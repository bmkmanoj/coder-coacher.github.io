hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
my name is John Tong and I'm a member of
Microsoft Research but I work out of
Silicon Valley down here
and I'm joining by the proxy which is
research that we do on social proxies
remote people and we're very glad to
have mr. Jeremy bailenson from Stanford
come to talk with us and visit here at
MSR this is perhaps the first time that
a proxy is introducing a real speaker
but it's kind of fitting because
Jeremy's research is on virtual
realities and the kind of impact of
virtual presence so here we go this is
kind of another aspect of that I've
really enjoyed learning about Jeremy's
research in the virtual human
interaction lab at Stanford both in
terms of the impact of virtual
experiences on our daily behavior but
also the very clever experimental
designs for measuring the impact of that
that work and I'm sure Jeremy will
describe some of that as well as some of
the ways he's I'm playing with artifacts
that in many ways can be enabled with
connect and and technologies like Kinect
he's written a book called infinite
reality which I'm sure he'll mentioned
more information about but we're really
glad to have Jeremy here visiting and
sharing what he's been working on and
having a chance to meet many of the
folks up here in Microsoft joke and and
I just wanna say I'm gonna drop off here
because I can tune in remotely through
rest and get a better view but I'll
probably try to pop in at the end if
there's any questions ok thanks very
much and welcome Jeremy thanks John
so my name is Jeremy and I'm absolutely
delighted to be here what an honor it is
to come talk to to you guys about the
topic we're talking to today and you
know I just on a personal note I had a
fairly intense week at work where it's
the finals week and I was very fatigued
kind of sick of my own voice and I've
had four meetings this morning already
and I just got completely energized by
those meetings I really the time I spent
already here has just actually really
made me think about things that I hadn't
thought of in a while so thanks for that
my morning meeting people and I look
forward to the rest of the time that I'm
here so the title of my talk is infinite
reality and what I'm gonna do what i
decided to do today was to really give
you a whirlwind of about 15 years of
research kind of sampling big ideas to
give you a sense of who i am i got a PhD
in cognitive psychology where i learned
how to run experiments about what goes
on in the mind I got a bit disillusioned
with the field I was in I was at
Northwestern I decided to try something
new
I got a postdoc at UC Santa Barbara in a
lab with Andy Beal can you stand up a
little bit this is a one of my mentors
one of the best go Gauchos one of the
best people have had the privilege to
work with and learn how to program
virtual reality and also learned how to
run social psychology experiments and
which are so I'm kind of a
jack-of-all-trades what you're going to
hear about today is a lot of work that
I've done some of it in collaboration
with Andy who's also the CEO of world
vis who brought you this amazing VR
experience that you're about to get
talking about the psychological
consequences of spending times and
avatars both good and bad and everything
I'm going to do today is for the most
part it's published I'm going to rocket
you through about 40 or 50 experiments
this is the webpage of my lab all the
stuff is online by PDF and the big
question we're gonna explore today is
what are the wonderful and horrific
things that can happen psychologically
when people spend time inside of avatars
and toward the end we're going to shift
the focus to from Microsoft how can we
really think about opportunities for you
guys and what are the research things
you can do and the applications you can
build so to give you a bit of a roadmap
I'm going to talk about technology
what is VR it's a very jargon is term
and lots of people define it in
different ways so we'll talk about the
technology I'm then gonna take you
through lots and lots of experiments one
at a time and then I'm gonna focus on
some very specific applications that
we're starting to work on a little bit
that are really going to affect the
future so thanks to world vis I don't
have to fully describe what's going on
here so just show of hands how many you
guys went through the thing next door
okay all of you will do that later on I
want to talk a little bit about the
technology here so here is a gentleman
who's walking the virtual plank what's
happening here is he's moving in the
physical world as he's moving in the
physical world there are sensors that
are detecting say the X Y Z position of
his head or the pitch yaw and roll of
how he's moving his neck and as he's
moving in the physical world there's a
three pronged process the first is track
the movement understand if he's
translated forward understand if he's
turned his head understand if he's
opened his mouth so that's called
tracking retracting physical movements
the second step is called rendering that
is redrawing the virtual world some
digital scene as a function of that
movement so when I walk a meter forward
we should redraw the world one meter
backward based on the tracking data the
final step is display that is updating
what somebody sees what they hear maybe
what they feel there's even a handful of
people in the world changing what you
smell as a function of that tracking
data so virtual reality is a cycle of
track the physical movement update a
virtual scene as a function of that
movement and send it back to the user
sensory organs and when this works well
it happens about a hundred times a
second and the person has a very
seamless experience of walking around a
virtual world and to give you a sense of
how hard this is so some of you have
done this in my lab at Stanford because
the technology has matured
I've been running pit demos like this
for about 15 years it used to be the
case that about 1 in 10 people would
decide they'd look and they'd say no I'm
not gonna even take a step forward
toward this big hole that's looming in
the middle of the floor which you guys
have over there we're now at the point
where 1 in 3 people in my lab will
immediately close their eyes and say
take me out of here it is a fairly
compelling simulation that I should stop
talking about because you all get to
experience it in a second but anyone
who doesn't believe that virtual reality
feels real can go next door and jump off
of that 30 meter plank and we'll see
what if you still believe that Stanford
rebuilt my lab two years ago and I can
brag about this because I had absolutely
nothing to do with this Stanford paid
for it and world is built it but it is
the best virtual reality lab in the
world right now in terms of a fully
immersive experience we have the vision
that you'll experience next door which
is uh updating what you see as a
function of your movement there's an
array of 24 speakers in the wall that
can spatialize sound to correspond with
your physical movements so if a virtual
object flies by the sound emanates from
that virtual object and then we do
virtual touch in a variety of ways so
this yellow part of the floor is very
rigid airplanes steel that can carry a
vibrations in the four corners of the
room are what we call butt kickers which
is a product name that can basically use
low frequency sound to make the floor
boom and vibrate we also use commercial
devices to move your hands for you so
basically in this lab we integrate what
you see what you hear and what you feel
as a function of your movements and so
one way this talk happened is because
John came down to my lab and Radha
bought a bunch of folk from Microsoft
and you're all encouraged as well after
this talk if you're in the Bay Area one
of the goals of the lab is to give
outreach you're all welcome to come down
and do something as amazing as you're
seeing there but also with virtual sound
and virtual touch at it as well and
here's where I thank you guys so I've
been studying VR for about 15 years and
even longer than I and up until this
year I can never I've never been able to
there's a joke among VR guys which is
next year VR is gonna be in your living
room
okay and idiots like me have been saying
that for 20 years but now because of you
guys VR is in the living room right so
what does the Kinect do the Kinect
tracks twenty-something points on your
body the XYZ position of them and it
does it about 30 frames a second so what
you're seeing next door which is a my
humble opinion the one of the best
virtual simulations you will ever get
Andi is pulling that off with the XYZ
position of one point and then an
accelerometer that gives pitch on roll
you guys are giving us 24 so we have the
raw materials to have the best
amazing virtual experience that could
ever happen by tracking your physical
movements and just about every living
room a second non-microsoft technology
that has made VR more accessible to the
common person is something called Auto
stereo which is things like lenticular
displays that can give you an amazing 3d
experience without even having to wear
glasses so you may have seen the
Nintendo 3ds lenticular displays are
like those fancy postcards I started
there's cheap postcards that can give
you a sense of 3d lenticular displays a
fancy version of that and in my lab we
bought one from a French company called
alias copy that you almost have to reach
out and touch these 3d objects to see if
they're real when you walk in the
waiting room it feels as if they're
there so finally the vision of all VR
scientists which is track my body
without me wearing anything which we can
get from the Kinect and rendered me 3d
stuff without having to have a fancy
room it's here so VR is simply tracking
and rendering and finally tracking and
rendering are available not for the
scientist not for the Stanford lab or
for the world vis people but for
everybody in the country so but I don't
just build VR my specialty is social
science I'm a trained cognitive
psychologist and social psychologists
and I study virtual people so when
you're a subject who walks in my lab we
want to build your avatar we study what
happens when you spend time in your
avatar so you know this is my colleague
Jack Loomis when he if he were a subject
in my lab and I run a hundred subjects a
week like this they walk in we take two
pictures of his head and face and then
what we can do is build a 3d model of it
so this is a 3d model of Jack's head
that we've done using photogrammetric
software which is software that from if
you take pictures from a series of
angles and find anchor points you can
reconstruct that 3d object in the way
that looks real so how real are these
things they're pretty real okay so
subject comes in 15 minutes later he's
wearing a head that captures about 96%
of the variance in his faces these are
real enough such that we've worked with
a federal government to do police
lineups using virtual busts as opposed
to photographs of people i just got an
amazing
raishin upstairs of using the Kinect to
do something that's very similar to this
so the idea of building an avatar that
looks like you you don't even need
people to do this you don't need humans
anymore you can just simply have someone
sit from the Kinect to move around and
we've now captured your virtual bust now
but I want you to pause for a second I
want you to think about what what
Napster did to the idea of music and how
it drastically transformed what we think
about music if I build your virtual bust
it's around forever
it'll never degrade I can make a billion
copies of it for free and I can send it
to her wherever I want more importantly
I can change it I can manipulate it so
this virtual head this idea of having a
human everything that virtual songs did
to the music industry what does it mean
to have a person where you never change
you're gonna live forever and I can make
a million versions of you and I want you
to keep that in the back of your head as
we move on with this talk it's not
enough to make an avatar look like you
we can use computer vision devices like
the Kinect to capture somebody's
gestures and this is fairly important so
here's a woman standing in front of a
webcam we're using facial tracking
software these aren't markers on the
face computer vision algorithms are
catching the X Y Z the X Y positions of
22 points on the face and then so the
subject comes in 15 minutes later he's
not only wearing an avatar that has it
on his face but this is the real-time
video image this is me animating or this
is the software company animating the 3d
model as a function of the X Y position
of those 22 points so if this looks
amazing it's because this is a demo
video that the company produced it
doesn't look this good in real-time but
it looks pretty good and using fairly
old technology so you've come as a
subject in my lab we've built an avatar
that not only looks like you but now it
it just yours just like you so here's
where I pause and I say well who cares
and I've been giving talks like this for
15 years now and I almost don't even
need a point to make this point any
longer but I want to focus on I don't
need to talk to you guys about the
Kinect which is the fastest selling
product according to Guinness in US
history a Kaiser Family Foundation my
colleague Don Roberts who just
retired from Stanford every five years
he does a report for the Kaiser Family
Foundation where he studies children the
United States their use of media and in
2005 he stood up in front of Congress
and he said children when they're not in
school and they're not sleeping or
consuming about seven hours of digital
media a day and he said it simply is not
possible he said this in front of
Congress it is not possible for them to
consume anymore digital media it's just
not tangibly possible he redid the study
in 2010 national random sample were very
rigorous early run in 2010 the child
between the ages of 8 and 18 is if you
count multitasking that is using two
things at once they're consuming about
11 hours of media per day and if you
don't meaning just the pure amount of
hours they're exposed to digital media
they're consuming eight hours of digital
media day so this is the average child
the United States is consuming not in
class not sleeping for eight hours a day
has a thing on giving her him digital
media okay for minorities
african-americans and Latinos it's
actually higher than that it's closer to
ten hours okay so kids today eat digital
media for living a 1.25 hours of that
are spent in video games wearing avatars
okay put that in perspective reading is
how many how many hours think reading is
reading print 38 minutes yeah 38 minutes
on average so twice as much time in
avatars as they are reading books so let
me get to the theoretical point of my
talk and this is a big idea that Andy
and myself and Jim Blas kovitch and Jack
Loomis came up with some years ago that
certainly was an original idea science
fiction authors have been talking about
this for a while which is in the
physical reality when I perform an
action whatever I do you see okay if I
smile you see it over Skype if I smile
you see it if I lean forward you see it
but how does virtual reality work so
let's take let's take have you guys
heard of Second Life this online virtual
world in Second Life if we were all in
Second Life now we'd have versions of
each other's avatars the 3d models
stored locally on all of our machines
okay as I'm talking and gesturing my
computer senses on gesturing how do you
do then Second Life you hit a button but
let's pretend the Kinect was doing it
the Kinect is capturing my emotions my
system is automatically emailing you
systems telling you that I'm gesturing
and you are redrawing my avatar
gesturing locally on your machine so
Skype works by capturing pixels and
sending those pixels over the network VR
works by categorizing or tracking a
behavior locally sending the semantic
definition of that behavior over the
network and you draw me doing what my
computer said I was doing locally on
your machine is that clear is that
difference between videoconference which
sends pixels and VR would send semantic
information would you draw later that's
the crux for the rest of my talk ok so
why is this important this allows for
what we call transformed social
interaction which is not I can send you
what I'm doing or I can send you data a
strategically optimized version of what
I want you to think that I'm doing
moreover in a crowd like this where
there's 50 of you instead of me sending
the same version of myself to each of
you I can strategically optimize myself
differentially to all of you because the
way that the Second Life works the way
that avatar connect works is that
everybody is simultaneously sending each
other their behavior data and everyone
redraws each other locally so I can
simply change the version of myself
simultaneously to all of you and that
may saying that may sound abstract and
weird but let me give you a lot of
examples so first let me talk about how
when I transform myself how I can make
myself a better present or a better
teacher better salesperson etc so one of
the most powerful ideas and all of
nonverbal behavior which is other than
me walking up to you and poking you in
the chest looking at you in the eye is
the most powerful nonverbal tool I have
and as humans we've known this for a
long time as psychologists we've known
it for 50 years which is when I look at
you your heart beats faster you retain
more information you're more likely to
look back at me you're more likely to be
persuaded what I say but in the physical
world there's a problem which is I can
look at you guys but in this room each
of you can only get on average my direct
eye gaze about three or four percent of
the conversation in VR it's simple for
me to send different versions of myself
out to all of you such that each of you
gets more I gaze than you could ever get
to in a face-to-face situation so the
first study that we ran in this area we
wanted to start very simple
algorithmically
because we wanted
the psychological effect we took three
subjects three subjects came in one was
the teacher the other two were
designated as the students and
unbeknownst to the teacher as the
teacher is teaching the students there's
two conditions either the students
receive the natural eye gaze as rendered
via head movements or again we start
very simple on the AI side each of these
two people received the direct eye gaze
of the teacher for a hundred percent of
the social interaction okay so you
either got normal I gaze about 50% or
for the entire 20-minute presentation
one person was staring and looking at
you for the entire time while we talked
okay and so I want you to think about
that this is in order for us to pull
this off this is maybe twenty lines of
Python code this is not a hard thing to
do technologically we were simply just
redirecting the yaw of the head such
that it either was being natural
according to tracking data or redirected
to stare at each of both people at the
same time
so we've now replicated the study about
three or four times probably over six
hundred people in a period of six or
seven years the findings I'm about to
give you are very robust so though the
first thing we find is that people hate
this okay it's extremely uncomfortable
you can imagine that if I was giving
this lecture and staring at all of you
for the entire time you would not enjoy
that okay but despite the fact they
don't like it nobody knows that it's not
real so afterward we have them write a
detailed paragraph about the teacher and
no one says well it's probably fake gaze
redirected by an algorithm they all feel
like they were getting stared at so
despite the fact it was cheap and easy
to do this people are buying into that
they're actually getting looked at the
third thing that you get is behavioral
change in terms of attention so if I'm
on a teacher on a salesperson half of my
goal half the battle is getting you to
pay attention to me and what we can do
in VR which makes us gives us a big leg
up in terms of other social scientists
we can capture all of your tracking data
so what we can figure out is how often
were these guys looking back at the
presenter when I'm using this super gaze
algorithm you guys are returning my eye
gaze more often than if I have just my
normal power the fourth thing that we
get is social influence whether on some
studies we measure persuasion in some
studies we measure learning regardless
if I've got a conversational goal if I
give myself 20 lines of Python code such
all of you are getting stared at the
whole time you've as a class you've
learned better as a group of voters
you've decided to vote for me I can
change your mind simply by changing
easily the nonverbal factors of my
avatar next line of studies is based on
a line of work by a woman named Tanya
Shar Trond which leverages the notion
that people love themselves okay so one
of the overriding themes of social
psychology is that people similarity is
one of the largest drivers of human
behavior out there and Tanya shot Rhonda
in the late 90s he was a NYU she ran a
study where she sent people face to face
into interviews and he had the people
either mimic non-verbally the gestures
of the interviewer so the interviewer he
closes his legs
the interviewer she crosses her legs the
interviewer he leans forward etc the
interviewer the people who are being
interviewed were trained to non-verbally
mimic the interviewer none of the
interviewers consciously detect this but
the odds of you getting the job increase
if you employ this mimicry strategy
compared that if you don't and since
then there's probably been 50 studies a
hundred studies that replicate this and
all sorts of domains one of my favorites
if a waitress if this is study done in
the Netherlands if she says to you ham
and eggs actually repeats the order that
you say compared to if she says thank
you sir tips go up by about 20% so we
know that mimicry is a huge factor in
terms of behavior in the physical world
but how does VR work VR works in a way
that is stunningly easy to do this I
send you my tracking data you get it
from my Kinect you'd use that to draw me
locally on your machine and you're
sending me your tracking data so I can
draw you guys locally on mom on my
machine it's trivial it's it's it's ten
lines of code for me to grab to pack it
that contains your behavioral
information hold on to it put my name on
it and send it back to you so think
about mimicry in the physical world if
I'm trying to mimic you I need to focus
cognitive resources it's really hard for
me to do that I can screw up and you can
consciously detect it moreover in a room
with 50 people
I can only mimic one of you guys I can't
mimic all of you with VR you're just
giving me your tracking data you're
handing it to me on a silver platter
saying here's how I'm moving
and so the first study we again we start
really simple in the algorithmic side we
just decided you know what what happens
if somebody mimics the pitch yaw and
roll of your head at a four second lag
and we the four second number didn't
happen magically we did a lot of pre
testing if four seconds is kind of this
magic land between it's still
interactive but nobody consciously
detects it and what you're about to see
is a persuasion study where this woman
is trying to persuade this man about a
very unpopular policy at Stanford which
is if you're ever caught on campus
without your student ID you're gonna get
in a lot of trouble nobody wants to sign
this this petition to support this
policy it's fairly Orwellian and while
she's presenting this policy to him half
the subjects get head movements that are
normal the other half get a slow lag of
her head movement so off of his own head
movement so let me show you this so
she's telling about this policy he's
looking at her
so he looks up one two three four she
looks up so basically she's just a slow
mirror of his movements okay so what do
we discover in this study the first one
the first thing we discover in this line
of work is that nobody consciously de
Texas so we thought about half of our
subjects we're going to be clearly aware
that somebody's shamelessly stealing
their head movements but only one in 20
people on average 5% of people put in a
simulation consciously to Texas someone
has completely stolen their gestures and
those tended to be people that spun in
their chairs or did something very
unorthodox so and remember we started
with a very uncreate eval ger it's just
a slow mirror if you put in a tiny bit
of logic to make this more impressive no
one consciously detects the second thing
that you get is attention so people are
more likely to look at the presenter
when she's mimicking them then when not
even though they don't consciously
detect this and the third thing that we
get is social influence so later on the
probability when you're out of VR of you
signing this petition that nobody wants
to sign which is if you get caught on
campus without your ID or in trouble the
probability of you signing that
increases if you were mimicked by the
presenter than if the presenter had
normal head movement so in addition
you're light you're rated is more
intelligent more credible more
attractive we just love ourselves and
when we see our gestures on other people
that transfers and look imagine what
we're getting with the Kinect we'll
return to that later on okay it's not
just your action so we have a whole line
of work about simply grabbing your
appearance so if I were to ask you don't
have to raise your hands how many of you
have 10 pictures on Facebook of your
face 20 pictures a hundred pictures at a
ridiculous resolution of 4000 by 2,000
pixels I don't even want to know the
answer of that but I can get all of your
faces quite easily and we wanted to ask
a question I want you to be very
impressed by this video so be impressed
because it was made in the year 2003 by
a 19 year old communication major using
software that cost 1995 and it took this
student 30 minutes of training to
produce this video so really cheap and
easy to do this
all right I'm gonna show you that again
this is the governor the the new
governor of California back then Arnold
Schwarzenegger as he's morphed into Gray
Davis and all this is pixel blending
software where are you more from one
picture to another okay so it's trivial
for me to make my face look as much as I
want like yours and vice versa what do
we know about people looking like you so
again one of the huge driving forces of
social influences if you look like you
me we like to think of humans as this
very advanced species where we're deep
and we look inside people and we are and
we do but it turns out how you look has
a huge influence on how I'm going to
treat you I'll focus on these two bottom
ones de Vidya demonstrated that if I'm
clutching my knee and agony on the
street of the odds you'd be stopping to
help me increase if we look alike and
Lisa de Bruin a researcher in England
she morphed faces and demonstrated that
the odds of me handing over my children
for you to babysit increase if your face
looks more like mine so we've known for
a while that facial similarity has a big
driver on people's behavior but I wanted
to ask this in the domain of politics so
how big could these effects get how much
would they scale up and I collaborated
with a colleague of mine named Shonto a
younger who is a political scientist and
what you're seeing here is pictures of
two subject this is a woman named Julia
who works in my lab this is a picture of
me from 2003 you can see it clearly that
is from before when I got tenure very
clean-cut and this is George W Bush and
this is John Kerry this is the morph
that you saw in that video which is 6040
George Bush to me and 6040 John Kerry to
Julia as long as you stay under forty
percent we've now run over a period of
almost a decade over over 1,300 people
in these studies and asked them after
the study to write a detailed paragraph
of the candidates face as long as you
stay under 40 percent not a single
person to date has had any idea that we
have taken their own face and blended
them with the candidate so fairly
trivial for me to do this so we wanted
to ask the question if I was a
politician and a week before a major
election ice took your face and put it
into mine would it change how you voted
and the way that we did this experiment
we six months before the 2004 election
which was between george w bush and john
kerry we paid a focus group company to
acquire photographs passively of a
national random sample of people so we
got about four hundred people from
across the united states six months for
the election we had photographs of all
of them and we really had a national
random sample in terms of age
demographics you name it whatever
feature we had it and then feverishly
for six months we had Stanford
undergraduates morphing faces of the
voters into either George Bush and John
Kerry we had three groups of subjects a
week before the 2004 election remember
this is a very heated election people
either loved george w bush or they
really didn't love george w bush alright
a week before the election we asked them
who they're going to vote for and we
sent them pictures of Bush and Kerry
side-by-side there are three conditions
in one condition they saw the normal
pictures of Bush and Kerry in the second
condition they saw their own face morph
with George W Bush and in the third
condition they saw their own face morph
with John Kerry with a prediction that
perhaps this would change who they're
going to vote for based on this
subconscious similarity that we've been
talking about what we demonstrated it
first look at the gray bars this is 4644
Bush over Kerry which means we had a
very good national random sample we had
the exact pattern that you got an in the
election in the red bars when the voter
when he was more for George Bush Bush
wins in a landslide by about 15 points
when the voter was morph with John Kerry
Kerry actually wins by seven points okay
so statistically significant differences
demonstrating that a simple thing like
making my face look more like you is
going to cause you to vote for me so as
social scientists we were extremely
excited about this as citizens we were
terrified and what we immediately did is
we took this and we wrote it up and we
sent it to the best journal political
science the editor rejected it without
even sending it out for review he said
voters are rational voters don't make
decisions based on your face and in fact
the entire field of political science is
founded upon the notion that people make
decisions based on substance so in order
to publish this which took literally
seven or eight years because the
controversy we replicated this four or
five different times huge samples
different elections
this effect just doesn't go away and and
I want to think I want you to think
about it you know you're probably a
little bit freaked out right now but I
want you to think about all the data
you're giving away on Facebook with the
Kinect everywhere our digital identities
are out there for people to use and what
my studies have demonstrated is that
even grabbing a tiny bit grabbing your
face grabbing some nonverbal data gives
me advantage to where I'm interacting
with you
all right let's shift let's shift and
let's not talk now about me influencing
you guys if we are transforming and
changing ourselves I want to talk about
the impact of an avatar that's different
for my physical self how does that
affect me and you know in second life
the online world second life there is a
the ratio of female avatars to female
users is quite high so you have lots of
men who wear female avatars in games
like World of Warcraft people are even
in different species and these crazy
goblins etc so you have so you know you
guys familiar with the game world of
warcraft the average player what do you
think his ages 29 is his average age
average number of hours per week average
our number of average number of hours a
week is around 20 okay so you have
adults spending half of a workweek in
these crazy avatars that are different
species from us so this is a an issue
that we're gonna have to confront as a
society and one study that we wanted to
answer one big question this is a guy
named Nicky these are the his
dissertation studies is if I spend a lot
of time in an avatar that's very
different for myself how does that
change the way that I feel about myself
my my self-esteem my psychology my
attitudes and so I want you to watch
this movie this is the classic mirror
demo that you'll see in many VR labs and
this is Nicky's physically walking
around this hotel room it's a fairly old
simulation and he walks up to the
virtual mirror and you can see he's a
white male and our typical studies you
spend about two minutes gesturing in
front of the mirror moving around and
you get a lightning rod when this thing
moves with you in the virtual mirror it
really feels like you so he's now formed
a cycle psychological connection he was
a white male he pops up and he's now a
woman of color okay and what we ask is
now that he's wearing an avatar that
social features different from him
namely we've changed his race and his
gender
how does he proceed to act when he meets
someone else in VR does he act male or
does he act female and what are the
changes long-term to spending time and
avatars that are different from you and
the paradigm for most of these studies
are this is the subject in front of the
mirror he looks at himself from the
mirror for about two minutes she then
turns around and interacts with what we
call Confederate two Confederates
another person who's a part of the study
in VR with them whose job it is to talk
to them to elicit behavior and I'm gonna
summarize about 12 years of research and
I'm going to talk about two different
identity cues that we change the mirror
attractiveness and height we've looked
at age we've looked at race we've looked
at gender we've looked at having
disabilities we've looked at just about
every social feature you can imagine all
of them showing these similar effects
but I'm gonna focus on these two today
so the first one attractiveness in the
United States attractiveness is
correlated with extraversion it's a
correlate with self-esteem so again we
like to think of ourselves this deep
race but it turns out physical
attractiveness is a driver of how we
feel about ourselves but in VR beauty is
free so I challenge you to go into a
world like Second Life and try to find
an unattractive avatar it just doesn't
exist in fact it's people that make the
software have a hard time even designing
these features into the design so Nick
wanted to ask the question when you're
wearing an avatar that's better-looking
than you or better-looking than average
how does that change your behavior and
so in this line of studies what he did
is you subjects went up to the virtual
mirror and they are wearing avatars that
were either one standard deviation as
determined by others by coda ratings or
higher than average or one standard
deviation lower than average so subjects
went to the virtual mirror they saw
themselves either as better-looking than
normal or as less attractive than normal
they then turned around and the
Confederate says why don't you come on
over here come on over here and what we
measure is their behavior when they have
an attractive face in the mirror or an
unattractive face in the mirror when you
have an attractive face and the subject
the Confederate asked you to come over
you'll step a meter closer to the
Confederate than when you have an
unattractive face so personal distance
which is one of the most unchangeable
metrics of confidence and social
behavior
when I have a good-looking face I've got
the confidence to get right up to you
okay
we also tape record everything that's
that you say in a subsequent 20 minute
conversation and we mail those tapes off
to judges who are trained they note I
have no idea but with the experiments
about they're trained to figure out how
confident you are based on your voice
and when you have an attractive face in
the mirror even though you're only
looking at it for about two minutes and
you turn around you actually speak more
socially more personally and more
confidently so very large effects and
anything I'm going to talk about today
I'm confident in these data meaning when
Nik had to publish this data he had to
replicate the study three or four times
these are very very robust finding so
let me give you another detail here
there's this work is based on a theory
called self perception which is I look
at myself and by looking at myself I
figure out how to behave so why do I
dress up for a talk because maybe if I'm
having a hard time I can look down and
see I'm wearing a fancy shirt tucked in
and that's going to give me confidence
to be a good speaker and that's the idea
that my own appearance is changing my
own behavior and that's what Nick wanted
to study there is a competing theory
called behavioral confirmation which is
because I'm dressed up you guys are
treating me more official and I then
speak more confidently because there's
this behavioral feedback from you guys
and so in order to prevent that second
theory all Confederates were always saw
the subject in VR as average and
attractiveness so yeah because the
subject saw himself as high or low the
Confederate saw the subject is average
and what we were measuring is the pure
change in behavior based on the belief
that you were in a better looking or at
worst looking avatar the next study Nick
wanted to do was height and in this
study in the United States income is
correlated with height so taller people
make more money a fairly depressing
study came out of University Chicago
they got all the backend data from
online dating websites and they could do
the actuarial math on lots of features
as it predicts whether or not you're
going to get dates basically how many
people click to date you and it turns
out that for male every inch you are
under five ten to get the same number of
dates you have to make an extra $30,000
per inch okay so you can actually put
you can put a price on height but
remember
vr height is free it's just a scaling on
the y-axis it's trivial to make yourself
any height that you want so in Nick
studies he simply made subjects ten
centimeters taller or ten centimeters
shorter than the Confederate so the
subject walks up to the Confederate they
start talking and there's a height
differential as with the attractive
study nobody consciously realizes that
they're taller or shorter later on we
interview these subjects during
debriefing no one has any idea that
there's a height differential or
attractive differential this is all
subconscious in what we call implicit so
there's a ten centimeter height
differential they then go and have
financial negotiations we borrowed a
paradigm from the business school at
Stanford called the ultimatum game which
is a classic money splitting task and
what we had people is actually haggle
with real money as they interact with
avatars which were the same height
taller than the Confederate or shorter
than the Confederate when you have an
avatar that is ten centimeters shorter
than the Confederate you were three
times as likely to lose that negotiation
then if your avatar is the same height
or equal so tiny change in a scaling on
the y-axis is drastically changing the
amount of money that you win this effect
occurs independent of your physical
height so it's purely the virtual
manipulation even you take into account
the physical height this occurs and this
has been replicated a number of times so
fairly confident that a small change in
how your avatar looks in terms of how
tall it is is going to change how much
money you win but the question everybody
always asked Nick when he was running
this work is fine that's fine but I
don't spend that much time in VR how
much does it transfer to the world when
you're face to face and so for both of
these studies Nick ran the face to face
analog with the attractiveness study you
spent twenty minutes and it you saw
yourself in the mirror for two minutes
as good-looking and then you turned
around you interact with a Confederate
for twenty minutes we then take the
helmet off pay you for your time you sit
there you fill out some forms
and then we walk you four flights of
stairs down the our building and you're
about to leave Stanford you're going to
your car and a graduate student runs up
to you and says wait wait wait if you
fill out this form I'm trying to finish
my dissertation it takes five minutes
I'll give you ten dollars they please
help me out I need you to fill this out
everybody does it no one has any idea
it's associated with this task and it's
an online it's a dating task where
you're supposed to choose people that
you think what
go out with you so you're supposed to
pick people with whom you think you have
a shot to date when you've had a good
looking avatar compared to a bad looking
avatar half an hour earlier in VR you
pick better looking people that you
think would be interested in you so the
confidence that you get in virtual
reality
extends face-to-face and again all this
is replicated and we're fairly confident
that major major social consequences
from spending two minutes in front of
the mirror wearing an avatar that's
better-looking or worse like with the
height differential study Nick had them
spend time in VR taller or shorter he
then took the helmets off the
Confederate and the subject they never
saw each other physically he then put
them in chairs designed to make their
Heights exactly equal and had them then
do the negotiation and literally
identical results meaning in the social
hierarchy that forms inside VR transfers
face to face and the guy who was shorter
in VR still loses money so and I could
talk about all the other examples if
you'd like in the qat with other
features but it's basically the same
story for all this stuff which is a
small feature in virtual reality whether
you're good-looking whether you're tall
changes how you want behave not only in
VR but later on when we talk about the
opposite phenomenon and this we call
this Vasia do it feels like I've never
been here before
another word that we use for this is
doppelgangers and this takes the big
idea remember when I built that 3d model
of Jack Loomis ok this is the model of
his head that looks just like him but
now I want you to think about every
animation that's ever been produced in
the history of video games all right how
many is that is that closer to 100 or
closer to 50,000 that's probably a
million I don't even know how many does
there's a lot of animations I can take
that head and put it on a body such that
any animation you can fathom that head
can do meaning we're at a strange point
in the time of human history so let's
take a step back and just think about
self-reflection and people humans have
always been able to look at each other
themselves in the mirror even when we
were cavemen we can look over the water
and see our own reflection in the last
50 years we've been able to see
ourselves asynchronously meaning you can
watch a video of yourself doing
something that you've done but you're
not doing it right now and you can see
this via home video for the first time
ever as a species we have a new media
vent and this is a you know this takes a
while to wrap your head around but I
think it's one of the most profound
things that I've ever encountered in my
20 years of social science history which
is for the first time ever we can look
in a mirror see ourselves and it looks
just like us and our mirror image can
all of a sudden do something that we've
never done physically and this
experience of seeing yourself from the
third-person engaging in a behavior that
you either have never done or you
couldn't do or is dangerous or is
unethical or is something that you hope
to do is one of the most profound
psychological experiences I think that
we can even think about as a species I
want to talk about some of the examples
that we've done in my lab and the first
one this is a the dissertation of a
woman named Jesse Foxx who really cares
about health behaviors so this guy is
exercising in place he's seeing his own
avatar it looks just like and we've
modeled his face from the third person
every three times that his legs cross
his waist in the physical world his
avatar loses a pound so what he's seeing
is the real time consequences of
physical behavior on his idealized self
he's getting to see the cause and effect
of actions and actually being able to
see the virtual self that he wants to be
so he wants to lose weight we've
selected people that want to do that and
what we show them is over time an
exaggerated sense of the cause and
effect of exercise so that they can see
the ideal version of themselves and how
they want to be and I'm gonna summarize
about 15 studies by Jesse Fox when I
give you this simulation compared to
control conditions for example seeing
someone of the same gender who is not
your exact face but looks like you that
doesn't doesn't work showing you
yourself but it doesn't change as a
function of your actions compared to
those control conditions this changes
your behavior drastically so all of us
in America you know Seattle's probably
like California where we're a fairly fit
part of the country but in America we've
got a problem where people are not
exercising and all of us know we're not
we're supposed to be exercising more
than we are but that's not enough what
VR gives you and what you experience
when you go to that pit I want you to
take all the angst when you're looking
over this cliff and all that
psychological power that you're feeling
imagine that you're directing this
towards you know improving your own body
size or shape
based on your behavior and when you get
this simulation and Jesse studies we
have people keep Diaries for the next 24
hours when you get the simulation
compared to control conditions you'll
exercise for an hour longer when you get
this compared to other control
conditions
that's a self-report she's also run
studies where she leaves you in the lab
and she says you know what you studies
done gives you your money but if you
want you can kind of hang out here and
work out here are some weights and when
you give them that simulation people
exercise for 10 times as long but when
you've given them this compared to other
ones so we know exercise is a hard
behavior to change and we're getting
unique leverage by using these
doppelgangers so on the negative side or
positive side depending on what you do
for a living
grace on a PhD student in my lab took
the idea that has been long Harold in
science fiction and built it which is
what if you were walking down a shopping
mall on a camera took your picture and
then you got 50 feet later and then you
were starring in a billboard using a
product you never use before and
wonderful things were happening to you
because you're using that product there
are beautiful people fawning all over
you or you're smiling and she calls this
self endorsing so the goal of
advertising is you know if you can have
an endorser that matches the demographic
of your target market who's a better
match of your demographic than you and
through a long line of studies grace she
just actually published this in the
Journal of advertising demonstrated that
whether you're showing yourself in the
third person using a product or whether
you're over taking someone's avatar and
putting labels on their arms about a
product any form of self endorsing is a
more effective advertising strategies
than lots and lots of control conditions
a study by how Hirschfeld who's now at
the business school at NYU we did this
in collaboration Laura Carstensen who
runs the Center for longevity at
Stanford and the goal of the center
longevity is to try to figure out how we
can have happier or be happier when
we're older so it's not about extending
life but it's about making sure that
you're having a good time when you're
older and in this study is about
retirement savings so the actuarial math
people have demonstrated that people in
their 20s are not saving enough money
and that demographic is going to be in
big trouble
40 50 years from now because there's
simply not putting money away how was a
PhD student of Laura's and said hmm you
know there's this flaw
ever called par feet and he's got this
really cool idea about a connection with
your future self which is we have a hard
time imagining future pain we were more
likely to be pleasurable now because we
can't make the pain in the future is
very abstract so what he did is he
brought subjects in and we built their
avatars and you can see this a little
bit what we're doing is we're
algorithmically ageing them so they go
to the mirror and they look in the
mirror and they watch themselves turn
from 20 years old to how they're going
to look when they're 65 in front of the
mirror and what they're getting is a
visceral connection with their future
self he then gives them a various ways
to defer gratification for example you
can have $20 now or if you put it in a
savings account you can have more money
later and he looks at the probability
that you will defer gratification and
put money in savings and demonstrates
that avatars do better than descriptions
better than typical ways of getting
people to save money and just to give
you a sense of how this is how these
things are being applied so a big
company called financial engines and
about three different stock companies
are putting this as an interface on
their software the woman who did the
program in this Maria Jabin left my lab
and works for LinkedIn it is now their
most popular feature that they have ever
put on LinkedIn in terms of getting
people to click on a job that was meant
for you and the exercise studies are
being used by a variety of different
people were trying to make people
healthy so big huge opportunities for
people that want to do a behavior change
in terms of where we're doing a lot of
work now we're at 50 minutes now so I
want to wrap up to give you guys
questions but quickly we're doing a lot
of work with energy conservation so one
of the big themes from the work that
you're getting thus far is that VR gives
you the opportunity to make behaviors
that would have been abstract to make
them concrete so take global warming
carbon molecules are invisible their
changes are long-term it's hard to
imagine them and we ran a line of
studies to try to connect people in a
very visceral manner with their with the
environmental consequences of their
actions so this is a study by grace on
and there's a there's an article an
op-ed that came out in The New York
Times about five years ago that said if
you use that beautiful soft non recycled
toilet paper over the course of your
lifetime you're sawing down two huge
beautiful virgin trees this
changed behavior that much so grace
brought subjects in she selected for
people that use an on recycled paper
everybody was given the statistics that
if you use non recycled paper you're
killing two trees half the subjects read
a beautifully written narrative of what
would be like to cut down a tree the
other half put the helmet on had
spatialize sound of birds in the forest
and used a haptic device that shook
their hands and we're forced to cut down
these two trees the trees thunderously
crashed shook the floor and it's
everyone that comes to my lab that does
this it's a fairly profound experience
that really makes you think for a long
time afterward what she then does is
measure your behavior later on in the
physical world she measures your paper
use when you get this virtual simulation
compared to reading it really
beautifully written narrative about what
it's like to use a virtual to cut down a
tree you use 20% less paper in the
physical world later on so again
everybody likes to think of themselves
as green we'd like to say that we're
gonna you know carpool and recycle but
talk is cheap she's demonstrating large
behavioral changes as a function of an
embodied experience we also have a line
of work on diversity training so it's
hard to imagine what it's like to be
someone from an out group whether that
is a different race different gender in
terms of sexual harassment I can imagine
what it's like to be harassed by my boss
but what if you could put someone in a
simulation and have them literally feel
like what it would be to be an out-group
and this is a line of work we're doing
with disabilities so for example we took
a very simple disability which is huh I
wouldn't even call it a disability which
is red-green color blind subjects were
either wore a helmet that filtered out
so you can either see colors are made it
so you couldn't differentiate between
red and green and then they had to do a
task that was very difficult to do
without seeing colors so they're wearing
a helmet and they're either robbed of
the ability to see color or they can
have normal vision later on we give them
the opportunity to volunteer their time
toward people with visual disabilities
when they got this simulation which is
being forced to see color blind compared
to having to imagine what it would be
like to be color blind they're more
willing to volunteer their own time to
help people with disability so again
small virtual simulation that has a
lightning-rod to experience that causes
big behavioral changes huh I'm going to
conclude very quickly talk about four
different challenges going to spend
about a minute on each one the versus
digital foot
and you know so John asked me
specifically to talk about some work
we're doing with the Kinect and
everything that I've talked about before
what the Kinect does is just make it so
we can do it in a way where you have
more control of your body and where you
can increase the scale because it's in
the homes but there's a side effect of
tracking and rendering which is when I
track your motions I can store it in a
data file and I in my book infinite
reality there's a chapter called digital
footprints that summarizes experiments
we're doing with the Kinect and others
which is what can I tell about you based
on your digital footprint so I'll talk
out there there's about 10 different
studies here but the one I'll talk about
is one that I just got data from last
week we used the Microsoft Kinect to
track the behavior of two people there's
a teacher in the physical world and
there was a student the teacher's job is
to teach the student about environmental
principles the student is listening both
the ste sure and the student are two
subjects from my classes we run a
hundred and fifty of these diets okay
for each person they have a Kinect
trained on their body we're not
rendering anything we're just capturing
the XYZ position of all the points that
connect gives us okay with these 150
dyads
we then take the learners and we can
partition them in the top quartile and
the bottom quartile how do we know this
because after this whole thing ends we
have them take an exam and we have
education scholars that teach us how to
grade exams so that we're actually
getting inferential learning and we have
a very objective measure of who learned
and who didn't what we then did is
machine learning where we take the
nonverbal digital footprint that is all
the data that we dump the Kinect gives
us X Y Z position of 24 points 30 frames
a second and it's a 10-minute
conversation we're running hundred 50
diets you can imagine how much data we
have with 90% accuracy based on the
nonverbal synchrony between the teacher
and the learner not looking at what was
said at all I can predict whether or not
you are in the top or the bottom tier of
learning so simply what your body is
doing is telling me what what the
learning is and you know I had a
wonderful conversation with Doug this
morning about how you guys are thinking
about protecting privacy on this table
with this data but to make a long story
short based on the nonverbal footprint
using devices that are much less
sophisticated than Kinect I can predict
your gender I can predict your
personality I can predict your race the
way that you walk around second life you
know
speed with which you walk and how close
you come to objects I can predict your
attitude towards things like women
political parties whether or not you're
going to buy a product a side
consequence of us spending all this time
in VR is you are giving away what we
call Big Data and if you've got an
objective truth on things like if you're
going to purchase something or not if
you are so the military's using this to
find out what country you're from and
you know there's wonderful applications
of this but there's this cartoon from
The New Yorker you guys probably seen on
the internet nobody knows you're a dog
all right so the internet gives you this
illusion you're anonymous but based on
your nonverbal footprint that I can get
from the Kinect and not only do I know
you're a dog I know what kind of dog you
are I've known what you've had for
breakfast and it's a it's a side
consequence that in terms of things
Microsoft can think about I was very
excited to talk to Doug and hear how
hard you are thinking about this but the
other thing I would be very brief on
this because I'm running out of time I
want you to take the immersion you're
getting with that pit next door that
world vis is built and you're looking
there and you're free to take that step
I want you to port that to imagine that
online gambling felt like Vegas
imagine that pornography felt like you
were there and I want you to think about
the future for better for worse when
these video we call these video games
but you guys who have used the Kinect
you know it's not just a game anymore it
feels like you're there what happens
when these things that are already
subsuming us feel like you're there a
related point of this is not knowing
what's real anymore and a very brave
woman named Katherine Segovia ran a
study in my lab where she brought in a
hundred elementary school children the
elementary school children all got a
novel experience which is they saw their
doppelganger remember you once I build a
version of yourself
I can animate it to do anything so they
saw a version of themselves that looked
just like them swimming with whales a
week later she brought the same eight
nine year olds back and said hey you
guys ever been to SeaWorld and swam with
whales and 50% of them not only said yes
they'd been to SeaWorld and swam with a
whale but could tell you about the
hotdogs they ate earlier about the
different games they played with the
Whale of the temperature of the water
there's a fairly rigorous method for
determining what's called a false memory
and Kathryn has demonstrated that seeing
her
gang or do something results in huge
formations of false memories so things
for us to think about as these video
games get more and more realistic
multitasking very briefly I know you
guys are dabbling in this have you guys
seen the video for Google glasses where
a guy is walking and skyping with his
girlfriend while standing on the edge of
a building and playing the ukulele at
the same time my colleague Clifford Nass
at Stanford
ran a line of studies designed to prove
to the world how multitaskers get more
done than people who don't because cliff
is uh he'll be the first to tell you how
much he loves multitasking and he
published this in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Science cuz the data
were so surprising people that use more
than one media at once not only
performed poorly in the moment but tend
to be people in general that perform
worse at work at life what's going to
happen as these virtual experiences that
we love so much can be integrated with
the physical world is something that I'd
love for you guys to think about more ya
know generally near who many of you guys
know he's one of the reasons I'm here
this talk today he really asked a world
visit to come to bring the VR he and I
have been collaborating on something
that is only possible now because of the
Kinect so Jerrod's big idea so this is a
guy with an arm that's 50 meters long
and this emerged Jaron will tell you
about how he had a sign error or he had
an extra zero so in one of his
simulations in the early 80s when you
moved your hands when you translate your
physical hand your arm was as big as a
skyscraper and to him this is very
inspirational about well how can we
what's called remapping degrees of
freedom how can you put someone in a
body that's different than their own and
his anecdotal evidence is a lobster in
California lobster has eight arms okay
and if you're tracking your physical
arms it's fairly simple how to track
arms 1 &amp;amp; 2 it's not so easy figuring how
to track arms 3 through 8 and there's a
line of research I have going with
jarran which is can you increase
people's function meaning can you teach
people how to occupy bodies that are
drastically different in terms of their
physical bodies and I'll tell you some
data that's fresh off the press Andrea
Wan a woman who works in my lab we ran
an experiment using the Kinect and other
tracking devices as well where when you
move
physical arms either your arms move and
you move your legs in your legs move
which is reality in an avatar or she
simply swapped tracking and rendering so
when you move her physical arms your
legs go whoop and when you move your
physical legs your arms move and what
you did is she gave up on a task in VR
where they have to pop balloons and
she's measuring how quickly and easily
someone adopts to these novel bodies and
we've got some really great data showing
that it takes about two minutes and how
you can literally in body configurations
you ran another study where people's so
your arms have much more degree of
motion than your legs and demonstrating
giving someone the ability to have the
legs move like arms do and just showing
how you can accommodate and the answer
is really quickly but that's a brand new
area of research I want to leave time
for Q&amp;amp;A so I will just have you guys see
in this Orville Redenbacher video so not
now but when you leave this talk go to
youtube and look up virtual Orville
Orville Redenbacher Orville passes away
Orville is the spokesperson of the most
famous spokesperson in all time he is
the literally the brand and the brand
name of a popcorn company a very
successful company Orville passes away
his grandson gives ConAgra the right to
hire an advertising agency to rebuild a
3d model of him after he passes away
from all that video footage and there is
a commercial where Orville was dancing
around with an iPod saying this baby is
light and fluffy just like my popcorn
and and so Orville continues to be a
brand endorser from beyond the grave
he's never given permission to do this
right so you guys may make the conscious
decision to have your avatar built you
know they can do it on the second floor
here and to have it stored so that your
great great great great grand show being
and sit on your lap and you can have a
wonderful experience they can have
wonder experience in the future and
that's your decision and that's
fantastic but orbital didn't give that
decision all right his dad were out
there somebody built a 3d model and now
he's dancing his legacy is dancing
around with an iPod like an idiot okay
that was old technology so you watch
this video and it looks very creepy
there's a concert in California called
Coachella which is a very big three-day
big conference and this is an artist
called Tupac Shakur who passed away some
time ago and what you're seeing here is
the crowd went ballistic because this is
Snoop Dogg on stage they
used Pepper's Ghost which we talked
about earlier to basically put Tupac on
stages snoop no one in the crowd had any
idea what this technology was they just
looked up and saw this guy who they all
knew was passed away and you know in a
very nicely interactive manner snoop and
Tupac Tupac sings a song he's never sang
before and integrates it with Snoop Dogg
so you know the question is so this
horrible thing is a one-time thing
so with Tupac his mom gave permission
for this to happen and you know how long
is it until you guys put him in the
connect all right what's you know we
could talk about the laws are on this
and that's a different conversation but
there's a lot of big ideas here and the
data we're collecting now forget about
the stuff actor but early on in my talk
which is you know I can be a better
teacher a better persuader you guys can
fall victim to my tools of persuasion I
mean this is big stuff any of you guys
that have a facebook profile with a
hundred photos of you the things that
the people in this room could do with
that in terms of building a perfect
version of you is wonderful or scary
depending on your point of view so again
my book is called infinite reality it
gives lots of detailed discussions to
all this if you enjoyed this talk please
do read it and I look forward your
questions
yes sir
yeah I had a question regarding the
rescue simulation and when you you have
mimicked someone that's wrong how good
do we have to be to stop disbelief then
we know for example that if you are in
there the bill to a t-test if the
measurement lags by some value then it
disconnects so there's so since we did
this study there's been about 10 or 15
studies in VR and we haven't looked at
lag in particular but let me give you
some examples of things we have looked
at so we've looked at the imagine that
so the mimicry we did was just we just
just take head movements imagine that
you swap the axis so when you did this I
did this okay so that's making the
mimicry more like interest so it's a
fine line peen mimicry and interactivity
and what we demonstrated in kind of a
psychophysics manner is how the effect
goes gets smaller and smaller as a
function is abstracting the technique
but the one thing I will say is that the
effects are fairly robust that mere
approximation so with VR what you'll see
this I mean what makes so this so
amazing is that 60 times a second no
matter where you're looking they're
capturing the position if you read
perfectly and rendering it in that
position
so with I with with field of view you're
very sensitive with the behaviors of
others you you're a lot more forgiving
yeah afraid your book very inspiring
thank you you speak a lot about the
narcissistic background here but you
also talked in your book about the
potential for education therapy phobias
and things like that I guess I just
wanted to ask for your bedroom knowledge
what do you find to be the most
use of this technology yeah I hope I
didn't come off too cynical I try to go
50/50 on studies that are positive and
negative I guess I jump up and down a
little bit more when they're scary so
thank you for the kind words about the
book to me that this to hold the two
homerun applications in my mind are the
environmental stuff I really think we've
got a great potential to connect people
in a visceral manner with you know what
is a carbon molecule what is warming we
have a study I didn't talk about this
funded by the Department of Energy we're
trying to get Stanford kids to use less
hot water in the shower they take 40
minutes showers that's scalding hot
water the simulation is they walk in we
build the avatar that looks just like
them they're in a shower that has a
window and they see themselves through
the window and they've given given data
about how much coal it takes for a 15
seconds of hot water and in order to
power that shower and this feels really
real it's really feeling shower there
avatar is forced to eat a chunk of coal
and then we later we measure their water
use and showing with this vividness you
get a decrease fairly so that's a good
one the education I think is look you
know Stanford is taking a very huge I
think leadership role in doing these
online courses and and my take on this I
wrote an article for The Chronicle of
Higher Education which is my avatar
could be a better teacher than I could
ever be and if you take face morphing
mimicry the Augmented gaze and put them
all in a teacher imagine all of you it's
got the perfect version of me as a
teacher and there's many of you probably
read this book called the diamond age by
Neal Stephenson that you know so we've
got a lot of data on the home run
applications for education but know I
sometimes during talks I'd carried away
but I do think especially we when I'm
talking to you guys that have so much
power moving forward to do the right
thing I wanted to focus on the alerting
what I appreciate you pointing I should
focus more on what we can do well thank
you yes
speech
so as surprising as it sounds it's ten
times easier for me to manipulate the
features of your face than it is in real
time to do your voice so there's a book
called wired fight wired for speech by
Clifford Nass which is the treatise on
doing these things with voice and
there's some studies with it just it's
really hard to transform speech in real
time yeah that's curious with the kind
of self perception stuff you're talking
about is that kind of limited to this
fully immersed virtual reality
experience where you are you aware that
there's same effects from the plain
world warcraft or something where i've
not literally in the perspective of so
one of the most famous studies in cell
percepts so there's a line of self
perception face to face one of the most
faith so self reception states that the
world is a complicated place and there's
no blueprint for hap for how i can
behave I often infer how to behave from
my own behavior I know that sounds
circular but a good example of this is
if a famous study by a guy named Valens
in the 60s he had people look at Playboy
Playmates while they were looking at
playmates they had a heart monitor
showing their own heart rate boop boop
boop for half the playmates he randomly
sped up people's heart rate for half of
them he had them be the actual heart
rate and then later on they rated how
attractive they thought each of the
playmates were for people when somebody
saw a playmate for whom their heart rate
had been jacked up they rated the model
as better looking later on meaning they
inferred their own attitude from their
own behavior and there's a whole line of
work on that Nick has done so one of my
favorite studies in regard to this is
with Nicky he did a study with World of
Warcraft he somehow got data from eighty
a hundred thousand years of World of
Warcraft and he looked at gender so a
lot of people a lot of males and World
of Warcraft play female avatars and he
somehow got a very large sample size of
men with multiple avatars some that were
male some that were female and
demonstrated that when males wear female
bodies and world of warcraft 2d non
immersive they have a much higher
proportion of healing to killing than
when they wear male avatars and there's
nothing inherent to the avatar that
causes that it's as
perception but I'll send you some of
they send me an email I'll send you some
of the Knicks work on that yes so I get
this question every time I give a talk
and I bet I've got two answers so let me
answer the first one first that's my
first answer that is that we just
haven't done enough work on this and of
this of the 80 studies I've run in this
I've done longitudinal studies three or
four times and the exercise lasts at
least 24 hours later I've done studies
with obesity where I basically force
your avatar to eat Reese's Pieces and
you see your gut grow and your thighs
grow and we've shown some fairly
longer-term effects with that but not
enough we just you know now that I have
tenure I got tenure two years ago and
social science doesn't really reward the
longitudinal studies so much but the
world does but so now I'm going to focus
more on the longitudinal stuff but the
second part of that answer is that kids
are spending eight hours a day inside
right so as long as you can get them
there once a day you know yeah I don't
think you need to show that it last 80
years sorry that's it's a and that
answer is kind of a cop-out to your
question I think we need the second one
I'm positive versus negative framing the
answer to that is that we've manipulated
that variable how important is positive
versus negative feedback and thus far
haven't found many differences that
literature in general is a really
complicated one on what works better for
your appeals or positive appeals and and
our work both have worked yeah yeah so
then your first the student lecturer or
an example one of the indirect effects
is that the student thinks that the
lecturer staring at them is ignoring the
other students which isn't true and I
guess that's then the question is will
over time we start to not trust anything
that's out there are we heading to K
dick wins ok dick inspired a lot of the
work that years you saw today whether
directly or indirectly but the
interesting idea of this arms race so I
like to talk about spam you know spam
there's this arms race between the
defenders and the people that create it
and you know every once in a while I'll
click on one of those things you know
they do it smart enough they put my name
in the title that grab they grep
something that so you're going to
look for for everything I've talked
about that with his subconscious
persuasion stuff when you detect it
consciously a backfire so the mimicry
when so we've done some studies where
instead of it was four seconds it's only
two seconds and you detect it and when
that mimicry becomes mockery it
backfires and you know in pilot studies
before would be when we're doing the
face morpheme before we perfected that
technique if you're conscious and
immunologist power I mean now how I
sleep at night by doing this work is
that you know I just make these
discoveries and I talk to you guys about
it I don't answer the phone call from
political consultants that want me to go
to Ohio and work in those five districts
and get a roomful of monkeys that are
doing morphing the same way that they
have people stuffing envelopes so the
way the cheat so you want whenever you
want experiment you want to avoid it's
called demand characteristics which is
you know what the study is about so the
way she solved that problem that all the
the woman who ran those gray shoes from
Korea all the products were novel and
Korean and she gave you lots of them so
a month later when she tested your
product preference and recall you didn't
consciously remember the association
between yourself the product you just
had this implicit liking but you know
it's yeah it's fairly hitting you over
the head but what she did demonstrate is
that you you could imagine getting very
pissed off at an advertiser for doing
this and she didn't demonstrate that
people weren't that pissed actually yeah
you studied the difference in a lot of
these things between children and adults
specifically like identity cues like you
are children born with this notion of
attractiveness and being more confident
when they're attractive versus today so
that's a question of by far above my
paygrade
the nature versus nurture debate to
answer the specific question we've only
run a couple of studies with with
children the universities make that a
fairly complicated and a sad fact of
social sciences ninety nine percent of
them the work is College sophomores I
mean I can I've send me an email please
and I'll send you the three or four
scholars I know that who are looking at
stuff developmentally what I will tell
you is that VR kids take the VR like
fish to water man they are when you see
this pit you're going to be a bit
hesitant kids are doing cannonballs in
there and they
they're fairly happy yes sir um kind of
build them love what the gentlemen over
here mentioned about the whole Philip
Kingdom dynamic I'm kind of gravitating
back towards the the children that swam
with the whales how they kind of had
these manufactured memories which kind
of touches on the do we you know we can
remember it for you wholesale yep is
there
thanks for using the curve and you're in
your uh in in your opinion do you think
there's a need of anything positive that
can come from manufacturing memories
that sort of that the art perceives look
I'm a social scientist not an ethicist
and I appreciate the question and I'm
gonna cop out in the answer which is you
know in the book we've got a chapter
called the yin and the yang of this
stuff and I want you to think of avatars
in VR the same way you think about
uranium it can heat homes and it can
destroy nations and and yeah if I've got
a fairly traumatic event and you can
knock it out you know what makes this
what makes these stories so brilliant is
that there's an appeal there right it's
not it's not 1984 of them telling me
which country I should hate this is you
know why why wouldn't I you know travel
some why would I take a virtual vacation
you know it's cheaper I don't get germs
I can have well you know there's an
allure to it but again I what I can tell
you as a scientist is that kids and
adults have a hard time differentiated
there's there's a theory called media
richness that really kind of explores
you know the richer the richer a media
event the hard there's the more likely
you get something called source
confusion which is you know if you see
something on TV and it's very detailed
and it's high-def you're more likely to
five years later to you know basically
tell someone else you were there and
it's not because you're being evil it's
just because that's how we are yep jaren
back in the eighties developers invented
displays and you know over time as they
became more of more high-resolution
found that simulator sickness was a cute
problem because there's no gravitational
cues unless you're on a motion platform
that luck it will become ill using these
kinds of things is there been any
solving of that problem so I have you
did you go next door and try it out yet
no okay I suggest you try you can always
close your eyes you know in two seconds
up so nobody knows exactly why similar
sickness happens and and Andy is
probably better equipped to answer this
than I because he's a more of an expert
on perception but what I can say is in
our time running we get it a lot less so
one of the reasons you got to be
forwards from lag meaning you move
physically and it takes a while for the
world to catch up Andy neither in world
vision or myself ever run at less than
60 frames a second in each eye you do
get something called the convergence
problem which is when I see an object
far away my eyes focus in a way and
everything in the hmd even when it looks
far as close so that hasn't gone away
that's an HM that's a that's a VR thing
so that could be driving it but it it's
a complicated literature on similar to
simulator sickness that people don't I
guess the second question is I'm doing a
lot of research myself with with
telepresence and autism we're finding a
lot of kids who use telepresence
technology and communicate and unless
you effectively before any research
you're doing there's about four scholars
around the world spending good time on
this I did a project we got funded by
the NIH a guy named Peter Monday at UC
Davis who's one of the world's expert in
treating autism and we did a grant so
this is a kind of a crazy imagine so as
a teacher I know that me looking at you
guys is one of the cues that I energize
my crowd I pace I get you guys engaged
we ran a study where you know you guys
would probably remember the Augmented
cognition call from the late 90s this is
augmented social interaction imagine
that I received real-time feedback about
how much I'm engaging you guys and the
way we ran the study this is with adults
normal normal adults if I'm not looking
directly at you your avatar slowly
starts to disappear so what I get is a
real-time cue that's very easy to
perceive to give me as a teacher and aid
to spread my gaze around and to include
you in the conversation and what we've
demonstrated is when you give the
teacher that's simple cue students learn
better the teacher spreads her gaze
better a Peter read this paper and said
autistic children who have a very
high-functioning autistic children have
a very hard time engaging in nonverbal
social behavior what an amazing tool for
them and we've now run two pilot studies
he just got a new grant on this as well
showing that when you give high function
artistics the ability to get real-time
feedback about their nonverbal social
behavior that they improve so it's it's
a huge area Ross Picard at MIT does some
stuff send me an email later on and I'll
give you the list of the four or five
scholars doing it but you know in
general to take a step back autistic
children are comfortable in VR this is
over this is generalization and it's at
some opinion but base for my
conversations with Ross for card and
it's a nice technology to help that
population perhaps we've had the last
question but I'd encourage you to check
out the demo that's just next door and
Jeremy's around to answer questions for
all you have a free time before your
next meeting for but join me in thinking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
