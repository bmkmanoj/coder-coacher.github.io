powerful tools in the hands of very
large numbers of people wonderful things
happen so many of the ideas from what
with science fiction are now being made
a reality
computing is kind of like people in the
sense and that they grow up and they
continue to evolve thinking about
computers and and where they're going
and being part of of making them go
there is what drives me every day
research is one of the ways in which you
can create tremendous technological
value coming up with brand new
approaches to solve old problems
tackling new problems that no one's ever
solved before moving into new areas
where suddenly you can do things were
simply not possible and that creates
lots of new applications those factors
are what personal computing has been
about from the get-go key behind the
Microsoft Research is the is certainly
its people and their passion for trying
to to extend the frontiers in various
ways and do things in much more in a
much better inventive fashion when
Microsoft researchers talking about what
they're doing they do this in a context
of other researchers at other labs and
universities around the world so it it's
what makes computing research so
exciting is that there is real open
discussion of what's going on and who's
making progress and getting great
results the Sun never sets on Microsoft
Research and so that ability to tap into
cultures and different mindsets but also
to be able to invest not only in
conventional core computer science ideas
but take a lot of risk when I came to
Microsoft 20 years ago to start
microsoft research I wouldn't have
imagined that we'd reach the state that
we are today where we are the number one
basic research organization in the field
of computer science where we're having a
tremendous impact with our products it
really changing the field of computer
science with our research there's been
nothing more fascinating to me than the
evolution of
peters were living the future microsoft
