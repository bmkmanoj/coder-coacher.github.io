so hi I'm Lee Rainie from Pew Internet
pew is it is a family name it's not an
acronym it's a it's the family that
found oil in Pennsylvania and shipped a
lot of it made a lot of money it's the
Sunoco fortune so there's not an acronym
behind me or anything like that and
actually in a weird way we're funded not
to do any advocacy we're not supposed to
promote anything we're not supposed to
recommend anything we're not supposed to
cheerlead for any companies and stuff
like that so that's kind of where I'm
coming from and I took Liz's assignment
and the general topic that we're
supposed to discuss and try to look at
our data for examples of what would be
rare in things like what we do and
examples of what would be mysteries in
things that we do but could you guys
could help illuminate and one of them
sort of interesting challenges of this
workers pew has always been associated
with big national phone surveys that's
that's a calling card for pew research
for forever and one of the most
accidental wonderful things that
happened to Pew Internet is it came into
being was we became like the default
census bureau for digital statistics
which puts more and more burden on us to
sort of benchmark and measure big
phenomena and big things because you
know for better or for worse the Bush
administration just decided not to
continue on what the Clinton
administration was doing in the nineties
and doing wonderful regular fast
turnaround robust surveys the Bush
administration in about two thousand two
or 2003 did one major household survey
fifty thousand households as they do
with the Census Bureau and wrote a
report about a year after they collected
the data so already the data were sort
of suspect and they wrote a report that
basically said more than half the
population was using home broadband the
market has solved the problem we don't
have to worry about this anymore so now
we the pew internet data is pretty much
the only day that you have for most of
the 2000s about what was going on in
broadband and mobile adoption and social
media and things like that so we feel
the burden of that and in some respects
we're handing off lots of problems and
interesting issues
because we can't cover the things that
maybe are you know most interested
people in this room so I I thought I'd
talk about three things that are three
ideas that emerged from our data about
either rareness in what we find or
mysteries in what we find you can
roughly categorize them as things that
are outside our data what we don't quite
capture in the way that we capture it
things that are beyond our data things
that nothing a phone survey can possibly
answer and then there are actually are
things that are hidden in our data that
for one reason or other we haven't
extracted them or that you know aren't
necessarily top of mine subjects for the
kind of work that we do so when you do
big national surveys one of the limits
on it no matter how great your your your
sample is is eventually you you get to a
point where you can't good good samples
of every group that matters so right now
our standard survey is about 2,000
people we collected over a month we do
not get enough asian-americans in our
sample to report those data as important
race and ethnicity data it's a
frustration that you know drives our
stakeholders wild and and eventually we
will be able to do it but but there are
small groups and subgroups and not
necessarily even small groups that don't
get captured in our data so so there
there are some subpopulations starting
with you know seven percent of the
population that doesn't get reflected in
the way that we report out our data
although one of the nice things you can
do is combine our datasets and
eventually get enough sample so that you
can at least look at basic things with
subpopulations but for instance it's a
real limit on our work that we have to
wait until something is likely to have
been generally adopted by the pot by
some portion of the population before we
can pick it up so early adopters of
everything sort of never get covered in
our work and it's an enormous
frustration to scholars who are
interested in cutting edge thing it's it
even bigger frustration for the
marketing and media communities that are
using our work because they want to know
you know the day after the tumbler goes
live as a platform you know who's using
it how many what are they doing how are
they different from every other
kind of social media user well we just
we just don't know so small groups like
early adopter small groups like like
subpopulations that's that's part of the
problem a second thing is there are
small activities that occur online so
there are ways in which many of you
would like us to be able to parse
different kinds of social media for
different kind of activities that you
know two people use Twitter and Facebook
in different ways we're almost at a
point where we can measure that but we
still can't slice the activities quite
the way that are most useful which
leaves a lot of territory for you guys
and it also means that I only in rare
instances do we actually asked about
specific functions we ask a general
question about email use we ask a
general question about people getting
news online people we ask the general
question about people sharing links and
stuff like that when we don't talk to
them by device by platform by you know
application or activity and stuff so
there are limits in our data that that
relate to that and then there are messy
minds when you're talking to people in
phone surveys you think you're being
really smart and asking the question and
exactly the way that every normal human
being would be able to understand it and
respond to it well especially in an
evolving space like this that's just not
so I mean one of the chronic
frustrations with us almost from day one
is we've never done a piece of work on
net neutrality because the the terms are
not well understood in the general
public to the degree that they are well
understood there's somewhat contested
terms I know I've reached out to a bunch
of people in this room to help design
some questions for some international
studies we've done but they're just
there there are too many sort of
different things going on in people's
minds to sort of sort this out and even
in our data there are frustrations we
think we've asked a straight-on question
and people don't necessarily know such
things as whether they've gotten a piece
of information from accom or a dot edu
or a.gov they don't know when they move
from one site to another site whether
they're still in the domain of the
original site that moved there one of
the first things I learned about the
limits of our work is that men
surprisingly
enough are less likely to answer a
question don't know so you will ask them
stuff and they will say absolutely i
know this or I feel this or I think I do
this and women are a little bit more
circumspect but there are things like
that that are sort of part of the human
condition that that we sort of can't
account for and the big limit of doing
big national surveys as you you can't
get to the white questions you can't
people can't explain themselves really
well when you're asking them to say yes
no or giving them maybe three or four
options because they will give you the
Kansas kind of answers at data it was
getting you know I don't want it I don't
need it I don't like it and stuff like
that when when you begin to talk to
people they will say much more revealing
things but you can't do that in a phone
on a stranger and you know some some you
know they did people are uncomfortable
talking about their tech literacy skills
or their language literacy literacy
skills or things that they don't know
about you know how the world works and
so the the sort of fundamental issue
with with the kind of survey work we do
is why so any answer that gets you
towards why in the kind of research that
you all are thinking about is in
advantage that's a rare thing to be able
to come out of survey work so then there
are other things that are just beyond
our data on I would I would sort of
categorize them the most interesting
ones that I always get asked about and
can't give reasonable answers about
involve some sort of alchemy between
nature and nurture and the two big ones
that always come up our personal
disclosure decisions everybody wants us
to have good useful important data to
help regulators think through privacy
implications and stuff like that well it
turns out that there you know the
paradox and privacy findings is as
obvious as it is long-standing people
say they value it people act like they
don't it's not clear whether they know
what's going wrong and the way that
they're acting on their lives it's not
clear whether they're thinking about you
know I'm getting a transaction that
actually matters more to me and is more
efficient to me so I'll let a piece of
myself or my identity go out there
it's just really hard to sort out the
balance of how people are making
decisions about this stuff partly
because they're unaware and partly
because in their transactional frame of
mind they can't necessarily talk very
articulately about why i do what i do
when i give up this kind of stuff so
we're going to actually spend in a year
doing much more qualitative work on this
because that's the real way that i think
we'll be able to find stories about how
context-driven disclosure decisions are
and and more carefully sort out how
aware people are what the heck is going
on in the first place you know our paths
assess is that the basic definition of
privacy is what a lot of you have
understood for a long time people want
to control their identity and control
what happens to pieces of information
about them but they they we will have to
use other methods to find that out the
other sort of mystery in our data is
patterns of influence you know people
would love us to be able to say social
media accounts for X percent of the
value of somebody's vote or whether
someone made up their mind to vote and
traditional news media accounted for y %
and and things like that well the people
can't don't think that way they don't
often remember where they got key pieces
of information in many cases in part
because the online and offline worlds
have merged so thoroughly in people's
minds they can't even tell you whether
they got it in one of a digital devices
they've got or whether they have gotten
it through a friend who tore out a news
story for them so they're you know one
of the great mysteries in our data and
one of the wonderful rare things that
other methodologies are going to have to
unearth is the new contours of how
influence is being felt in these in
these new domains then there's a sort of
a cluster and I think Clive said it too
high a standard for everybody in this
room to try to understand everything
where that's going on we can't that's
okay but there are a couple of things
that we see about group formation and
group activities that strike me as
relatively less well understood as other
things and they're emblematic by three
things I'm going to talk about one is
the home concerts movement you know it's
actually been going on for a while who's
been to a home
concert here okay this is you guys who
really would um well it's the interplay
between individual artists and their
audiences enabled by sort of digital
promotion and digital awareness and and
sharing and sampling and things like
that people host homes in their host
concerts in their homes and invite their
friends and then this is a way lots of
musical acts now sort of get their start
or move to the next level of awareness
it's that wonderful interplay between
creation and audience and and then how
people find each other that's a pretty
new thing and particularly in spaces
where the transaction costs are at some
level zero but they're you know finding
the right things and discovering the
right things is kind of hard a second
phenomena it's just I heard this
yesterday and I looked it up and it was
the coolest thing I have heard in a
while there's a wonderful movement of
green funeral home practices that
something happened a couple of years ago
where some activists who cared a lot
about the environment and God you know
the way we were burying people was
ridiculous is in environmental terms
well sort of a merger between advocacy
and a business opportunity and stuff
like that and there's now you know if
you do a search on green burials you
will find lots of funeral homes that
offer this and lots of ways that people
are trying to make this a market
differentiator for this work so there
are ways in which sort of new business
formation and new business sensibilities
and its intersection with activists
groups is it's kind of new and kind of
interesting and we don't well understand
it but it's it's a phenomenon that is
sort of rarely understood and then
there's another one that we at Pew
Internet call communities that are
essentially just in time just like me
communities it's very evident in the
rare disease community where people who
don't have a lot of contact with others
who are have the same condition or the
same condition that a loved one has they
find each other but there's something
magical that happens at the moment that
they find each other completely you know
often stranger encounters these are not
people who have lots of history together
don't necessarily have you know any
level of trust you know going into the
relationship but a form an immediate
bond i'm just i'm dying for someone to
coin the right word for how powerful
these situations are when people
discover someone who's going through the
exact same thing that they are in a
circumstance where they've never met
someone else like that this this is the
Moebius syndrome website one of the ways
that we've heard about this is it Nell
Minow whom some of you might know as a
corporate governance activist has told
us a wonderful story about her uncle
Burt who had Moebius syndrome which make
essentially paralyzes your face you are
and and does potentially other things to
you but it's very hard for people with
this condition to send out any kind of
social signals apart from their speech
it's an it's a quite debilitating quite
you know socially isolating kind of
condition and Nell talks about how her
uncle Burt became sort of the Godfather
of this movement when she introduced him
to bulletin boards in the 1980s and all
of a sudden again she can describe he
can describe encounter by encounter of
how people who were suffering from the
same thing all of a sudden found the
soul mate on the other side of the
country and and so something magic is
happening there and I would welcome
anybody's insight into how you know that
can be well understood then there's
finally there's stuff that's hidden in
the data or stuff that we haven't
extracted so we know that in our data
there are poor people who are old people
who are tech crazy they use it a lot by
every measure of use and enthusiasm and
outcomes they look exactly like well
educated rich white folks and then so
it's just rare because we haven't you
know had much cause to quite go find
them and promote them because one of the
most important things we do is keep
moving on and gathering new data but
it's there we also by implication in our
data have things that speak to why
people abandon their social network
sites or why people sort of transition
from time to time to different levels of
participation so it's their might who
knows what what motive is going on there
so my final word will be to invite you
to play with our data we are open source
all of our data sets
from all of our surveys from march two
thousand and now it's 150 surveys are
available for people to download and
play with however they want so steal our
data and help us tell these stories
thank you very much questions and i
really i mean i'd really love at some
point i've met it today i'd love to hear
from folks about what we should be doing
because we've we've got a lot to do and
i'd like to be really useful to you guys
yeah limitations of coverage some of
those as resource driven right yeah
there are other private sector general
social survey of other large national
representative surveys that use face to
face interview technique so that media
sponsors because it's a slower method
but they do want coverage and it's
largely if I've got a trade-off between
the resources behind and what next right
well the other thing that in the future
that one of the stories that maybe you
all are painfully aware of probably as
painfully as I on surveys are in deep
trouble right the right now the standard
response rate that we're getting now is
about half of what it was at the dawn of
the project for the political stuff that
we all relied on and made so much use of
and and was so important to the last
campaign those response rates are middle
single digits even with extra effort to
try to get more people into them and and
so you know the caller ID has not been
our friend and we're doing lots of
survey work with with with mobile
devices because we can the the
registries that the pollsters use to
talk to people are just as robust now
for mobile devices as they are for
landline devices so that's not the issue
its just people won't answer the cause
and for the first time in some of our
data as we as we try to figure out who's
not answering our surveys for the first
time this year as we did special
analysis we find that people who answer
surveys are much more civically oriented
much more likely to be volunteers sort
of slightly more likely to be
politically engaged they actually they
don't they aren't different politically
in other words surveys are still quite
good for pretty
being election outcomes if they're done
well but the but the sort of social
character and community spiritedness of
people who don't answer surveys is it
seems to be different and that's you
know going to be a problem as we keep
moving forward because one of the great
things that the GSS is done for forever
and then I you know work like ours done
on a much smaller scale is figure out
what's going on in civic life and how
people get information in an acting
civic life and and so so there's a
pretty you know intense discussion in
the polling fraternity about how to cope
with this yeah
to see more collaboration sharing
yeah we're definitely one of the chronic
problems that we've had for a long time
but it's intensified in recent years as
people always think we're telemarketers
yeah you first could first encounter
with the strange number on the phone is
somebody says we're taking a survey and
then we have to do one of those drug
condition voiceover sir and we're not
telling you anything please keep talking
to us don't hang up don't have and
sometimes we can convince him to do it
and sometimes not but it's so there are
definitely ways that that we're seeing
other problems or other issues in the
marketplace get wrapped up in our work
even though there are sort of legal
carve-outs we're the political and civic
polling and nonprofit polling enterprise
has lots of permission under the law the
telemarketers don't but there is some
thought about about polling resources of
course it's still a competitive space
and others so you know the other thing
just to be brutal about it is there's a
lot of junk out there you know their
stuff masquerading as representative
samples of poles that just isn't and so
finding the right partners is is very
much sort of a contest and we still
don't you know he wants to do its own
thing sometimes too so it's it that's a
big challenge yeah
Oh
we were trying to design a nationally
representative survey that were
targeting for 16 year old and polymer
disappointment there was just so
we ended up designing and that's what we
would like to call
is that by your standards we're we're
doing started
but it actually you know there's pude
has similar interest and does similar
things we done some very specialized
work with understanding Muslims in
America and they're just there are lots
of ways that you have to sort of you
know change the standard rules to get
the kind of population samples
you see that are creative that are doing
you know what you're just suggesting
something there's that that's that's
possible and I don't think ever been
attempted there's a there's a poll data
repository at the University of
Connecticut called the Roper center
named after Elmo Roper and in aggregate
or it pulls together it's just it's a
vault for lots of polling did I know as
far as I know linking data sets in that
has never been attempted and there's no
way I can think of that would prevent it
there it's very structured data you know
who we all ask kind of the same
questions in the same ways we might have
to rename variables but it's not that
part of its not hard the other thing
that we've done at times when we really
care about a population and have had
trouble finding it through standard
methods which are enormously expensive
is to sort of back filled with with data
from the knowledge networks in that gfk
has a really great robust panel of and
they know a lot about their members and
it's a panel so that you've got a we're
a little bit about not only one side is
survey fatigue but another side is
professional survey responders people
who have signed up to sort of be on a
panel and sort a yeah I'll do ten
surveys a year you know why not so so
yeah there we should probably talk more
about how to do that but absolutely
that's a great idea
but is one of this wasn't one of the
things that was so out of whack about
those election that election that the
use of the phones
if you're looking at the merging sort of
smaller groups some of these groups may
not have I mean isn't that isn't that
your sandwich you're giving people with
card ideas problem that was actually a
big problem in the election what was it
was one of the problems in the election
trying to reach special populations and
probably were decisive in some
congressional districts or state races
or even the national race and it's part
of that cellphone driven this this we're
still happy and actually we're happier
than we thought we'd be with with the
mobile phone kinetic collection it works
about as well as landline we're getting
the registries are as good so that you
if you have a cell phone you have as
much chance to be called by us as any
other cell phone owner in the country a
new waiting variable it's been added to
surveys which is actually made them
better is your phone use status because
one of the best surveys that's done
against which we true up our stuff in
our waiting sample is done by the CDC
where they talk to people about not only
do you have a cell phone do you have a
landline phone but if you have both
which you make most of your calls on and
these numbers are so solid that that's
now a one of the things that we use for
our waiting so that's not so much the
issue the issue you know for the best
polling that was done in the campaign
non response rates didn't seem to matter
the problem is that you know even for
nate silver he was combining you know
gold standard polls like ours and a
couple of others with stuff that wasn't
necessarily gold standard and it came
out okay so aggregating does do
interesting dude does do good work and
the other thing that he really
introduced to the conversation that was
so important was understanding
probabilities I mean he just changed it
by himself he changed the nature of the
discourse by by doing that and you know
the fact that he did it well means that
in the future that's now going to become
at least part of the smarter political
commentary that's you know the emerges
from Poland okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
