thank you hello hello thank you for
coming hmm so yeah this is my new book
mama gone geek and it's a little bit of
a departure for me i have written I
think 48 books but many of them are very
obscure like Indiana the Hoosier State
that was Avenue or one two three green
frogs so not all the books where as
involved as this one this one is a
memoir of sorts so it's a bunch of
stories that come from my experience and
and through the lens of science how I
kind of stayed or I try to stay sane as
I'm parenting so I'm going to do a
couple things I'm going to read a little
bit of the introduction so you can get a
sense of where I'm coming from in terms
of my my inner geekiness and then and
then I'm going to read you a story so I
won't read the whole introduction but
I'll set the scene I learned that I was
a geek when I was in the summer of
fourth grade and I went to a camp Quecha
which is right near by where I grew up
and I fell in love with horses with that
I just loved horses I needed to learn
everything about them I learned the
names of all of their bones and their
muscles and anything that afflicted them
and Annie anything I just I couldn't get
enough of horses it's the only thing I
talked to my counselor that the camp
counselor about was when is my horse
lesson when is my horse lesson was my
horse I have a horse lesson today and
they're like a huh so at the end of the
summer uh they always gave out awards
and oh gosh you know everybody dreamed
of you know am I gonna get the best
all-around camper am I gonna get the
best swimmer am I gonna get best
horseback rider but I knew I wouldn't
because patty Barber was way better than
me but I was still hoping I was still
hoping and um uh so that's setting the
scene here this is the final day the
counselors gathered and handed out
awards we all had our hopes best
all-around camper best swimmer funniest
camper most popular i coveted the best
horseback rider award of course but I
knew in my heart that patty or Amy who
are
older and better would win that when my
name was called I stood up the
counselors were smiling they bestowed
upon me my award certificate most
persistent camper who is that what did
that mean there was no mention of horses
or sports or popularity everybody
clapped on all the adults laughed and
cheered Sally the mean girl turned to me
and whispered horse nerd I brought my
word home and I showed my parents they
laughed tears flowing from their eyes
what does it mean what does it mean what
does it mean what does it mean every
time I ask they just there they laughed
harder I looked it up on my own and the
50-pound dictionary and dad study
persistent number one refusing to give
up or let go persevering obstinately
number two insistently repetitive or
continuous a persistent ringing of the
telephone number three botany lasting
past maturity without falling off as the
calyx on an eggplant or the scales of a
pinecone zoology retained permanently
rather than disappearing in an early
stage of development the persistent
gills of fishes for a while I was
embarrassed by this award people had
laughed at me the word nerd seared into
my self-confidence and made me shrink
then the stubborn obstinacy that I had
been awarded for kicked in what's so bad
I wondered I had no clue how it had
anything to do with camp Quecha but I
kind of liked the part about not giving
up if being persistent meant to love
something enough to want to learn
everything about it then bring it on
what I did not yet know was that being
most persistent camper followed being
passionate and was the foundation of
curiosity knowledge and discovery my
persistence was a symptom of my
exploration of passion and science so
that's how it kind of all started and
then i am going to advance here so not a
day goes by that my kids aren't engaged
in a why what if or i wonder it sharpens
their sense of amazement and
accessibility of knowledge while
creating a broader view of themselves in
the world to help encourage this sort of
curiosity and wonder i've included some
of my favorite activities
projects and experiments at the end of
each chapter because I think they're fun
and I think they also work as a
wonderful springboard into conversations
that go even deeper you know it's a
little geeky so at the end of every
essay I have a little experiment that
you can do geekiness is a treasure it's
a legacy that I love sharing and when I
hope Kai and Leo ones my kids will pass
along to their children some day science
isn't just for geeks it's the future if
you're a parent or planning to become
one it's your future and that's true
that's sort of my soapbox I think you
know everybody should be exposed to
science it's fun it doesn't have to be
agonizing I don't know about you but for
me when I was in third or fourth grade
science was agonizing we had these yeah
we had these horrible kids that were
made up of quarks and pebbles and it was
like what floats what doesn't can you're
like not a challenge pebble doesn't
float so I kind of I have this I have
this thing that you should science
should be accessible to kids and you
should be able to do these cool science
experiments with stuff that you already
have around the house not something you
have to go or chemical you can't
pronounce so that's sort of my that's
right my soapbox all right so chapter
i'm going to read to you is called i
hate to tell you but you're a little bit
fat mmm did you know that a person who
weighs 120 pounds on earth would weigh
just eight pounds on Pluto not that I've
seen 120 pounds since I was in like
seventh grade but it's nice to know it's
just a number and that the mass of me is
a variable there's a comfort in that the
kind of comfort I clung to when we
packed for Hawaii isn't it so boring to
hear mom's complain about their soft
figures since they had the baby it is
but I'm no exception I complain I worry
about it I joke about it to deflect the
niggling worry that I'm no longer an
attractive young thing I'm now married
and saddled with a ring of blubber
around the middle that like a life
preserver just won't quit I know I know
in my head I am good I own my body it
has taken me years of fending off
obsession and diets and slimming jeans
and shapewear and vertical stripes and
slimming shades of color I swim I walk
I'm strong I'm still working on the
self-image stuff so when Kai was three
and a half and Leo was one and a half
and we were packing for Hawaii I had to
face the idea
that I would be mostly nude in public
like red is not a cover-up make the
pools the great bodies of water that
were my friends during pregnancy we're
now staring me in the face I worried but
it was Hawaii after all paradise plenty
of real bodies from poi eaters to
midwest corn-fed mamas I was not unique
I had emerged from the hotel
pale-skinned shark bait as Keith called
me in my new suit that I hoped was
slimming I felt fo confident as I walked
across the pool deck in the early
morning warmth I had an iced coffee
under my belt and I was feeling good the
pool was sparsely attended at that hour
of the morning I decided to take the
leap both metaphorically and literally
to hell with his body insecurities it's
ridiculous I passed the waterfalls the
koi pond the large main pool and the
grotto hot tubs and made my way to the
small pool off the beach side of the
pool complex where Keith and the boys
were splashing in the shallows I didn't
skip a beat I dropped my towel sprinted
up the stairs and leptin to the
waterslide it was exhilarating i zipped
dropped turned and finally shot out like
a buttered ham and a cannon and landed
the splash I rose to the surface
laughing and floated over to chi he was
laughing and smiling at me he reached
for me as he scrambled to get close this
boy was so sweet love in his eyes here
we were in paradise mommy yes love I
reached over and cupped his freckled
cheek I hate to tell you but you're a
little bit fat how can a single sentence
undo a woman's confidence so thoroughly
I immediately start solving it wasn't my
finest moment Kai's face crumpled and he
looked at me in shock and he started to
sob he thought we were drowning so he
lunged in both to try to drag us out
this made me cry harder and sent Kyle
into hysterics Leo who was in Keith's
arm was straddled so he began to sob too
what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong
Keith erupted it in rapid succession
this made us all cry even more it was
ugly I handed Chi after Keith and hauled
myself from the pool he stood there
confused a sobbing boy under each arm I
wrapped the towel around myself and
folded into ashes just in time for the
waitress who was wearing
bikini to come by and asked me if she
could get me a drink it was 630 in the
morning pina colada please I mustard of
course she said with a wide island smile
she walked off and I found myself again
wait a minute wait a minute what did
they get pathetic i hailed her she
turned can you make that an iced tea
please she smiled of course I dropped my
towel and hopped into the pool I wrapped
my arms around my sobbing boys I picked
up Kai and looked him in the eye moving
I'm sorry he sobbed sweetie you just
surprised me that's all I know I may
seem a little bit fat and yes it's
interesting how a woman's body responds
to getting older I really had no idea
where I was going I wanted to let him
know that fat isn't anything to be
ashamed of I wanted to arm him with all
the things with which I really wanted to
arm myself tell me what happened keith
was calmer now I came out of the slide
and kai said I hate to tell you but
you're a little bit fat and I lost my
cool Oh sweetie that's a line from the
movie we watched this morning at four
o'clock when they got up because of
jetlag a bug said it to a caterpillar I
thought it was funny he's been saying it
ever since you should have seen the
bikini waitresses response did you see
her she's not fat I looked at Keith if
we both broke out into hysterics then I
looked at Chi in the movie it was funny
mommy I don't think you're bad I think
you're beautiful chi launched at me
wrapping his small body around me
clinging and sobbing again Oh baby I
didn't know he's a line from a movie I
did wonder why you delivered it in a
German accent though you are funny you
are I just misunderstood I was only
thinking from my perspective and I was
feeling a little vulnerable the great
thing is you brought it to my attention
that I was worried about something that
I should not spend time worrying about
right huh well if I'm worried that I
need to make my body more fit than I
shouldn't cry about it I should just do
something about it you helped me see
that I did yep hey mom he said and
pushed up in the pool watch me swim he
swam up four strokes and then back well
done watch me float i floated belly-up
wow how did you do that well honey
believe it or not I'm an awesome floater
because I'm a little bit fat
he looked at me wide-eyed it looked like
it could fall on either side of my joke
thankfully we both laughed daddy floats
too yep really well happily yes hey
keith said and splashed us dive in
that's what this was telling me what
else floats guy climbed out of the pool
and amassed a few objects a quarter
container of sunscreen goggles a coffee
cup one by one he dropped things into
the pool and exclaimed every time
something saying or floated if it
floated he bellowed it's a little bit
fat this was the mantra of the whole
trip delight expressed if something
floated joy when something was a little
bit fat it was a good lesson for me to
learn after a poolside lunch of sushi I
had an idea I took my water bottle and a
packet of soy sauce and brought it back
to the pool we filled up the bottle with
the pool water and dropped in the soy
sauce packet it's loaded we capped the
bottle and then squeezed the packet sunk
we let it go and floated it's a little
fat and then not I exclaimed his eyes
lit up like you mommy you are right
about that honey but how does it work
it's all about density truer words have
never been uttered what well the soy
sauce itself would sink in the water but
it's in a packet and it has a little
pocket of air that holds it up see oh I
see it it's like a little balloon that
makes it float exactly when you squeeze
the bottle you squeeze the soy sauce
packet and you make the air bubble
smaller and it just can't hold the pack
it up anymore because of pressure this
metaphor was biting me right in the
blubbery bot yup under that kind of
pressure it will sink hmm kai trotted
off and hopped into the pool with his
bottle he squeezed that thing and let it
go all day up down up down up down up
down he explained to anyone who walked
by all trip yes there was a part of me
that was dazzled by the fact that my boy
was geeking out over a physics
experiment but every time I saw Kai's
delighted surprise in amazement at the
ups and downs I reminded myself that
once again my salvation was in science
it's all about floating and sinking
isn't it we put pressure on ourselves
and little bubble that holds us up is
overwhelmed and we sink let go a little
and we rise back up to the top we're so
used to being programmed to believe
and what and be what we are told be
skinny be fit always smile have perfect
hair in all the right places not the
wrong ones life isn't always that easy
we all have moments when we sink and
moments when we float moments when we're
a little bit fat in moments when we just
believe we are I guess the trick is to
be clear-eyed and just enjoy the
constant dance between the floating and
the sinking so this is this bottle I got
a soy sauce packet in here and it floats
right but look if you squeeze it it
sinks it's just like life so that's a
little taste of what my book is all
about and I am here to answer any
questions if anybody has any no no
questions you mean anything from online
yeah hey chef eat another one I'll read
a short one should I be a short one all
right I was gonna read you the one about
head lice uh-huh but I think I might
give you one where ah see there's so
many fun ones there's the time Chi
swallowed a magnet sir science has
really been my go-to friend with all the
questions you know inevitably you get
the question you know where do babies
come from and oh it took me by surprise
copies of the backseat and like now this
is happening now you know where's key
why one so I just jump in and talked
about DNA
uh how old are your kids now my kids are
12 and 10 now kai is now 12 and Leo is
10 and they like they they're still okay
with this they're like go ahead read the
story i don't think i can write them now
I don't think I somebody has said your
next book should be about puberty I'm
like my god my kids would never talk to
me um all right i'm gonna read lice
because why not it was a lovely early
morning in the Pacific Northwest foggy
warming spring was a promise in the air
parents gathered at the bus stop with
mugs and hand and kids scrambling up
trees the birds were singing bugs were
buzzing and the people were full of good
cheer the bus dragged its caterpillar
like body up the main drag and hissed to
a halt in front of us the bus is on
Bainbridge our retro of course they are
their picturesque like enormous Twinkies
on wheels the kids jogged across the
street backpacks whacking their
backsides in unison with each footfall
we sipped our coffee smiled warmly
controlled our well-behaved dogs on
their leashes and waved to our perfect
children a mom sailed up next to me and
whispered conspiratorial e hey I just
wanted you to know that there might be
although only possibly perhaps be a
small no big deal outbreak of lice at
school specifically in Leo's class but
you didn't hear it from me I waved to
Leo and he waved back from the window on
the twinkie bus as if on cue he started
scratching his head the other moms took
a gentle and friendly step back they had
been listening everybody listens when
somebody whispers my head started to
itch too but I was determined not to
succumb to succumb lies I said with the
nervous giggle I didn't hear anything
from school oh they're everywhere they
can't get them out of the carpet in the
kindergarten room and when the kids go
into cozy reading corner and put their
little noggins together the lights have
a field day it's a big problem in Leo's
class I know for sure there was a girl
on the playground with the little things
just hopping off her head her mom is one
of those all-natural types and doesn't
believe in killing the lies with
anything harsher than mayonnaise but you
didn't hear
for me may L one mom said seriously well
we've never had it said another oh no
neither have we but I hear it's a
problem and really there's no shame in
it it's not a reflection of how clean or
dirty you are from what I hear the
conversation bubbled around me lies even
worse secret lies whoo even worse than
that I did what any self-respecting
Bainbridge Island mom would do when
faced with the possibility of a nasty
parasite infection as the back of my
head seared with a tingle calling me to
drag my fingernails across my itching
scalp I ignored the itch and deftly
didn't hide the possibility of lice
about my family look the thing is as
soon as she said it I knew we had it
licet simply not been on my radar ever
Leo it had been scratching for a week
and so had I I thought my shampoo was
too drying or that maybe the laundry
detergent was irritating the back of my
neck all good and very clean reasons for
stretching your hand but lies yo visions
of medieval poppers Street people and
Dickensian waves with no loving homes
waft it through my tingling head panic
begin december i could go home and soak
everything in insecticide or i could
lean on my old friend science and see
what i could dig up first i looked up
lice there are a zillion sites dedicated
to the identification and removal of
head lice some have cute names like
leiston oh yeah hair whisperers miami
lice Rapunzel's secret or nitwit I went
directly to the Centers of Disease
Control pediculus humanus capitis the
head louse is an insect of the order so
codilla and as an ecto parasite whose
only hosts are human the louse feeds on
blood several times daily and resides
close to the scalp to maintain its body
temperature their bugs they're parasites
which means they live on a host and
cause it harm okay I thought nothing new
lies are about the size of a sesame seed
that almost makes them sound cute sesame
seeds are kind of cute but look closer
they're milky beige lots of ugly things
or milky beige lice have six grasping
legs with a single sharp claw at the end
of every appendage this helps them grass
for the hair shaft and grasp they do
they have a swollen segmented abdomen
females cement their eggs onto the shaft
of hair near the scalp their eggs need
the warmth of the human scalp in order
to incubate and develop their tiny white
spots called nits again that sounds cute
doesn't it they can hang out on the hair
for about a week before hatching into
nymphs adolescent lice I can only
imagine the attitude of adolescent lies
one of the signs that you might have
head lice according to the CDC is the
feeling that someone something tiny is
scampering around on your skull the
nymphs are scampering again it sounds
cute but it's not nymphs just look like
look just like adult head lice but
they're about the size of the head of a
pin because they're insects their
skeletons are on the outside and they
have to mold and shed their skin before
they can grow so they do this three
times in one week and at the end of
emerged as an adult you and then there's
the itch allows his tiny sharp
mouthparts slice into your scalp suck
the blood right out of you that's what
it is they're slimy saliva is filled
with an anticoagulant so your blood will
flow they need to have a blood meal
several times a day they can live for 30
days on your scalp before kicking it the
females can lay up to eight minutes a
day so in a month one louse could make
your head pretty crowded with 240
possibly viable mints waiting to hatch
and then they lay more nets okay and
that's just one they all grow up and lay
more eggs the math is staggering if an
adult louse wanders off the host 10 I
think it's funny to call your head a
host it's not like you're throwing a
party it crawls because it cannot jump
it can creep to a scarf or hat or pillow
but unless it finds a new scalp to
explore it will die within a couple of
days yeah my head
I read about how lice are drawn to the
cleanest of heads they're passed around
when kids exchange hats or put their
heads together or as in Leo's case when
they roll around on infested carpets in
the book nook or the cuddle corner lice
are just doing their job making a living
having kids trying to survive
unfortunately they do it on our heads
and only our heads for some reason they
don't hang out on dogs or cats or even
other parts of our own bodies though I
was horrified to read that sometimes
they can lay their eggs on your
eyelashes and eyebrows they like good
clean warm places to live really they're
just like any living thing except
they're gross and they carry with them a
nasty stigma what parents want their
kids to be the lice kid with Leo the
lice kid did that make us the lice
family did that make me the lice mama
the horror i emailed mrs. barrel and
asked if she'd seen any itching or signs
of that leo head lice could he go to the
nurse and be checked she wrote back that
she was instructed to tell me that
unless he has actual lies on his head or
was complaining he could stay in school
what that wasn't my question no wonder
they had a problem she also said they
were not allowed to send kids home or
even send out a message apparently an
effort to spare parents the humiliation
of having their kids pinned with an
unpleasant label when the boys got home
from school I channeled my inner monkey
and went through their hair and search
for the elusive lice and their
apparently easier to spot nits but I
could see no nits but I still knew
something was up so we went to the
doctor actually we were going that day
anyway so when dr. England was just
about to have Leo say ah I said casually
he may have lice how can we tell dr.
England recoiled you recoiled did I he
asked sheepishly and laughed you're a
doctor and you have kids and you
recoiled I said trying to laugh my way
through the moment they're icky well
yeah that's true I have lice Leo
interrupted cool I want to name them
let's take a looks at the doctor he
snapped his hand into the rubber glove
and took a pencil and a light and
generally lifted a section of Leo's hair
he looked suddenly he winced and
recoiled again this time dropping the
pencil he's got it yeah and then he made
an eel face Leo however had an elated
face he was psych
awesome he spouted and began spitting
out possible lice name pygmy scout itchy
scratchy digger chomp a little bit
meanwhile I was thinking if you're a
doctor are you ever supposed to make an
ill face especially when all the
websites I saw and the parents of the
bus stop that morning assured me that
there was no shame in head lice if there
was no shame then why was our doctor so
desperate to get us out of his office
why the winds I pretended I did not
notice this time you're gonna want to
shampoo everything with that nasty lice
shampoo and then pretty much wash
everything in the house he said then he
looked at Leo and Kai don't share hats
with anyone put your jackets over the
back of your chair at school and then he
looked at me been to the movies lately
why is there a lice monster vs. Tokyo
flick I shouldn't miss he did not laugh
instead he grimaced you can get it at
the movies because people hunker down
and put their heads on the upholsterers
back holstered back of the chairs you
come along and lay back and once you got
lice home yeah nasty huh okay so have a
good weekend and let me know if you have
any questions as we left the doctor's
office on route for the cleaning of a
lifetime my head spun how many services
to our heads actually contact in a day
the car seat the pillows the couch is
the hats the scarves callers towels
blankets sheets stuffed animals animals
I was feeling the power of organization
and playing them attack coming on bring
it on lies I will take you down kai
interrupted quietly from the back mom
don't tell anyone okay we had lice but
in a world where this kind of thing
doesn't happen out loud the outbreak was
to be kept secret there was something
deeper happening here oh honey I said
you didn't do anything wrong I know I
didn't but I don't want everyone knowing
that we have bugs on us it's gross what
would they think of me they'll think
you're above garden a bug arena a bug
ecosystem piped up leo it's science he
said as if you were announcing a monster
truck rally star well honey here's the
thing i started in here we go i could
hear his eyes roll I think we got lights
for a reason because we're grows no not
exactly I think we got it because other
people are ashamed of it so they didn't
say anything and we caught it from them
because they had no we had no warning
they're ashamed of the idea of lies
because it carries a bunch
bad ideas with it what if you are
embarrassed about something because you
think it makes it you unworthy or
unlikable you hide it you make it a
secret you push it under the rug you get
lice from under the rug well kinda the
fact that no one said anything made us
vulnerable in a way that because we had
no reason to protect ourselves against
something we had no idea that was
lurking out there but how can we got it
how come we're the ones it's not fair
lice isn't fair get it ha life isn't
fair lies lies yeah kai was silent and
about to tear up in the back why do
these things always happen in the car I
parked are you crying asked Leo
incredulous Lee no I reached back to
hold his hand listen them here's a cool
opportunity for us to be courageous and
maybe even make a difference for
somebody else if we tell people we have
it then they can plan we didn't create
the lice yeah that's eggs said Leo or is
it mama lies hey which came first the
lice of the lice eggs he waggled his
eyebrows we didn't start the lice
outbreak but we could help stop it may
be how well we take of our care of our
problem first I paused to scratch my
head we shampoo we comb with clean we
stick everything that fits into the
dryer and then we seal everything else
in plastic we'll take these lights down
down town said leo sup nice you're going
down I cracked a sideways smile and
glanced at Leo supplies really then we
tell folks i continued we don't keep the
stupid secret that there are lies we
destroy the power of the secret we we
destroy the power of the secret shame of
lies are you with me yes hollered leo I
guess said Kyle it'll less enthusiastic
Lee we drove home despite the myriad
natural treatments from mayonnaise to
oils on gwin's and various citrus rind I
had been reading about all morning we
took the triple threat approach the
phone rang hi Lynn it's bev you have
lice how awful for you can I drop off a
casserole I thought she was kidding but
she wasn't I knew her kid probably had
it as well everybody had it she was
never going to admit it she was reveling
in our misery it's way better to watch
someone squirm than to be the one
squirming Oh God would have I set up for
my kids lice it was now defining us even
the doctor
winced phone didn't stop ringing the
moms at the bus stop riddled me with
questions emails flooded in everyone
wanted to know how I face the demon lice
and lived parents it didn't even know
stopped me in the grocery store lice mom
you're the lice mom right lies mom like
a superhero or an action figure lice
Barbie her arms bem so she can reach her
itchy scalp can you look at my
daughter's hair she's been scratching
show the nice lice lady honey people at
the gym stopped me hey you had lice
right I heard can you tell me if this is
dandruff or if this is lice I heard
myself spouting off comments like
actually more kids get head lice than
all the other communicable diseases all
added up you know except for colds
people would nod from a safe distance
but I sense that they were grateful for
the information somehow in my zeal to
teach my kids how to take the high road
and take responsibility I became the
town lice expert even though I postured
to the kids that we had done the right
thing deep down I was embarrassed I was
horrified and I felt judged the drama
all happened on the parental front we
can be so judgmental when in fact it's
the virus of the bacteria or the louse
just doing what organisms do making
their way replicating and finding the
best way to survive just like us the
kids were fine leo never once thought
any part of the whole life saga wasn't
awesome he loves insects and he
delighted in the science of their life
cycle he learned about parasites and
communicable diseases it was a great
springboard for him I decided to embrace
Leo's thrill of the revolting and take
it all in and it's disgusting nas's
we're not perfect that we spend so much
of our time trying to make ourselves
seem so we do this to ourselves by
dieting and training for triathlons and
spending obscene amounts I'm clothing or
by sucking the fat of our butts and
injecting it into our face or by not
allowing ourselves to delight in pasta
chocolate or any other decadent pleasure
for fear of adding pounds we work to
have the perfect kind of house and
furniture and yard and car and job and
relationship and kids can I possibly
even consider myself a decent parent if
we all got lies hell yes the nerd gift
that lice brought to me was the
realization that my job as a parent was
not to tell my kids that they were
perfect I am not perfect keith is not
perfect life is not perfect perfection
is too much pressure and it's all about
secrets and show my job is to tell
myself and my kids you are imperfect and
that's what makes
beautiful you hold that itchy head up
high you are authentic you are real you
have lice admit it embrace it and zap
those suckers is your head itching yet
and then the experiment at the end of
that is to make this cool jam jar
terrarium and you can catch bugs and put
them in there and see their life cycle
and all that stuff and it's a fun
springboard for that kind of thing so
that's it yes online question of them
what tactics or strategies have you used
to keep kids interest in science both at
home and in school when a kid such as
mine his name is Julian is often bored
in school and school science lessons
well I would say yeah I can understand I
can relate I would find out what julia
is Julian the boys name Julian is the
death oh the death find out what the kid
loves you know my kid loves soccer and
gymnastics and so we do a lot of that as
a springboard for physics or bouncing
you know their big am bouncing on the
trampoline there's all sorts of fun
things you can do to talk about science
and tip to put it in even though it's a
game and you know if it's music that's
another thing anything any any interest
that he has can be brought can be looked
at through the science to the lens of
science and i think that's it bring
bring the kids own passion to it and
then find out where those where those
take you that's that would be my advice
because it's science is fun and it's
everywhere it's in everything and that's
we just need you know to raise science
literate kids we need to inject them
with that knowledge that joy of
discovery that sort of that science is
really the basis of everything out there
and that it's sort of almost bottomless
there's more and more and more and more
and the more you wonder the more magical
it is and and in pad and the more you
look and the more i don't know at that
I'm sorry I go off find out what he's
passionate about and find a way to bring
science to it yeah yeah I have a
question so I myself I'm not very
scientific the last science
took was when I was in high school so
how do we open ourselves up to the
science level where we can explain to
kids when I don't know myself right well
and so that's the thing i mean there's
examples in here when my kids ask me a
question I don't know the answer like we
were camping and they were obsessed with
the fire you know and they like what's
fire and of course Keith just says ask
your mother and I'm like oh you know I
can tell you that it's a chemical
reactor reaction between molecules I can
tell you that but I don't know what it
is like I didn't know how to explain it
so we actually took that and that was
our springboard we looked together now I
lost them in the first five minutes but
I was fascinated and then after I
learned I could sort of turn it into
something else which was do you know
what okay you know let's burn a
marshmallow let's look at that you know
and and bring it back to what's
interesting to them but um yeah I don't
claim to be an expert at all I'm just
fascinated with science and so I think
everybody's in the same boat and and
really what we're teaching them is to
ask those questions to wonder out loud
and then to find ways to to solve to
solve the answers yep as a follow up of
that so how old were your kids when you
started introducing them to this kind of
conversation maybe baby babe is uh you
know not necessarily conversation but
but everything was always like this is
cool and look you know and I mean if
they were to we would do this and
squeeze it just say I mean they don't
want to know but they're not gonna
understand about density but they but
it's cool if you squeeze it and it drops
and you know um yeah and as soon as they
were walking I mean and there's all
sorts of stuff their stuffs you can do
in the bathtub you know and again it's
not even asking them to understand the
science principle behind it yet but it's
just that wonder like blowing a bubble
is magnificent you know and then later
on it's even more magnificent when you
realize it has to do with air pressure
and surface tension that's cool but you
know when they're really little it's the
bubble or both all of that is how do you
know how much to give them like how much
death or Danny just when they start to
glaze which is what my kiss you all the
time they're like yeah she's still
talking
I just push it until they come yep and
with the holidays coming grandparents
are asking Oh what should we get them
and I might rather have something you
can learn from other than something that
has a million pieces that yet lost
vacuum can you recommend either a
retailer or a brand or something that
has science involved that you've seen is
great for young kids got kids under
under the age of seven maybe something
that they can get introduced you yeah
well I'm gonna do a little self picture
I do book called pop bottle science and
it's a book that comes in a bottle and
it's 79 science experiments you can do
with a plastic soda pop bottle because
these things are cool they're like
little mini science labs and you can do
it in the bottle that the book comes in
or you can use other pop bottles and
it's great because again they're
springboards for things so some of the
science kits out there look so great and
then you open them up and they're like
oh my god a baggie of baking soda that's
it you know I like I have that at home
so that's why I don't like the kids as
much because I think it's more fun to
kind of say you got this stuff you've
got these cool chemicals in your in the
kitchen let's go and see what we got um
so uh I haven't found you know aside
from pop bottle science um necessarily
the kids just seemed all more flash to
me than then solid science um but having
said that there are some really cool
ones out there I think steve Spangler is
wonderful and I don't think he sells I
don't know the resells through amazon he
might only sell through his website he's
a science educator he educates science
teachers and he's a lot of his
experiments do have the special
chemicals but not all of them and it's
worth looking at and there's and some of
these experiments you need to have a
grown up with but they're pretty great I
think um I can't remember the names of
the of the of the tunnels of book but
steve Spangler is his name and he's
great yep I
curious about how you come up with your
projects I mean for instance just what
you have up there I mean are you doing
anything how can I prove this concept
yeah like what is here yeah a lot of it
is my kids are visual both of them are
really visual and I when I first started
teaching it actually goes back to them
so my first teaching job way back in the
days when they would take kids that have
behavior problems and they would take
them out of the mainstream classrooms
and put them all in one classroom and it
was the behavior problem classroom and
that was my first job so I had 25
behavior problem kids and and me you
know and it was remarkable these kids
were amazing they weren't there was a
couple that were scary whoa I don't even
know what happened to them but most of
them were fantastic most of them just
learned really differently one kid was a
visual learner and they said to me he he
cannot do a sequence he can't hear story
and then tell you what happened at the
beginning in the middle of the end he
cannot do sequencing this is a huge
problem but he was so bright I didn't
buy that I didn't buy that he couldn't
do it and so I noticed that he was
drawing it was in fourth grade he was
drawing and so I thought we're doing
these Japanese myth so I made a film
strip this really dating myself to
remember filmstrips you kidding so I
made a film strip of what happened in
this tale of euro she mataró and then
afterwards I said draw me a picture of
what happened at the beginning of the
story boom he whipped off this amazing
picture draw me picture about the middle
and he drew me a picture and roomy
picture at the end and then I said okay
can you give me a sentence of what's
going on in this picture and it did it's
like he could sequence he just couldn't
get to it just verbally he had to get
through it visually first so that was
such a huge and and there was a girl who
was musical and she was she was in sixth
grade they were it was fourth through
eighth grade too by the way this was a
pretty big span it was it was a really
eye-opening job and she couldn't get
they were weird they she was studying
the excretory system and she just was
you know she couldn't get it she
couldn't get a kidneys and the ureters
and urethra and she couldn't get the
ureters from the urethra and so I was
like okay but she she loved music so I
was like okay urethra there's one year
III because there's only one Aretha
Franklin and she's like ah and so
we sang a song about the you know the
tubes and um and then she got a test
back in low and shed label the parts and
she wrote urethra Franklin it was good
but it was a way to get in and that's
that's what all of this is it's just a
way to get it's a way to get that to
access the wonder of things right and so
with my kids you know their physical
then want to build stuff they want to
you know they want to squeeze things so
uh you know oftentimes even if I'm going
to have a conversation with them we'll
make slime and they'll play you know
that used to bug me at first I'm like
stop put that down but then I realized
after I I was learning about language
and how boys process language
differently than girls that this
actually helped them like doing
something with slime something physical
actually help them be able to verbally
process it's always so yeah so they come
they come up with what's around me how
can I show this you know and um and
that's what a lot of this is about to
there was one where Leo cut his hand Leo
hates needles and things like that he
was five I think he cut his hand and we
had to go and get stitches and he was
beside himself and I'm like no it'll be
interesting you'll be so cool and the
body heals itself and he was buying him
none of it and they put numbing stuff on
him and couldn't even feel it but he was
just he was freaking out we had I had
him on my lap they had five people one
holding an appendage right and he's
screaming and what they have ear plugs
no I've got that kid and he's screaming
and he's like yeah and he looks at the
doctor and he goes I hate this planet
wait whoa go big or go home and the
thing is it's cuz he couldn't not look
at it could not the idea for putting a
needle into his skin like oh my god so I
was like oh god there's tongue depressor
so I made this little thing with tape
and it was a like a little dragonfly and
and then I taped some pennies on him
look at center of gravity look hold your
finger out let's see if we can balance
it and so I was doing that over here and
while he was trying to balance it she
sewed him up you know and then he's like
yeah
she's like you still hate the planet
looks like no oh but yeah so it's what
you know finding stuff and and that's
something that nobody needs to have you
know nobody needs to know about the
string theory to do that it's just more
of a creative you know like what do I
have around me and that was a simple
distraction thing so well let's thank
you so much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
