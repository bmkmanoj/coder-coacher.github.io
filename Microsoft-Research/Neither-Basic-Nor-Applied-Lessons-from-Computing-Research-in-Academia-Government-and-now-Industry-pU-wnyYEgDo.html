for the last session of the evening for
the afternoon of the faculty summit and
it is a lead-up to our great demo fest
which will happen straight afterwards
and of course because it's demo fast it
is absolutely fitting that it should be
introduced by the head of the Redmond
lab who is piotre lead Peter Lee is
managing director and also a
distinguished scientist one of our top
people in redmond and before he came to
us he had a academic career he was head
of department of computer science at
Carnegie Mellon University and he his
area there was programming languages
compilers and so on many of you probably
know him from those days it between the
his sake Carnegie Mellon and here he was
also at DARPA he had a while in DARPA
where he was solving problems for them
where he was an officer managing officer
manager offers a manager but he tells me
that that's actually the equivalent of a
general so at this stage are black us
all to welcome a general doctor Peter
Lee so thanks you just it's um it's
really it's thrilled to be here I after
years of coming to the faculty summit as
a faculty member it's strange and
wonderful to be on the other side of
this and I'm getting a new fund
appreciation for how much goes into this
kind of event I thought a lot about what
to say here and what I wanted to do was
to talk about my recent journey I have
been on a journey over the last few
years going from completing the trifecta
going from academia to government and
now to industry and from that I've
gotten a little bit
of a different perspective my
perspectives about computer science
research and research in general have
changed a lot and I thought I would try
to express some of that and also to give
it in a way that would in at least an
underhanded way allow me to brag a
little bit about some of the great stuff
going on in in their lab and so let me
dive right in so it's a journey I'm
going to start a little bit
autobiographical here now I grew up in a
household I had a physics professor as a
father and a chemistry professor as a
mother you might imagine that computer
science definitely was not respectable
in that household and in fact you know
computer science especially in those
days and especially amongst physical
scientists was really viewed as a tool
not really an intellectual pursuit or an
academic profession on the same level as
the great physical sciences and so I
ended up going to college and majoring
in physics at the start and then later
when I realized that wasn't for me I
disappointed my parents and majored in
mathematics now of course all the time
and even in high school I was attracted
to computers into computer science and a
important thing happened to me as an
undergraduate which was I ran into the
work of the man you see picture here
Dana Scott and Dana as many of you know
was a very important computer scientist
is a very important computer scientist
and at Carnegie Mellon of course and
prior to that at Oxford had done some
very important work in developing the
foundations of the formal semantics of
programming languages and ideas like
domain theory and denotational semantics
along with collaborators like
Christopher strachey now I tried to
explain to people what this is all about
and II
computer scientists work in computer
science researchers today don't have a
very clear concept about this and so I
have a standard explanation for this
which is actually a textbook explanation
so if you pick up a standard textbook on
formal semantics you'll see this example
and so what is this about and what how
did I get introduced to computer science
this way well let's take this very
simple thought experiment we see here an
equation now all of his computer
scientists would see this and understand
this as a program immediately programmed
to compute factorials but as a
mathematician I didn't see this as a
program this is just a mathematical
equation in fact it's one that implies a
problem to solve namely to solve for the
unknown F here and so there is nothing
at least to a prejudiced mathematician
as I was in the early days nothing
special about computer science exposed
by this piece of code and in fact it's
not too hard to see that if we solve
this by using God's factorial function
we can see that the equation holds and
everything is just fine now the early
work of Dana Scott's and others in the
time in the late 50s and early 60s
started to realize that there were
certain conundrums certain paradoxes
here so for example there are our other
equations that don't correspond to
sensible programs for which sensible
functions like the factorial function
still are solutions and in this kind of
situation suddenly at least in
mathematical the conventional
mathematical thinking of the day
something is very odd now and this
launched a long series of very important
research and ultimately in a touring
award and and many many other kinds of
follow-on pieces of work and for me this
was a revelation suddenly it was a
realization
that there was something much more to
computer science than would meet the eye
of a mathematician or a physicist or a
chemist that there is actually a new
intellectual pursuit something that
hadn't been contemplated before by man
and for me this was the top cover I
needed the reason that I needed to
finally fall into being a computer
science researcher and I ended up
switching and going to graduate school
for computer science now this informed
my research then after my PhD studies as
a young assistant professor and for me
this is a kind of research that is just
achingly beautiful just has this
crystalline structure and if this isn't
the right way to think about computer
programs then that's a cruel hoax played
by God or somebody to just give us such
beautiful things and not have this be
the right way to think and this was
really something to shape my early
research at carnegie mellon of course
this is also as many of you I'm sure
have experienced in your own careers
when you are really committed to
foundational research in computer
science you sometimes have a hard time
convincing colleagues or funding
agencies or review panels that what
you're doing is valuable and even for me
as a young professor sometimes it was
hard for people to understand the value
of doing this kind of research and so
one of the themes that i'll be
presenting here today is the value of
fundamental research in computer science
and the fact that over and over again
since we're dealing with man-made
artifacts over and over again these
fundamental ideas end up down the line
having tremendous practical impact and
in fact today of course we now know
completely well just how important some
of those fundamental ideas in formal
semantics of programming languages have
been in the development of tools that
are used every day now by millions of
developers around the world to help make
our software more secure and more
reliable
and this is something about the science
behind the demos and so we will be
introducing you all to the demo fest
after this in the demo fest has lots of
cool wizzy looking demos but we all have
to remember and remain committed to the
idea that behind those demos there is a
deep science that forms the foundation
of these things and that science is
absolutely essential and everything we
do is essentially to everything we do
here at Microsoft Research now as Judith
mentioned i went from academia i was
there for 22 years at carnegie mellon
eventually the head of computer science
and then i went and had a short stint as
an office director at DARPA and DARPA
even expanded my vision and my view
about computing research even further
and in DARPA there is really tremendous
diversity different kinds of research
where if we look at the lower left of
this diagram where there are research
programs there's a fundamentally mission
focused in other words research that is
designed to solve somebody's problem
today some crucial problem today too
moving to the lower right research that
has a component of sustaining our
capabilities constantly improving what
we're capable of doing constantly
ensuring that we as a society have the
capability to do certain things and
almost as an insurance policy in case it
should become needed at some point in
the future to continuing commitment to
blue sky theoretical research or even
systems or any research that is just
purely exploratory and also a very much
present very strongly present at DARPA
in the upper left is a kind of wacky
side of research where you're just
trying to do something very inventive a
new in the attempt to disrupt or
surprise and this type of search for
disruptions
the short term that's a big part of
DARPA's mission to avoid technology
surprise kind of completes this picture
and so taking all of these experiences
together I arrived at a map for
computing research and if we view this
in two dimensions on the x-axis you go
from research activities or projects
that have expanded short-term hope or
expectation for short-term payoff and
then as you go out the x-axis to a
long-term kinds of activities activities
that may require some patience and then
on the y-axis you go from reactive
problems problems where somebody's
society or someone here in Microsoft and
the product group comes to us and says
we need help solve your problem to a
more open-ended search for truth and
beauty and in this space of computing
research we see if we divide these in
things in the quadrants a tremendous
diversity in the kinds of things that go
on in computer science and so we see
just as I've drawn from the DARPA and
Carnegie Mellon experiences
mission-focused sustaining research blue
sky research and disruptive research and
this quadrant diagram which actually is
not purely my invention but was inspired
not exactly in this form but inspired by
a person at DARPA named Peters echo who
is also a fairly famous and somewhat
notorious former Black header has been a
map that I use to understand are we
fully embracing the full diversity of
possibilities and computing research and
here at Microsoft Research to all of our
research groups and research areas I
asked the question are we making an
impact across all four quadrants are we
fully valuing and embracing the
possibilities in all four quadrants that
could be
research and so the journey through
academia to government to hear really if
you wanted to sum it up is summed up by
by this diagram and so for me I am
always hungry for things to brag about
in all four of these things now I show
this and link this back to the title of
this talk and neither basic nor applied
because when you are in a government
research agency or at the University
there's always talk about basic versus
applied research and that's the way that
my parents would talk as physicists and
chemists because in physics and
chemistry there is a real difference
between basic and applied research and
the real difference between basic
researchers and applied researchers my
claim is that in computing research this
distinction doesn't make any sense and I
believe any one of you would be hard
pressed to pigeonhole yourself as either
a basic researcher applied researcher
and so for all the demos you're about to
see and for all the things that you use
like search engines or connect devices
or any kind of smartphone or tablet for
all the applied things you see there by
and large the computer science that went
into these things had elements that you
would call either basic replied but
they're really possible to separate so
I'd like now to go around these four
quadrants and show some of you by using
examples from Microsoft Research what is
meant by mission focused sustaining blue
sky and disruptive research so let's
dive right in so I'm here now Microsoft
Research complete the trifecta all right
so let's start with mission focused so
if we look on this map we're in the
short time scale problems that we want
to solve where the solution is needed
now or where the solution would really
only make sense in the relatively short
term and in the reactive problem domain
meaning that these are problems that
someone comes to us with or can state
for us very clearly that needs be solved
and so how do we do that now we do a lot
of
mission focused research at Microsoft
Research one thing that craig mundie
alluded to this morning for example it's
a societal problem about in the
healthcare IT domain about readmissions
hospitals this is a very very big
problem that's pertinent to us right now
in fact it informs part of the big
budget debate in our country because one
thing that we now know is at very large
percentages of patients who have been
hospitalized are readmitted to the
hospital within three months after
discharge and oftentimes and in fact the
purpose of this paper that appeared in
the new england journal of medicine is
to show that sometimes even relatively
cheap interventions if we had known
ahead of time that patients were
susceptible to being readmitted even
relatively cheap interventions before
discharge could have prevented a large
number of these readmissions and so the
estimated cost of this problem is in the
many billions of dollars and so as Craig
described this morning this is an
example of a kind of mission focus
problem that we here at Microsoft
Research have devoted a lot of energy to
addressing but to get into more
technical detail beyond this predictive
analytics from healthcare IT let me
introduce Chris Burgess to come and talk
to you about some of the science behind
search quality in the Bing search engine
Chris ultra Peter great thank you so I'm
going to tell you about the algorithms
that being users to search order of the
search results and this is the task
we're trying to solve a typical query
might be learning to rank and I'm
particularly interested in the in the
second item that showed up the yahoo
learning to rank challenge which is the
challenge that took place last year it
was a public challenge and are using a
blind data set about a thousand teams
took part and surprise that many people
work on this stuff of which 312 were
serious and that they had two
submissions the system I'm going to tell
you about today won that competition and
the reason I mentioned that is to show
you that it's it's a competitive system
and it's entirely published everything
that we do is published the second
interesting thing that shows up is the
class of algorithms that we invented to
solve this problem called lambda rank
and before I describe that and we just
described the problem a little bit more
so how do people measure relevance they
have humans label the relevance of a
bunch of documents given a query and
then based on the rank of which the
documents appear and the labels they all
give you a measure and there are many
different measures I counted 15 at one
point so one of the things that lambda
rank has to solve is how to solve the
problem for any particular measure that
anybody wants to solve for and secondly
these measures are very discontinuous if
you change the scores a little bit the
ranking changes the measure changes by a
discrete amount they're not
differentiable so it's a hard problem
lambda rank was used by being beforehand
associated in London neural networks
today I'm going to tell you about the
same algorithm but in star city using
boost boosted trees another kind of
machine learning system which is 100
times faster than the neural Nets they
replace and this is essential for
increased experimentation which is
really where the new relevance comes
from allowing people to try ideas
quickly so let's just show you how
lambda rack is trained take a query 10 7
7.5 7.7 the end which is a Seattle radio
station and imagine that we have these
URLs human attached ratings or judgments
and let's suppose that we're in the
middle of training and the model has
come up with these scores so first we're
going to reorder the scores so it's not
doing too well right now it's putting
bad a badly relevant thing at the top
and a perfect lower down what we'd like
to do is somehow treat these URLs is
point masses and attach forces to them
so here we're going to do that we're
going to say there's a force pairwise
force between each pair of your nails
with different labels and this the goods
and the other good the bad knee
have a bigger force because the gap in
the score is larger and even bigger
force here because a perfect wants to go
up more and about wants to go down
that's a more egregious error and so
forth the accumulated forces on just the
bad I show here and the question is how
we actually compute these forces so
basically we take a smooth function a
cost function that penalizes that it's a
function of the model scores the current
model scores and it penalizes the
ranking so if you're to the left of this
that the penalties higher if the school
is different linearly and to the right
it goes to zero even if you have the
same score the student penalty pushing
these things apart and then we take that
cast and we multiply it by the change in
the metric you get by switching the two
guys and that's how lambda ranked solves
this problem being able to be able to
optimize any information retrieval
metric so that's the key and it gets
around the differentiability problem by
doing this after the sort so here I'm
actually computed the forces for this
particular example that you can see the
bad wants to go down on badly and the
perfect wants to go up a lot so negative
means come down and positive means go up
so how do we actually go ahead with this
I've again shown the same URLs with
their ratings on the left and the scores
I just showed you rated by ranked by
score and those are the forces we just
computed and what we're going to do is
we're going to take the member in the
middle of training we're going to figure
out how to change the scores so we're
going to add a regression tree which
takes all the forces attached to all the
RLS for all the queries in the training
set and that's a large number of items
and it makes a split based on the
features so as to minimize the variance
of the forces that go either way in the
leaf so every URL travels down this tree
winds up in a leaf arrange things so
that the variance in the leaves is
minimized so for example the red guy
that's great minimum small variance
they're all negative the gray guy at the
bottom that's also good so now we can
add a little bit of these forces
depending on where the URLs land to the
original score will do that now and then
re-order by score and the band is move
down one that's great we run it down the
perfect disturb where it is but it's
score has gone up so we're headed in the
right direction and the forces have
changed
so now we again model the new forces
with another regression tree and we
repeat this reorder new forces
regression tree build a buncha
regression trees that's how we rank but
I haven't told you how a split is
computed and this is the key I've put
here for other features that we use
today they're all integers we bend them
the circle is a node in the tree I've
just shown you and the red and the green
of forces that I want to model and the
loss is simply a squared loss it's the
loss of each for teach y minus the mean
for that the items that land in that
node and we want to choose a split and
to do that we have to go through all the
features every column here every value
compute the split and find which gives
the biggest increase in the I mean
decrease in the loss so the biggest gain
and that's expensive that's why training
these things is slow and that's what we
sped up so how do we speed that up well
if you look at these two losses and you
subtract them it turns out that the
minimizing the loss is equivalent to
maximizing this quantity where the sum
is over the forces that wound up on the
left leaf on the left and the size of
the number of points that one up there
and the number of guys aren't up in the
right leaf and the points that went up
there and that's expensive but in fact
you only need one linear scan of the
data to compute this if you form these
histograms so go through a future pick
pick a feature zip through it first of
all you have two bins is critical so you
only get a small number of values and
this works because the data is very
sparse and if it's not sparse its parson
the sensitive it takes a few values they
may not be 0 but it's fast in that sense
once you form this histograms computing
these sums is trivial and extremely fast
and you just sweep from left to right to
compute them so that's how fast drying
using blister trees became so much
faster than the than the neural nets and
I can stop there to give our people time
to talk so CI what so thank you Chris
that's great let me ask you a question
by the way I'm surprising Chris with me
so now this is operating on the scale of
the Bing search engine in fact this is
the fundamental training regime for
the research quality and Bank right and
so in what ways does that scale present
new challenges or surprises for you
there are two things that really matter
that is how fast it is to train and that
the key there is is just experimentation
experimentation orientation but looking
for another factor of 50 or so by going
to clusters and GPUs and so forth that
the the other big challenge is
essentially a cost and how fast you can
you can generate these results they have
to return in milliseconds so less than
hundred milliseconds so these two issues
and there are things you can do about
both of them so I hope that answers your
credit work thanks a lot x.x thanks a
lot Chris so so of course you know for
the public you it's hard to explain
something like fast rank but of course
in any demo that is based on a search
technology these things end up being
very important and the interesting
interplay here between wanting to solve
the mission of really accelerating the
training regimen for a large search
engine and that driving new computer
science ideas I think is really
marvelous now I'd like now to move from
the mission focused realm into the
sustaining realm and so these tend to be
problems that don't have the same kind
of time critical aspect to them but are
reactive nonetheless and so what are
what's an example of this well one thing
that we do here in Microsoft Research is
run a service called Microsoft
translator and so if you've used bing to
translate documents or use Microsoft
Office and use the the office translator
or the bing toolbar to translate a web
page you've used Microsoft translator
and as this graph shows the the numbers
unfortunately our proprietary by the
very large number of translation
requests per day really in the tens of
millions are served by by this
translation service now this involves
several dozen languages
natural languages and that is a realm
that requires tremendous amount of
research in order to have continuous
improvement as well as the supporting
context together as much training data
as possible and to constantly drive new
breakthroughs in machine translation and
so this is an example of kind of
sustaining research where every day we
have to make good progress in order to
provide as much value as possible for
all of our users as well as other
researchers but to get into a little bit
more technical detail I'd like to invite
David molnar to the stage to tell you
about white box buzzing David hey thank
you very much Peter thanks so well the
problem we're talking about today is
serve a classic problem for Microsoft
which is that we support hundreds of
different file formats across all
Microsoft products every time some
external to the company finds a bug in
one of those formats that lets a
malformed file take over your computer
it costs Microsoft at least a million
dollars and it costs you even more in
the amount of pain and effort quite
upgrade your systems we want to stop
this and to stop this we have a thing we
call the security development life cycle
which mandates testing for these bugs
before any code hits customers hands
unfortunately the most common kind of
random testing can't catch the kind of
bug you see on the slide where a very
specific relationship has the whole
between variables in order for something
to go wrong our approach takes makes use
of state-of-the-art constraint solving
technologies we have Microsoft Research
combined of industrial-strength binary
analysis and what that lets us do is it
lets us watch programs as they execute
on initial input we see exactly what
predicates they evaluate on that input
and we use is to come up with new
constraints that once solved come up
with new test cases which then allow us
to explore new parts of your program and
so Peter talked about sort of
foundational long-standing research mean
this idea of being able to write down a
simple logic formula and determine if
it's true or not and if
not to find a counterexample this dates
back to Hilbert but we now have one of
the best solvers in the entire world and
I can show at you now in action on a
real program so we could switch to the
demo pling yes thank you so what you
have here is you have a little program
it compete it compares the input bytes
to be ad ! and if this counter goes
before it crashes that's nice we're
going to run it on the initial input
good and we're going to see what happens
so we type go sage and what's happening
is right now sage is executing the
program on this initial input and it's
computing something it looks a little
bit like this so this is the output of
sage it's looking at the trace of
execution and it's saying ah i see that
there's some kind of jump so i'm going
to add a new constraint it then
translates a constrained into an
internal language and later on it
translates that into a sequence of
constraints for z 3 which is the
constraint solver developed microsoft
research in this particular case we can
actually solve the constraints and we
can solve them very very quickly and we
come to a new test case and in fact we
even have the ability to go look at the
trace itself using wind EDG which is a
debugging facility in microsoft windows
and we can actually time travel and say
that's the exact jump that corresponds
to this constraint the corresponds to
this part of the program and what this
all adds up to is if you take a look at
this results directory after a while we
end up sort of seeing that we have new
test cases which are being created which
end up creating new parts of the program
and you can see it's putting dad and
booed and all that good stuff and so
eventually we end up creating the test
case bad which causes the program to
crash despite having told our program
sage nothing about this test all it's
done is watch the actual inputs and use
it to create new test cases now this is
something that's a small test case we
actually around hundreds of different
machines and we have a system called
seguin which keeps track of data from
ever
a single run so every single time we run
we get data about what's happened and
where it's gone we can keep track of how
it was run all the test cases and we
keep track of statistics which I'll talk
about in a minute or so that give us
examples of where we're doing things
right and where we're doing things wrong
so if we could switch back to the slides
please thank you so the impact of this
is that we've changed the way security
testing is done at Microsoft this slide
shows you the relative number of bugs
found in file fuzzing by the windows
experience team during windows 7 so
there's hundreds of file reading parsers
and one-third of all the bugs were found
by sage these are bugs that were missed
by static analysis missed by white box
fuzzing missed by human code review and
we're now running every Windows 8
milestone we've ongoing engagements in
the office and the microsoft security
engineering center and because of this
partnership and this value we provide
we've been able to run for over two
hundred machine years and solve over a
billion constraints something we could
not have done without the partnership of
our fellows in the product groups inside
Microsoft but from a research
perspective what this does is it lets us
ask questions that previously we could
not answer because we just didn't have
the data for example if we have several
hundred programs all running on Windows
we can now tell you how much sharing
they have in common and this motivates
research in how to reuse parts of our
symbolic execution whenever we see
different programs using the same piece
of functionality and then we look at the
solver we now know that 90.1 eight
percent of all constraints are solved in
10 0.1 seconds or less and yet we know
that the solving time still dominates as
a group because there are millions and
millions of constraints and this gives
us direct application to helping our
colleagues in the XIII world who then
helped all tools inside Microsoft that
use III we build a virtuous cycle that
keeps ahead of the competition by
answering questions that we could not
have answered without this scale and so
the clothes just like the bank there's a
large list of contributors but this is
the kind of research why I came to
Microsoft to do this is the kind of
thing where we have a deeply
intellectually interesting problem of
how do we look at the
actual artifact of computer programs in
the large and we also have a deeply
interesting practical application which
is protecting Microsoft customers and
this is the kind of thing that I love
doing here at Microsoft thank you so
thanks David that was great are you able
to tell us of all the applications and
systems that the sage gets run on what
tends to show up the most bugs uh there
are certain parts of the careful what
you say yeah there are certain parts of
display subsystems which are being
actively worked on okay to be a little
bit more serious one thing I know about
this area of research in Microsoft is
that it's very very deeply engaged with
the academic community um can you say
anything about what's been important
about about that yeah I'd be happy to so
in terms of the academic community
belong list of publications on different
aspects of the symbolic execution but we
also there are a number of groups inside
Microsoft particularly dawn songs or
David Bromley's Dawn's at Berkeley and
David's at Carnegie Mellon of course who
are actively working this so in fact we
were just at a summer school at MIT
dedicated to applications of solvers
like XIII and we had several groups
talking about this kind of symbolic
execution scale so we're able to show
show them the data we had that we can
show and they able to talk to us about
their ideas and we hope we can you know
make our stuff better from that kind of
engagement yeah it's great that we give
XIII out to so many people yes it is
great thanks what I do thank you very
much thank you right alright so that's
the sustaining area and and so let's
continue to move around so if as we move
out to kind of this open-ended long term
area this is where I have a lot of
affection and I don't think it takes too
much explanation here I do want to point
out that it's oftentimes the case that
people think equate blue sky or this
quadrant with theory research and that's
really not the case we're not talking
about Theory we're really talking about
really trying to push the boundaries of
human experience in human knowledge and
try to understand something new and so
what are some examples well one example
that goes on at microsoft research is in
quantum computing and in fact in quantum
here at microsoft we take taking a
fairly radical approach in the work
funded on Mike Friedman's research on
topological quantum systems or
topological quantum computing tqc and so
here were very very interested in
understanding whether there are
practical physical realizations of
so-called topological quantum devices
and if so that would potentially drive
different practical pathways to larger
scale quantum machines and so this is
one example that is really trying to
understand whether there's a new regime
in quantum computing and we take a
fairly balanced approach looking at both
the physics and computer science as well
as the engineering of these systems but
enough about that to get into a little
more detail in a specific example for
something really completely different
let me ask Nikolai Tillman to come here
and tell you about programming on the
phone Nick why the world is changing the
way how the in Texas computing devices
is changing so now more smartphones
devices like this are being sold and
traditional PCs and laptops combined
what does it mean how do we use
computing devices what are we doing with
our smartphones we surf the internet we
play games we read our emails what are
we not doing with them in our tithing
new programs on them so they are
incredibly powerful devices the
smartphone is much more powerful than
the first computer I ever had so my
first computer was a big clunky machine
very slow horrible resolution and yet
when I powered it on it greeted me with
a basic comp that is basically how I got
interested in computer science and did
my first baby steps in programming and
now the whole environment is
around what people get in their hands at
first it's it's a closed end user device
just for consumption so we were asking
ourselves the question can be changed it
can we turn this form factor into a
programming development environment what
I'm showing you now is an application
developed for windows phone 7 it's
available available on the market place
so you can hide out yourself when I
power it up what you see here is a list
of scripts that are not just
applications that you can run but they
actually in source code you can view the
code you can change it so let's write a
script together so click the add script
button and I can give it a name okay and
now i'm in a view they are i see
different actions they're basically like
functions of your programming language
let's add a new function and a function
in action basically consists of
statements and you will see in a moment
that it's very familiar to what you know
so let's edit this let's do an image
search and display images that I find on
the web so I can go in and edit this
statement instead of doing nothing I
want to do an image search now we are in
a calculator view which lets us edit
expressions and what we're going to do
is search on the web so here I can
select web and then using statistic
analysis on existing scripts that people
have written we know that these are the
most common actions that people want to
do on the web so let's do an image
search which appears in the list and now
after enter string entering text is
usually the most difficult aspect in all
other places we really made sure that
it's easy to hit all the buttons with a
big sum now after we move bit more
careful let's search for microsoft and
let's see if i can know it miss rate
microsoft okay let's go back so this
delivers has a list of pictures and i
want to do something with them so need
to store them in a local barber i can do
that by pressing this orange bar so now
we introduce the low cover wasn't much
typing let's go back to our list of
statements
I've know a list of image links no one
to display them so here in this
statement level i can add statements in
a way that is structured I cannot make
mistakes that's a statement level so i
can only choose know from a set of
statements that make sense here and i
want to iterate over all the links we
automatically synthesized so they will
link that we want to iterate over and
then whatever I want to do with the link
i want to show it and we are living in
the Facebook edge so we call it posting
to the wall each script has of all
output it's an interactive version of
the console so there is little script a
custom search i just put together let's
run it so now it's going to Bing and
it's getting images and they short show
up shortly yeah so here for number of
images that I get from being for
Microsoft I could show you more how to
refine this program adding if statements
what I want to show you a different
program so we can't leave her high
school student as an intern and in just
one day he wrote a game government it so
this game consists of more than one
action so I was just writing one now but
this one has a few more and i will show
you the code in a moment but gets just
on it so i press the play button and
what you see now is a yellow guy who is
moving around according to how I holds
the phone so this is using the
accelerometer which is measuring for so
and general gravity if I don't
accelerate the phone and I'm currently
running away from the bad guys and know
they got me now I go to score and the
scores automatically sent up to our
server maybe maintain a positive high
scores it's very easy to program so
let's look at the code what does it
involve so it involves creating a board
which is the grid you just sort of
points that my yellow figure was eating
so how do we create a board where
there's a function create bot and then
you see there's actually a number of
instructions in here but it's basically
two pages of code to set up the bar it's
not too much and here you see that a
matrix is being bit of points those are
the dots that my
eating so there's a loop XY that creates
ellipses and position them all across
the screen and then later end the code
an update board the code query see
accelerometer acceleration quick here
gets the count basically gravity
coordinate the vector and it applies it
as a speed vector to my figure that is
equal to p.m. and then it iterates over
all the enemies and makes a move towards
this PM figure so this again is
basically one page of code and a high
school intern audit ok they said I go
back to the slides so we are very
excited about this project but you don't
have to trust us it's out there on the
market place and it's actually one it's
in the top 1% of more than 20,000
applications for the windows phone so
people really like it many people
probably started to learn programming in
this way now so we have pretty good
ratings we believe that this is a great
tool for teaching because it's a really
engaging experience so its programming
on the most personal computing device
that the students have and they can
programmatically excess all the songs in
their pictures I didn't shows it but
basically in a loop you can iterate over
everything that's stored on your device
so instead of writing abstract
algorithms students can all sort their
songs or let's say pictures bounce
around so what look very simply when I
was doing it was in fact a lot of
research trying to figure out what
language and what editora is really
amenable to this new form factor of a
touchscreen so in addition to the
language and editor is also important
that all the new sends us and access to
the web has made available as a
first-class citizens so it's not just an
edit library on top of a legacy language
but all of these new elements of a
smartphone are made available in a very
easy way if you want to see more the
effort
demo all that the demo fest thank you so
I have to ask do you use your left thumb
where you'll write them to do your
programming I'm right-handed so i use my
vibes numpy yeah so more seriously just
as someone who worried a lot about
computer security as a when I was a
Carnegie Mellon are you worried that
people might start making hacks and
viruses on the phone yeah yeah but in a
future version via will enable sharing
of scripts so you could run escape your
clan board and maybe of a malicious
friend and then it would send your
contact information to facebook maybe
you don't want it so we are here in a
unique position that we are designing a
new language at a very high level so we
want to use automatic information flow
analysis to ahead of time figure out
what this program might do and put the
user into the power to decide whether he
really wants to run the script or not
what a great thing and just imagine all
of the people who have as their only
computer in large or a smartphone yeah
everyone needs a phone everyone does
have one of these great thank you a lot
thank you thank you so programming on
the phone I have to say that struck me
as a pretty blue sky idea but in fact as
we see smartphones at this scale
starting to really invade many parts of
the developing world the possibilities
are really fantastic okay so now we're
down to our last quadrant here and
people who have come to know me here
microsoft research now now that i have a
special place in my heart for the upper
left quadrant this is the so-called
disruptive quadrant where roughly
speaking based on our understanding of
the world today you what can be done
that is surprising or disruptive you
know how can we change the rules of
whatever game that we're playing and
this is something that i think many of
us are always
particularly tickled by and that's true
and I think particularly true in
computing research and what better
example of this then the recent
excitement and the involvement of
Microsoft Research in helping the
development of the Kinect game
controller now one thing that of course
when you have a connect that's hard for
the public to understand is that
underneath the Kinect is decades of
fundamental computer science computer
engineering research certainly much more
than a decade here at microfiche again
the research here of course founded on
research in the academic community that
was even decades older than that and so
to give you a little bit of glimpse of
that I'd like to ask Avant a chef who
really developed the technology behind
the audio array of connect to come here
and tell you a bit about it Vaughn thank
you thank you good afternoon before to
start to talk about the technologies in
connect the first thing we did is
actually to figure out who are our
enemies what are the factors we have to
overcome so to make the audio part to
produce enough good sound quality for
speech recognition in telecommunication
and in this particular scenario sitting
in your media room it happened to be the
sound from the loudspeakers because in
all gamers they tend to listen to
extremely loud sound sound on levels
which you can barely hear your own
thoughts the second factor our group of
factors were sounds we don't know about
this is the room noise which when a
person speaks at three three and half
meters distance is pretty much
comparable as energy with the noise or
with the noise over the level of a human
voice so add three three and half meters
we have a zero DB signal-to-noise ratio
and of course this is the reverberation
we sit in a room and we speak but only a
small portion of the individual reaches
the microphones is so called direct path
from our mouth to the mic
for a lot of the energy canes from
reflections from the ceiling from the
floor from from the walls and this is
what smears the future of the speech
signal makes it less understandable
makes the work of the speech recognizer
more difficult and of course we have to
deal with enormous dynamic range of loud
from loudspeakers the sound from the
loudspeakers to a soft voice of a hue of
a kid for example at 4 meters but still
in june 2009 when the work on assembling
that connect audio processing pipeline
started we in microsoft research already
had all of those technologies developed
published patent it so for one half here
is the problem which we have to work on
is to make those technologies to work
well together to assemble that
end-to-end audio processing pipeline to
make each of the blocks to work better
than what the state of the artists and
to create depth critical mass of
technologies that explosive mixture
which late will became so successful
project as connect to us so this is the
block diagram of the audio processing
pipeline in connect the first several
blocks calibration in multi-channel
acoustic echo cancellation in general
are designed to remove the sound from
the loudspeakers as much as we can
follows the beamformer and the sound
source localizer which are pretty much
the microphone array processing and a
chain of additional speech enhancement
blocks so now we are going to go in each
of those quadrants and to go in the deep
details of the signal processing
algorithms inside I am just kidding
happen happen at that for solving this
particular problem critical role played
two of the blocks the multi-channel
acoustic echo cancellation and the
microphone array processing and i'm
going to give you just a brief
information about only those stone so
acoustic echo cancellation is one of the
oldest signal processing algorithms it
is part of every single speaker for this
is the adaptive filter which estimates
how much of the energy from the
loudspeaker goes to the microphone so we
can subtract it from the microphone
signal and half on the output just the
local voice unfortunately once we start
to use the same approach with two
channels stereo or five channels around
sound the problems arise because that
those two or five channels are highly
correlated and this leads to ill
condition it matrices and are extremely
difficult solutions multiple solutions
and the system tries to reckon which
constantly and has a reduced performance
and this is a stereo acoustic echo
cancellation is a long-standing research
problem what we did in connect is based
on a simple logic because you have
multiple solutions because we have one
microphone channel one equation and to
transfer functions to estimate from the
left and the right loudspeaker so
obviously one when you have one equation
we have to have one and no which means
one adaptive filter and then the normal
approach is to see ok if we can have one
adaptive filter what will be the mixing
matrix how we can estimate which portion
of the left rights are left surrounds or
rides around in central speaker goes to
the microphones and for this we have the
famous calibration phase which consists
of playing of sounds like this it sounds
like a music but actually is a highly
sophisticated signal which contains
every single frequency between 200 and
7500 shells this allows
to estimate the filters the mixing
matrix and in real time just to run one
adaptive filter to compensate for opened
or closed or somebody people move in
front of the device and the second
processing block is the microphone a
processor so the logic here is simple
one microphone captures a lot of noise
and reverberation if you can have more
than one microphone and there for in the
connect device if we have a noticeable
position it right here underneath the
device so therefore microphones
directional microphones listening
forward and the we will utilize the fact
that the sound wave reaches the device
in the microphones in a different order
if someone speaks from this direction
the sound wave will reach the
microphones in this order on the other
direction it will reach in a different
order as a result as a result our sound
capturing device has a sense of
direction so we can focus on a given
sound source and suppress the sounds
coming from other direction this process
is called be forming and it pretty much
at a special selectivity in the upper
right corner you can see the directivity
pattern of our microphone array when it
is focusing 20 degree so this is the
frequency and this is the direction and
we can see that the device actually can
focus quite well towards the desired
sound source and in connect case because
we so called adaptive being former we
can do even more when there is one sound
source an additional person talking
interfering sound source the device can
press actively a note or that direction
which is the chart on the right lower
corner so here you can see that we have
our sound source around here 26 degrees
and competing sound source at minus-9
degrees so the device plays it and
motors the undesired sound source and we
can receive a better sound from the
desired sounds of
several quick demos the first one will
be how to connect device the sound
source localization okay one two three
testing so you can see that the device
can says 1 2 3 testing testing 123
testing so the device can do
localization and follow the sound source
in the same way as when they do movie
shots and there is a sound operator with
those long directional microphones and
pointing the microphone tour towards the
various artists so connect devices this
completely automatically using the sound
source localization and beamforming
techniques the second demo consists of
parallel recording I with the Kinect
device end with the microphone in my
laptop for this with your permission
about rates which of my microphone for a
moment one two three testing testing and
now we're going to see those two signals
from a single microphone and from the
microphone array we want to drink this
thing they stink so this is the single
microphone one two three testing testing
so first even in this quiet room you can
see that there is a substantial amount
substantial amount of noise which we
cannot hear because of the two element
microphone array we have and because of
the hundred billion neurons processor we
have between them and once we start to
do the system end-to-end my last demo it
will show what happens in real
conditions so we have a gaming room with
quite loud sound and a local person
speaking commands so this is what the
microphones here
and after processing so the quality is
not perfect but it is sufficient for
speech recognition I did this demo you
once with calibrated loudspeakers when
the loudness in the room was actual
loudness of 85 DB sound pressure level
and I was strongly advised not to do
this anymore so in conclusion in
conclusion in connect we have three
things which we haven't seen at least
well in products outside out there the
first is this is the only product in the
world with surround sound echo
cancellation which is a scenario
enabling technology the second we do
hands-free sound capturing we don't have
to wear a close talk microphone or any
kind of headset and the thirties this is
the first open microphone recognition
system the speech recognizer is enough
reliable so we don't have to have a
button to signal the computer i'm
talking to it is the keyword xbox does
this for us and at the end why we're
doing this because connect is nothing
else but same for human machine
interface it just adds two more colors
to the palette of the user interface
designers it's a gesture and speech and
I recent user studies with our beta
users show it that fifty-four percent of
the users prefer voice modality when
they deal with media for selection and
for controlling their media player in
their media rooms and I would like to
say that this is just the beginning of a
nice and interesting journey thank
so give on really amazing stuff so when
a product group like xbox comes and says
we want to be able to do clear voice
recognition and and and hear clearly in
the noisy room in a arbitrary living
room from a distance what's your first
thought you've had a long history of
academic research publishing in the area
but what happens when someone comes to
you and ask you to work on something
like this so for me this happen it in
mine 2009 when architect from xbox came
and say even we need a couple of your
technologies for a product you don't
know about but we are trying to put
together and then pretty much we started
to put the technologies together so you
can just run away your ID ok very the
goddess of the fact that I was warned
that this is not possible thank you
thank you thank you so we're almost out
of time but I hope you can see that at
least to my mind what we do here in
computer science and I could have told a
similar story like this at Carnegie
Mellon or DARPA I suspected any of your
institutions and organizations there's
something special about computing
research that it blends the foundational
and the applied the near term in the
short term the same person is having a
string of 12 years of seminal papers
proving fundamental theorems and signal
processing and at the same time engaged
in helping deliver a key part of
something like connect and in all of
these stories we tried to show you the
same thing I think it's something that's
unique really to computing research and
we should all feel really lucky to be a
part of this field and so to sum up
computing research I think has
incredible diversity the quadrants are
really just my way of trying to express
that diversity but that is a wonderful
thing that is important for us all I
think to embrace and don't
all into the trap of thinking that some
people are basic some people are applied
what is important in computing is that
just about any practicing computing
researcher really does it all I know you
all do and so do we and as you go to the
demo fest and see what goes on there ask
about the signs behind the demo I think
you'll find it fascinating so thank you
very much I really appreciated all of
your attention ok I have been told that
we are out of time for questions and so
let me promise that all four speakers
and I will be in the demo fest and so
we'll be happy to talk to any of you
through the demos ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
