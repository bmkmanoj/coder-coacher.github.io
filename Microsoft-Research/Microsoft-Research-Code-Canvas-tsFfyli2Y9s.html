microsoft visual studio that we are
prototyping at microsoft research with
code canvas all of the projects
documents are placed side-by-side on a
single design surface the screen
currently shows a portion of a Tetris
game I'm working on we can see a dialog
box sitting next to a code file written
in C sharp the code implements a class
called enter name stored in a file
called enter named CS code canvases
presentation of this class hides a lot
of the boilerplate code like the using
statements and namespace declaration and
instead concentrates on the important
content namely the classes members this
is just a view of the class the
underlying file still contains the
boilerplate code this is not just a
picture of the project both the dialog
box and the code file are presented
using visual studios standard editors so
for example I can add a button to the
dialog box I can also edit the code file
using the standard features such as
intellisense by default all of the
classes members are shown together in a
single editor however if I want I can
break up the class into fragments that I
find more meaningful if I place the text
cursor inside a method name code canvas
provides a drag handle around the method
I can then use direct manipulation to
place the method where I like code
canvas automatically prevents the
fragments from overlapping one another
it also automatically resizes the boxes
representing both the class and the file
to preserve the containment
relationships again these fragments are
just a view of the underlying code file
as I edit the code code canvas
automatically resizes the fragments to
grow or shrink them so that all the
content is shown if necessary code
canvas moves other fragments to make
room for new content because of this
there are no scroll bars anywhere in
code canvas all content is always shown
in full on the design surface instead of
scrolling code canvas uses panning and
zooming for navigation I can drag the
background to pan the canvas back and
forth
I can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and
out now that I've zoomed out we can see
the entire project in fact we like to
think of code canvas as providing a map
of the project this map reflects both
the project's content and its structure
for example we can see that this project
is organized into three directories the
directory figures shown in blue contains
the glass figure and at seven subclasses
this directory lives inside the
directory Tetris controls shown in green
this directory contains several classes
and user interface designs finally the
topmost directory Tetris shown in brown
contains one additional class code
canvas uses a technique called semantic
zoom to show as much useful content as
it can at all levels of zoom at this
level of zoom the code is too small to
read so code canvas pops up labels that
show the names of the members with icons
to distinguish fields methods and events
notice that as i zoom in and out code
canvas keeps the labels at the same
readable text size it crops labels to
prevent unreadable overlaps also notice
that there's a pecking order among the
labels as a fragment gets smaller code
canvas compresses the labels of private
members first since those tend to be
less important this map visualization is
organized into a series of layers
showing different types of information
we can turn these layers on and off
individually for example if I'm not
interested in how the project is stored
on disk I can switch off the file and
folder layers this makes the individual
classes much easier to see since these
layers are useful for staying oriented
I'll switch them back on as another
example code canvas also provides an
annotation layer where I can place
sticky notes on top of the code for
example I previously took screen
snapshots of the seven types of Tetris
figures and added them in sticky notes
next to the classes that implement them
these provide visual landmarks that help
me quickly locate the different figures
they also serve as documentation
for someone who doesn't know the code
there are additional layers that are
designed to answer different types of
questions about the code for example
let's say I want to know how the game
keeps track of the player score so I do
a text search for the word score Visual
Studio pops up the usual tool window
with all the search results this is
useful for seeing all the results
together in one place but I'm more
interested in what parts of the code
contain these results for this code
canvas has a search results layer that
uses these yellow boxes to show where
the search results occur in the code if
I click on a search result code canvas
zooms in on that part of the code notice
that even though I zoomed in code canvas
kept all the search results on screen if
a search result occurs in a file that's
currently off-screen code canvas shows
it as I semi-transparent ghost a ghost
sticks to the edge of the screen in the
direction of the file that contains the
search result if I click on a ghost the
screen pans over to where the search
result is located these ghosts allow me
to continue to see all the search
results as I navigate around and give me
a general sense of which direction
contains the most search results another
useful layer shows the debugger call
stack to see it let's run this Tetris
game now I'll start a new game after the
game starts the debugger hits a
breakpoint the statement containing the
breakpoint is shown large and in red
this is another example of semantic zoom
this layer also shows a series of curved
arrows to indicate the flow of execution
I can use the slider at the top of the
layer to see the execution in order the
execution starts in Maine then goes to
the callback for the new game menu item
then to an it new game and so on until
we see it create a lefty figure because
of code canvases layers I can look at
the call stack and my search results at
the same time this makes it easy to
compare information from different
sources for example I can see that so
far in our execution the only executed
code that deals with scores is this
initialization
of the score 2-0 while this map provides
a handy overview of the entire project
this may be more detailed than I want
for a given task for example since I'm
using the debugger I really want to
concentrate on the current call stack to
do this I can create what we call a
filtered canvas a filtered canvas
contains just those parts of the code
that are involved in a given layer in
this case the call stack layer this new
filtered canvas shows only those
fragments that are on the current call
stack notice that code canvas
automatically pulled these fragments
closer together to make good use of the
screen but kept the fragments in the
same relative spatial positions this
helps keep me oriented in this new view
code canvas allows me to create any
number of canvases with a tab for each
one to switch tasks I switch tabs all
canvases are automatically saved the
next time I start visual studio I can
reopen my previous canvases this
persistence is intended to help
programmers deal with interruption and
multitasking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
