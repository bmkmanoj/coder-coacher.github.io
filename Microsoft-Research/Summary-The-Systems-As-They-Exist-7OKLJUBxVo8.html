hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
alright so what we'll do while people I
guess make their way back from lunch in
case you forgot what happened so far
we'll just very quickly run through some
of the key points and then hand it over
to Leon for the panel so so we saw live
linear which is project sort of
specializing around linear
classification and regression we saw the
poll Hobbit which is very much built
around online linear learning but
provides a whole bunch of other feature
manipulations and reductions for other
problems torches I would say much more
deep learning centric but the scripting
and interpreter do provide it a lot of
other flexibility and there's definitely
a wide range of packages Tiana again is
more deep learning centric but the
Python library actually makes it fair
bit more flexible once more I think
shogun is probably maybe the most
general purpose tool kit type feel of
all the things we discussed it was
probably mostly built around kernel
methods but now provides several other
functionalities and hooks and Stan comes
more from the statistical and
probabilistic modeling point of view and
probably sampling is the strongest suit
although like it was discussed also lbf
JS based optimization is implemented as
well so some quick properties of the
projects most of the projects are it
seems based on ps3 which is the more I
guess friendly license Shogun I think is
the only one based entirely on GPL and
with Stan I think it's a bit of a mixed
some of their yeah so with standard core
is I think implemented with BSD license
but then some of the interfaces that
people have done are done under GPL so
it's a it's a bit tricky I think C++
still seems to remain the popular
language of choice
except for the deep learning folks it
would seem your your your backends are
still yeah so curious to know about why
people chose individual licenses
but then we've done there some company
that does oh is it really true we can do
that thang votes for VW the reason why
is BST because it was a yeah who
released the first version the lawyer
said let's use via steam there's like
okay right so so shogun is kind of this
children understand fgp oh we don't have
a representative from either back from
lunch yet yeah why's it though yeah all
right um i think that's true that's true
dairy company friendly right yeah yes
people don't want to be too friendly to
companies so i think Patti did was
eventually incorrectly attacks differs
from the BSD in that some sort of we
want Patinkin see you free on septicemic
code so it is really something I need to
empty through a matching fire set now
use the SD
I know that some open source projects at
Microsoft are using apache license and I
know what would still one that works
issue with the Duke who'd ya feel like
java stuff hmm I think all of spark is
also under Apache ok Billy another job
people prefer that apache license what's
the main difference the main difference
for the Apache License BST is do
whatever you want yeah and apache is
still a Kiva listeners do what everyone
and we promise we won't see you Oh for
the ego is there's a bit more protection
a little bit yeah if you use my software
you can't sue me if you see me you can
continue to use mashable so give some
superb writer and Liars
but then there's a super dictionary
I mention it was different when training
was that it went the other way around it
if if I'm apache license and I'm
promising that if you use my software I
won't sue you for violating a hat so you
can't sue me i think is already part of
goose decoys
hmm
okay in terms of platforms I mean by and
large they seem to be pretty friendly
overall think you unix Windows and Mac
are mostly supported for all of them
except torsion not sure whether it works
with Windows or not but I guess so a
subset of packages or most packages
what's the okay and I used to have piano
windows without quotes but then what you
said during the top made it sound more
like it kind of works so i put the
course there I see
exactly the all right and the thing we
can look at is whether things work only
on one machine or can they work in more
parallel settings so lib linear C
dimension has some cluster support now
works within MPI and spark I learned
just this morning from the website VW
provides support for multi-core and
cluster through certain work basically
in my produced type environments as well
as in multi-core settings torch again
works multi-quote fruit threading on
cluster and as well as provides a lot of
GPU support Tiana again has good GPU
support provides I think the the linear
algebra operations can be made
multi-core through through glass
essentially we don't have a shogun
representative there the website had
something about parallel but but then i
could not actually find anything about
how it works so i'm not sure that it
actually works or not and Stan I don't
think has support for parallel but again
we don't have a representative to
dispute that claim a lot of these things
do provide several alternative
interfaces live Linear's probably
leading in the number of interfaces that
people have implemented so that probably
speak for how long things have been
around also no more than anything else
combined with Libous via sorry yeah so I
think 11 kind of amazing property is
that they're probably multiple so we
know that Shogun interfaces live linear
torch does and prop
physical abilities like a very small pig
used by Shogun in the torch yeah yeah so
it's reasonable that why it is so many
yeah it is used to be close by so with a
blue is so we also have long-range
dependencies it seems that's even better
and then a apart from that it seems
mostly everybody is definitely providing
command line support there is almost
always some some degree of library
functionality that is being implemented
at least in the primary language of the
project and then other interfaces may or
may not of more varied across there are
different projects ok so the eye yeah
python definitely stands out is my
experience do you think a lot of people
who are doing data stuff or drinking by
though right
I tried the lab it's a fun factor of
three I said I mean they're so spread to
the slower compared to running it just
went in my life but did you try the new
one the helmet as a web app lapper is
just it just calls this me online and
use it through a bi-directional the new
VW have where the current release if VW
has a native python library which
hopefully will be pastor because you're
not passing things or pipes hmm
correction we use is just two fours
right yep it's a big package so there's
this two things you can do if you are
just what you want to do multi-core with
more than two goals you can use the
spanning tree which is kind of heavy
weight because you have to manually cut
up your data set which is done for you
out of my I do exciting but not so
automatically the other thing that you
can do is you can fire things up there
Damon
and the way that Damon works is it has
much to child processes you can talk
each of them and it's intern exams to
each of them all the steps at the voice
yeah sure there yeah so they should
share the weight
alright so good thing is all the
projects exist on github so I was able
to at least dig up some statistics about
the developer base and I think for me
probably the most interesting one to
start from was how long the projects
have existed although this might be
inaccurate because you might have
started out on get later than the actual
did but lib linear seems like has been
around since 2007 and then shogun is the
oldest one according to github actually
and the other things are relatively more
recent so and that and that yeah yeah so
I I was pretty sure that the tour sheer
was exactly due to some such user base
my experience is this no so this is this
is at best representation of the
developer base and not the user base at
all right so and and you know we see
that definitely a lot of the projects
are getting fair number of contributors
and so so i guess thats that's good that
means at least a lot of these projects
really are sort of operating in a more
open source software mode so i stand
probably be is the encouraging oh yeah
it's partly from the license in our so
ours GPL so the our interfaces the
linked are you at least there's no point
vsd because the whole thing has to be
GPL for Python it's because the guy you
eventually wrote it wider GPL rather
than bsd do you prefer we just usually I
think one other thing that's kind of
interesting to look at is where where
the money comes from so I think live
linear probably has been developed
mostly by cjs funding from you know from
so so that's pretty amazing VW had
corporate backers with John being at
Microsoft and Yahoo at least and Tosh
again has had so so you guys you guys
are sort of taking over one company at a
time it seems right we as a company
before joining Google we have been using
it everyone since people started you
wouldn't know but now that
and then I think theano is a bit more
like live linear in that it's okay hmm
that's good mm-hmm where does Shogun get
the money from you can tell me all
google Summer of Code and stands
probably mostly based off of research
grants or yeah research grants but
they're not all to Colombia and also
insulting projects that we've done
companies like Novartis okay but there's
only two of us who were actually funded
by research grants through columbia of
the 11 or so developers all right and
that's for finished I go so we can go
back the licenses all right so it kind
of stood out that I guess shogun is GPL
everything this matter EST yeah and why
is that
actually switching from GPL get away
from the which is quite hard to do so
the result we can be labeling output C
would be walking because all right
solely on Europe time for panel
