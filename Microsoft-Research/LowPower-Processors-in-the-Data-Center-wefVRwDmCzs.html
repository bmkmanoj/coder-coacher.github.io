computing futures team in microsoft
research we're doing research and
improving the large-scale data centers
that Microsoft is building to house the
servers that deliver services across the
Internet these are very very large
plants involved tens of thousands of
computers they consume an enormous
amount of energy they require an or
misson of cooling and what we're looking
at is trying to figure out ways of
building them more efficiently
programming them more efficiently so
this is our experimental vehicle that
we've built it's a low-power server so
the servers that you currently run in
the data center use very high powered
processors this one actually takes
advantage of the processors that are
used in netbooks there are very
low-power processors they consume
somewhere around the tenth or twentieth
as much power as the servers that are
currently used in the data center
they're not as powerful and so you might
require many more of these servers in
the data center but since each one
consumes less energy the data center as
a whole can be more efficient and get
more work done for the same amount of
energy so let me show you what's in this
so this is an experimental vehicle we
built we took 50 of these low powered
servers we connected to them together
and put them in iraq the interesting
thing is unlike a conventional server
there's no real fan in this rack there
are fans on the individual processors
but that's about it then that
demonstrates how much less energy this
server uses them a conventional server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
