company called pull string which was
formerly known as toy talk and I will
give a talk here brief Leone
conversational design so I like all in
this room share the excitement of the
opportunity in front of us that with
these messaging platforms there's an
opportunity to create lasting
connections that feel native to the
messaging medium and we do that through
a combination of art and science and so
the power of chat bots really lies in
the intimacy of the connection right and
I think anyone just need to look at
their messaging history right to
understand the power in the intimacy
that happens through these messaging
platforms these conversations are direct
their brief that shorthand can be very
emotionally charged and this in here
lies the opportunity we reference art
and science because like many that have
talked here today there is a real craft
to the conversation itself we believe it
pull string this really is a new art
form that conversational experiences
whether they happen in a messaging
medium or in a voice-based experienced
in an interactive gaming experience
these will change the way consumers
actually consume media and obviously the
science part of that is the NLP nai
piece of the puzzle so like Omar and
others that have talked on this we to
believe that a persona is very critical
to the success of a bot it's not just a
character could be the voice of a brand
or the voice of a productivity bot
itself so I'm going to talk about
conversational design and I'm going to
do that in reference to three
experiences that we've recently
published
at the top hello Barbie was the first
conversational IOT device came to market
and holiday in partnership with Mattel
this was a very open-ended dialogue
there are actually eight thousand lines
in Barbie that allow kids to speak with
Barbie whether they want to talk about
dreams or pets or their friends or their
school and so very open-ended
conversational design Jessie himani was
published on messenger we were a launch
partner there this was a day in the life
experience with Jessie this is an
example of a story arc and again had a
very different conversational design and
then finally most recently we brought to
market a call of duty bot and we did
that in conjunction with Activision so
at the time Activision wanted to promote
the new release of their game infinite
warfare they actually drove their
audience to messenger where they could
actually chat with lieutenant Reyes a
new character from the new game
understand and tease some of the
elements of the new game and their fans
of Call of Duty could actually view a
trailer and receive a digital good as
part of this experience so here's an
example of a live promotional event this
drove over 6 million messages in a
48-hour period and so I think it is also
a testimony to the possibility of this
medium so let me talk about
conversational design so where to start
you want to start with the right writer
in at the beginning and too many times
we've seen Bob builders make the same
mistake here right they anxious to get
going a bunch of engineers and
developers get a room they start to code
this thing and then they actually have
to backtrack it's super important to get
the person who's going to be responsible
for the content in the bots in on the
ground floor so that individual is
involved in the actual disease
mine can understand the conversational
flows that are actually going to drive
the outcomes or the tasks and it's also
important to get the right individual
most riders come out of the linear arts
their screenplay or movie or TV writers
and what's actually needed here is an
interactive writer so we look for folks
that have background in gaming who have
an understand or the interactive aspect
of what they're building because in this
screenplay you actually write lines 1357
you have to anticipate what the user is
going to be responding back it's
different a different skill set and
important to get the right capability
there so once you have the right
individual on the ground here's what the
focus on so personalize the content and
I'm just going to go for the low-hanging
fruit here right so our belief is that
if a user has a history with a bot
there's an expectation that that bot
should know who I am right this can be
very simple but if you blow that out of
the gate I think that's the fastest way
you can actually use lose a user it
could be as simple as just greetings at
time of day you know something that
actually makes the the first makes that
a personal and sort of meaningful
interaction second personality so I
could speak at length on personality
I'll offer a couple tips here we like to
visualize what the persona of the bot is
you know through relating that to actual
real people whether that be famous
individuals or actors who have
personality that gives a vision for the
persona that will apply to the bot the
other thing we like to do is really be
thoughtful on what the bot is expert on
what the bot is knowledgeable on and
what the bot won't speak to it all
because what the bot doesn't speak to is
equally important as to what it will
speak to and how you actually handle
that
the next point here is guiding the
conversation this has been referenced in
the talks today we use the analogy of
keep it on the rails but allow for a
natural detour and what that means for
us right is that users will take a
conversation off the rails but
ultimately the bot needs to guide that
back towards an end destination and an
outcome need to mirror the language of
messaging so again I'll reinforce what
others have said respondent brevity I
can't tell me how many times I've turned
on a bot right and I get you know
paragraphs of responses from the bot and
when you use the font size that I have
on my screen you know all of a sudden
three or four responses it's gone and
i'm done with the bot so respond with
brevity you have to understand the slang
and acronyms of the messaging medium
right this is a challenge for Ella nlu
but understanding how users speak
obviously is is key to the success here
understand the use and interpret
emoticons images and other rich media we
also think pace is very important here
right so it's again helping to reinforce
the natural aspect of this communication
channel so the use of typing indicators
is important how fast the bot response
we utilize Tom time-based delays so that
there is a slight natural feel to this
and just imagine if the bot is failed
out what if you see a typing in a
carrier for a few seconds and then a
very polite let me get back to you on
that I think that aids in that failed
case and actually speaks to the natural
sort of pace of the interaction the need
to understand intense in context so this
is not just an NL you issue in tents are
so dependent on where
and what state of the conversation
you're in we empower the author to be
able to do that and so the author is
actually designing those attempts and
it's signing those attempts it's
specific nodes of the conversation and
that really addresses the issue of being
able to understand a user's intent in
this within context user testing so many
people will say hey we're going to use
do some beta testing you know they'll
just open it up to folks in the company
right so I think there's an obvious flaw
in that approach we learn a ton by using
external test companies that really help
us understand where users are having
trouble and understanding what types of
responses we get so we can actually
write the content to those responses we
use the same analytics on the backend
you know with that testing group so we
know where we need to add content that
doesn't exist and then finally optimize
so once you published a bot we like to
use analogy of a stand-up comedian right
so you you'll test your material you'll
go up on stage you'll actually deliver
it you'll figure out what jokes are
working what's not we have analytics
that use heat maps to actually show you
where the deepest engagement is in
certain branches of the conversation we
also use ml techniques to obviously
surface intense where content needs to
be written for and so those are some of
the lessons we've learned in the
experience of designing conversation our
platform is called pull string it puts
the power of NLP and AI directly in the
hands of the bot creator so they can
actually implement those intense local
to the context of a conversation
enterprise-class in terms of its
authoring environment and its
scalability it was I thought a useful
question earlier about tool sets right
and tool sets that are designed for
designer
versus tool sets that are for developers
I think our answer there that it needs
to be both it actually needs to be both
simultaneously and so why do we think
that so one the market is moving
incredibly fast so you want your
engineering team and the folks that are
writing the content for your bot to be
able to work in parallel to get that to
market as fast as possible or publish a
new version as quickly as possible so
having an authoring environment that
allows teams of writers to actually work
on the content itself they can break out
a brand to the conversation working in a
locked form sync it back without
colliding with other content that's been
written and being able to track revision
controls in the context of the tool set
we think is super important to bringing
a bot to market so my name is Mike
Houlihan I won't let suffer through QA
I'll be around for the next day and
thank you very much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
