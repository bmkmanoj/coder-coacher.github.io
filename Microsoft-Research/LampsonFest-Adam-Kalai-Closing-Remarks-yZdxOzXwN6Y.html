you
I feel a strange being invited to speak
here with all these God's presence this
is Mount Olympus and Butler is Zeus here
and I don't have included all the gods
that are here President Biden speakers
and some of the organizers are here can
you see yourself there christian your
ear who is that her music I don't anyway
you're a look like you're apologizing
for Jennifer but uh i want to say first
of all the start that having Butler in
our lab is one of my favorite things
he's he's so still so fast and brilliant
and he sometimes protects us from the
other gods and he and he's also very
wise nobody mentioned the wise thing I
haven't known him as long as you guys
have but he's very wise I don't know if
he was wise back then but he's wise now
he was okay there's always wise um so
anyway it was great to listen and to
speak i'm not exactly sure where I fit
in this picture I figured out I fit in
here as the the fool of Mount Olympus
okay so I'm going to talk to you today
about some work that that i did with
butler and several other people another
thing about butler by the way is he's
very frank as many people have mentioned
and he's not afraid to shoot you down
when you're wrong do you have anything
to say already butler to criticize no
wrong yeah definitely yeah no I never I
never I one of my points was that
Butler's always right I didn't know the
butler was ever wrong so I didn't see it
never trade when I wonder at nine why I
don't want to win the argument I want
understand what he's trained the same so
I'm well but I imagine here haha yeah
yeah yeah I imagine here that he would
have said you know he probably just
being nice cuz i do you think Mount
Olympus doesn't have a fool and you know
Here I am and then he strikes me down
with it
with a smile as always okay all right
anyway I should mention that this is not
something that butler I usually work on
but we were able to collaborate on this
and we were able to collaborate with
some excellent people who have worked a
lot on this including sumit go on Ian
Redmond and Rob Miller who's from MIT
here and several very good interns adage
of men in omerta move shubham tool siani
and kuat yes enough so let me start by
telling you about what we're working on
here which is programming by example and
we're talking about specifically text
processing so here this is Butler again
is Zeus why what's so funny have you
ever seen Butler without history maybe
it wait um so um ok text processing by
example so seriously so I'm in the in
this problem you know it's one of these
things you're manipulating text and it's
really slow and annoying maybe have a
column of first name last name and you
want to arrange it to last name first
initial or phone numbers you want to
reformat those are kind of simple tasks
actually beat early the reason I have
this this quadrant diagram here is I saw
him here I saw him here today and said
oh he loves his quadrant diagram so I
better put one in so this is not
complete i apologize but i was able to
throw it in so so you've got the simple
tests which are like you know first name
last name complex task which people have
talked about for a long time or the
classic one is like reformatting a
bibliography from one format to another
and now in modern days you know big data
is a lot of times in text files most the
time and it's in some structured format
and reformatting it or manipulating it
is very painful and ideally the dream is
to get end users who don't know how to
program to be able to do all this kind
of stuff instead of programmers and so I
think you should wait ok I don't even
never use snowball but was is it for end
users no okay
Zeus has spoken all right so if you ask
Butler I think if you ask better where
we should be on this picture you would
speak and say we should be here where
you know creates a system that end users
can solve complex tasks that would be
awesome they'll be what programming by
demonstration is for I'm not quite as
ambitious so I was saying hey let's
build a programming by example system
for programmers hey what do you say and
Butler says that's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard programmers don't need
programming by example right i mean
their programmers well i say maybe it
could be easier to make something useful
to them at first um wait it do you agree
we would be solving the wrong problem
well programmer is a programmers are
people too and maybe there's some value
in helping them there are orders of
magnitude more end users and programmers
programmers are the last people in the
world that need programming by example
see well along if we can't make
programming by example work for them
then we can't make it work for other
people and I'm just not that confident
that we can on one shot you know make
make things work over here in the HCI
and we have to solve a whole bunch of
problems in HCI and machine learning in
order to make something over here so
maybe we should start something for
programmers other says okay but admit
that we're not solving the real problem
for anyone who knows Butler this site so
true I admit it I don't need I didn't
win the argument well watch how I 20
remember fine I'll collaborate with you
mortals see I we both won so and I'm
very happy that he's collaborating with
us it's super every every conversation
with Butler even if it's very short I
always learn a ton so collaborating with
him it's really actually my favorite
part about being here so let me tell you
a little bit about our step system today
which is in this lower right quadrant
and it's for programming by example I'm
just going to talk a little bit about
two different projects here oh but
before I do I want to mention a very
nice system by Summa gulanee in
microsoft in redmond which is actually
in excel 2013 and it's the largest
deployment of programming by example
especially for any users so there were
many systems here that were really cool
and could do a lot of things but getting
it in the hands of many people is really
nice and having it in Excel is super
useful and actually I think Irene here
told me that she was editing something
in Excel she had actually the classic
example of first name last name it's
comin in excel in a column of entries
and she just started typing in the first
names the first few ones and exhale just
filled in the other ones and it was like
magic and that that's the beauty there
when you have it in it in Excel and and
you were planning on doing it by hand
and then it did the rest for you that's
just wonderful and also you know you
don't have to deal with well do people
know when it's going to work when it's
not they were going to do it anyway
maybe it didn't work one hundred percent
perfectly but it saved them a lot of
time so if you want to kind understand
just to get your head around what are
the types of problems that you might
solve with these systems so assume it
was smart and he looked at help forums
that was very clever idea so he went and
looked at the help forums and especially
for Excel users who are trying to do
string manipulation and he got a bunch
of ideas for what tasks to solve in our
system we looked at help forums for
people writing pearl and Ock programs
Python d these languages which people
tend to use for text processing since
our target is for programmers most
programmers know what these languages
are we had for example you know on our
user study we had somebody said I took a
class in chrome programming he couldn't
write a pro program at that moment to
save his life but he had taken a class
so he knew what a pro program could do
and couldn't do so in tip
it's for manipulating sort of structured
text or semi structured text that's
which a lot of the big data these days
is in okay oh there's a nice quote from
watch what I do which is a classic book
and in the forward Allen case says we
have macro capture systems of every kind
in scripting languages but we don't have
end user programming nor do we have
programmed by example the range of
aspiration so now he's talking about
which tasks we should solve the range of
aspiration should extend to at least the
kind of applications purchase from
professionals so I think he's I think
correct that he's talking about the kind
of you want to have eventually
programmable example for these tricky
problems which is something that's
really hard to do as programming is hard
getting end-users to do it is very hard
so I've talked a little bit about the
target audience and the task domain and
then I'm going to talk about 22 papers
both of them with joint with Butler the
first one is about structured
programming by example and the second
one is about machine learning and then
I'll conclude ok so I'm going to start
with a task here somebody's doing a task
picture this they're doing a task at the
keyboard and try to figure out what
they're doing ok Here I am duh move my
cursor over here this programming by
demonstration actually where you get to
see me do it step by step mmm hey raise
your hand if you have some idea of what
you think the task is undoing ok so one
person so this was not a great success
in two people but what do you think it
is well there's this character here
which I didn't surround by Dow so that
was very very close this one oh yeah
these are single you're right these are
single characters you're very close
these are single characters trying to
bide Allison for that one I didn't
terribly though Wow oh well it's
actually very close but not quite right
okay but it made it just less of them
protect me okay so this is a latex file
I just changed the funds actually that
last part was winking and this is
regular
so we're putting dollar signs around
single characters that are not already
between dollar sign but it's a bit more
subtle in that this task was actually
given to me not an help form but by a
friend who runs a journal and he was
getting a lot of submissions and he said
we want to automatically and dollar
signs single variables now that's how he
phrased the task actually it wasn't well
defined so that means roughly putting
dollar signs around things that are not
already between dollar signs already or
already between begin map and a beginner
line and the line you know there's like
a hundred different ways in late tech
for those who know to the market math
and what about the lowercase a which is
a word in English or capital I and I
grits oh so it's actually you want to
you want a system that will help you
figure out how to do this as best as
possible you don't even know your task
ahead of time but the points of this
example is it's very hard to communicate
this example by exam by example only one
person got it and even that definition
wouldn't have been satisfactory for him
in his system okay so what's going on
here so one of the things that Butler
says is that it's not a joke is that
when things don't work the user you
don't want you don't want to have the
user just doing it over and over again
okay these are has to have something
else to do now so in this example what
should we do I mean the user is going to
go a dollar signs here dollar signs here
what can the user do besides just keep
going and going you have any idea I mean
it's like somebody described is like
trying to fix a clock it's not working
and all you can do is shake it you know
trying to fit you need something more
transparent so you can see what
communicate to the computer what you're
trying to do in the computer can
communicate back what it's doing there's
any an idea what you should do computer
give you feedback about what it thought
the patent was and then you could go and
find counter examples that showed it
what you're looking for yeah so exactly
the question of feedback and sort of the
idea is that you want to also enrich the
representation because there's structure
here in this example and in the test on
the health forms many many of them have
a very rich structure and without being
able to expose that structure you can't
leave it I don't even know if I could do
it just through examples I mean you need
to expose the structure they need to be
able to computer needs to be able to
have a notion of what's in math mode
what's not enough mode and so on so
that's a what we do and just to give an
example in the classic example you have
the bibliography obviously there's a
huge amount of structure here where you
have you know records our entries each
entry has author lists and authors and
years and then you know if you really
want to be formatted bibliography
correctly you need to know what our
books versus articles or so so on so
there's a lot of structure there and
this is represented in our system i
apologize i chose the colors i don't
know why i chose the colors for this
project I'm colorblind ok so let's oh so
now let me give you a little demo I
think that'll be helpful hmm this is a
great chance for a failure which will be
much more fun than if it succeeds right
so ok so here's our system I've already
put the program here you can't see it
but essentially if you can just big
enough to see to read it all oh that's
too big essentially we have a list of
fonts here can you guys read it or is it
too small you can read it ok there we go
so the beginning it's just a list of
fonts each font has a name a style and a
bunch of other stuff and the goal in
this task this is one at a string from
the help forms and from the user studies
the goal is to sort the fonts and group
them by their by their style ok so all
the bold fonts should be listed here
separated by semicolons so here's the
beginning here's the end of the script
and then the steps in between you're
essentially adding colors and marking it
up ok so you're kind of manipulating it
and I'll do that a little bit stuff but
you're kind of wrangling and adding
these colors all by example ok so that's
kind of what we'll do so let's let's go
ahead and try it out so I'll take the
data I'll copy it I'll paste it into the
web page click start a new script ok so
now each step in this program is
illustrated by a mock input on the right
and a mark I put on the left I'm going
to take two records let's say and copy
them down into the mark input and Mark
output and the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to mark them in red
which will call font so the font name
will mark in red so macht output I say
ok these are both fonts and then
okay we're going to click Auto code and
feel free to interrupt with questions by
the way I'd rather have questions during
my talk when it's not clear then at the
end so you get a bunch of choices some
of them I write something well in this
case one of them is right here this one
looks right oops let's see what the
other one is here this one's wrong okay
so i can see that the third one is right
so i take that okay and now again I'm
going to mark something let's mark in
this case the records because there's
this great hierarchal structure and the
second color will use for records I mean
okay and we go we had records sure
enough seems to work the first one looks
good second one looks terrible so we
choose the first one and the next one's
gonna be a little more interesting we'll
add styles okay and you'll see why it's
more interesting so we choose the blue
collar for style again we choose to
records if you ask how many examples to
use try three unless you used it a lot
than you can try to you really know what
you're doing you can sometimes use one
okay so we say styles we this time it's
not going to work so what happened is
that both of our examples had regular
and so the computer I can play my
interns you know didn't generalize
correctly and said oh I think what
you're doing is highlighting all the
regular so you have two choices you can
go look for another example with which
is not regular or you can do something
cool which is you can play with it here
so the computer is trying to figure out
what function Maps the mock input to the
mock output so let's just change the
mock input in mock up but they don't
actually have to be a real examples and
maybe this is even better because what
if what if the style doesn't start with
a capital letter what if a style has a
lower space and I don't know if there
are any styles like that but I want my
script in the end to be able to work for
those things so let's try that and that
didn't get it right but we were looking
for a program that gets it right there
we go yeah okay so the fourth one in
this case works and we used to show
people carefully the functions we
generated but we found they just
looked at the data much more so okay so
you get the idea and then I won't go
through the entire example but I'll go
maybe a couple more steps wait so you
know you delete a bunch of stuff because
all we want remember is all the fonts
and the styles and it's a pretty easy
routine and then the next step is
sorting by styles okay so we're going to
sort this entire list by cells which is
fun because sorting by demonstration
think about it how do you sort by
demonstration but having this little
mock input example is pretty good for
that because you say well you just
choose some unsorted region here and you
say okay what function Maps this small
set to the small set and that that's
that's pretty easy to figure out sort
records by styles or no political or
okay and then the only other thing I'll
show you maybe is this other cool step
which we were happy with in our user
study we didn't teach our users how to
do this but there's another step here
which is very natural which is maybe
we'll call this color style set you need
to create a set of four each well put
all the records of the same style
together in in groups so here let's
choose the bolds and the bold italics
and then I'm going to put these guys in
style set together oops okay and so what
I did is I said oh let's put these two
things because they have the same style
in one color these guys are not and
these guys are in the same color and one
of the things that happens here which is
nice is that since I've done this before
I see what I know what happens but the
computer didn't exactly do what we
wanted it actually put a style set
around each individual style which is
not exactly warrant but that's progress
so let's take it actually maybe it's
better than what I asked for so that's
just an example of where you get what
you get sometimes you do better and then
you continue on and move on so so you
get the idea and that's that that's the
demo of this system and we ran a user
study where we took grad students and
postdocs who knew how to program to
different degrees and they were able to
either program using their language of
face or use our system and they did
better using our system I think they
liked it more and they completed and
faster and more and more tasks okay so
basically i talked about these first two
things i'll just have maybe one slide on
the features for programming by example
of machine learning so so let me just
skipped even this is a let's just skip
ahead to the step of interest in this
program so here's a simple step that
somebody might want to do you have a
list of authors and you want to count
how many times each author occurs in
this list we've already sorted it
alphabetically by last name so it seems
like a pretty simple operation to any
person you could probably figure out
what they want but it's like you know
it's a program I mean you got to learn
these programs and these programs is
infinitely many of them and how do you
search for them and you know even
programs of a small size there's
exponentially many of them and there's
not much to do about that I mean there's
still exponential of them I don't think
you can avoid that totally but you can
use machine learning to search faster
for them and so what we did in this
other paper is we look for features of
the data so the features here just I'll
just tell you what the features are I
won't connect them to the machine
learning algorithm but notice that for
example there's numbers in the output
and no numbers in the input and when
that happens that suggests that you
might be counting it's not at all a
promise but but counting is a little bit
more likely than other functions the
counting is already in the library of
functions parentheses are in the output
and not an input well do these
parentheses constants might be useful
you're not going to just start
generating all constants in the world
but ones that are in the output and not
an input multiple times especially might
be very useful and there's duplicate
lines in the input but not in the output
okay so so that suggests maybe dee doop
function which is sure enough in there
so that was kind of another project so
the point is that the in this
programming by demonstration it's really
a challenging problem their search
there's HCI there's so much to do and
and you want to possibly make it work
for programmers but ultimately it boils
down a lot to representation and having
good features and that's something
that's in common across the machine
learning and the HCI part I'm overtime
so let me skip the conclusions and just
say happy birthday Butler thank you for
always being a brilliant which you are
and
Bank which is great and you're right I
thought I thought he's right i guess
it's nice to hear that i should try to
argue with him and maybe win an argument
I never thought of that strategy that
occur to me and also thank you for being
a friend I should just say that when
Adam and I argue and we don't agree he
goes his own way yeah I don't have to do
what he says I just I just don't need to
convince him that I'm right actually
night for my wife actually did watch
through the conclusions what you say
actually did want to see the conclusion
to conclusions yes more or less what I
said which is in this these two things
which is that the system we just about
is a text processing system for people
who know how to program right now
initially and our goal is to move to
these end users and as I said it's sort
of a combination of those challenges in
interface design and machine learning
and machine learning you we all know you
need the right features to get something
to work well in machine learning and in
this case since it's a problem that we
can design a way we use HCI to really
generate those features
what about the system that you presented
to us is particular to programmers to me
it seems like something that even my you
know anybody else in my family who are
all completely non technical could
probably figure out with a little
guidance oh thank you but uh well I mean
there's part of this is actually you are
programming I mean somebody takes a task
they have to think about how to break
this task in the steps so that in itself
is the beginning of programming but I
guess you have to do that even when you
bake a cake I mean okay you you have to
do that always but I do think that well
we did some experiments with
non-programmers and you know they looked
at colors and they started talking about
rainbows and so I'm not sure how much
more work is involved to be honest but
what you say but there's so much going
on I guess I guess I think we need to
the the programmers were much more
tolerant let's say of when our system
wasn't working or think creative about
coming on workarounds you can usually
find workarounds if it's not working you
could add more colors and they were very
fluent and just coming up with solutions
one after the other we did we didn't
experimented on it that much with
non-programmers we started down that
route originally to try to understand
how they would think about these colors
and stuff and it was so hard that we
just said let's try for programmers and
they went so easily okay other questions
all right if not this tank Adam again
thank you
it's quite amazing how this happens
never seen workshop finishing 20 minutes
before its time but Christian will
probably cover for all of this time that
we have access no I really don't want to
cover for all this time because as we
learnt this cake outside and we will
soon after i finished my few remarks go
and have a champagne and toast on butler
which i think would be the most
important part so we learned a lot about
butler right he is stubborn he's fast he
often uses the word bogus and actually
honestly sort of i have not the
sensitivity of a native speaker sources
words he usually uses don't bother me i
can tell you he never uses the word
bogus so but he's definitely always
right or at least on the first argument
and as Jennifer said he has a lot of
stylized learned that immediately when
he moved in here in his office he was
the first who actually it was important
for him to first hang up his out before
he got his books in and his patent cubes
and things like that so he definitely
has style and what we learned from all
the speakers today is is really well
laughed and so I want to thank all the
speakers of today for and I want you to
join me to thank the speakers for all
the talks and telling us a little bit
about bad luck
okay and I think we should say the
organizing committee I mean Jennifer I
want to thank the rest of the organizing
committee with deleted all the works or
Barbara Chuck and my duel saying the
three of sin and finally they are sort
of the invisible people behind the
scenes who always help Irene Lauren I
don't know whether Lauren is he I see
Irene and last but not least jessica who
really does sort of a super professional
job he sort of she came in from redmond
for that and without her you probably
half of you wouldn't be in hotels
because just like Butler you might not
book your hotel when you come to a
conference or things like that so sex is
three of them for this okay and beset
let's enjoy the champagne and the cake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
