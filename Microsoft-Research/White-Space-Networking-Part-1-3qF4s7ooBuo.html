you
hello hello everyone.welcome gives me
great pleasure to introduce Victor today
Victor got his PhD from UMass Amherst
and he's currently a principal
researcher and head of the mobility and
networking research group at Microsoft
Research Redmond he is well known for
several pieces of seminal work including
radar where Wi-Fi is used for indoor
localization rather than communication I
spoke on Wi-Fi mesh networking and of
course white space networking that he's
going to talk about today so Victor is a
fellow of the I Triple E in ECM and it's
won numerous awards including ECM sigma
world's highest award which is its
lifetime achievement award for
outstanding contributions to wireless
research and if you have not had a
chance to take a look he has an
excellent award talk titled me and my
research and I'm assuming it's on the
web and where he talks about what it
takes to sort of take good research and
make it great and have an impact on the
world right and he touches on
characteristics like being courageous
when others think the idea is foolish
and perseverance where you keep plugging
away on your idea until it's real and
you know bulletproof and I think we saw
some of that for example in such in
stock the first day taking idea like
full-duplex which maybe people would
have laughed at and then making it real
over many many iterations like several
years over so without further ado please
join me in welcoming Victor ball thank
you thank you thank you it's a great
pleasure to be here it's strange I when
I get a award like a lifetime teaching
me reward I feel like I don't think I'm
done yet but I feel like I'm supposed to
be done cuz you usually learn you're all
right here
like sitting back and reflecting in and
it's true actually I don't know if you
know I'm like the youngest guy in the
whole everybody's like whiter so I I
feel embarrassed about it but
nevertheless I'll take it all right
thank you very much for having me here
I think I'm going to entertain you today
okay so you talked about about making
things real and persevering which is
true what I'm going to present today is
is a topic
do any of you know about white space
networking alright that's pretty good
you of course know you don't raise your
hand this could he actually works on it
full time for the last six years so
these raising his hand anyway doesn't so
good so if you know that's great so for
the for you for those of you it'll be
you can sit back relax and for those of
you who don't know I'm gonna I have two
hours we'll give it a break we'd have a
break after about an hour I've tried to
divide it up into two talks one talk is
giving you the history of how we started
why this is important what's happening
where we are so and then the next talk
will be more technical and getting to
some of their technical issues that one
needs to solve and we have solved and
where we are and so give you some sense
of the kinds of problems that we need to
deal with now making it real I think
this is the sort of important thing so
to me this is I like to I don't like to
work on incremental things so I don't
like to work on improvements of you know
small thing here not to say that it's
not an important thing I think that's
really important and real engineering
gets done that way research is all about
you know you go and keep doing the
problem keep drilling keep drilling till
you can't drill anymore and you sort of
think that you've got the best solution
but my side is little different than
that I I tend to sort of try to do what
I perceive as new things in new big
areas and that are going to open up new
paths so this is one of those areas and
I started doing working on this 2003
actually for quite a while and it's
still not there but I believe this is a
very big but like anything else there is
risk that'll go away and you will
understand what the risk is once I am
done so at the end of this you can talk
so feel free to interrupt me if you feel
to ask questions and we'll make it
interactive we're making exciting and
enjoyable it's not about learning right
now everything that I tell you but it's
about peeking your interest enough that
you go back and you find the right
papers you read those papers and then
you start driving and finding your own
thing all right okay with that this is
an obligatory slide I need to put it in
this to press set the context and for
you to go but essentially some of these
bullets are pretty straightforward
before you probably had many speakers
talk about this but you know Wallace
just amazingly amazing amount of growth
this is where real action is for a long
time and now data centers but I think in
a sentence is sort of we will solve that
problem while says not a problem that we
can actually solve really easily so it's
growing there's a lot of user pink data
that has been generated and there are
lots of marketing graphs which show you
like from Cisco for example we'll show
you how much usage is going up how much
pressure there's all these networks now
I have to tell you that I've been very
disappointed by the networks here okay
I've been have done some measurements
while I'm here have been only here one
day and I just find it
pathetic very very bad so for the for
those of you who are not going to go to
grad school are not going to go to the
US which is great you stay here you must
keep this in mind that we are way behind
this is very very bad what is happening
but there's no reason there is no actual
technical reason for it to be so bad as
it is here however by from my vantage
point I'm just gonna tell you how
because I live in the u.s. how things
are there and what what do you need to
do as you you know get into your careers
and all is to leapfrog and you can but
keep all this in mind so massive amount
of consumption of data and lots and lots
of new apps right even in my own lab in
Redmond the kinds of applications that
researchers are building they can't be
sustained over the wireless networks but
they are greater they actually add to
your productivity they make you much
more efficient they make you do even
bigger thing
more important things but you can't
actually run them and you will not be
able to run them in India for example at
all because the networks would not
sustain just to say we do it or Wi-Fi is
not good enough
right because you're moving around all
the time Wi-Fi is not there everywhere
latency LTE is touted as the next big
thing that's great it's coming all over
the US but latency still weighs 70 to
100 milliseconds and this latency is a
killer it can't there many apps can do
then you know you have a lot of concern
about bandwidth and then but but you
know this last bullet is true the more
connectivity you have the more bandwidth
you have the more prosperity but
actually believe it or not you can have
because you can do more things all right
now in the u.s. you often see reports
like this this is slightly old slight
but it's true so everybody sort of
realizes this and they know that they're
heading hurtling towards a problem so
there's a spectrum crisis is what they
call it so when you look at these these
headlines you sort of see all this stuff
right you see there is a spectrum crisis
there is going to be a problem it comes
of how much bandwidth okay in India
actually I think you already have it
it's not being utilized very well so
this is this is fair and square in the
middle of the of every debate not just
in technology not in the technical
fields but also in the policy regulatory
field governments everywhere else okay
now you say okay what do I do you look
at this fine let's find some spectrum
but then you go around this is the u.s.
chart and some of you may be familiar
with it but if you're not what this is
showing is this shows how the spectrum a
finite resource is allocated in the
world right and all these colors and
things there are just basically
different allocations to different
parties right they allocated for defense
which NTIA there's a body there at the
eye control and then the FCC controls
all the commercial stuff there's a
handle to all kinds of thing medicals
public security whatever same thing has
happened in Brazil UK Canada one
actually finding a chart for India has
been tremendously difficult I don't know
if I ever found it or not if you do
pre-shared me I obviously knew I was
going to give a talk here and I could
find one so it was very difficult even
to find a chart like that but the
interesting thing here is that this was
done many many decades ago right many
decades ago
they decided that the best way to
allocate it you will give it to TV
broadcasters or we will give it to for
medical supply so we'll give it to inter
vehicle communications or whatever and
so this is all the static application
now you look at it and you say well
Wi-Fi has become very big seller has
become very big we need more data more
bandwidth even a way to give it because
it's not given away so you've got a
crisis that's where the crisis comes
from it's true everywhere all over the
world it's the same thing cuz everybody
sort of evolved in the same direction I
bet you linearize it sort of the same
thing as well ok so what can we do
alright so when I stick make the pipes
thicker make more bandwidth but I
already showed it as a problem next is
you know you're all a lot of you are in
EE communication Theory all that kind of
stuff and you can say well let's kind of
squeeze more bits out of the Hertz right
but I'll submit to you that this
actually has been done quite a bit we
already are at the limit of that
all right turbo codes would actually get
you pretty much there you're limited by
the noise floor okay if you've got you
can't do more than what the channel
provides you so even though you might do
more and more tricks like my Mo's or you
know other other interesting according
techniques you never be able to extract
the amount of bits that we want to go
from the purge and this yeah so I think
this this is a I don't know what they
say here but essentially the way to
think about this is there are
frequencies now I'm trying to think like
the frequencies how do you yeah that's
right so the thickness as well as the
amount of the the bands zero to whatever
verses how thick they are thank you
thanks okay all right so I talked about
this now another idea is that you reduce
the cell size right you reduce the cell
Sox because the smaller cell size that's
never too
you have more capacity so so
theoretically you can have infinite
capacity or goes to define capacity
because you can just reduce the cell
size to be so small and then you just
present the data there and then you kind
of repeat it but that's a serious
problem because imagine how much
management headache it is how much
control traffic you have to sort of
Centre on to manage it I mean so this is
always the case right theory is this
practical people who are in theories
will think like these guys are practical
they're just engineers they're not
researchers that's actually that's not
true but you have to be very pragmatic
and designing these systems so you have
to innovate on both sides and then
another idea is to sort of say well
maybe we can have people who own the
spectrum you know I gave it away or you
know can sell the spectrum so if I or
something or FCC has given me or NTIA or
somebody else is given I have the
spectrum I can give it back and and and
some create a commercial market out of
that they talk a little bit more about
it later and then the other one the more
technical solution is that hey if
somebody's not using it let's use it
okay that's opportunistic it's like the
spectrum is there I'm looking at it
there's nobody using it I'll use it and
if you want to use it I'll get out of
the way
right if you do that then that
possibility becomes quite going good so
now this let's step back for a second
for you to appreciate how this all came
about so I my first exposure to a lot of
these issues started in 2003 okay now it
was already clear into the eleven years
ago or so yeah is there that you know we
wanted more we didn't really at the time
realize how much more we wanted more so
everybody was aware of it then the
question at that time was and it still
is is whether it should be licensed or
unlicensed so Cellular is licensed Wi-Fi
is unlicensed right and quick question
how many of you think if you were let's
say the chairman of one of the big
military bodies and you had certain one
effects spectrum what would you do would
you give it
make it license license would mean that
certain you know some party will come
and say hey I'll give you so much money
so many growers so many billion dollars
whatever you give me the spectrum and
then I will make it available for the
public
that's licensed use or somebody say well
I'm gonna give you money but look at all
the good after all this is a national
resource this is not a resource to be
made money and that person says well you
know look at Wi-Fi look how successful
it is so the question I posed to you for
those of you who are not sleeping there
is actually one of you sleeping here we
just got off do that so tell me what
whether you would make it so the people
who think that a certain mass spectrum
should go to for licensed here is this
raise your hands okay and then licensed
okay then licensed users have it now
then we ask the question to the licensed
users one of you who raised your hand
why do you think it should be licensed
this kind curious why who you what if
you raise your hands right I forget
who's who's you they're like who is you
like you is the person who buys it or
you is the government or who haven't
they already done that
but right now you're hedging now
somebody who said unlicensed can you
actually refute that argument the his
argument is that you can get more
efficiency out of the system because I
mean I'm going to rephrase some of the
things he said but essentially he said
if you give me license you know I've
already spent a lot of money on it
because I buy it so somebody's gonna
government is going to make money in
that government hopefully in theory
should go to the tax go back to the tax
population of people who pay the taxes
of the population and it just got better
better use of the spectrum so that's a
fundamental his argument anybody else
who said unbiased can do
yes it can hold that thought we will go
back to that that's a good good point
that's absolutely a very very strong and
compelling argument because what gene
said is that no matter what do you do if
somebody buys it they are buying it for
profit which is what you say they're
buying it and so if you think if you
think of this as a natural resource or
utility water everybody should get water
whether they can you know whether they
can afford it or not similarly if you
think of information as just a natural
thing that everybody must have to sort
of move forward then it should be free
and it will never be free if you
actually sell it so that's kind of what
the argument is and and the other thing
is that it is not clear yeah yeah yeah
so you're talking about some sort of a
middle ground between the two yeah yeah
okay so let me just go on just keep
these points in mind this is actually
take these arguments to the extreme
which is that you actually have people
arguing on both sides and in fact in
fact this individual who I bet you most
of you don't know if you know it just
raise your hands and I'll be very
surprising I'll take you out for lunch
that's okay I didn't know him either
for a long time he got a Nobel price he
got the Nobel price for arguing that the
way spectrum was allocated was about the
FCC and all was bad it was a bad way to
and that was not the best way both
economic sense see what he was saying as
well as and he was an economist so he
wasn't actually technically from
economics sense it didn't make sense for
the way it was allocated in the way it
was spread out so I'll come back to all
these discussions and hopefully and by
the end you would have a much stronger
opinion either way okay and either is
fine actually so going back to my
history of all this stuff so in 2003
there was a event held in Stanford
University I was invited to this event
and
who's who at the time of people who were
leading policy thinkers now these guys
are not in technical fields they're
lawyers and they're just they're belong
to think tanks right so for example
Leslie Lessig is still very active in a
very smart man and actually writes very
well so if you get a chance you should
read about him and really the question
was is it a property or as if comments
so what is the name yeah yeah so I was
gonna say as he suggested so he talked
about the comments and then as you
talked about the property so there was a
debate in 2003 and has been forever
about the properties in the comments now
in order to get in the lesson number one
from what this is from my talk in when I
gave when I won the award so lesson
number one here is if you want to be
part of this talk you want to be part of
it you want the seed on the table
bring your proposal to it you can't just
sort of this ski I want to be there
because everybody wants to be there you
can read about it but if you actually
have something important intelligent to
say bring your proposal on the table and
I did I brought a proposal on the table
to that particular workshop and I talked
about spectrum allocates the time yeah
now it's in retrospect it seems very
naive but at the time it sort of seems
like hey let's all be good you know it's
all be very nice and just do the right
thing and have an etiquette just like
you have manners
you don't speak when somebody else is
speaking that's a manner similarly in
spectrum why don't we have manage like
that and actually it's a to just to Pat
myself on the back it actually is well
thought out paper it's a well thought
out people because I I was writing this
with the intention that in all these
regular body should not mandate how
innovation should happen it should they
didn't want to mandate for example what
kind of Mac protocol you have what kind
of channel access you have what kind of
coding you have but what they can do is
they say okay this is how you can use it
this is the power numbers and all that
stuff right so it's well thought out
there but it's all wrong because nobody
actually thinks about etiquette this is
what I've discovered over many many
years because there's a lot of money in
or lots of other stuff is involved and
so it's all good but it's all theory now
so so but anyway got me there you got me
a lot of exposure to a lot of these
things and then life kept moving on
and then I sort of own a period of time
I'm just moving way further I had some
interns both are from terms and
different I might forget now when this
was done this was done many several
years ago this was done just recently
what this shows is it's just looking at
the spectrum and what you see is that
you see all these gaps like for example
we think of this as amplitude think of
this as spectrum or frequencies and you
see that there are all these gaps in the
sense that it's not being used it is
empty and then so this is a more recent
picture this is Mission listen she is
Deanna kitabi stood in MIT he was
interning with me and this is one of the
blocks taken from that FCC picture that
I showed you and this is the occupancy
graph and you can see it's all empty so
what it shows you is a lot of frequency
has been given away but people are not
using it right they're not using it so
we call them white spaces whether we
just as a funny thing a lot of people
ask me what the hell you've got at white
wall together black brows I mean this
kind of sensitivity you ever deal with
let's go white spaces okay so so then
you know so I was we were not the only
ones observing this many other people
were observing it and there were lots of
thought that was happening others have
done other some other studies and so
there's idea of dynamic spectrum access
became pretty big right the idea was hey
let's just use this it's empty why don't
we just use it for data connectivity why
are we just wasting it right but problem
is talk is cheap and you will always
find this right you'll always find
people who can who will debate who will
have will sound very smart who will say
a lot of things but they've never been a
thing in their life okay and they have
never actually sort of they don't step
up to do the thing right thing like
don't don't know if somebody has to
prove that this thing can actually work
all right so that was sort of the
challenge that we were facing which was
that nothing will move forward by just
talking talking you have to actually
build it to prove it and that's what we
do is ingenious we build things okay so
now we keep moving so what is
opportunistic access so if you look at
this frequency graph frequency was a
paragraph you say these are let's say
primary users so pu sensor primary users
Cisse well there is a gap let me just
sense it
I'll sense the channel of wine head gap
and I'll start operating here
well now somebody the problem another
primary user comes in primary user is a
user who owns that spectrum okay so
let's say these are the owners of the
spectrum this guy's unlicensed and he
shows up and then the owner shows up and
starts using it so this guy has to
immediately sense that see that the
owner is not there and move to a
different place right usually move in to
continue operating now similarly you
will notice that the channel width here
and the channel width here is different
the amplitudes are different here so you
have to be if you're going to be like
this which is just send something and
then use it you have to be very flexible
you have you flexible in the bandwidth
and you've been flexible in the
amplitude is worth so you sense it you
transmit in the white spaces you detect
if a primary user shows up you move to a
white space and you adapt to your
bandwidth okay from a technical
perspective that's what you have to
build now where are we going with all
this stuff is really if you think like
ideally in the world if we could build a
system like that right if we could
technically build a system then we don't
need any other stuff right we just need
this everything becomes shared we don't
need any allocation what we do is we
need our patient but we need sort of
like say here's the primary user and we
can build a system like that we should
always work that means the primary user
will never suffer which is really what
you want and then you can go there now
once you go there I would submit that
you have been finite capacity you have
more capacity than you can ever have to
deal with it right so this so the old
way does not exploit the time-space
frequency degrees of freedom BSA
actually does and provides a limited
guide so that's where we want to go now
so what is TV white space so I just
talked about whites business so far so
it turns out that in 1996 the US
Congress had authorized the distribution
of some additional channels to
televisions to start transmitting in
digitally so they did not do did not
take the analogue ones away but they
kept give them the digital ones because
this they wanted to move in this you
know HDTV generation was coming more
resolution all that good stuff all the
digital technology what we use but they
couldn't take the unlawful way because
the
millions of people still using these big
antennas on the rooftops when I to get
the signals instead of couldn't but they
said that in 2009 okay so that's
approximately what is it like for ya
thirteen years later they're gonna
completely move switch over to digital
forgive thirteen years to switch over
but the interesting thing was when you
switch over the rule of thumb is that
you use one-third when you do digital
you use about one the bandwidth to
sterna transmit the same information
that you would use an analog so a whole
lot of spectrum opened up this was now
certainly why the great we have spectrum
and this was you know this was going on
in parallel right now
turns out the TV spectrum is amazing
right it's actually some people think of
it as a beachfront property beautiful
beach beautiful why is it amazing
because it can actually provide you
great propagation TVs had two TV signals
had to propagate through ceilings and
rooms and all the other stuff and kind
of get to your TV boxes which were like
you lay on your homes and you didn't
have so many TV base stations you had
few and they were broadcasting yes a
great power but nevertheless had this
thing so it was considered a beachfront
property and a lot of the proponents
started to say well you know what you
can actually build for rural areas now
you don't need to sell guys to show up
if you give us this spectrum we can
build it up inside enterprises public
safety all these different things you
could do that was a sort of thing and
there were a lot of articles on it so
what happened is so when they opened up
so this is the band again from 0 to 900
megahertz that I show you the things to
focus in on the in the yellow color and
the red so this was the bands that were
opened up when they when the transition
happened and out of these bands the
government immediately sold these ones
ok so they sold it and when you say LTE
at least in the United States so
everything I'm talking about is the US
now for India there is pretty similar
things and we can actually talk about
that in discussion later but but so
everything I'm giving you is what is
happening in the US and but you can see
draw parallels anywhere in the
it's not just the US so the AT&amp;amp;T in the
Verizon theater big telcos there they
bought it inside the reality these ones
were left open now of course the
properties were for these well let's say
unlicensed you can get long-range and
you can get very deep penetration
now just I don't have too many equations
but if you sort of say let's let's think
about like what the propagation looks
like so to a very simple modeling right
this is the received power transmit
power free space loss a loss lost at the
transmitter and loss of the receiver
that gives you what the power you get a
receiver and then these this loss is a
is a function of frequency and distance
so this is f here this is D as the
distance between the transmitter and
receiver this is the gain at the
transmitter this is the gain at the
receiver right on the two antennas so if
you you can see that the received power
is a function of the frequency now if
you plug all this good stuff in you it
gets you if you for the same power
budget and power budget means in some
sense think of it as your the the
wireless NIC that sits here it works on
some power budget right it has to
receive a signal over a certain
threshold only then it can decode it so
for the same sort of power budget if you
do the calculation it's about four times
this these frequencies give you four
times the propagation that they would
thought you would get for Wi-Fi let's
look at it from a real-world perspective
this is where actually live this is
where Microsoft headquarters is it's
actually in Redmond well Raymond's not
there but it's very close to Bellevue
was aware LF so baby and sanam is either
the so if you look at this the reds are
the good coverage areas the blues are
bad coverage and then green is silver
like in the middle so you can just focus
on the Reds and flu when I'm going to
switch this shot real quickly and show
you this it's the same map with
different red coverages and of the
different so oops so which is which
looks better first or second second
looks better I don't know if you notice
the first one has ten sites the second
one has three sites right that's pretty
big deal so the ten sites one is that
twenty six hundred mega
so that's approximately 2.4 gigahertz
that's where the Wi-Fi works right and
the three sites one is that a 700 which
is where the TV space is that so that's
why this is beachfront property for 3
over 3x points you can actually touch a
lot more people so cost wise it's great
it's just great okay so we wanted to see
for real if this is actually real
theoria site let's do the practical
thing so we had several years ago we
built a system and this is a garage
parking garage is showing a picture of
an antenna and some radios and this is
sort of plotting all the places that the
coverage was done so what we found is
that the range is approximately five
times the Wi-Fi so theory was being
conservative this is actually good we
like that so for a Wi-Fi or as the reach
now this is a little bit more cleaner
graph this was done more recently
actually it was done in two thousand
eight or nine I forget but what this
shows is there is a base station right
there and then what the white is is a
shuttle driving around the campus and
that not unlike this campus and we are
measuring the signal strength so this is
distance from the base station and this
is the RSSI value that's coming and so
you have the the the the one VHS what is
the UHF and what you see is DBM you see
that even at one point two kilometers
right you still have good signal now Dan
thought that this was very very
suboptimal piece of hardware we had so
when people ask me what is the range I
give them a sort of a rule of thumb of
about one mile even more so one point
six kilometers is the rage so one point
six seven now if you know Wi-Fi can
anybody tell me what is range of Wi-Fi
who said 200 200 that's actually being
optimistic it's not really I mean that's
what the actually I should say 300 but
really it isn't it's actually less
especially in these buildings and things
it's about 100 by rule of thumb is 150
meters
I will yeah the point being made is
small cell size more capacity I'll touch
on it but I'll just give a short answer
right now everything that he can do
Wi-Fi you can do here so if you want to
feel if you think that I'm getting more
fitted using Wi-Fi there's nothing
stopping you from getting burst
basically using theater you just make
the cell size smaller as well but what
would the other way around
Wi-Fi doesn't give you right you say I
don't have and ruler covers for example
if you want to create a mesh network or
you want to create you can't actually do
that without without having the
propagation properly yeah this is
transmission actually yeah it is
introduced it quite a bit because right
now be transmitting in the same levels
that had Wi-Fi yeah sure
and this is a little Victoria is showing
that I've already said something to you
that the transmission inside indoors is
pretty damn good too it's actually
penetrates a lot better than Wi-Fi in
fact I will break somebody ask somebody
if they care to ask me you can ask me
why didn't mesh networking succeed I
actually spend a considerable or in my
life doing mesh networking and then I
walked away from it not actually I
didn't walk away from it because of some
technical reasons but it was because the
objectives that I set out for ourselves
we achieve those objectives move off but
as I look back I can tell you why I
think it failed and part of the reason
it failed was because propagation was
terrible and it was very costly and this
one doesn't have that issues so you
might actually want to consider again so
so now the question is how do you find
if the spectrum is available right so
the one thing I didn't tell you yet
which I showed that when this spectrum
opened up it wasn't like it was clean
okay they were still TV signals that
were going and there was a lot of PR and
things around that we can leave because
there are still millions of people
depending on analog signals and you know
like you if you if you take if you force
doing data connectivity they will all
lose it and there were like paper in
lots of newspapers they were articles
written about it
unhappy grandmother who's watching TV
and suddenly it all gets bestop and they
were out of business and also so the
government was hedging because
government is inherently political and
they need votes and they're not going to
figure yes so what they had said was
that let's think about this as a primary
user secondary user well we know more
that analog TV will not be there so most
people can use it but sometimes it might
be there and if it is there you must
sense it if it's there then don't
transmit that's what they said ok so
then that means that we have to sense it
now what has happened and I'm going to
skip this part is that over the many
years as researchers and genius who went
down the path of trying to build sensing
systems right we looked at energy
detection that means if the signal
energy was over a certain threshold then
maybe it was there was a signal there we
tried to do feature extraction to do
pattern matching to see if there is more
what kind of signal is but lady
nobody could conclusively show that we
knew how to do a sensing that we can
without a doubt always sense correctly
and without a doubt always carried on
and there was a lot of pressure and
nobody could wait ok so thing was then
we had to sort of take the I think the
thing that at this point technology is
not there we are not ready to be able to
build systems that can really sense well
all right so is there another way to do
this right and so somebody said yeah of
course there is I mean this is our paper
I'm not saying that we were the ones but
didn't me
we did have a lot of influence by the
way we'd introduce as Victor but my name
is Fabio there's a history of that too
you know but anyway so the their story
the way the story goes is that we said
what if we have a database ok the
database is the god it knows if
something is used or not and if we
somehow keep that database completely
accurate
all the time then we can go and ask the
database hey I want to use this channel
is it be used or not the rebus is know
then I go ahead use it
problem solved now the whole problem
becomes in keeping the database accurate
ok so we actually wrote this paper about
database driven white space Network and
it sort of goes into lot of detail if
you want to go in there in terms of how
you design the database you know what
all he needs to have and I'm going to
say
few words about it but I wanted to tell
you so that was a database approach so
devices only use the channel specified
by the database yes so no the way it
works is yeah the way it works is that
the FCC takes the responsibility and
this approach the FCC takes
responsibility is just saying we will
own the master database so that means if
you have let's say you are doing analog
TV transmissions and I'm FCC you have to
tell me that you're doing transmissions
now if you are then I'll put it in my
database and all the other commercial
vendors will build the actual database
will be built by the commercial vendors
but they will take the feed off of me
so I am the most I'm the responsible
person and then you have your
responsibility towards me and the
commercial guys don't have any
responsibility there is a responsibility
on my database right but so that's
that's the way it works so no sensing
required but you have to prove to me
that you are actually transmitting right
because I mean if you're just saying
that I'm transmitting and you're not
that's illegal and I'm gonna find you
and so you have to let me keep the
transmission going now for you to keep
the transmission going there has to be
some commercial reason for you to do it
right why are you actually doing it
there's nobody using it so I mean the
system is built like that right now but
it makes technology easy because now you
can build a system without requiring
sensing yeah so the way of policing
works in all of this is that it doesn't
exist but when it happens and you do it
you're gone forever
so that's how I see work I mean you
could like I could do entrancement
whatever heck I could nobody would know
but no government official nobody will
know it but if and so we're we're do it
do it in the u.s. is they will they will
actually have they have vans equipped
with most sophisticated equipment and
they just drive around and it you never
know where they are and if they find
some illegal stuff going on
they will not only shut you down they
will find you and they will put you away
it's a common criminal offense to do it
so it's done with with that sort of a
heavy hand but most of the time you
can't you can get away with it
right so
I'm just I'm gonna make it I could make
any joke about India but I would not
make it I'm into it anyway so so that's
how it works
all right yes yeah right so the question
is so the you have to speak from an
entity perspective so the FCC may have
some regulations with the the guy was
transmitting that you have to update me
so frequently but the FCC mandates that
once every 24 hours you have to check
with me so if you're a commercial user
you check with me every 24 hours and I
don't say it's open then you're okay
under whatever the channels that you
were looking at the channels they are
specified the channel is very heaven the
the band is specified this is one of the
white spaces by the way this is not for
the entire frequency
just the channels channels are six
megahertz from from one point to another
insist there's some numbers let says
channel 22 from this band to this band
is used not used that's how it's correct
but great point good question and the
reason is a great point good question is
because commercial vendors commercial
can can actually get that additional
pieces of information such as what is
like who is transmitting what power
levels they are transmitting at and and
as you get it deeper into it you realize
that there are different rules for
channels so for example in in for seven
six megahertz if there is no
transmission going on in the contiguous
channels on the side channels then you
can transmit at a certain power level
but if there's some transmission going
on in the contiguous you can so now the
question is even though you might find a
channel 3 you don't you know you could
you could sort of say well there is a
somebody's trying to occupy but it's not
really occupied so maybe I can do some
propagation modeling to say whether if
I'm here which is like 2 miles away from
from where they're from you know where
the actual transmitter is maybe I can
use the second channel without
transmitting so I guess not to
complicate the answer the the the
question you ask and the answer is that
the FCC doesn't care about the
transmission it just says yes no that's
all but the commercial vendors can
provide additional information to may
for you the client to do better to be
able to utilize and that's where a lot
of the great engineering can happen and
I'll show you some examples of that so
it's actually this decent question to
ask because that's how you did yeah and
that is available it's just that preface
it doesn't actually it makes it
available but it's not going to make any
decision not going to say anything about
it it just say yes or no yeah correct
you need yeah
yeah so that's so the answer there is
hey party it's like Wi-Fi it's like 35
people do you want to do it they don't
care so you can have as Michigan
resident so I think the way you deal
with that is you've designed a Mac right
it was gem sensei listen before transmit
CSMA that kind of thing so but we can
talk about that too this is actually a
reasonable questions as well I have to
let me think
we started at 10 right so ok just a
little bit so the airbase maintains up
to date list of protected channels their
base can block and so so this last
bullet is kinda like is interesting
bullet because if you think you are if
I'm nervous to ask if I'm going to
always consult the database then the
database actually has a lot of power in
what it can do right it can sort of
arbitrarily control who can use a nod
even if there's nobody using so think of
it as a channel access protocol we'll
get back to that in a few minutes so
pictorially FCC a beautiful sign FCC
some acronyms you don't really care they
provided to the commercial their
commercials and commercial entities they
will then provide database all over in
the original manner although there's no
reason for example if you're in
Bangalore to figure out what's a
transmitting in Delhi I mean who cares
right if you can also you can also sort
of argue it if you and I see you know
you probably need only nearby you don't
really need so you can have regional
databases and to they they provide the
service of being consistent they provide
additional services that we'll talk
about in a few seconds a few minutes but
if they are centrally driven by the FCC
and so these they provide channel maps
then you can sort of consult with these
channel Maps and you're gonna have
transmission going on in those Maps
that's how kind of it works the system
works now Mike some research though
before any of this becomes a commercial
success or you know commercial at all we
you know I showed you the paper which I
the paper was based on this database
system that we built actually you might
appreciate this the person who I
literally built the code for it is Rowan
Murthy anybody know her and Murthy all
of them he's not a bad guy I don't know
what the papers say they went he says a
good guy okay well he himself is not and
I know there's all these issues and we
can talk about it he was my intern - I
was on his PhD thesis committee I've
known him for many years and he so
anyway so he he can code if nothing else
if you don't miss anything about the guy
can code he can go even coding for a
young very young age and he coded this
thing up and it works beautifully his
coat was actually very good and I was
surprising to me because it was very
robust so so we have built this database
and we provided it to to the world to
use and so you can actually if you are
if you interested write to me I'll send
you a link to where it is you can play
with it and it actually it is now been
ported to Singapore and other UK other
places as well which what you see here
is the channel map the Reg are the ones
which say that these are the ones that
are being used the yellows are the
whites are the ones that are available
you can actually get the question that
was asked is you can get what kind of
what is happening in a particular
channel you know this is the callsigns
you can't read it well I realize that
but these are call signs for the komo-tv
KMT y-q these are like local TV channels
there is the channel number they are
allocated what is the signal strength
right
what is the transmit power what is the -
Matt which has to do with the height of
the transmitter where it is how far they
are from elevation so you can get all
these information okay and then from
there you can do your propagation
modeling and I'll tell you about that
and here it tells you where the base
stations are located you click on it it
tells you more information so this is
the data base that gives you a lot more
information than the FCC databases and
we provided this will build our own
system based on this and then we
provided the world to basically for
researchers to do whatever they have
wanted to do with it it was no reason to
repeat all that stuff okay now and it's
a really good
even to this day this was done five
years ago and third and even now it is
probably the best database out there and
the reason is because we went to great
lengths in trying to do the propagation
modeling so the way to think about this
is the following if you say that there
is a transmission going on in point a
and you know whether you're going to see
a signal so you quote the database you
two miles away and it says it's busy but
you say hey I'm two miles away is it
gold matter whether I transmit to that
guy right so you want to know what the
propagation are we so if you do free
space loss so this is on the horizontal
axis the fraction of the white space is
lost okay and this is a CDF of that and
so if you're on this side you're bad in
some sense think of it that way so
because the number is higher right so
this is free space loss so if you just
take a regular free space loss modeling
this is what you get right this is what
we were able to achieve and this is done
with using some terrain modeling so we
got we got this thing from NASA actually
how does the terrain look like we did
some fancy Longley rice modeling change
some parameters here and there and then
we pull all together and then we
measured it thousand different size so
Rohan who I mentioned in a cell in the
car with the spectrum analyzer and drove
about a thousand miles around that and
measured the data and measure it with
the theoretical thing that we had come
up with to see how good it was and in
fact he was actually stopped by a cop
once because of that you know what is he
doing is it terrorist or something
measuring things say it is another I am
a researcher and I'm trying to do it so
I hope this answers the question that
you asked which is that that a good
database provider will not just say yes
or no but will actually provide you some
more information and that's the value
add that the database is providing
because now you as a client they're
still not going to take the
responsibility they will still tell you
no but here's what it looks like and you
can make the judgment that hey I really
need to transmit I'm two and a half
miles away from it I'm not going to get
any signals you know from the earth a
I'm going to transmit right and most
likely you'll be fine they will
nobody complaining and you'll be fine so
so that some of these database vendors
are doing but that's where it sort of
the engineering in the communication
theory that we have studied in the
antenna shaft knowledge can come in to
me you can actually make this better and
better and there are people who've
actually written papers after this I
just wanted to show you the seminal
papers and then you can look at the
papers afterwards so we're all made we
also ask the question is it actually
available like how many people are
transmitting so this is where this is
where Microsoft headquarter is this is
where I live there's a Seattle Samara is
New York Boston all that stuff this is
the number of channels are available
this is approximately bandwidth
available if you do some rule of thumb
some so many bits per Hertz I forget
what I did here it consists of the math
you'll find out then you can say this is
the kind of capacity you can actually
get okay and then this is your thing you
can always make the cell size smaller
there's nothing preventing it from do
that so if there is in fact I don't have
a picture of that if you think about the
mesh world the way we sort of thought
about mesh was with dual frequency
meshes you've got when you have less
density of population you can have these
cell size very being very large NASA had
become popular you can just keep adding
more cell size and this change transmit
power increase this and so you can
actually create multi frequency mesh
networks okay so this is just a pretty
picture to show that you don't have to
worry about the details here at the
point is if you write software you have
to think logically well how am I going
to write this software right because
I've suddenly introduced a database
angle this is not like Wi-Fi anymore
it's not about sensing right now we
think about the difference between Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is just in the radio itself
there's a sensing protocol right which
is a CSMA it senses it and it transmits
and that I think such and give you talk
about full-duplex and things like that
so essentially that's what they were
trying to overcome which is they were
just doing it in the radio but now we
have introduced a completely different
thing we've sort of added a database
entities and you still have to be
compliant so we got to change the stack
a little bit so this picture just is
like I said is pretty picture itself
allows you to think modular II about
this whole system about how you're going
to build the software you have these
different things and so you just do that
so don't worry too much about it this is
that architecture everything differently
so we you remember I said that a lot of
you were talking about but somebody has
to build it so we actually built
we built the whole network these are
some pictures from that deployment there
were some buildings we put up some
antennas there's a white space antenna
these are some TV antennas and we put
them deliberately close to that because
we got the local TV got very upset with
us saying that we were messing around
and we had invited them and showed them
their TV transmission and showed them
white space transmission simultaneously
it will prove to them that nothing bad
is going to happen because we have the
technology to do it and then they signed
off on it and that helped further this
is a shovel we inside the shuttle you
see a laptop we see a radio and shuttle
was driving around we were providing
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi access to the corporate
network because from a laptop you can
connect to this little box through Wi-Fi
and then from from here we would connect
from white spaces into the building and
it this is a shuttle guy putting it on
this is the shuttle the antenna that
thing kind of look pretty cumbersome so
here's the antenna that's our shuttle
and so after me a build all this stuff
involved the FCC Chairman because there
was a lot of debate and we showed him so
this is me right here this is a CTO at
the time as a researcher workmen Ranvir
Thomas this is the chairman of the SEC
right this is the guy who reported a
president of United States
he's pretty serious guy and this is
we're sitting in the shuttle we drove
him around we showed him the whole thing
working we actually showed video
demonstrating and so he was they were so
impressed
I believe when this is obviously I can
never prove it unless you hear somebody
talk to him directly but I believe that
after he's seen it and he he I spent two
hours that day presenting to him in a
room small room him and his two other
people and he asked me a tons of
questions he went back convinced that
you could build this technology the
opportunistic car technology and so they
opened it up 180 megahertz of spectrum
was opened up for use for unlicensed in
the United States the big success for us
so let me show you a little video here
yeah
this is a monkey who lived with the
ongoing transition from analog to
digital TV more and more spectrum is
opening up adaptive radio technologies
allowed networks to have the advantages
of inexpensive Wi-Fi and the long range
of cellular these technologies can help
us use that spectrum by dynamically
finding and using the white spaces
between frequencies used by existing
broadcasters and wireless microphones
this allows more users to coexist on the
spectrum Microsoft researchers have been
exploring this challenge for many years
and have created a network that finds
and uses these white spaces this
technology uses your location and
information from nearby transmitters to
determine what frequencies are available
then dynamically moves to the
frequencies for use in those white
spaces technology like this can offer
low-cost connectivity for underserved
communities schools or hospitals by
ensuring that this spectrum is available
for unlicensed use around the world
government policymakers can help
innovators find even more uses for this
bandwidth and preserve the economic and
social value of this important resource
ok so this is pretty much what I said so
now the word we started with was looked
like this so in the horizontal axis the
range on the vertical axis is a speed so
Wi-Fi sits somewhere around here ok so
that's about 100 200 3 250 meters and
then can go from whatever 100 to 600
megabits have also been demonstrated so
that's where Wi-Fi is USB bluetooth
ZigBee things what I've been talking
about is sits here all right so the
range is higher the bandwidth is less
now as you sort of mentally think about
what you can do with this this starts to
give you some idea of of this is
actually a different technology this is
actually opens up new opportunities both
commercials as well as availability so
darkk law about this I mean this these
are scenarios if you look for example in
Microsoft I just show you some pictures
never
with corn they give you a micro Redmon
it's a huge space not unlike this
University and lots of buildings so you
can provide campus wide coverage
everywhere and so use it walk around you
can provide that you can provide
security security network which I'm
building now joint hotspots right you
can have a access point and then a mile
and a half mile approximately you can
connect to it content distribution
networks you can provide direct
connectivity to retail porthos and you
can use basically all the wireless stuff
you can do in the cell space you can do
here lots of regulation body regulatory
bodies all over the world came and saw
that whole thing and they're going ahead
and building I think we had people from
India as well let's come up I don't know
if I have yeah I do they came in 2009 to
sort of figure out so they were going to
see do the same thing in there because
this problem is true everywhere in the
world it's not the u.s. this is all
multi that I talked about he got his PhD
thesis out of this there was another
person that I supervised she got a PhD
thesis out of it in there some more that
are going on so there's many many
problems I'll get into that in the next
lecture for example and so what we've
also done is we've demonstrated or
deployed a lot of these pilots all over
the world in Africa especially it's
actually two bullets but they're more
different parts of the world to
demonstrate because everybody wants to
see this thing actually works these are
some pictures and they're that one of
our biggest trials was in Cambridge
England and this has involved a lot of
different people from different vendors
you know database provider is different
hardware providers cetera and using 14
UHF channels and this was built up and
lloyd in the UK and it all worked and
succeed it was successful at it in Kenya
we deployed this in a very rural setting
okay and it worked and this is something
that I got completely unsolicited of
course and I want you to read it just
for a second required as you read it
now the reason I wanted you to read it
was because I learn about how you feel I
don't know how things are here I mean I
do know a little bit about things out I
do know everybody talks about these big
things like what's up being bought for
thirteen billion dollars and whatever
startup I'll do a startup I'll do this
right and very few people I feel like
it's our obligation to sort of say that
there's stuff that you do which really
impacts human life they really packs now
this individual for example you know
he's sort of thinking like he had no
clue he didn't know what the world was
doing and suddenly you had he had this
ability to see the world that's that has
to amount for something so even as we
build these technologies even as he
learned a lot of stuff in the books and
things and but the application of it in
the real world is providing things that
nobody else have ever seen that's a
really good thing and that should be a
pretty big driving force in some of your
lives I think because if nothing else
you know when you look back at your life
you'll say I had an impact you know
which is substantial okay this is just a
little picture of different countries
United States UK Finland Canada blah
blah talks about what is happening for
example in the US laws MnPASS
regulations have been passed policy
guidance and provided trials are being
completed so it's pretty good in the UK
also in Cambridge because of the trials
were showing you know this is happening
so it's happening now it is important in
the world to do all this stuff because
nobody's going to build a product unless
or you know product used to get built if
they're applicable all over the world
and so it's kind of important to make
sure that its harmonize all over the
world there are lots of other things
going on so for example the I Triple E
standards has has a thing called a F
which is the wireless LAN standard for
TV band channelization and standards are
very important because standards bring
the price down right because now the
commoditize the hardware and once I mean
Wi-Fi I was working on an 89 it seems to
cost about three four hundred dollars
per Nick four hundred dollars per night
which was a lot of money at that time
which is equal to I would imagine a
thousand dollars at least now maybe more
for every Nick and now it's like five
dollars in less than pylorus it just
comes back because standardization
happened and then when standardization
happens of course went on so when we see
things now in white spaces and they're
costly that's only because you're at the
front end right but that means you if we
still working on it you could be the
ones who actually have profit out of all
this stuff because standardization has
happened so this tile isn't happening
all over the world and you can follow
all this stuff I suspect you'd have a
slide so you can look it up and then in
terms of the databases that I talked
about the databases had to go to the FCC
they went and get certified so they get
a FCC certification and once they so
there are several companies including
Google which is gone
and certified their database so they
provide these databases to anybody to
use for free but you have to work with
that certified database to be able to
use so this is this picture this is just
a snapshot saying that's happening and
then similarly the devices have to be
certified so for example every NIC that
you have is a certified piece of
hardware which is that it would say is
that it is actually complying to
whatever the FCC has said now this FCC
has this is sort of a unique problem for
FCC now because initially if you bought
a piece of hardware they would take it
into their testing and would test it but
now you have to have a combination of
that hardware and the database for the
network to be operated so so for them to
certified even they've had to redesign
the certification process to think about
how they certify that radio is compliant
to everything with the FCC is saying and
then they but you still can't use it
unless you have a certified database but
anyway the point here is that there are
companies that are now starting to
provide hardware now again there is an
opportunity if you do want to do sort of
if you don't want to if you want to
think about that you could potentially
build these things right you could
actually because they're all this only
starter they cost a lot of money for us
to deploy where to spend a lot of money
but you know if you give all of your
electrical engineers you should be able
to design this and I'll show your design
a later on which is pretty simple and
straightforward so in terms of us I told
you that we have built that thing and
then we took a little bit of a break
from that several people kept doing cone
is going to give you a talk in the next
couple days I think on a
software-defined radio so we actually
using cones hardware or software into
the next generation of the network that
we are building now so we're deploying
this there is a specification of the
other system that we are deploying now
you could deploy it in your campuses as
well
that would be you know if you if you're
gonna go to grad school if you're even
doing your senior project there's no
reason why you couldn't do something
like this but we are deploying this with
voice over IP support now we want to
build a production quality system that
has got a camera feed coming so you've
got you know and then we are also going
to do some interesting visual analytics
on it I'll mention this to you tomorrow
when I talk about a different topic
about what we're doing and then the
equipment we are using in surah which I
mentioned soon is going to talked about
it that should be interesting talk it's
all completely software-defined radio
and this is not certified the reason we
wanted to use a software-defined radio
is because we want to control every
aspect of the stack from from both the
hardware to the software to every little
thing because we as researchers and we
want to be able to tweak every different
thing and come up with the best network
we possibly can right so if you if
you're going to do one research you need
a platform like that you need something
very flexible if you're going to
commercial then you actually can see
learn from this and decide like what is
the best commercial entity a commercial
product I can build from that and we use
the Rice University code that stock is
happening also now we have students of
theirs
clay was who was here with me last
semester he's coming here again this
semester was convened to deploy this and
he works with a shoe and this is a
beautiful platform as well and then
there you have a commercial platform as
well so what we're doing is this is sort
of a aerial picture I can't even says
it's some soccer field this is building
is this where I sit somewhere in here
are the base stations so then one one
research problem we're solving is that
of interference mitigation so for
example if you have a base stations
running and they are just you know
selling their traffic they're gonna
interfere especially for long-range a
wireless network that becomes a bigger
problem because it's an omnidirectional
thing and it's going all over the place
that's no good because if these things
become popular you're going to interfere
we don't want that so what we want to do
is this so we want to build directional
systems that can adapt themselves to
wherever they are pushing the data and
we then we can mitigate some of these
interference and this is part of ongoing
research so what I'm showing you now is
the state of art this is
not being built yet it you know in
theory we know how to build it it's been
done in other frequencies but not in UHF
frequencies and there are issues with
the UHF frequencies such as the antenna
size and modulations theory teaches you
that the antennas light is directly or
it's proportional to to the frequencies
at which you operate on or so so we're
building this thing and and so as you
know the next hour when I talk about it
you will start to see the technical
problems which is what we really I think
hear about I just want to give you the
whole thing this is what a picture looks
like that's a Sora board you'll hear a
lot more about this and I focus on sir
but we have the warp thing actually warp
is nicer in some respect because it's a
smaller and so it allows us to build
clients stuff so in soil what we're
doing is right now we're building base
stations from Sora and we're building
clients with in the warp mode and the
are the thing that we have nobody has
ever done is to show the
interoperability ability to
software-defined radios and that's a lot
of engineering a lot of hard work but
but we've gotten there we can actually
see sir end what talk to one another
which is very very cool but so itself
it's not enough then there's a front end
which I don't know if people talk about
or not oh you've oh I'm so sorry
okay first ok he's already finished the
tank so cool it's already done all this
stuff so that's cool ok so you know a
little bit about this pictures again
that's the company which means a front
end and this stuff this is clay he's
this there's some you know work these
are students I just want to show you
there show you they're just like you in
the u.s. his climbing ladder is putting
things up putting the antenna nobody
does it everybody has to do and this is
a boat that was built we put it into a
weather resistant things so that have
rain shine whatever it can still work
that's the building I work in you can't
actually see there you can't really see
this but there's an antennas it's a
bunch of antennas that there are sitting
at out that building that's the guy clay
this is some pictures those are the
antennas a close-up view there are many
many antennas here and people actually
the off people in the offices here got
worried inside some emails saying hey
you fry my brain
it's actually not that we actually have
a lot of these antennas because we're
trying different things right we could
trying different aspects of the of the
directionality that I talked about so we
had to wear to try different antenna
styles and this is what I mean by saying
that you know it's cooked to do theory
but I own a big advocate of actually
building these systems up because what
you learn from that is after all theory
is an observation of the practical stuff
right so it's you can't act you know you
can only try to explain what you're
doing in some sense and then you learn
where it lacks and so when you build all
these things up then you start to see
this is the soccer field this is where
there's a box here which has the Soraa
board is a little antenna there's a
camera that is pointing here down you
can't oh there we go there's a camera
there
and so whenever there's a game this
thing lights up and then we transmit
that to the rest now why if I couldn't
have done it because this soccer field
is pretty far away from the building and
then this is the sole antenna so we were
also trying to make it self-sustaining
so if you want to go into rural areas
and you don't have lek City that's what
you need so we've we've got systems
where we are looking at the end you know
Seattle or Redmond it's not a great area
because it rains and it's very clouded
but we trying to make sure that you have
enough energy coming in that these
systems can run without actually having
power some more picture is a client this
is the watt board is is in a little
container I just wanted to show you that
too and this can right now it's pretty
big and that's where the commercial
opportunity exists to sort of take this
and shrink it to the point where you can
actually proof it in your laptop you
could make it in a USB form factor you
can make a lot of money without a
question and you could have solace in
that field and so right now this is our
client and we kind of put in whatever we
want to put it to make sure that it
works oh well this is one of the
antennas here this is some boxes some
more pictures from this is a picture to
showing this is Anton and that little
person right that little box is where
we're I think one was sitting there and
young one was sitting there yeah there's
a little van here somewhere yeah where
is it
the red car did okay whatever that is
you okay fine
and oh yeah right there Thomas a young
young young young there's a colleague of
conan-kun s thing there which is like
really far away this is the building and
they have to buy this I'm just showing
you this picture so you know like what
it takes to do research okay
this is a gas tank with patrol in it
okay cuz we didn't have enough battery
power to do this is this is actually
this is a motor which runs the thing to
give it enough battery juice to actually
transmit so you know this is the kind of
systems we serve it and of course at the
end we get this so it's grainy here but
it's a Skype call so making a Skype call
to him and I much much better than this
I just it is this is me sitting here
this one right there this is another guy
who works with me and this is young Wang
sitting there is a every tree we got it
great working so that's all so I'll stop
here I will give you a break
five-minute break there's a video of
start with this the next talk and then
we get into a little some technical
meeting but if you have any questions
I'm free to ask but I want to give you a
five minute break but then we'll start
promptly whatever five minutes at 3:15
11:15 yeah I'll talk about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
