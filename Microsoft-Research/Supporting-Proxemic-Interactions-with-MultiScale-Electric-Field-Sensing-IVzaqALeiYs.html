you
okay I think we should make a start it
gives me a great pleasure to introduce
Tobias and who's visiting us today from
fraunhofer he's been doing some very
interesting work in particular in
capacitive sensing and he's going to
talk to us about proxemics interactions
supported through these different types
of capacitive and electric field sensing
techniques he's been developing thank
you thank you so in case you have any
questions just let me know during the
talk and I'll be happy to answer them so
my talk is building up on very famous
paper by soil Greenberg called proxemics
interactions the new you become and they
start this paper by giving a quote from
bill Buxton when he said when you walk
up to a computer just a screensaver
stopped and the working windows reveal
themselves it does it even know if you
are there and EDD quote is from 1996 so
now that some time has passed and I
think that not many computers behave in
that reasonable manner but it gets even
worse when we think of everyday objects
and yeah everyday home appliances and
humans so when we design interactive
systems for these purposes we face the
challenge of environmental perception
and Emma environmental perception means
um that we include both sending human
interactions and also sending the
environment um these two goals have a
few requirements which are for example
to embed hardware and also deployment
constraints so in that case we have the
Microsoft band and the space which is
available is very limited also
communication with other devices is
crucial
nowadays we many rely on having some
smartphone coupled to a smart appliance
like this oven or the scale but one
would aim for having many interacting
devices communicating to each other and
also a very crucial point is power
consumption and supply as in this smart
mark which needs to be recharged every
few days yeah to to offer its
functionalities so in terms of proximity
interactions I would last I would like
to ask the question on how a word could
look like in which every object can
perceive spatial relationships and that
means spatial relationships between
persons and objects objects and objects
and of course persons and persons so one
of the case studies i did was on smart
light and this shows how when objects
are perceived in a special manner how
interaction can become a bit more
magical so in that case one can switch
the light on using a lighter and filling
the light using different bottles so I'm
not yet going into technology but this
is a bit to exemplify what i mean by
proxy make interactions and you can use
gestures for example carried out with
this eraser to switch the lamp off of
course one might also might want to
interact using smartphones or building
up spatial relationships by yeah
touching two objects and then letting
one object or to respond to that action
and war might also want to carry out
certain gestures to make it more
convenient to use and perhaps not having
to touch it
so there are many opportunities to do
sensing for environmental perception for
example infrared sensors ultrasound
sensors accelerometers which are usually
attached to the objects themselves so
remote sensing is a bit difficult of
course cameras are offering a very large
bandwidth of information piezas and also
capacitive sensing so when using
capacitive sensors we have a few great
advantages to other sensing technologies
and these are for example placements
underneath of any kind of non conductive
material so it makes it very unobtrusive
to deploy those sensors also there's the
low power consumption of capacitive
sensors which is very good for example
compared to ultrasound the detection
distances which can be achieved are
approximately below 50 centimeters but
currently we also see a lot of
capacitive sensing and touch sensing and
far less detection distances for example
10 centimeters but that's possible to
achieve that so this is one example of
capacitive sensing and it's Leon tell
mean playing a music instrument which he
built up on capacitive sensing that was
in 1919 and he's having two electrodes
here and one electrode here and he
controls pitch and volume using those
two electrodes and this kind of music
was actually used for Star Trek yeah but
it's it's very hard to play that
instrument and it doesn't only rely on
the distance of the hands but it's more
the whole body which has an influence to
um so that's the thing that makes it all
so very hard to control yeah he later
become a Russian agent and traveled
around with this instrument so i would
like to dig a bit deeper into our
capacitive sensing techniques and i
would like to present a little
classification on capacitive sensing so
capacitive sensing is usually based on
using electrodes are connected to a
sensor and these electrodes are applied
to yeah have an electric potential on
them and then since the environment so
here one can see such an electrode it's
just a singular one that builds up an
electric field to an object within
distance so that could be for example
human hand or a human body this kind of
mode is called a loading mode in
proximity sensing terminology but could
also or is often referred to as a self
capacitance measurement which is for
example often conducted in capacitive
touch buttons the second operating mode
for capacitive sensing is shunt mode in
this case one has a distinct transmit
and receive electrode and an object in
distance will kind of interrupt this
electric field and change the
capacitance between those two plates
this is also called mutual capacitors
mutual capacitance NZ and the last mode
is transmitted mode where an electric
potential is coupled to the human body
and a receiver electrode is used to
receive that kind of electric potential
this is also referred to as introverted
communication because the human body is
used as as an electrode the work on
capacitive sensing and human-computer
interaction started I think with Smith
and he made his PhD thesis about sensing
the proximity to objects using
capacitive sensing arrays so here you
can see one example to send multiple
hands and here you use the very flexible
array of capacitive sensors that are
deployed on the table recent examples
especially in industry include mobile
phones and touch screens and they tend
to be a bit more expressive right now by
sensing also 3d interactions in front of
them as in this example by Microsoft
Research an example for transmit mode
sensing is diamond touch and hear a
signal is coupled through a chair onto
our multi-touch table and this makes it
possible to distinct between multiple
persons touching the surface so
capacitive sensing is not only
applicable in touch screens and a
touch-based interaction but also in
sensing interactions in ubiquitous
environments in that case we have a
smart dawn up here and by measuring the
self capacitance one is able two
distinct between different types of
touches on a doorknob it also be used
for measuring activities of daily living
as in this example whether electrodes
capturing muscle contractions or
swallowing activities and this makes it
possible to derive with a person as
eating or drinking something I'm
structuring my talk focusing on the five
proximity interaction dimensions
presented by Greenberg and these are
distance orientation movement identity
and location and i would like to dig a
bit deeper into these dimensions
and see how capacitive sensing can cover
them the first dimension I would like to
talk about this distance and here my
first scientific contribution is
prototyping board for capacitive sensing
so this is the board it's basically a
DSP processor inside and there are
multiple electrodes which can be
connected to that board and here you can
see the sensors and there are also
different sensors that can be combined
for capacitive measurements so as I said
there are these different operating
modes and this board board supports all
of them we are making it possible to
realize very flexible electrode setups
and capacitive setups we evaluated that
board using fake arm in that case that's
an aluminum tube and the distance of the
aluminum tube can be adjusted using that
wire here and this is the electrode and
the center and that way we conducted
measurements on the sensing resolution
in terms of distance to be roughly
similar to an hour yes with water meters
of here I actually the connectivity is
very high so it doesn't matter if you
fill up with something and yeah we we
made experiments also by fixing an arm
into that kind of appliance and see if
it behaves similar and it actually does
and yeah also previous works have I've
shown that it's very similar but we
wanted to check on that yeah it's it
it's a very it's not very common to see
that as an armor I guess but yeah it is
so these are some of the results we
obtained and one can see that large
electrodes have a very very good
resolution also in distances of 30
centimeters so that's an electrode of 10
by 10 centimeters but when these
electrodes go smaller are the resolution
also decreases we also investigated
different materials for electrodes which
can be I 20 for example and I do is
often used in capacitive touchscreens
peter PSS is prototyping material which
can be inkjet printed and makes it very
convenient to prototype and it's also
transparent and yeah peter PSS actually
has the worst performance because its
connectivity is not very high so I t
always somewhere in the middle there but
still the electrode material is not that
crucial because the currents flowing in
such a setup are very small and the
connectivity of an electrode doesn't
have such a great influence so there was
a loading mode sensing and for shunt
mode sensing when we have two electrodes
we can see that the resolution is not as
high as in loading mode sensing when
having large electrodes are we can cover
greater distances but the resolution is
worse than having small electrodes are
when sensing small distances so there
was a very interesting finding I guess
and this intersection here is the
crucial one using that sport there was
published as open source somebody from
San Francisco contacted me and he wanted
to do an art installation with these
interactive wheels spinning around and
whenever you had San Francisco
fort in terminal 3 you may want to check
it out so that art installation was done
first by prototyping using capacitive
sensors and then I did develop a known
sensor which can be connected to a
programmable logic controller to steer
these wheels and steer the different
lights so these are actually mechanical
setups and the sensing electrodes are
deployed here around the wheels but it's
still possible to detect changes over
here because the plexiglass is slightly
conductive to make it anti-static so
that's one of the prototyping examples I
did and another example when having a
very high update rate of currently 100
Hertz is that one can do for recognition
for example in elderly homes and you can
see me falling down onto that augmented
carpet having eight electrodes and yeah
this is the impact of my hand and when
we go on ah you can see my whole body
going down and creating a very distinct
measurement in that case you could of
course use an accelerometer people have
done but that sir depends very much on
the material of that floor so in case
you don't have very large vibrations
when you have a very solid floor
accelerometers may not behave that well
but when you have let's say wooden
surface accelerometers will be perfectly
suitable for that but still I think that
the ambiguity you can observe with
accelerometers is very high for example
when something drops down
you don't cover an area like it is here
generalizing on that one can also do our
be a general-purpose activity
recognition and this is an example of
variable device it's called a hedgehog
activity logger and this one actually
uses accelerometers to record activities
of daily living and we thought it would
be good to equip this sensor also with
capacitive sensing to sense it the
distance to objects using that wristband
and an open caption sensor so here's the
electrode and when having the wristband
on it can detect the distance to nearby
objects and this is the Hedgehog so
these are some examples where we see
that data provided by this modality is
adding additional expresar tivity in
that case this is an open door activity
and you can see that the wristband is
approaching the door then there's the
activity of moving through that door and
the second approach to the door knob
which is very similar actually to the
first one another X exemplary activity
is drinking and here we can see that the
hand is moving away from the table to
the mouth and yeah we can identify the
number of nips someone takes so in that
case we could show that this data can
enhance accelerometer based activity
recognition and provide an additional
mean for classifying general-purpose
activities
so the next two interaction i would like
to cover is orientation and movement and
here i designed a method for recognizing
objects in proximity to our capacitive
sensors so currently the state of the
art was that usually someone would have
just like a 3d location of an object but
my goal was to have it some bit more
expressive by adding more dimensions to
it for example multiple objects also
different object representations which
are here are provided by these boxes so
these boxes can also have a different
width for example or a different hate to
indicate whether somebody's grabbing
something and in this case we have an
interaction space above a capacitive
sensing device and these volumetric
models that kind of give an impression
of how hands or objects are located
above that and this model is called
Swiss cheese and I will explain now why
it's called Swiss cheese is because
there this model is based on elimination
so when making a capacitive measurement
one cannot say ok there's a hand located
at a certain distance but one can only
say that there is no hand located at a
distance of X around me that is because
different objects have different
connectivity's one might also have
different sizes so in that case one can
only do a best or worst case assumption
and so that model has those holes inside
and when combining multiple sensors now
one can eliminate the probability of
object presence
at a certain location so this would be
the first sensor and it's telling me
okay there might be something around me
but in that small space I'm sure there's
nothing when using other sensors right
now like might be able to tell okay here
there's a large area in which nothing
may exist and when combining all these
sensor values one has a remaining part
of cheese which is located here at both
sides and this remaining part can be
analyzed by fitting these volumetric
objects in as I told you and here you
can see these are some sand very
probable assumptions for object object
presence and these are some non viable
assumptions as they are not very
probable and here's the second hand so
to give you a little bit of a background
BMW's are currently are also working on
gesture recognition in cars and they
will introduce that feature with the new
BMW 7 and we thought of a way to make
that low cost using no cameras so BMW is
currently using cameras in the infrared
regime and a locust resolution for
interacting with gestures in a car could
be that display way where you can simply
arm point on things and make it a bit
less distracting to interact with
technology and not probably having to
focus on the touch screen itself so no
one can use different kinds of gestures
to select music for example as it is
shown here and then the music will start
and yeah Jessa gestures can also be used
to yeah race or decrease volume of that
music so these are some exemplary
trajectories we record it in front of
the screen and here you can see that
rectangles are clearly distinguishable
air shaves or triangles or circles and
this kind of technique could be used to
provide gesture recognition cars for a
course of perhaps 10 euros so it's it's
very low cost I also created some
conceptual standalone devices in that
case it's the device that can recognize
gestures and we experimented with it in
different use cases and settings for
example to control screen application or
to control appliances in the environment
like this smart door and here again the
advantage is that it is non-contact but
will also experience that when people
come up to a capacitive sensing device
they don't know what to do because
nothing affords for for example touching
or carrying out gesture and therefore we
integrated this led grid underneath the
sensing surface to indicate possible
gesture movements but also to give
feedback on interaction yes so let me
use it people get confused if there's
anything attachments of it what is the
advantage of having a sensor like this
that is non touch over touch we've been
for example investigating possibilities
to open doors by non touch because of
hygienic aspects so that might be a
solution but also in the medical domain
when you have surgeries you don't want
to touch something but
is also a case for cameras of course but
at some point maybe privacy is also an
issue so it's it's many the hygienic
aspect which one might focus on okay so
that's a video I know the device is
telling me okay interact with me and
that's actually working quite well and
now I'm getting feedback on my current
hand position and soon as I select an
image in this image viewer application
it lights up in green and now it's
telling me okay you can carry out swipe
gestures a top of my surface to switch
between those images so that's the
feedback and as soon as it lights up in
green it says okay I'm carrying out an
action and now it's acknowledging and
now giving feed-forward information so
we've met the experience that the
different colors only makes sense if
they use complementary and in that case
we have a door and the green color
indicates that a gesture can be carried
out to open that door and the red color
are to close it again so in that case
that's the hygienic case study the green
buildings in again everyone is for
opening the door and the red one is for
closing it again which weight is way
right oh seok so that's the hardware and
we got 12 different capacitive sensors
and transparent electrodes on top of
that surface so now i covered the first
three dimensions but i wasn't yet able
to identify objects and devices or
humans and this is my next goal to
provide mean means for identifying
things and also the spatial
relationships so here's my goal I wanted
to identify interaction
with devices making use of spatial
relationships like very proximate
distance between devices but also on for
example gestures carried out on a device
itself and also proximity may be
established using are using touches
between two devices and connecting them
this way and this probably makes the
proximity terminology a bit more
pragmatic so there are different methods
of providing means for communications
and the first one is inductive where you
use magnetic fields the second
capacitive and the third is based on
radio frequency and in order to support
these proxy make interactions i use the
capacitive approach because it can make
sense of spatial relationships using
both interaction and messaging and it's
also very suitable for ultra low-power
devices which are in a region of effect
of 100 kompert compared to long-range
communications when using capacitive
sensing it is very vital to establish a
common reference between two
communicating devices in that case these
this references is critical and it can
be established for example by touching
two devices and establishing the
reference with the own body also using a
power supply which provides for example
current reference and in order to design
applications based on capacitive new
field communications I propose the
framework which has three different
operating modes and the first operating
mode is ground coupling by touch where
one has a battery-powered object
and the grand coupling is established by
this ground electrode here and the
transmitter electro transmits
information to appliances in the
environment let's say in this case a
smart table and now this object may
communicate information about
acceleration to the table the second
operating mode is crowned coupling by
proximity where we have a very large
ground electrode and as soon as somebody
moves closer to that ground electrode
the communication or the the signal
between receiver and transmitter
increases this makes it possible to
detect proximity to objects provided by
persons the third operating mode is
intro body communications with the
common ground and in that case we
basically have a closed loop here's a
common ground provided by two objects
and one can establish a communication
link using a transmitter electrode and a
receiver in that case of the smart lamp
which can be filled up by touching a
colored area and the lamp both the DFG
you could be consistent with the
position of Warner hand on the right um
if we can distinguish between different
gestures I'm sorry yes Bridget for
gesture recognition yes yeah this is
what it's for recognizing if two devices
have been touched at the same time yeah
and now then it's possible to transmit
messages through the human body to that
device I mean that in the right hand
example if my hand was on the thing I'm
thing in your hand was on the table it
wouldn't I must be held hands right yeah
when we had held hands it would work
yeah so um would be nice having some
some kind of business card exchange by
shaking hands right so that's a very
very interesting operating mode for
or doing or exploiting spatial relations
and proximate interactions so these
three operating modes make up my
framework and I would like to show how
to how to use them but first I will
present a little technical setup which
exemplifies how how simple it is to
communicate by means of capacitive new
food communication so in that case for
transmitter only a single
microcontroller is required and this
microcontroller puts a square signal arm
on an electrode so that's a very simple
output pin and the 10 kilohertz carrier
which enables to transmit to killer bits
of information using that method of
course this is only one way so one is
not able to include very sophisticated
methods like csma/ca into communication
it's just broadcasting information in a
very simple manner but it also enables
to create very or a large number of
interacting objects and operating at
very low poll the receiver requires some
additional hardware so that's basically
an operational amplifier and there's
some software running on the
microcontroller and analyzing the
incoming signals and decoding the
messages and in that case that airplane
can transmit its acceleration
information and ID to the computer here
and this is these are two examples of
the hardware we created this is simple
transmitter using a coinstar tag it can
run for ages and transceiver which can
be connected to USB to the computer yeah
capacitively we're sending the data from
the example hunter and you get an ID as
well from the device yeah
also get the proximity oh yeah you did
the the signal strength I guess of the
capacity of signal itself gives you that
that distance is that right yeah but
it's very ambiguous so are you only
major tech changes but not yeah deriving
a certain distance so suppose you only
cover one third of the grant electrode
when you're touching it it will induce a
much much less signal than touching the
whole ground electrode with your whole
hand so it makes it easy to detect
changes for example when moving it
closer or moving it away or touching it
in a different way but having a real
proximity value is very difficult to
obtain okay so these are some examples
here we have a lighter and one can
basically use every conductive thing
which is already included in an object
like this lighter cap and this one is
used for transmitting and it can even
transmit when the light is on which is
very neat and here's the ground
electrode which is usually touched to
establish this kind of common reference
another example is some aluminum tape
which is attached to the table which can
act as a receiver for a laptop for
tangible objects and this one also
allows for different operating modes
like run coupling by proximity touch and
in robotic communications this is an
example of a magnifying glass which can
be used in combination with the desk to
sense proximity to it and as soon as I
hover over that magnifying glass it can
be located and that I can say okay
here's a glass I find it so we
implemented that for as a proof of
concept for blind people which I will
show later and this is an example of
smell
watch that's a bit of a different setup
because that's not so much tangible
interaction what we use that in
combination with a bat having some
conductive wires inside to show that
it's possible to do very low power
communications of acceleration data for
example to analyze sleeping behavior and
in that case we have a transmitted
electrode here and a ground electrode
located here that's on the on the bed
sheet yeah so that's conductive fabric
inside and it can basically receive the
messages of multiple watched step yeah
so I could imagine having that much much
smaller scales integrated into normal
smart textiles to do sleeping behavior
studies okay so I evaluated all these
different operating modes and the key
findings are that of course bigger
transmit and receive electrodes are
allow for greater communication Rangers
in that case having a three by three
centimeters patch allows for
communicating in distances or 15
centimeters also larger transmit
electrodes are better than large receive
electrodes which is a bit of a pity
because when we have like small objects
yeah we we can't enlarge this electrode
as we would like to but it's usually
easier to enlarge receive electrodes
when you're operating with objects that
are a bit more sophisticated like this
bed or the table which provides the in
just more space to deploy electrodes
when using large ground electrodes one
can detect distances up to 15
centimeters and hovering over the object
and also when using intro body
communication it is possible to
recognize changes in contact area so
when I
two devices with each other I can sense
whether I remove or add fingers for
example which I could be exploited to to
make things a bit more interactive for
example by having different strengths of
special relationships so that is the
case study we made for blind people in
cooperation with the company and they
are having these brave cards that can
carry out certain commands so that
people don't need to use the keyboard
and learn all the difficult shortcuts
and in that case let Brightheart carries
out the command of reading the screen
content and the airplane was used to
control the speed of the screen reader
and here one can launch different
applications using that cube like email
client or our online banking for example
and this is an example of the magnifying
glass you can see me hovering over it
and then then there will be a textual
description or what it does that I can
use the magnifying glass to our browse
through the screen and yeah reach for
example some contents so that's a very
conceptual study but I think it could
show how blind people can or could
interact with a computer in the future
using tangible objects and the last
proximate interaction dimension i would
like to cover this location and i
started my work by creating a smart
couch using capacitive sensing and this
smart card able to recognize nine
different postures and then adjust the
environment for example are turning our
music when somebody lies down or yeah
switching off the light to makes it make
it more relaxing we could show with 9
training persons and 9th Esper's
since that the recognition performance
is very good at ninety seven point five
percent the second example I would like
to show is kept floor and this has been
a project I've been working on since i
started my PhD and it's an industrial
project which is supposed to be used in
smart homes to localize persons and also
to recognize false especially in elderly
homes and here we can we can see a setup
of CAP floor we have wires deployed
underneath the floor in that case that's
wooden flooring and we have sensors
right at the wars that are connected to
these wires and this basically makes up
a giant touchscreen and there's a
subsystem controller accumulating or the
sense of values and then sending them
over to the dispatcher box which is
located in the apartment and
approximately one year ago or a bit more
we got our first assignment on deploying
kept floor in an early home and we've
been doing that in in 23 apartments with
1600 square meters deploying all these
wires of course in the future we would
like to have some some kind of sheet
which can be rolled out to make it more
convenient to to place these wires
underneath the floor and then the
senders will be placed right here the
wars are aside the wooden flooring no we
had a we had many many students working
on that so yeah it was tough work and
also the workers on the construction
side weren't very cooperative doing
things different so yeah they basically
destroyed some installations and we had
to clean up beer bottles and cigarettes
and
it was that was very tough actually so
then we got a water leakage and we had
to do that twice because they had to
remove the whole flooring and there was
a huge catastrophe because all the
elderly's already had canceled their
contracts for apartments and so they had
to move to the children and yeah that
was a very serious actually so um these
are the sensors I developed they are all
attached to this kind of ruined cable in
an array yeah composition so every 20
centimeters you would have such such a
sensor but in our current iteration we
only have a sensor every 40 centimeters
where one can connect two electrodes to
make it a bit less expensive and also to
have less technical failures and this is
how it looks like when being placed side
the wooden flooring that's about one
centimeter and we require spacing of 1.5
to 2 centimeters here and here is the
cable that runs into the room and then
the flat-band cable is connected across
that line in order to analyze data we
developed main controller let us place
in the dispatcher box and this main
controller has texas instruments bigger
bone on top third running all the
applications and dunno the signal
processing and this peripheral board was
designed by ourselves having bus
connections and bus drivers and also
dispatching or the communication lines
are to these connectors and yeah as I
said this controllers and being placed
inside each apartment there's also some
software related to cap flow
this is the Kepler designer where you
have a grand plan and one can simply
drag and drop sensors from here and
place them into room and then use the
live view to analyze the signals and see
where persons have been located and
where force have been recognized so
that's what it looks like from a
technical viewpoint and we also go out
nap for caregivers which notifies
caregivers when a Ford has been
recognized in that case this message has
been distributed to four or five
caregivers and the one wins are which
process except and then the caregiver
has to take care of that this is an
example of data provided by caption or
in that case one can see to our data
sources one is a for recognition which
does a bit more signal processing and
you can see a person are stepping over
the floor from the top and now we can
observe a fall so that's shown here and
we basically analyze the area which is
being covered by the person line and
that's the second floor so I want to
quickly wrap up my talk I've I'm going
to talk about a bit about future
workforce in a few minutes so I've
covered the three the five different
proxy make interaction dimensions
distance orientation and movement
identity and location using different
scientific contributions and also some
industrial projects I've been working on
and I want to quickly also go into the
future of capacitive sensing
so currently I've always used an
actively generated electric potential
well that's very similar to to
ultrasound where you where you kind of
transmit a signal wait for its return
but you could also just listen and that
has been done by various researchers
also by a census in device group and
combining that could lead to very
interesting developments like for
example low-power messaging between
objects greater detection distances of 2
to 3 meters high expressiveness when
interacting with objects monitoring of
vital signs like ecgs and a greater
energy efficiency by the fact of I think
like 50 when you have current commercial
products I would also like to
investigate passive piezo based
interaction tags which are spayed or
which which are placed a bit away from
the sensor itself but still being able
to to measure interactions a second
thing I've been doing was to equip
physical objects with capacitive
communications but now when we move to
the domain of virtual objects this
hasn't been done so far and this could
for example allow to build smarter touch
screens that have a better support for
tangible objects and can also lead to
through body data transitions as it has
been shown with cameras and Microsoft
Research and I want to quickly step into
that and show an example of what I mean
by a smarter touchscreen so in that case
we want to transfer an image from one
source to the other by simply touching
those two sources in that case the
images transmitted from the tablet pc to
the smartphone and this actually makes
makes use of the spatial relationships
so whenever one touch with that image it
will make a difference
touching this one so data can be encoded
locally on the smart on the touch screen
to be transmitted by intra-party
communications yeah in the alarm but you
already have it because it's already
there so yeah it's it's basically the
same infrastructure but the hardware
needs to be changed yeah right new
environmental okay you don't need to put
like electrodes in the table nah okay
another thing which will be interesting
is to transfer information by device
hovering for example again I want to
transfer this image to the mobile phone
now I can simply hover over it and
transfer the information also by the
spatial relationship that I'm placing it
right here another thing that is also
interesting but it's a bit of a
different domain but it's also possible
is to sense biometrics for example by
sensing a tool eat finger ECG right on
the on the touchscreen and this could be
used for example to identify persons or
monitoring their vital signs and
currently we see a lot of developments
and related work which applies
smartwatches to communicate with the
touchscreen and they basically fake
touch events but this faking comes with
the cost that one needs to apply really
high voltages of 100 volts which just
trick this on the the touch screen
controller but the controller could do
more but we're currently just not having
the techniques to do so yep not wearing
any that log on bye-bye biometrics
somehow it possibly take some some
bodily reading as i write and have you
done any work to see or i guess the plan
is to do there
how how much you distinguish people yeah
there have been some some works on
impedance sensing to distinguish people
but that's very cause you can't call
that biometrics more like identifying
let's say 10 or 5 persons right yeah
yeah so that mean works on that but I
also think that ECG sensing might be
very interesting perhaps also to just
wing distinguish between persons
touching in a multiple and multi-touch
on multiple person environment so yeah
this is one aspect I'm i would consider
interesting to investigate and it
definitely requires some some scientific
discussions and yeah I thank you very
much for your time and looking forward
for some questions and so we're right on
the top of the hour but I think that I
don't see anyone desperate to get in the
room so and we've had quite a few
questions through the presentation but
if there are one or two questions now
okay almost everything you've done there
are people trying to be similar things
with def cameras and various so the
visual thing now you've made the clear
point that this is way lower costs and
we lower power gen but have you thought
about combining widget because I can
imagine you know the sort of def camera
kind of sort of approaches they're still
you know they're not they're not there's
no not perfect I think just throwing
feel the sort of extra signals you have
into the machine learning infrastructure
might really help have you thought about
that regard that yeah yeah definitely
for example let's suppose you have some
wall-sized displays you got your prom
with the angle of view of your camera so
the one could be for very close
interactions also using through body
transitions and all these kind of things
and the cameras could really enhance the
information distance there and of course
words have a much greater bandwidth and
they can provide much more information
than capacitive sensing can do so
combination of both is definitely
interesting and yeah I've seen some some
works for example on tablet PCs where
they use capacitive detect tangible
objects which are recognized by the
smartphone and then have also a visual
check on them which can be detected by
the camera so you can basically have
these two steps like touch and yeah a
great interaction distance so yeah I
think that's these these two things like
tiny interaction distance angle of view
and cameras these can be combined very
very nicely and also to perhaps to
provide some greater reliability when
having camera based applications here at
celica I mean I guess yeah the BMW
scenario you talk to that there's an
issue with optical systems in cars I
guess because of the right yeah well
sunlight coming in that's it's going to
be really difficult it was really
actually using a capacitive sensing yeah
oh is it land using it for the rooftop
to control it yeah but I think that this
is not going into a production right now
so that was so shown on iaa but on the
BMW 7 the gesture recognition with
cameras is going into production in and
by the end of July and I mean I had a
kind of question about the the
installation that you showed in the care
home right so that is that that's still
up and running is that right yeah is it
being used sort of daily how does that
they running your software to detect
fools are they yeah since we're that
water leakage everything got delayed so
currently what we've been doing is to
equip one apartment decking taking and
recording test data
and now we went into a second heart
federation because we had some problems
with noise provided by these cathodes
tvs so yeah now we're planning to see
she attends more so everyone to buy a 4k
yeah but the and there's a company who's
kind of running that is this an investor
running that house and they have so in
the way people if there's less community
down there for dementia patients there
are 14 dementia patients and we've
equipped all of the rooms with
capacitive sensing but but but just with
the electrodes so there's not yet a
system connected and now we're having
one very nice old lady and what we're
always going to the apartment and say
okay we need to do some more tests and
we need to record situations and she's
she's she's really supporting us and
that's that's very nice yeah I have a
question here just poking at capacitive
sensing in general so a lot of the
things you're describing are nice
because they can be very intuitive but
at the same time the fact that the
sensor can't be seen or can be hidden I
mean so for example like the floor think
the idea that I could walk into a room
and not know that all of my actions
within that room are being tracked um
and that maybe I you know that end of
the things I tie it just seems I mean
are there do you feel it there's privacy
concerns or or you know that there's
that there needs to be a way in which
kind of the ability of sensing or that
or that um you know the presence of
sensor should be communicated to people
yeah definitely there are privacy
concerns they're probably not as strong
as when using cameras so we have these
lifelogging cameras where some people go
on the toilet and people still play
against wearing this camera so that's a
bit of a very intrusive also to other
people and especially when you have
visitors who don't know that
three steps recorded that could be a
problem yeah we're trying always trying
to tell people that or the data remains
in the apartment of course currently
there's a big downstream to our
Institute to have all the data recorded
but in the meantime mood or in the
future we would like to have it all in
the apartment and nothing going on but
that's also the problem when you put up
a camera and say okay it's only doing
gesture recognition and the data has
been abstracted at some point people
still fear that they might be kind of
observed so that's it that's a very
difficult to conservation okay what it
said thank I speaker one more time thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
