kaanum architectures and computation
group which is part of Station Q here at
Microsoft Research and I'm Dave whacker
I had quantum engineering which is
concerned with the software tools and
eventual Hardware we're going to build
quantum computers out of I came to
Microsoft to see how mathematics and
computer science innovation could really
reach people in a big way to really have
impact and make a difference in our
world through quantum computing our area
of expertise is quantum computing our
group writes software for computers that
don't exist yet quantum computers go
beyond the most powerful supercomputer
quantum computing will be as
transformational if not more so than the
evolution of conventional digital
computers over the last 60 years at
Microsoft we've actually been doing
research in quantum computing since the
late 90s in late 2000 Michael Friedman a
topologist and Fields medalist and
Microsoft colleagues actually showed
that computing with a yet to be
discovered quasiparticle might actually
lead to a paradigm shift for computation
they called this approach topological
quantum computation and further
understanding the potential of this
topological quantum computation Michael
Friedman approached one of our senior
executives Craig Mundy to discuss the
company's quantum investment in 2004
after that Microsoft actually started a
dedicated lab called station Q to focus
on quantum computing ranging in the
research from theory to experiment just
two years later in 2006 Microsoft
station Q was founded to serve as a
center for the study of topological
quantum computation and quark is
actually part of station Q and in quark
we focus on advancing quantum algorithms
designing programming languages and
compilers and determining good error
correcting codes for quantum computers
we really look at what do you do with a
quantum computer how do you program it
and then how do you actually execute
that program on the device in 2010
station Q researchers and collaborators
showed theoretically how this elusive
quasiparticle that could lead to
topological quantum computation might be
able to be seen in the lab and then our
research partner Leo Cowen Hoban who's a
professor at Delft actually built this
experiment in his lab in Delft and he
was the first to detect evidence of a
Meyer on a quasi particle just two years
later in April 2012 at station Q were
dedicated to harnessing the power of
topological qubits because topological
qubits promised to reduce the cost of
building a quantum computer they store
information non locally between two
quasi particles located far apart so
that the information corruption cannot
occur locally and the ability to corrupt
the information decreases exponentially
with the distance between the caused
quasi particles it uses nature to
protect the information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
