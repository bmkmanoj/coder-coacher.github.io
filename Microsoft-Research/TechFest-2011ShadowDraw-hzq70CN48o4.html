here at the interactive visual Media
Group here at Microsoft Research Redmond
today I'm gonna be talking about shadow
draw which is a collaboration between
myself Michael Cohen and a student at
the University of Texas in Austin named
Youngjae Lee my personal research is
centered on object recognition but this
is one application of it which I thought
it'd just be fun to kind of test out and
demo so the project is called shadow
draw and the goal of it is really to
make drawing more fun to enable you to
be more creative and also to make the
result of your drawing be more
impressive and better quality so that
you enjoy drawing more now with shadow
draw I'll start drawing and the program
automatically recognizes what you're
drawing and then tries to offer
suggestions and the more I draw all the
more specific it gets and the more
accurate the recommendations it has
becomes so you see my final drawing
looks a bit more realistic so the way
this works is it it actually matches my
drawing to a database of images and in
this implementation here we actually
have 30,000 images collected from the
web basically anything you think of that
you might want to draw we try to put in
a database bicycle something else that
people have a really hard time drawing
because the frame of a bike you know you
don't know where the chains attached or
where the frame is
if I start drawing a bike already just
with drawing two wheels it kind of picks
up that I might be drawing a bike and
you see the frame already appear so you
know already like I should be drawing
the frame like this and one thing that's
important is we don't want people to
think the shadow is a part of the
drawing so as you draw you can always
click over here and see what your
drawing looks like without the shadows
and as I draw the shadows have more
contrast where my mouse cursor is and
have less contrast away so that way you
don't see the shadows as much as when
you move further away
so why a lot of my research is in
fundamental areas like object
recognition this is a really great
example where basic research can really
push the boundaries and I think lead to
some great applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
