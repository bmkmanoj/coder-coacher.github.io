you
so I want to thank everybody for coming
this morning it's a little bit short
notice but we really appreciate you
being here I'm really excited to
introduce Megan Watzke who's with the
Chandra x-ray Observatory she's a
communications officer for them and
she's going to talk about some of the
books she's been working on the most
recent one we have a copies of them up
here it's called light and that's
actually in costco shows you how many
copies are out there then another really
how the universe about the worker
actually observatory and hope I gave
them the work that they do is I'll
college etc and there's another one
which is an earlier book called your
ticket to the universe that is floating
around you guys and so I'd like just to
let's all give Megan a warm welcome and
take it away make it Thank You Curtis
and thanks for all of you guys for
taking some time out of your busy day to
come and listen to what I have to say as
Curtis mentioned i work for the NASA's
Chandra x-ray observatory and I don't
know if you guys know about it or not it
but most people have heard of Hubble and
that is obviously an orbiting telescope
that looks at visible light Chandra is a
sister mission to Hubble and instead it
looks at x-ray light from space it was
launched in 1999 aboard the space
shuttle Columbia and it has been
operating for 16 years and so what I do
in my day job is I am the press officer
which means that I translate the results
from the telescope that scientists you
know we have the discoveries and turn
them into press releases press briefings
web stories whatever in a big part of
telling the story of what has been
discovered involves images and that
leads you down a bit of a path in and of
itself so most people when they see
something say from Hubble they'll say
okay if I had a big enough telescope I
would get I would see that with my eyes
which is actually not really true but
we'll get to that but if you start
talking about x-rays p
we'll start saying well why do you have
a telescope looks at x-rays and so you
inevitably have to talk about there are
different kinds of light and you go
through the electromagnetic spectrum and
all this and so it you have to start at
the beginning which is that there is
more than the light that we can see with
our eyes we take this for granted if
you're in a technical field or involved
with physics in any way but most people
don't know that they just think of light
as being illumination so that was sort
of one of the reasons that I ended up
doing we my co-author Kim mark and and I
ended up doing the light book which is
somewhere in the room to basically just
expose people to the different kinds of
light that are out there get that one
and how even if you don't know it you
use different kinds of light every day
and they affect us in different ways the
book I me really focus on today however
I should that's the white book there is
coloring the universe and the story
behind that book is our good friend
Travis rector is an astronomer up in the
University of Alaska and until recently
I think he was the only astronomer in
the whole state of Alaska hey thinking I
was a friend or a graduate student and
he has done a lot of work over the years
taking images from places like Kitt Peak
and Gemini and other mainly ground-based
telescopes and turning them into pretty
pictures and that is something that some
astronomers don't do they just get their
data to analyze it and they go on their
merry way Travis over the years has
found I think both joy and personal
satisfaction and purpose in turning the
data that he takes and turning them into
beautiful images that the public can
understand and use and you see these
images everywhere you see them on
posters you see them on you know
billboard you see them probably on and
if i should say this on the back of I'm
apples you know the screen savers you
know whatever I mean space images are
very very popular and that you know
their popularity i think is a testament
to the fact that people are interested
in space but there's a downside is in
our digital world and that means that
people often question is what they're
seeing real I mean we live in you know
Star Wars will come out next week in
case you haven't heard there's a lot of
digital effects out there there's a lot
of
so there's you know a lot of digital
effects out there in everything from
movies to whatever and there's a lot of
photoshopping and we now live in an age
where to photoshop is a verb and it's
often a negative one right so people you
know have approached Travis and if
approached Kim and myself over the years
and said that's really pretty but you
know what you just made it up or is that
really how it looks or whatever so the
coloring the universe book is really
aimed at explaining exactly how
astronomers get these pictures where the
colors come from and also you know how
we all the steps that we take to get
there so i will give you a little bit of
an overview about what's in the book and
then give you some resources at the end
if you want to hear more so just to go
back to the electromagnetic spectrum so
Chandra is the one obviously the bottom
it looks at x-rays if you look at the
bottom you'll certainly sort of
backwards the left hand is gamma rays
the right hand is radio waves and you
can see that astronomers have an amazing
tool kit at their disposal these days
but basically and this is just a sample
have telescopes that look at almost
every single part of the electromagnetic
spectrum and they really need this not
just for fun we need is to fit in all
the pieces of the puzzle that they have
in order to get the complete picture of
the universe the nice corollary to that
is that while they're answering these
scientific questions you often can get
great data to make spectacular images
and these multi-wavelength images I
would argue are some of the most
profound ones we have out there in fact
sometimes it looks almost the single
wavelength images almost look to me how
to make it so I'll show you some
examples in just a minute but you know
we use this analogy for the public that
you know if you just have your visible
light if you just had the light that we
can see with our eyes and you had to go
and so say you have an alien friend that
comes to the United States and I'm from
Boston so you take him to Fenway and but
the alien can only see down the
third-base line so that's your vision if
you just had visible light so you're
trying to explain the game to
alien friend he's got to figure out the
rules like the school were all that
stuff it's next to impossible that would
be you know if even if you had if you
had Hubbell you would only be seen down
the third-base line if you just look at
the universe in visible light of course
you know I actually own take that's
Fenway but anyhow you need the whole
visible spectrum from Radio to gamma
rays and everything in between in order
to I don't know where it's from anyhow
to really get a full picture of the
universe oh so it's Cleveland okay
anyhow not my photo so anyhow of what do
astronomers do and why do they do it so
there's a little bit of misconception
about what telescopes do so let me start
with with what that involves there are
three goals of a telescope in very rough
form very basic forms the first is to
magnify and this is what most people
think of when they think of telescopes
they think that they kind of work with
binoculars you go you look out you see
something that's really really tiny and
it makes it bigger and that's some
degree of true i mean that's what a
telescope can do but that's not all it
does when more importantly it collects
light and that means that you can take
you can get more photons of very faint
objects that are often very far away
that's very important because our eyes
cannot do that no matter how much we
wish they could and the third thing is
we'll get to more is it expands what we
can see beyond the range of our eyes
what our eyes cannot see if the
electromagnetic spectrum were a keyboard
a piano keyboard the the amount that we
could see maybe two or three keys around
middle C it's really a very small
portion of all of the light that's out
there so what we astronomers do is they
build telescopes to expand that vision
both for magnification faintness and
also getting outside those few keys on
the keyboard for example just to give a
number here this is this this amount of
collecting space we have in the human
eye it's about a quarter of an inch
across you can only collect light
through the people it's not very fun up
not very big very good for getting
around the Earth and interacting but not
so good when
are talking about getting you know very
distant objects and seeing what's going
on by comparison this is the eight meter
telescope that was is now Gemini North
and we were just talking a second before
people came in there there are plans of
the works to make a 30-meter telescope
wouldn't be probably a single piece of
glass like this but it would be 30 meter
which is really big I mean the biggest
amateur telescope would be probably two
feet across this is 27 feet across so
you're talking about making a surface
area that's much much bigger and can
collect way more light and the other
thing that telescopes can do that human
eye can't is that we the human eye takes
image about 30 times a second not a very
long exposure time for some of the most
famous images we've ever had it's you
know the Hubble extreme deep field I
believe is the equivalent of 50 days
worth of exploding time and granted
you're stitching those together but it's
you can add those because you know you
can that's how it works so this is one
these are what some of the things that
telescopes do that we cannot okay so
what does that all mean and let me just
show you a couple of examples before we
get back to sort of how we make the
images and going back to the need for
different telescopes so this is the
famous supernova I'm gonna Cassiopeia A
and this is a star that exploded about
400 years ago the night sky and this is
an image from Hubble and it's you know
it's pretty it's nice you can see from
the film entry structure and this stuff
that we're seeing here is glowing at
about 10,000 degrees which again pretty
hot and that's that's nice but in order
to sort of really see it um if you add
in x-ray light from from Chandra you see
that it's much much different picture so
the difference between go back and we
can add these together and these are
actually two separate images and we'll
get get to the combined image in a
little bit and what do we do in order to
get to these images um the images that
come down from telescopes like Chandra
and Hubble and so on so forth they come
to us well from space telescopes that
come to us as ones and zeros for example
a telescope like Chandra we take the
ones and zeroes and we know where each
photon has landed on the ccd detector
and you is an event
and you can basically print out you know
where you can name the photons if they
want it and sometimes they do and they
translate those event tables into black
and white images and that's where
Photoshop comes in so in Photoshop what
people who make images from astronomical
data do is they make layers which i'm
sure you guys if you have used photoshop
are familiar with and these layers are
then colored and this is what i think a
lot of the confusion arises is that
people think that the colors from
astronomical images are somehow either
they're randomly assigned or they are
they're either a real color image or a
false color image and I'll get to the
topic of false color too because that's
in a very unfortunate term the term of
false color because it's somehow this
implies that things are being faked and
again we're back to this issue of
Photoshop and is it it somehow gives the
public at least the perception that
scientists are making it up and you know
taking out their box of crayons and just
coloring things as they want like oh
this part will be blue and this part
will be red and it's actually really not
how we do it so we instead translate
what is this into as I said these event
tables that are then made into black and
white images just so you understand how
something like Chandra works it's
Chandor's in space like Hubble and
something goes off in the universe
Chandra observes it and then it relays
its data every eight hours or so down
from the satellite through what's called
the Deep Space Network and then those
data are then translated are then sent
to our headquarters at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge
Massachusetts and eventually given to
the scientist who proposed that
observation so it comes it arrives to
the scientists obviously electronically
and there is no image at that point
scientists then take the data and then
probably do something like this which
you know is useful for the scientific
community
you know that's a real x-ray image on
the side but it really isn't some very
useful for communicating to the public
what is being seen what is you know what
the context is and so on so forth so we
need to find a way to translate the raw
black and white data into something
that's meaningful and color helps give
it meaning so but give you one example
it showed quickly before and that's this
image which is the so-called pillars of
creation this particular version i'll
show you an updated version later was
taken in 1995 by hubble and it's perhaps
one of most famous astronomical images
ever taken the steps you see are just a
byproduct of the camera on hubble that
took it and when it came out it really I
I think it really captured the
imagination of a lot of people it looks
you know unworldly it looks oh it looks
like it's black and white it was in
color it looks even better and the
colors come from more or less in this
particular case red green and blue
layers that have been stacked together
and I'm going to not remember exactly
which layer is which but these are not
either the colors are layers of specific
elements that are being admitted so I
think once oxygens one sulfur and a
kimber with a third want the top of my
head and this leads me to sort of talk
about sort of the different ways you can
take astronomical images some
astronomical images are called broadband
images which basically means that a
telescope looks at a chunk of the
electromagnetic radiation you know all
of visible light let's say and then in
that broadband emission you can choose
to cut it up in different ways you can
choose to cut up low medium and high you
can do this for x-rays you can do it for
radio waves you can do it however you
want this is sort of this used to be the
standard of how people would do
astronomical imaging they would low
medium high to correspond to you know
how the eye works and that's one way to
do it and it also mirrored how
photography was developed and how
astronomy developed with photography
over the 20th century
as we move into the 20th and 21st
century we now have way more colors and
options at our disposal the red green
and blue palette does work sometimes and
sometimes creates very spectacular
imagery however it's not something that
astronomers adhere to you don't have to
stick with that color scheme it does
make sense on a physical physically to
some degree that low represents the
lowest energy green the medium and blue
the highest but the point is that
astronomers sometimes I hear that and
sometimes don't and it's not random but
there is an aesthetic component that
goes into the decision and it really is
to show both what is the scientific
point of the image and also what is the
most beautiful image in striking image
you can take because if you are making
images that are distracting and not
appropriate or not you know attractive
to people then they're not going to
consume the information you're hoping to
get out of that image so so for example
here's another example of an image that
is not red green and blue at all this is
an x-ray image it's an x-ray image of a
supernova remnant called g2 92 and some
other stuff at the end which I forget
and this tell this image the important
part of this image was to show the
elements that they ass I anticipated
this exploded star so as you guys
probably know supernovas seed the
universe with important elements like
oxygen and hydrogen I mean oxygen and
silicon and you know the calcium in your
bones and the iron in your blood and
understanding exactly how they do this
is very important to astronomers and and
you know to also for us since we were a
byproduct of some long-ago supernova so
this particular image was colored using
the color scheme down at the bottom
oxygen isn't yellow and orange neons and
red magnesium green silicon and sulfur
and blue and it really depends on the
data set you have and showing you know
what is important and working with the
scientists you took the data to sort of
tell the story visually of what they're
trying to communicate and then finding
that balance between making
aesthetically pleasing and also
scientifically accurate is something
that that we do so there's always you
always basically have to look a little
bit deeper at the images to really find
out what's going on but I'll pause here
from Roma to say that the one of the
things that we really pride ourselves on
is that everything is transparent as far
as what we do there is again this
potential mistrust of scientists and
whatnot that there's somehow you know
manipulating the data in an in sort of
negative way doing things are not real
not you know it's made up you know we've
all heard their conspiracy theories out
there for everything from the moon
landings to whatever you know they're it
we take it very very seriously that in
be working for NASA that we are very
open and honest and about what is done
to every single piece of data and that
it's reproducible and we actually have a
lot of tools that we have make available
to the public that you can go take the
data and do the same thing and that we
don't just randomly color certain
features a certain color these are the
layers of data that's you know the layer
of oxygen is what it is and that's we
don't cut it out if it's inconvenient
and we don't you know so I mean it's
very important that you know whatever
decision is made about everything from
cropping to color to whatever that those
are disclosed because otherwise you'd
leave room for criticism and disbelief
and we know that scientists and you know
don't need any more disbelievers out
there right now you know we know that
we're here to sort of promote science
not give someone and a reason to attack
it so that's one of the things that we
are very my day job very adamant about
and one the reasons why we did the book
was that we want people to understand if
they're curious what actually goes into
making these images so there's no no
potential for distrust sometimes we use
images that involve more than three
colors as we did in the last one this
one involves seven this is an image from
Hubble of the galaxy NGC 1512 and again
II it by adding all these separate
pieces up combine them in one image
that's what you see in the middle
we also make the separate layers
available to so that you can as a lay
person or just interested whatever you
can see what went into the final product
what ocupa won't go and find the final
product but we make that available in
case they want to so it's not a mystery
like hey you just made that up going on
further to talk about you know different
kinds of objects that give off different
kinds of light perhaps the nearest and
dearest to us that we can all relate to
is our son I mean these are images
excuse me from the solar dynamic
Observatory and the camera or exactly
how many different wavelengths are
represented here but a handful our son
gives up almost every kind of light from
radio waves to to gamma rays and we you
know need to study all of them and so
you know these kinds of images are used
to sort of help show people the
different features of the Sun what
happens in different wavelengths what
happens to different temperatures and
they're all important and so I think
again the most important thing to do
with something like this is to explain
to the public what we're doing why the
colors are used or at least which ones
are used because the thing is you know
color adds information you know if we
were to look at a weather map we have
you know we're getting a big storm
coming through here in Seattle you look
at a Doppler radar screen if it's in
black and white you don't know where the
heaviest rain is you'll can adopt a
radar screen with you know red is the
most intense and greens lilies you know
you can you understand more you get more
information it's the same thing in
astronomy it's the same thing in
scientific images it's just you have to
explain it you just can't just assume
people without that knowledge base are
going to automatically understand
without that explanation and that you
know sort of jargon-free example so you
know going elsewhere in the solar system
we take pictures of other planets to so
color is important we call the Mars the
red planet for good reason it was this
is a picture taken from the Curiosity
rover back in 2012 you know we have to
calibrate what the planetary guys do
you is that they will calibrate the sky
so that it matches up with a sky that we
would recognize and to therefore
calibrate the red so you can land on
Mars and take pictures but if it's not
calibrated right right it just looks odd
so this is a merged I think from the two
of two images above the one below and so
their color Corrections done all the
time especially in science in again for
good reason sometimes we take images
from different kinds of wit telescopes
I've so far I think just showing you
images of different colors found within
one wavelength x-rays or visible what is
your reason to combine them together one
of those famous objects is the Crab
Nebula exploded why is it 10 I came over
the date-time that about thousand years
ago what's that 50 full there you go
thank you almost a thousand years ago so
that famous object was observed by
Chinese and other astronomers around the
world at the time and since then it's
probably one of those observed objects i
would say in astronomy and this will
show you what it looks like if you take
a look at it in different kinds of light
this is the x-ray image from Chandra you
can see it sorta looks like a little
vortex or whatever this is some infrared
data also and if you add in hubble
optical that's that you can see the
outer shell that it's moving into and
you combine them all together and it
really provides context that I think
otherwise is just lost you know and you
need to have you know these pictures but
again you notice the color scheme blue
red and purple it doesn't really follow
the chromatic which is the red green
blue color scheme this is these
decisions are made again by the working
with the scientists and working with the
professionals about what's going to make
the best image and we again try to fully
disclose certain long the way so that
when this image goes out there it's not
just throwing out there into the public
it actually has some context and we now
have in the astronomical community we've
done a lot of work with metadata so that
even if these things are randomly found
on the internet the some of the
important information about color and
other things are embedded within the
data so that you know we're trying to
make it as uniform as possible that it
there's sort of proof of purchase if you
find this image you can try trace it
back to where it really really came from
and it's not that information is not
lost similarly we can look at things
like galaxies the pinnace is the
pinwheel galaxy otherwise known as m101
and this takes four different telescopes
x-rays from Chandra it takes I think
it's galax which is ultraviolet then we
have that is Spitzer and this is Hubble
I believe put them all together and you
end up with that again some of these
images are again look kind of funny to
me when they don't have the different
wavelengths stuck together and each
element gives you different pieces of
information x-rays will tell you where
exploded stars are where x-ray binaries
are if we read for example will tell you
where the dust is in a galaxy the
optical light will tell you where you
know the older you know stars are and
ultraviolet I where the younger stars
are so you put all these pieces together
to get a complete picture another
example is the cat's eye nebula which is
a planetary nebula which actually has
nothing to do with the planet it's a
really bad name for this category it's
really just the end life of a star like
our Sun our Sun one day we'll go through
this phase when it runs out of fuel and
sheds its outer layers and so we can
look at it with x-rays and you can see
the middle of it it's just sort of the
hotter coon that's right around the star
and then you add in the optical layers
and then you can see sort of what has
happened in the context of the shedded
layers with the ongoing heated material
in the middle so just to shift gears a
little bit i just want to mention that
again it's not a random we don't do this
without thought or what
out sort of understanding some of the
consequences we actually we studied some
of these choices my cult my coworker Kim
she came our Candice led a group called
aesthetics and astronomy it's a research
organization project that is combined
astrophysicists with psychologists and
studying how people will react to color
and how they react to color and
scientific imagery in particular
astronomical imagery but also to better
really understand as opposed to just
going with our sort of gut feeling like
I think this works for the public
there's really some research behind what
is you what is useful and what is not
what's confusing what is not and part of
that has to do with understanding visual
grammar you know we understand that
those mountains in the background are
bluer and that means are farther away so
there are ways to sort of select color
in astronomical dena macol imagery that
will help guide the eye in a way that
makes us as humans interpret the data in
a way that will perhaps convey depth
convey distance that this is behind that
this is you know closer than that also
the issue of heat we talked about you
know if you're familiar with physics you
know that the hottest things are blue
and but if you talk to the public
they'll say that red is hot so what do
you do in that situation if you're
trying to convey something is hot do you
make it blue which is scientifically as
you know scientifically correct or do
you make it red and these are choices
that you have I mean you're not
distorting anything you're not you're
simply making a color choice and so this
was one example that we be tested or
Kim's group tested this is NGC 46 96
it's an elliptical galaxies in the
Centaurus cluster about 150 million
light-years from Earth and we originally
did this I think this was the original
one this was the original one and so
blue is the hotter stuff that's what you
wanted to be but people we'd when you
tested it they thought that the writer
stuff was hotter so
it's a matter of you know you can flip
them and you know it it seems like an
arbitrary choice but it's actually
important because if your point is to
tell people what's hot in an image of
what is cool you have to understand your
audience decide and by the way the
aesthetics and astronomy project
includes astrophysicists that we we test
and it's often diametrically opposed to
what the public things so it depends
what your audience is if you're talking
to your scientific colleagues you give
an image where blues hot but if you
really want the public to sort of at
their first glance when they're flipping
through their their news or their you
know looking at a strong a picture of
the day if you want them to understand
or think about something being hot you
might pick red and is there a right way
to do it not really you can argue both
ways but I think the most important
thing is that you is it you give a
thought and you and you disclose what
you've done and you know label what
you're what colors are what be very
upfront about it and I think the other
thing that our research has shown is
that the public will voraciously consume
any of this stuff you really have to
have clear information that goes with it
because otherwise it's meaningless at
the end so I mean we found it almost
what the image look like didn't matter
what it did matter of course but it was
also equally important to have well
written clear captions to go with it
otherwise you can have the most
beautiful image in the world and people
might look at it like hey it's cool and
walk on and you have something that's
kind of funky looking and you explained
it well enough and you're going to hook
them and you know my job is I think to
hook people on science and to get them
you know engaged and so I think that it
Image azhar one of the strongest things
we have going for us in science
especially in a field like astronomy
going so I just wanted to just shift
gears a little bit and talk about
something that was kind of a fun topic
at the end of the coloring the universe
book that is our final chapter because
it's one of these things that always
makes the rounds of you know the
internet or whatever one way or another
and often involves astronomy it's the
phenomenon I did
spelled it wrong pareidolia it should be
this is extra d in there so ignore that
first II um and this is the phenomenon
of seeing familiar things especially
faces in in noise or data or whatever um
and you know you always hear about like
you know seeing Jesus Christ and toast
or you know the Virgin Mary on a
windowsill whatever but it happens all
the time in astronomy which we thought
was kind of a funny thing and so we kind
of played with it a little bit at the
end of the book and one of the most
famous cases is the face on Mars that's
the corner image is the image from
Viking in 1976 and it looks kind of like
a face and freaked people out totally I
mean this is pre-internet obviously so
like imagine what would happen now so
you know this is an updated version from
the Redeemers Reconnaissance Orbiter
back in 2012 there is no face there is
no person I think there were some bad
movies actually made on the lower right
because of the lower right image I you
know William Hollywood but it's not just
you know Mars this is this image that I
was involved with we put out and it was
nicknamed the hand of God which it was
not our name for it at all we knew it
had sort of hand like structures but you
could imagine that people saw this and I
don't know you know apocalypse or
whatever was coming but you know there's
a ton of these images in in astronomy
and they're there you know we kind of I
think you just gonna play with it and
just kind of kind of go with it but you
know it's also another way when it
happens to sort of give people a reason
to hook them in and explain what's
really going on that this is really a
pulsar in the middle of that thing
that's spewing out high energy x-rays
and that this is what it is it's
actually not you know someone reaching
in you know anyhow but there's things
that are all over the place you know
this is the famous horse head nebula
that why because it looks like a horse
you know this is not some of this is
pretty obvious some of its pretty
far-fetched but if you're interested you
could take a look at the last chapter I
did want as your sort of end by just
mentioning the book one more time this
is that one it's in BBC sky at night
which has got a review which is fun and
I just mentioned a couple of other if
you want to learn more about any of this
stuff I'm going to be giving a town hall
event on tuesday about the light book so
it'll be not so much about astronomy as
much it is about the whole electromatic
Mick electromagnetic spectrum which I
need to say better in it and I say that
many times and Travis vector who was the
first author of the coloring universe
book he's going to be in town 2 times
the next couple weeks 1 it ADA's which
is in capitol hill and then he's also
giving a talk to the Seattle
astronomical society meeting over on you
doves campus and I think that's and both
of those are open to the public and free
so I would encourage you if you guys are
interested in learning more of the real
nuts and bolts about Luke's visible
light imagery and all that to try to get
to one of those talks with Travis or if
you want to hear more about the light
book your encourage you to come to that
one and I will just end by saying this
is how you can get in touch with me I do
have the day job which is the Harvard
address and then I have a gmail account
for my stuff on the side which is
basically the books so with that well
thank you and I'm happy to take any
questions ok all right this question
here I thank you very much less graceful
thank you you mentioned the importance
of communicating the choices of color
here what major raising given image but
they're often seems to be an
inconsistent way of doing that sometimes
it's intense sometimes there's color key
have you explored having a standard way
of including a color key on the image so
that it travels with the image is
obviously all of the format's of images
that get transferred around the internet
don't have an easy way of taking that
with its actually including a color of
the color key on the image itself could
be a useful way if it's standardized
could you kiss or a token of it I
understand those choices yeah that's
that would be ideal I would have to say
that um you know it's sort of like
herding cats with astronomers everyone
you know does their own thing to some
degree and there has been a lot of even
as being the metadata stuff worked out
and having the major observatories
participate and you know Curtis we
talked more about this you know I met
Curtis years ago with worldwide
telescope stuff and part of that is
getting the images in a format that is
uniform enough that can be used in
something like worldwide telescope and
and having it consistent you know to
have a color key on something that goes
out there going to people who don't want
some any labels on their images you know
you're gonna have people you know
there's so many different any of you
have just you know you have major
observatories that have staffs like like
ours that will make images and we'll
work together with other major
observatories you also have people sort
of single astronomers who make a pretty
picture and put it out there so it's
really hard to get that consistency um I
think it would be really great you know
just sort of have that sort of template
almost um it's really hard to get there
though so unfortunately I think so I
think the best you can do is you know
one things we've done for example on the
Chandra website is that we if we do a
multi-wavelength image we always have a
clickable you know layer so you can you
can say oh this is the radio that you
can play with them and stack them in
whatever so you can see what's what
because if you see one of these combine
images it's really hard to piece out
what is what and what information comes
from what layer so you know it we try to
do it to what we think is the best
standard but it's hard to get everyone
on the same page I guess it's probably
unfortunately my sort of non answer for
that good idea yes there's sort of an
ordering to the layering that you do or
do you always make them okay so you can
see through things or is that important
um we there's not an ordering per se and
sometimes for example we will make some
some layers a little less opaque for
example so if we're trying to show for
example somebody's x-ray images and we
want to put it on a starry background
because that makes it
West abstract psychedelic funky
jellyfish floating in the air kind of
thing then we make the we if that star
fields really intense it might overpower
the x-rays so we might tone down the
layer so those two there are choices
like that sometimes they're all equal it
really depends but it you know we try to
you know usually they're pretty much as
they are especially if it's like radio
and x-ray or you you know but there are
some times when you might you know tone
down the starfield for example or bring
up something else a little more the
layers are great for that so yeah I
noticed on your on the layered images
that you had of the nebula mhm the
spectrums had slightly different
frequencies is that because different
scientific teams have to access the
different equipments that actually
explode exposing different frequencies
is that way well so every observation
you can so you request for Chanin for
example you're going to use a certain
instrument and you're going to get a
certain amount of information back from
certain over a certain wavelength range
and then when you get that information
back some of that information and from
various wavelengths is not as useful as
others it's very either for example it
gives off very strong emission at a
certain wavelength so you would actually
splice out just that wavelength for that
purpose so it's not that it's different
scientists it's that you're just really
using the pieces of data that make the
most sense also with something like
Hubble or ground-based telescope you can
choose to use different filters you
actually physically put different
filters on the telescope so you're only
letting certain light come through so it
really depends on what where the data
came from what it was used for
originally all these data go on to
public archives at a certain point so
for some of the images you can just pull
the best of what looks the best it
depends on when the image was made and
again there's a lot of variables that go
into it so don't know if that answers
your question or not
guess the fall under that where I was
kind of going was if I look at those
images and realize that there are
slightly different frequencies it seems
like that'd be difficult to compare and
contrast in an apple to Apple fashion
right but it makes you make it sound
like that the scientists actually have
much more layering of frequencies
available to them so that they can go
pull together the exact slice of the
spectrum that they're interested in
comparing you know horsehead the cat
side at cravath sure right yeah yeah
there's definitely certain frequency
longs for frequencies that are like
crucial you know iron it submitted a
certain line or you know certain certain
very key frequencies that you are served
diagnostic tools you can use throughout
astronomy or whatever so it really it
definite depends on the image and
depends on the science being done and
then you know making the spectacular
image is generally not the first order
of business it's to get the science done
so what we do is that we use whatever
data we can get our hands on because
what the way they all these telescopes
work is that you propose to a committee
usually once a year I want to look at
this galaxy for this long using this
instrument give me time and money to do
that and if they get it great and then
they're off to write their paper and
that they have that data more or less
for about a year and then it becomes
public access data and so called in the
open archives so we it depends on when
we do the image sometimes we have only
access to that data sometimes we can
pull stuff from the archive to enhance
the data but the scientists themselves
know exactly what you know the way they
can compare one to another and and how
it all fits together just sometimes we
don't have the full range to do that
that make sense yes you ever confer with
kind of Christ and say microbiology her
father's from New CL fields who have
similar sort of the that I can't receive
the little detail that they're observing
it obviously they have different
specific intense because they're really
great about a great emission lines per
se but
just communicating science literacy to
the public so the signature yeah yeah it
actually that's um not to just talk my
book but that some of the things we
haven't in the white book we talk about
that because you definitely have some of
the same issues you're trying to see the
unseen or unseeable you're trying to
explain that you know one example I can
share is that Alyssa Goodman who's a
colleague of Curtis she started his
whole initiative with using medical
imaging with astronomical imaging and
merging those two together because
they're using these techniques to get
MRIs of the brain and get 3d all this
stuff and she helped implement that for
astronomical images and we use that
actually for Cassiopeia A we did a 3d
model so there are definitely ways that
we can borrow from other fields and
learn from other fields and I think that
that is something that we can do more of
as far as like you know merging you know
using sort of best practices for how do
you explain these very difficult
concepts to you know across different
sciences an ideal world would be that it
was there's some uniformity right so
that it's not confusing to the
non-expert that oh well this time it did
it this way and I don't get this but I
think that's a goal not really you know
but we're working on it let's put that
way yeah so you're basically serving a
projection from the Y range do you have
an information in something physical yes
is there any form acknowledging digital
world you could just you know have the
full spectrum sent and you have shaders
that generates specifically use that you
want well kind of more what I mean are
you saying like you want just pick an
object and then see in all the different
kinds of light or for example example of
the red and blue yes you can have this
view or that view hmm and now these when
you have books then you could serve only
one well in digital format you could
have different this shows the materials
this shows the heat this shows hmmm have
these confused yeah I mean you know
there's well first of all I have said
it'll I mentioned earlier there's almost
all these the major telescopes now have
a
publicly available tools that you can
download and grab real data and you can
make your own image and do it yourself
that's a little more work than maybe
what you're suggesting um you know as
far as seeing it and just be able to
flip the colors you know with a switch
or a button we're not quite there yet
there are tools like for example and say
worldwide telescope where you can go to
an object and see every image this has
been taken of it in you know probably
not every wavelength but know most of
the wavelengths that are available and
you can click through them and see and
again get some explanation for what the
colors are I'm not sure we're ready yet
to just be like show me what the heat is
and show me what this is quite yet but
that would be a really fun tool to have
and it would be very informative right
so you can really just sort of say I
want to know what you know this is doing
um so you talked to Jonathan Fey about
when he comes back tell me what that
tool and for my telescope in all its
spare time yeah yes absolutely enjoyed
the what you just saying um cuz there
this is definitely getting more
technical but has there been any effort
into perhaps creating a new file format
that all it does is for astronomy images
or I guess even for medical images
layers this information and says okay
this layer contains h alpha theta this
layer contains oxygenated but the image
format the file format itself has that
embedded in it so it's not a JPEG or
owned or anything and that would allow
you to easily click through and recover
all the few slaves like instantly I have
no idea that's what is mine is not my my
experience it's a great question I don't
I you know that's sort of a Robert hurt
question there are people who like no
could answer that question but I'm not
sure about that it would be you know
something to look consider for sure
anything else any other questions oh
that
