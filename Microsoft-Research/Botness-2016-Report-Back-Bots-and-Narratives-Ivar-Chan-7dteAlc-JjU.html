narratives so the big question right off
the bat was what is a narrative and the
approach like the three day four day
narrative versus the how do you get them
back on the thirtieth day pretty much
everyone in the brew in the meeting said
you know 30 day problem still trying to
figure out amy-jo had some pretty good
experience from the gaming world to
share with the team on how gaming MMO
and their use of bots helps get reach
ain't retention and a 30 day period so
that was a good discussion and then we
talked about um the concept that when a
user is talking to a character bot if
it's a fictional bot if you talk to it
and you ask is it you know are you real
that seems to be one of the first
questions that most users like to ask if
it's a fictional character like Miss
Piggy the the right code of conduct
through their experience with talking to
users is you should say it's a fictional
character so Miss Piggy as Miss Piggy
but if it's Jennifer Lawrence what the
in-person guys found was that it's
better to say I i am a virtual Jennifer
Lawrence taught that loves to talk to
fans and the surprising response he got
back was ninety percent of the people
that respondent says I love you as the
next thing so it's a little an intuitive
but it makes sense from a fan's context
I would say there was a lot of them kind
of brainstorming and narrative structure
is it directed is it a kind of a direct
conversation is it completely open ended
kind of the difficult part creating
narrative that all anyone here is trying
to clear narrative is the concept of
having a map of conversations and be
able to jump from different parts of the
map I think we're all trying to figure
that out but it's good to kind of
visualize
and I think the last part of our
conversation was more on a gamification
how to bring on the principle is that a
lot of the Amy Jones experience with
building bots of MMOs we haven't seen a
lot of group BOTS with narratives in our
space yet and I think that's going to be
coming in the next quarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
