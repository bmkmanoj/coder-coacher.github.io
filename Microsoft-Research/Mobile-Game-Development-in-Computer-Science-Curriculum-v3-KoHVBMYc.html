you
welcome it's my pleasure today to have a
stone-cold koski here from Central
Connecticut State University and I was
fascinated by his long history of trying
to teach mobile application development
to beginning students I'm very exciting
excited to hear more about this today
Nikolai thank you very much for for
introducing me well whether it's a long
history or not you know longevity is a
very very subjective issue I've been
doing this since probably 2008 maybe
2009 but I will I'll talk some more
about that a little later today so what
I wanted to talk about is not just any
kind of application development for
mobiles but specifically mobile game
development and where it fits into the
academic curriculum well to begin with I
think it's quite obvious it doesn't
matter how serious a person is how many
academic or other achievements person
has we grow up with games what are their
mobile games toys whatever it is that's
where we start just like a five-year-old
would take a toy car you know when he go
shopping when his mom a ten-year-old
would take maybe an iPod packed with
games and 15 year old and onwards will
take a mobile phone because not on what
they can play games they can do other
things an interesting trend that's been
going on for some time is that not only
we're playing with toys we are playing
with gadgets that are far more than toys
and all these gadgets walkman portable
radios they're converging so today the
thing that you carry in your pocket is
no longer just a mobile phone let's say
ten years ago it could have been a
device designed for just one purpose
today that one little tiny box or
whatever shape it is it suited for so
many different things
it's your media portal you can watch
videos you can keep in touch with
friends you can play games you can do
all sorts of things capturing videos and
then picture is and it's all in your
pocket all the time question is how is
this all happening today um well I mean
these are quite obvious things but we
don't really notice all these obvious
things because we kind of surround are
surrounded with them if you if you're
told anybody let's say 15 years ago that
hey you know you will be able to browse
the web well some people 15 years ago
didn't even know what what the web was
but if you could browse the web using
this little tiny computer geek earring
in a pocket that you know that was very
would would have been quite difficult to
imagine the these little tiny things
these mobile phones that we carry in our
pockets today well they pretty much have
the same power that desktop computers
had 15 years ago again right now we're
kind of we're kind of taking it for
granted but uh if if anybody told me
that this is how things are going to be
uh you know to myself 15 years ago that
would have been quite difficult for me
to wrap my head around this so not only
technology evolves the way how how us
how people and young people you know
school kids high school kids how they
interact with technology it also changes
I like to ask my students a question a
very very simple question okay so if I
ask you what comes to your mind when you
think about computers or technology in
general what would that be and again
when envisioning their answer i'm trying
to answer this question to myself you
know 15 or 20 years ago when i would
think well gee probably a pc that I had
when I was on a no 17 or 18 and you know
i was playing games writing some basic
programs you know for me that was
technology that was computer um in a 17
year old or an 18 year old 20 year old
in my classroom would say well TC what's
that I don't know what pcs are you know
it's my mobile phone that's that's what
I use for
basically everything for a lot of kids
these days the first technology device
that they get is a mobile phone or
perhaps an iPod or something like that
and later on maybe they'll get a laptop
or a PC PCs are all people would say
well you know they're on the way out
it's kind of the technology platforms
they're moving away from that the only
reason why I'm talking about pcs is
although the technology overall is
evolving the way how we're teaching
technology or anything in general it
seems to be stalled and you know kind of
frozen and literally the last century
and it's not only about teaching
computer science it's just teaching in
general now I have to make a very
important disclaimer I'm not trying to
say that oh because there is this new
technological innovation we have to
immediately switch our switch the way
how we're teaching using that new
technology what comes to mind even
though I'm not that old but let's say
when these are the stories that I hear
from my you know senior colleagues they
said when TV was first invented and was
brought into everybody's homes everybody
was saying ok distance education you
know taking courses via TV or mail order
VHS tapes that's the future how far did
this get us probably not that far but
distance education hybrid courses as an
idea it's kind of you know taking off so
i'm not talking about education in
general i'm talking about education in
computer science today if you walk into
a typical classroom a lab a studio what
do you see you see desktops and to do a
typical freshman that's not what they
envisioned as you know a high-tech
environment that's it's not what they
perceive as the embodiment of you know
modern technology again to them it's
something small something that you have
in your pocket with a simple GUI but not
that monster that you know that they
would see in a lab and I'm not
exaggerating
it's not just you know in smaller
universities that you know they're stuck
with with BC labs even a bigger very
well funded universities their kind of
mass access computer labs are still
dominated with VCS not not that this is
a problem at all but this mode of
teaching it it has a certain number of
implications and again I'm talking all
about computer science only about well
specifically about introductory computer
courses well traditionally when you get
into CS 1 so what are you taught
structured programming maybe java
classes and such and what kind of
examples are you getting all right well
let's calculate average salary of a some
employee well that's really exciting
really and these kinds of examples that
students see in their classes I mean if
they if they have their mind already
made up that yes studying computer
science and programming this is what I
want to do nothing on nothing is going
to change my mind fine no problem
however for a typical student these days
who are kind of thinking well maybe I
like this maybe I don't want like that
maybe I want to you know take this
course I kind of think I want to do
computer science but I'm not sure so I'm
going to try this cs1 and see how it
goes oftentimes the feeling that they
get is that computer science is coding
well it's computer science coding or not
coding or programming some people would
say the same thing some people would
argue that it doesn't regardless but
programming is a necessary component
some people would say it's a necessary
evil it doesn't matter how you perceive
that there is no computer science
without programming that's granted but
is computer science just about coding
and programming hell no it isn't there
are so many more other things that are
going on there and it's really really
important to convey these ideas to
students in introductory classes because
we are literally at risk of losing them
and I'm not saying this because this is
my subjective opinion if you
enrollment trends after the after the
big peak around late I'm always confused
how to call these years 1990s right
1990s two early two thousands there was
a big peak and then it's kind of fell
off the cliff in the last three or four
years well maybe two or three i should
say they'll the enrollment started
climbing up very very slowly but there
there is an upward trend but still
they're not anywhere near where they
used to be and granted enrollments in
programs such as computer science are a
cyclical but nevertheless we have to
fight for whatever students we got
whoever which every student has
indicated that they have some interest
in computer science we have to grab them
while they're there and try to convince
them that yes indeed if they have some
interest we have to kind of you know
keep that going and try to make them as
engaged in the material as we possibly
can so how do we motivate students it's
always a question some people say well
let's play games i'm not talking about
you know i will be talking about game
development but there is a bigger trend
about using educational games in fact so
my semester started about a month ago
and as usual there was a an introductory
meeting with a Provost you know chief
academic officer and he was all about
games he said well games is is the
latest trend we have to embrace it well
what kind of games again we're not
talking about just computer science or
technology or computers or whatever well
so we can teach through games well in
fact I have a colleague from from a
journalism program and she says well
she's using educational game city
journalism it was a little bit difficult
for me to to kind of process that how do
you play a game and n teach journalism
but she explained it to me and it made
perfect sense it's like you talk about
some made-up story and you're trying to
you have some sources for that and you
work within a team and it's all about
journalism and again I imperil making no
sense here but the way how she explained
it to me it was actually quite
interesting and if i were to study
journalism that kind of what makes sense
question is can we teach everything
through a game can we teach I don't know
English or biology what probably can
question is would that be more
appropriate for I don't know elementary
or middle school or university that's
where it gets me I'm not sure that you
know this game playing kind of stuff is
really appropriate to the university
environment I don't want to make a blank
statement I'm sure there are some
instances where it's basically just what
the doctor ordered but is it a panacea
is it the solution for all the problems
I'm not quite sure still I'm talking
about games I'm not talking about
playing games i'm talking about
developing them so um developing will
gain develop and the development games
developing computer games as as a
motivating technique is nothing you it's
been practiced in computer science
courses for well quite some time now and
it's very very important to to visit two
points that critics of weld game
development and computer science have
have raised the first the first not an
objective but a concern that the voice
that they would normally voice is that
ok so students are playing games or
developing games and you know 2 or
software developer you know there is a
really a blurry line between a
development of a game and playing a game
both is essentially the same thing so
question is how do i balance fun that
students are having with the educational
value and it's a very very valid concern
because if all you do is playing games
are you literally learning anything from
that so we have to keep that in mind the
second objection or a concern was that
they're saying well you know look at the
market of console games that are on the
market
today they are very heavily male
oriented uh there is blood and gore yeah
it's fun but it's fun for male audience
and if we're trying to squeeze that in a
computer class and we're going to
alienate whatever females were getting
it there because they're not into that
well I know some female students are
actually quite into that but there are
too many critics who would say that you
know that this is a problem and this is
another important concern so how can
game develop and really be integrated
into into computer science courses first
of all as I mentioned it would like to
reiterate this is not a new concept
that's been done there are entire
programs aimed at teaching students gain
development gain design and production
there are individual courses so it's
been done there is absolutely nothing
new there the the thing to remember here
is that develop developing of a playable
game is a rather complex task okay well
anybody who have ever played any kind of
engaging game anybody who understands
what it takes to develop a piece of
software would be able to appreciate how
much effort it would have taken to
program this game and design the
gameplay design the graphics and sounds
and everything else and how much skills
it would require how much in the
diversity of all the skills that that
would be required to actually create a a
product like that now if you are in a
program in an entire curriculum which
incorporates many different courses
aimed towards producing somebody capable
of developing a computer game yes
absolutely but remember the focus of
what I'm trying to look at is okay so we
have this kids in cs1 how do we motivate
them
can we give them a console game and say
here let's develop that no it isn't
going to work because they simply do not
have the skills for that it will be
really exciting if they could do that
but but they're not anywhere near the
skill level and that they versatile
different areas and computing and
related areas that that would be
necessary to create a playable game now
there is one class of games that people
typically called casual games that
actually may solve the problem again I'm
not trying to say that this is a
solution to all the problems but casual
games think about games like this one
Angry Birds any kind of puzzle anything
like that what do they all have income
well they're simple meaning that well
simple actually implies a lot of
different things typically there is not
that much animation going on and
whatever animation that there is it's
typically very very simple the logic is
fairly straightforward the gameplay is
again simple there is no long scenario
that you have to go through however or
if there is it's kind of
compartmentalized into levels and you
can pause at any time as a consequence
you can play these games in short
periods of time or in long periods of
time it's really up to you you can start
and stop at any time so you can play you
know during a break between classes
while you're waiting for a bus at the
bus stop or during a boring lecture why
not it's certainly doable a couple of
other things quite good things going on
for going for casual games statistics
show and again I'm not making this up so
they show that these kinds of games
puzzles whatever they are what they call
gender neutral meaning that both males
and females enjoy and play these games
equally there will be no possibility to
alienate or two to attract
disproportionate amount of males or
females everybody should be fine with
these kinds of games
because of all these ball properties if
I might say of these casual games they
actually might be quite suitable for for
for using them in an introductory
classes one other thing it's these
casual games that well I don't want to
say dominate but again they if you think
about the market share of different
kinds of games that other people have on
their mobile phones these are the kinds
of games that people play predominantly
on the mobile phones what else is good
about mobile phones is that well all
students pretty much have them what they
will like it or not they do have them
and they will use them no matter what
you do if you tell the students that you
have to turn it off during class will
they nah they won't they'll just keep on
texting and all you're going to see is
like and they will be looking at their
crotch somewhere and smiling at it yeah
what's so funny going on down there
that's probably your phone your texting
your friend and hopefully you're not
doing it during the test because your
friend may be sitting out there in the
hallway and giving you the answers well
anyway question is this technology is
over you there and if we don't do
anything about it it will be used well
in a quite a disruptive way so instead
of fighting it we might as well just
embrace it and say alright well let's
let's take all these phones that you
already have and do something productive
with them let's try to use them and
develop games forum so why why what are
what are the other reasons why we should
use the mobile phones in addition to
well that they already have them as
already mentioned to a typical college
student a mobile phone is what they
think is the technology today if you
tell them okay so we're going to create
this program that runs from the command
line on this desktop boring now you tell
them all right so we're going to write
some code and you'll have maybe a very
simple but still a game that you can run
on your phone I mean yeah you're
probably going to have to run at an
emulator on your computer but it's
you're done you can put in your phone
and off you go that's exciting at least
well may not be exciting to my senior
colleagues they probably hate me for
saying this I know they do but to
students that's that's their lives
that's that's what they perceive as the
cutting and bleeding edge of technology
these days instant gratification is a
very very important factor why students
like that with mobile phones with mobile
devices when they put a piece of
software on it they can see it run right
there and then they could take this
program with them and show it after
their friends who otherwise might
dismiss them as a computer geek but
they're not computer geeks they have
mobile phones just like everywhere just
like everybody else and it simply raises
their cool factor when they say oh I'm
not just downloading some stupid add
from somewhere I'm developing my own and
you know here it is and you can try it
also again studies and surveys and
everything else that I could possibly
find and my own service that I gave
their students indicate that this is
exactly what students like they do like
that not just the fun factor not just
the factor that it's you know it's in
their pocket but the fact that they can
enjoy the results of the work
immediately and show it off to them it's
I don't want to say the decisive factor
but it's it weighs very very happy
heavily on on students approval level so
to speak of you know what they think is
cool what they think is a good way of
doing things and teaching computing so
I'm in pondering all these things for
for some time around two thousand eight
and then I thought well wouldn't it be
nice to actually put together a course
that that will incorporate all these
ideas for the time being again it was
2008-2009 it was just I was just looking
for a fun course to do something
different
so I thought the course on mobile game
development worked fine I kind of liked
what I did so I put together a paper and
send it to 6c but it's the wealthy
conference in computer science education
in the United States well in fact it's
not a national it's an international
conference but it takes place every year
in in the United States it exists the
conference EDC where nikolai and i met
this summer which is focused on exactly
the same topics but anyhow i believe it
was in 2009 when i had a paper it's 60
ball talking about this these things
that was very well received and somebody
told me well so are you applying for
some some money to get this going I was
like should I I said absolutely so I
wrote a grant proposal to national
science foundation they said go for it
so for the next two years that was kind
of locked in to this project which was
funded by NSF and working on developing
these mobile game mobile game
development modules the idea here is to
create a number of projects that are a
portable that an educator could take and
incorporate into incorporate these
modules one or more into their computer
computer science courses this this
project does this NSF funded project has
been going on for two years as I
mentioned and I've been developing it to
get up with a friend of mine from
rose-hulman Institute of Technology the
way how this modules work the the focus
of each module is to not just a play
game I mean yeah students will get to
play and develop a game well in the
opposite order develop and then play the
game but it's not playing for the for
the sake of playing it's about two
things trying to reinforce some of the
core topics such as for example arrays
or loops or decisions or whatever and at
the same time introduce one or more
advanced topics artificial intelligence
networking databases security why am I
doing this remember one of the premises
that i made in the beginning was that
students do get disillusioned in early
computer science courses so if we expose
them to all the richness of the
discipline that yes there is coding you
have to do that but once you're done
with that you will be able to do all
these other interesting things well we
hope that they're interesting to them
which may or may not be directly related
to to programming say AI or databases
how much programming is there in these
two disciplines well probably there is
some but it's not programming for the
sake of programming so whatever might
tickle their fancy hopefully students
might get to see something other than
just you know programming and see that
oh so this is what computer science is
about this is what you can do with the
computer science degree so each of these
modules are focuses on one or more of
these quote-unquote advanced areas there
are no interdependencies among these
modules instructors can take one or two
or several and put them into their
courses and the primary audience is CS
one data structure is in the courses at
a similar level although I know these
modules have been somebody used them in
a more advanced courses so I'm using
Java in these courses in these modules
and the questions that the question that
I'm getting asked a lot is why why oh
why would you ever use Java I'm asking
that question myself why well if I were
to do this now I would stay away from
this as far as possible not because I
dislike Java no you know I just before
coming here I spend a few days in San
Francisco javaone conference and you
have to admire Oracle for you know all
the supported drumming up but well there
are a couple of reasons why Java is
you know the platform for for this
project again I started this in round
2008 so what kind of alternatives are
there or were there should i say in 2008
for any kind of mobile application
development well android was not
anywhere to be seen iOS was you know
taking off but as with anything coming
from Apple you have to develop your code
on an Apple computer which is great
except that they're expensive and very
few universities have dedicated labs
with max the most important reason
perhaps is that Java is the language
that we're teaching our students these
days if you look at the national
curriculum for computer science it's
java java java java everywhere one of
the objectives of of my project was to
try and engage students that are coming
in a lot of better students should i say
they take advanced placement courses in
high schools there they really don't
have an option if such courses are
offered in their high schools they are
in java so that was pretty much the
primary reason why I stuck with Java and
again at that time it was not just not
just the environment that you know which
edition Java as educators well the best
majority of us at least but also for the
lack of alternatives the biggest reason
why I regret that is because well oh
well one of the thing again back then in
2008 pretty much or 2000 I pretty much
whichever platform you look at except
for except for iOS those phones those
operating systems running on those
phones they could around Java applets
and that wouldn't be a problem they
could they could run native code written
in whatever it might be or they could
also run Java applets these days how
many operating systems mobile operating
systems are there that actually run Java
applets
not too many so um yeah it's it's it's
fun to teach these things but the skills
that the students would get as mobile
application developers in Java they're
not really leaving them anywhere well
I'm general yes yes but but it's a
little bit different java libraries that
i'm using there they are specialized
there is a special java api for sprites
canvases a senator etc etc which there
is a subset of Java called j2me Java to
mobile edition that's what it is yeah I
do love Android um but but it's a little
bit different it's it's something else
so but I want to to make a step back and
say the objective of this project is not
to teach students not to make them
proficient mobile developers not at all
the objective is to allow them to have
some fun while actually learning things
and trying to enjoy the richness of the
discipline through all the diversity
that I can find in a mobile game
development so um I would like to use
one of the modules and try to illustrate
what's what's in there every single
module is based on some well-known game
some of these games are ages old board
games some of the games some of the
modules are based on a well-known
console games or arcade games so there
is a battleship game that everybody i
hope played once in their lives I was
completely appalled when I saw a recent
movie it was a soul scarring experience
i'm not sure how i managed to to be
dragged into movie but my decision to to
use battleship as you know as a platform
for for a game module had nothing to do
with the movie that's that's a
disclaimer that I I feel that I have to
make the movie was that bad anyway so
battleship everybody knows how to play
it
you know it's a two-player game and you
exchange some some moves and when you
tell your opponent wat move you're
getting whooping what move you're making
you know they tell you the results so
everybody knows this so this is a kind
of game that we could except we could
use to teach students a little bit about
clip your networking where our networks
in here well come to think of it the
idea of communication protocols is
central to computer networking and when
the two players exchange information
about their moves well they are
communicating using using a certain
protocol so we do a couple of things
here first of all the students get a big
scaffolding code which already has quite
a bit of the GUI infrastructure and most
importantly message passing protocol we
wouldn't want cs1 students to to the
program sockets no it's already there
for them what they need to do they need
to understand what a communication
protocol is and to implement their own
it might sound like you know a tall
order but actually it's fun and most
students are quite capable of doing this
before they get to play this before they
get to implement this in the mobile
devices I asked them to well play the
game on paper and pencil and think about
the information that they're exchanging
and try to formalize puts put it in some
kind of format by that time in the
course in the cs1 or data structures
they would know about formats they would
know about different ways how they can
formally explain you know the
information that they are sending back
and forth and rules and decisions that
they're making based on what they
receive so all they need to do is to
play the game on paper and pencil and
try to think about the formalities of
that information exchange that's going
on and then simply take that information
and put it in simple code and they can
do it I'm saying it not because I think
they can do it because I know they can
do it because they did it um there are
quite a few other things going on in in
a typical module of course there are
learning objectives and learning
outcomes and
this particular case we expect students
to learn some basics of communication
protocols and be able to implement a
simple protocol in in Java and most
people so this will be their exposure to
an advanced topic a core concept that
they would be reinforcing here is of
course is of course decision making so
this being a module that we would like
other educators to you know to to adopt
we have to bundle with lecture notes and
you know all the good stuff but we're
trying to make it fun for students and
for every module we're trying to give
suggestions as to okay what else can
they do what else can students do with
that scaffolding or the code that
they're going to create well in this
particular case this the framework that
we're giving them essentially would
allow them to to use a framework for any
kind of a turn based games because
that's what it is it's a turn-based game
and they can use that message passing
infrastructure between the two phones to
to do to implement similar games that
use two players also every single module
incorporates this element which i like
to call our creative exploration so
using the same game sometimes it's been
out the obvious but it's often quite
easy how you can completely turn the
semantics of a game kind of on top of
its head so for for the battleship game
there is a game called crazy gardeners
we don't implement it we just give
students enough enough graphics /
motives and backgrounds and sounds and
everything else that they can use to do
that so crazy gardener is a game of well
two gardeners who have nice flower beds
and what they're trying to do they're
trying to destroy their flower beds
sounds ridiculous but actually students
like that especially those who like
destroy things and they don't have to
fiddle much with a code once they have
it all you need to do is to replace
syrup
place the graphics assets of course well
knowing what they're doing just to give
you an idea there is another module that
implements a connect for this module of
course is aimed at teaching some big not
teaching introducing students to some
basics of artificial intelligence but
this particular module I would like to
illustrate why a game like this would be
especially interesting to be offered on
a mobile device so with all the good
things about the mobile operating
systems and everything the device is in
which this proton which this code runs
they are resource constraint there is
not as much memory as you would find on
a typical desktop and no virtual memory
to speak of and the processor is as good
as they are there is still much slower
so when you give when you give students
some scaffolding with what different
handlers where they can write their own
or substitute different search
heuristics they could easily run into
situations where their search space just
explodes and the program runs out of
memory and that's a very very good
teaching moment to explain to them what
search space is and you know how it
relates the memory or another situation
when arm well maybe the game would not
run out of space but it might grind to a
screeching halt if if the searcher
istics are just happened to be too slow
again a good teaching moment explaining
what is going on and teaching them the
balance between space and time in terms
of computer programming so so good but
we have to figure out whether this is
actually working and see what the
students think so we went listed a
couple of professionals who all that
they do is they do institutional
research they you know give different
surveys to students and they do their
own magic so I won't bother you with
with all the boring acronyms and stuff
like that but what we're trying to
measure here is did our so what we win
we give students this the
game development project doesn't have
any kind of effect on student
persistence on student engagement and
motivation one important thing to keep
in mind it was not our objective to try
to improve students student grades we
want them to be more interested we
wanted to be more motivated in what they
do boosting the grades would be great
but this was not our objective as a
consequence we were trying to make sure
that at the minimum the grades would not
go down because that was a possibility
what if students are spending too much
time playing games instead of learning
something through playing these games so
over the course of four different
semesters we offer these gaming modules
in several sections of cs one course at
the different institutions at my school
and rose hulman and for every offering
we had a test and control group a
control group would be you know a
traditional section taught as it as I
said before and the test group would be
typically a section of the course taught
by the same instructor but with this
module incorporated other than that the
students will have exactly the same
experience the same tests same luxuries
same labs same instructor same
everything the differences were actually
quite interesting and I'll just probably
skip to the summary of this all these
results even though the overall report
is quite large what's lots and lots of
interesting or actually boring
statistics the underlying theme of of
the results was this students definitely
liked it and why well why wouldn't they
again we're trying to look at the
metrics of their engagement how
interested they are in learning about
things and there were clear positive
trends at both institutions however it
was quite interesting that it appeared
based on the analysis is that of the
statistics that it worked
at my school not because it was me uh
actually it wasn't me offering these
modules there but the demographics are
certain demographics are a little bit
different between Connecticut State
University and rose hulman well rose
hulman is pretty much the topmost school
in the United States in terms of
engineering computer science education
and stuff like that my school is a you
know is quite an ordinary original
University so we have all kinds of
students whereas at rose-hulman they
basically have the cream of the crop and
we kind of did it deliberately when we
were writing this proposal wanted to
have two different quite different
universities to compare our results what
it boils down to is something that I did
not really expect kids at rose-hulman
turns out expected a very very
traditional experience they did want to
see those boring examples about
calculating average salary they were
absolutely fine with that and based on
the comments and days in the statistics
that we got the the effects were such
that ok games we don't want that we're
here to learn about you know boring dry
coding that's what we want and why why
are we doing all that you know mobile
devices no no no no we don't like that
we don't care about that whereas Moore's
racial students said oh well great we
get to play games the most important
thing is that the grades state level
between test and control group there was
no no decrease and no statistically
significant increase but motivation
clearly went up student engagement with
the course material and their opinion
about the course instructor course
material etc etc etc went up regardless
of well especially at my university but
overall Buddha statistic statistically
significant measure these metrics did go
up so again going back to that big
concern that
that I indicated the very beginning was
there a balance between fun and learning
the students have fun well most
definitely there is no doubt about that
and again it's it's based on the
statistics that we collected did they
learn something again we were not trying
to teach them how to become proficient
game developers but we're not trying to
teach them how to become really good at
mobile application development we're
simply trying to keep doing the good job
that we hope are doing and teaching them
cs1 material so did they learn all that
yes they did because their grades as I
mentioned a state level or even improved
but again not a statistically
significant level so in that respect I
believe that we did achieve the
objectives that we that we set in front
of ourselves which were trying to boost
it and engagement motivation so I hope I
did not bore you to death and if you
have any questions feel free to throw
them at me yes you mentioned some
surveys and saying that the students we
wanted this kind of teaching but these
students show what they had done to
their friends today today sit there and
play the game or did they show them the
code no they did not show the car well
typically it would be quite again well
we're talking about showing showing off
what they have in a mobile device on a
mobile device you wouldn't normally you
wouldn't be able to show the code I mean
you can do this but it's not what it's
not what students would want to show off
to their friends um I would hate to go
off on a tangent here but um I've done a
lot of research which it really isn't
you know see us related it's more
sociology if you will you know things
that students perceive as cool you know
things like that so to a computer
science student if they have a non CS
friends they will be terrified of
showing them code because if they do
that they're non CS friends would
perceive them might
see them as too geeky and it typically
CS major would not want that to happen
however if you show them a working
product you know typical atypical
non-geek person they do not have a clear
association between okay code boring
working product cool they don't have the
connection so if you showed if a
non-league sees you know a nice game or
you know something on the phone that's
great fine if they see that oh so that's
what your code does that has might have
some negative connotations details
