hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
when a status I I'm by Kristen toll and
I'm a director in the microsoft research
connections team and I'm going to talk
to you a little bit today about doing
community developed translation models
so presently there are 7,000 languages
in the world over that that's what
experts tell us but only a hundred of
them actually fewer than a hundred of
them are automatically translated from
one language to another and something
that the UN tells us is that every 14
days another language goes extinct so
what we're trying to do with the
Microsoft translator hub project is try
and stem the tide and be able to allow
people to community source the creation
of translation models in order to save
those languages and preserve them for
generations to come I thought I'd start
out the taco just covering a little bit
of area about how you can include your
community in developing a machine
translation model but just going to give
you an overview we have a lot of
different interesting algorithms
statistical algorithms that actually
help us develop a machine translation
model and data is also a very key
important ingredient in order for us to
do that where I'm going to be focusing
this talk today are in some interesting
new develops developments we've done in
this space which are in domain specific
data and also doing domain-specific
within target languages and also
enabling users to participate in vote
and allow things to show up in the
translator model system through the
community so how the system works is we
take parallel data and that's all I'll
explain that a little bit later about
what parallel data is and we combine
that with data that we have inside of
Microsoft so if a translation model
already exists you can actually tap into
microsoft's big data and their
translation models by bringing your
small data to bear but this allows you
to actually build a more accurate model
because you're actually able to leverage
the models that we
create monolingual data is data in the
language that you want to be translating
from so for instance if i want to go
from Quechua to Spanish or I want to go
from Mayan actually or Maya to Spanish
what I would do is I would actually get
a lot of data that's that we're
targeting to do such as mine these go
through a training system which is
supplemented by a testing and tuning set
to check for accuracy and then they feed
into our contextual translation models
that we provide well i'm going to this
is a very high level architecture
diagram i'm going to go into more detail
on this later so don't get nervous about
the slide this forms are a model weight
vector and what that does is input which
can be text speech video even images
goes in one this creates the decoder
that translates from one language to
another and out the other side you get a
translation so I thought what I do is I
show you one of the early community
sources systems that we have and we've
been working with the Lake Washington
School District and that school district
has about 25 or 30 different languages
within the school where children in the
home are exposed to one language but at
the schools they're actually exposed to
another language which is English but
it's important for parents who maybe
don't have english as a first language
to understand what's going on with the
school district so what we've done is
we've collaborated with them to provide
a system that would automatically
translate their page so if you scroll
down in this page you'll actually see at
the bottom that they can translate it
into Spanish and if we do that what we
can do is we can select from there's
actually 37 languages that we support
I've got Hmong da selected there because
that's the newest language that we've
supported and it was a community
developed language but what I'm going to
do is actually convert that into Spanish
so now you can see that we actually
convert it over but this isn't something
that we do in a vacuum what we want to
do is we want to get people involved and
I can also translate it back here at the
bottom but
what we do is we let people go into the
system and they can actually improve the
translation by going right clicking on
it and then they can suggest a better
translation if they think that this one
is not appropriate and we've tapped into
the parent community for the children in
the Lake Washington School District to
help us make sure that this page remains
accurate and we incent people by showing
leaderboards like who submits more
translations and others so they kind of
compete together these parents they
compete against one another to submit
translations and make corrections so in
the Lake Washington School District
river and these are the people that
we've tapped to be what we call
community leaders and the largest
portion are actually Spanish we have
more Spanish speaking people in the Lake
Washington School District who are
making corrections to the page and what
we found is that we can show them the
rewards you know get them to compete
against one another but reward them
instantly for their for their
contributions but the most telling thing
that we think is is that none of the
community because they take a personal
pride and the models that were
developing there's been no spamming and
we have no expectation that there would
be this is something that we were
concerned about but it actually has not
happened so even pages that don't have
our little widget embedded on it we can
translate so I'm running this in
internet explorer and all I have to do
here is a right click on it and you see
I get this menu bar that comes up and
says translate with being and then I get
this and I can auto detect what it is
and then which is Spanish in this case
and I can convert that to English so now
you can actually see that this page has
been converted into English so I'm going
to it's a little bit hard to read at the
top so i decided i'd slide it down a bit
so you can see this is where you can
actually have the settings which are two
at the top of the page you actually see
that that you can translate it between
spanish or any other language that we
presently support so what do we do about
these languages these other you know
69,000 languages at the or sixteen sixty
nine hundred languages that we don't
support what we do in those cases
well what we do is we tap into the
community and i thought i would actually
provide you with a quote from John
Ralston soul the the best way to shut
down freedom of speech is the loss of a
language and so it's very important for
us to make sure that we preserve these
languages I was recently in Nepal
running a workshop trying to preserve
the Nepali language and one of the
things that was very shocking to me we
saw these children playing out in the
soccer field and they were shouting to
one another in English and if you go to
school the kids are actually punished if
they speak Nepalese to one another so at
the college level many of the university
students who went to our workshop were
not fluent in that police and the reason
is their parents believe that it's
better for them to learn English or some
other major language as opposed to
speaking Nepalese so they've literally
in country losing their own language so
it's you know and there's no way you
know hi Mei who's the chair of this
event and I were talking about this
there's no way to truly express yourself
accept in your mother tongue like that's
that's the only way you can really truly
express yourself I mean we can get close
with translations but really what comes
from the heart what comes from inside
has to be in the mother tongue so what
the translator hub does is it enables
companies it enables organizations
language communities educators to build
custom private domain specific web
accessible automatic translation models
we literally are enabling people
stepping out of the way allowing people
to build these translation models
themselves when I say custom that means
it could be for any language even
languages that we don't presently
support even pairs of languages between
two languages that we don't support
private means that it belongs to the
community it's developed in private and
when the community feels like releasing
it and deploying it then it gets
deployed it's the the ownership really
lives with the community leader who
signs up to do one of these languages
and web accessible it runs on Azure so
it's accessible anywhere in the world
it's a web service that runs integer so
when we ran the workshop we ran it live
against the system
in Nepal and Katmandu with questionable
connectivity but it worked very well
actually for our training event but what
it does is ultimately it empowers users
to take a hold of this it sort of takes
it out of the hand say of a large
company it puts it into the hand of
communities and as I say it's a free web
service we don't charge for you to
develop the translation models and that
it leverages as I had said before you
bring your small data if it's a language
that we support you can tap into our big
data models and that means you get more
accuracy more quickly and we have all
kinds of a pis and guides and even how
to videos on the website to show you how
to use it we support soap Ajax HTTP and
Oh data interfaces so this is dr. pong
yang and he was one of our alpha testers
this is before even beta these guys
really put us through the paces and
trying to develop moong dal but working
with his community it took about six
months working with his community but
they actually were able to release their
language on being on international
mother language day which was februari
21st of this year so this is a proof
point of a case where a community
developed the model decided as a
community that it was ready to ship and
then they shipped it I mean no
translation model is going to be perfect
not from the outset but the thing is
this language is a living thing and it
changes over time if you give ownership
to the community that language evolves
and so you're continuing to improve it
over time and it's the community itself
that has ownership and pride in what it
is that they develop so we also like to
acknowledge people so since they did the
work we didn't do the work they did the
work what we wanted to do is we wanted
to make sure that people in the world
knew that they did the work so what we
do is off these different language
models that we translate we provide a
place for them to be acknowledged for
their hard work so that people know in
the world that this was done not my
Microsoft but this was done by the monk
community and so this is one of the
landing pages that we have there were
currently working on for Nepalese as
well and if you want to read more about
it in Spanish
there is a blog that's out there of
course this was written in English but I
use the translator to convert it to
Spanish but you're more than welcome to
go find out more about that and use the
Bing Translator to convert it so this is
the landing page that people get sent to
and this is an invitation-only site so
you do have to request an invitation in
order to use it the reason for this is
we don't want just random people sending
thing it's kind of like the Lake
Washington School District we want to
make sure that you're serious about it
because this is actually taking compute
time not only on our web service but the
high-performance computing cluster where
we build the statistical training models
in order to have translation models
developed so it's important that we make
sure that people are have a plan what
they're going to try to do and you can
do more than one model once you've been
invited the sky's the limit and i'll
show you how many languages we support
and it's quite easy it's a very easy
step-by-step process and again we have
guides that help you along the way but
it's setting up the project adding your
data go to you know creating the model
and then just going live of course the
devil is in the details so I thought
what I would do is I would show you some
screenshots of that I was going to do a
live demo but unfortunately my internet
is up and down and I thought that would
be a mistake didn't want to have any
technical difficulties so for instance
what I would do once I've logged into
the system as I would create a project
there's a drop-down up here that says
create project that's selected and so
for this example I thought well let's
let's do the Mayan preservation project
and go to local Yucatan Mayan languages
because there are actually several
groups or six groups that are spread
geographically across South America
Central America and Mexico so I picked
one actually that's local to this area
which is Maya or more thumb and you can
do it to English or you can do it too
many other languages in here we actually
have almost 1300 languages of which you
can select from now earlier I said that
there were seven thousand languages
spoken in the world but those languages
are largely spoken languages they're not
text based so this particular version
supports text but in the case for
instance like hmong mong was a language
that was also a spoken language not
written language so what they did is
they developed a language and it's been
around for long enough 60 years now but
they developed a language to map to that
in order to be able to put it here but
for instance like a gopher I'd said
English before but now if I want maybe I
want to go between Maya and Spanish I
can do that here the other thing that's
really interesting and I said this
earlier custom domain specific models so
whenever you're building a model you
know being as a general-purpose model
you know you can it can map to all kinds
of things but the accuracy perhaps is
not as high as you would want if you
were doing a very specific thing like if
you were going to be doing anthropology
or if you wanted you to be doing
chemicals what I find actually a there's
been a lot of interest particularly from
the Gates Foundation is agriculture you
know they want to develop agricultural
information so they can help farmers
around the world share best practices
with one another so there's a lot of
socially relevant things that can be
done by isolating the models you still
can tap into the big models that we have
but the data that you upload can be very
customized which means that the accuracy
of the translation model that you build
could be higher so education is another
one and we find a lot of educators I've
already got translated data data so
they're great candidates for doing a
specific transition model particularly
if you pick a specific domain of
education so when you are after you've
selected your project you arrive here
you can either add files for training
right away if you're just going to just
do that you're not going to invite the
community or you can also invite your
community enters and co-owners the nice
thing about having co-owners is that
means more than one person is
responsible for using the system so
typically we we set up co-owners as
people who are sort of your committee or
group in your community that you want to
have be responsible for the model but
you can also invite communities in a
less trusted role to just be reviewers
and they can submit transitions but they
can't approve them and I'll show you
what that looks like in a little bit so
here's where I would upload my data this
one I'm actually uploading a file for
Spanish so that it can go into the
system for training
and I thought what I do here is pause
and talk about a little bit about what
parallel documents are most people don't
have a good grasp of this and they also
don't realize that they have a lot of
them so for instance if I just hunt
around the microsoft site so here's one
that's on discovering internet explorer
9 but we've also paid money to have it
translated into Spanish so this is a
truly parallel document has the exact
same content but what you can do is you
can upload them both and this is a
parallel file and a lot of times like
people say well do they have to be in
the same file they don't we actually
intentionally put them in separate file
because typically you don't put them in
the same file so one HTML page which is
one of the file formats that we support
can be mapped to another HTML page the
only thing is that the first part of the
name has to be the same so one of the
things I was telling you about we're
tapping into the Microsoft models you do
that by selecting here it is on by
default that you can access our models
on the backend your small data combined
with it however if you're really looking
for something extremely custom you could
actually pick this off right and so you
don't actually have to use it we make it
an option but we do add it because it
does tend to increase blue scores what's
most important is this tuning and
testing if you're doing a
domain-specific model you want to make
sure that the files that you upload for
tuning and testing accurately reflect
the domain that you're trying to build
so this particular file is one that's a
very much a representative sample if
this works sake for chemistry or
anthropology this file should be
targeted it should have data that's very
specific to that particular domain and
that's both for tuning and testing so
once I've drafted a training it shows up
in my overall heads-up display for this
particular training thing once it's
drafted I can then choose whether or not
to run it if it runs successfully it
will say succeeded if it doesn't it says
failed typically that's because I don't
have enough data in the system don't
worry just add more data is it's quite
easy to fix once something has been
succeeded it can then be deployed and
once deployed your community
can then start working on it improving
it making it function better so I had to
switch to hmong i had didn't have a Maya
I didn't have data to build a mile in
Spanish translator so I have to switch
to one of the ones i do have deployed
which is long and I it's interesting
here to see that how is the weather and
you see it translate adherent among I
don't speak Hmong either so don't worry
about that that's not the point of the
site but if I go out to being you'll
notice it's different it's actually
slightly different and the reason is
because in our tool you'll get multiple
different types so for instance in this
listing the community has submitted
three different ways to say this
sentence and they're all right there's
not one of them that's wrong because
they've all put got a blue ribbon next
to him that means some reviewer went in
and said yep these are all acceptable
and the reason for that is in different
contexts a sentence might mean different
things and so what we're trying to do is
provide all of the different possible
options that it could be but the one
that succeeded is is this one here at
the top so data really is the key to
translation quality you need to have a
minimum of 10,000 parallel sentences in
order for you to build a translation
model that's actually really not a lot
of data and if particularly if you are
an educator and you built all of these
websites you often have that data lying
around but you just don't realize it
books for instance we work a lot with
publishers you know they pay a lot of
money to translate their books and what
they'd like to do is be able to then
translate their online properties using
these very custom models and that works
extremely well and they have hundreds of
thousands even millions of sentences
available but you can access the system
through our API that I talked about
earlier HTTP soap a Jackson odata you
can embed the widget like we did in the
Lake Washington School District example
that I showed you earlier this is where
you can gather community inputs there
but you can also gather community inputs
from using the Microsoft translator hub
there's a UI where you saw them against
another users can submit translations
there this goes into a collaborative
translation memory and then we get one
hundred percent match at the runtime the
Train models come out and you get
parallel training data and this is also
an association we build off your your
target training data so the community
gets an immediate reward they get
immediate credit in a leadership board
we show who's leading the charge and
then they get immediate validation and
ranking and that was why I was showing
which ones three three things were
submitted the top one is the one that
gets the highest ranking and validation
so collaboration is the key to vitality
so data may be the key to building the
translation model collaboration is
really how you keep it vibrant how you
keep it evolving and so you know what
you want to do is you want to get a lot
of really good parallel data that's from
within a domain from your community you
can achieve the higher quality by using
Microsoft stepping into Microsoft's big
data models and then the Microsoft
translator widget collects data also
from your community and in order to
build the best system possible you can
use the translator hub so I did the
wrong thing there there we go so I
thought what I would do is I wrap this
up with a new tool that we've just
recently come out with that's driven by
the Microsoft translator system this
system is called the your mobile travel
companion and it runs on any windows
mobile phone what it allows you to do is
so you know Rick rash it's a big star
trek fan so I couldn't help to Gold Lee
boldly go where no man has gone before
so quite literally it does translation
of speech it even does like video it
does text and images which is really
incredible it uses OCR to take that in
and it uses automatic translation and
humid ated so if you have your friends
they can actually help you as well they
can make corrections along the way so
friends in your social network and also
make corrections um it uses smarts it
knows where you are so for instance it
knows right now that I'm in Cancun and
so it operates differently here than it
would if I were in the United States so
it if I have my locator location turn on
my
phone and actually can rely on that to
tell me what's the location i mean in
the context i'm in and it's been
implemented as Windows Phone application
literally it could be speech texts and
they even assigns and if you come by the
booth I have a demo fest booth for both
of these particular projects so i invite
you to come by and check it out but it
takes that video speech and text sends
it to the phone and then it also
interacts with Facebook that Facebook
uses our translator as well and then
through the translator it comes out
again in as video speech and text this
is important so if I take a picture of a
sign and I want to know how it's
pronounced in Chinese what i can do is
take that picture of that sign or maybe
the signs in chinese but i want to hear
it needless because I don't speak
Chinese what i can do is i could say
output it to speech and then my phone
will literally say what the phrase is
that's on that particular sign so it's
quite handy to have when you're
traveling so what it looks like is this
when you load the system you come in and
it shows you a startup page there's a
keyboard camera voice so literally the
camera on your phone is where you can
capture images so it's asking you what
is the input that you're going to be
using and then over here is where you
actually select that which languages
that you want to translate between one
of the things really nice about this is
you can do just right away type
something in you know how are you como
esta if I have images I take a picture
of it immediately it overlays the text
right over there this is a case of where
I've gone I want text output so I've got
an overlay in English from Chinese which
I don't speak and then if I want I can
even speak into it and have it translate
so maybe I speak English and I want
someone to hear it in their language I
could speak into my phone and it would
speak it back out in the language that
they needed to hear in so one of the
most important things about this tool is
well we're not always connected to the
internet and it can be very hard to want
to do this you know you may have more
connectivity when you grow more travel
like I do you don't want to pay the data
charges so it's quite easy to actually
download some of these phrasebooks to
your phone itself so that when you're
offline or
even an airplane mode you can still
access all the functionality that you've
seen here so in this case I'm actually
downloading a french-language one and
I'm going to come down it's now but
succeeded it's now in my system but I
want to view some of the other ones that
I've got so as you can see I have five
of them and my in my phone that I can
access and all of these are available
offline all the functionality that i
told you about is available offline to
users so this is downloadable from the
windows phone marketplace not just the
english site but also on our our site
for mexico so you're free to go there
and download it and test it out it
shipped earlier this year are there any
questions fast it's funny because I had
so many slides I was thinking I'm gonna
be over yes
yes gracias what about the server I mean
for example my n as a school that does
not have any connectivity or internet
connection or it's not as good as it
should be sure whatever they have
options to work offline you up for the
hub or for the mobile full of hope yeah
the hub is not offline okay you do need
to have connectivity at least regularly
the nice thing about it is it's
extremely fault tolerant because it's
built on Azure we've when we were in
Nepal the internet would drop out like I
wit would cycle up and down about every
I don't know I sometimes it was every
five minutes over at other times it was
every half hour the thing is is the
system keeps your state so IE is very
good about keeping your state i'm sure
most other browsers are as well but we
were using IE in this particular case so
even though the internet had gone away
and the model had gone away the moment
that we were back online the people who
were doing reviews submitting
translations using the system were able
to pick up exactly where they left off
that they had no problem at all actually
just interacting with the system they
were get an error the moment that it
occurred they could resubmit and then it
would go through so state is maintained
within the browser by the way in which
we implemented the UI for this system
okay but that's for the hub but then if
you already have the information in the
server mm-hmm you can download a subset
to your phone you can for a classroom
for example yes absolutely no you can
build materials educational materials in
Mayan Spanish yes download it to the
phones sure okay yeah fantastic yeah you
want to try it okay nofollow you can try
it
hi I would like to ask about the
categories or domains are they like
built-in or can they be modified for
example if i choose to 20 in you
category I haven't seen I don't know the
fields to to add one more you you you
can request that we add another one in
fact this I'm glad you asked this
question because there's something I
failed to mention earlier in my talk so
the domains are presently fixed in the
system but you can request when there's
a link there to request it just below
the domain but in addition to that
there's also a link to request new
languages so even though there are 1300
in there these things actually can be
changed in addition for domain-specific
ones you can further isolate it by on
your own so while the category list may
be fixed for when you start and maybe we
haven't added it yet what you can do is
you can actually there's a box directly
below it that allows you to type in your
own domain so we think these areas are
very at a very high level so for
instance one might I think one of them
is sports that's fine but sports is a
very broad thing right education is a
very broad thing it's too broad so what
you can do is you can further classify
it by adding something into that field
that says okay this is education but
maybe it's going to be about mathematics
this is education it's going to be about
physics so you can automatically with
the system right as you create the
project perform a more sub
classification directly in the UI at the
project's creation
they know they don't actually so the
question was for those of you who don't
didn't hear it is due the parallel
documents have to be sentence by
sentence we do have a sentence mapping
tool and inside of the system because
you know there's no way like with mung
the reason why there's so many different
translations for for one single sentence
is because and they're all correct right
all the reviewers had gone through is
selected them and said they were all
correct is that in different contexts
things are different and the other thing
is sometimes the way in which you
express something in one language is
ordered differently not with just within
the sentence but even para graphically
and so what we try to do is we try to
match them up we have a mapping
algorithm to map between this the
sentences by looking at individual words
that we know are accurately we have a
dictionary lookup and so then we can map
the sentence even if it appears before
or after to the appropriate translation
in the other language sorry to be so no
no it's fine but what is it could you
explain it something very basic because
I get this question a lot what is the
difference between this kind of
translator hub and a typical dictionary
word by word what's the real
breakthrough in this kind of technology
well one of the things is that it even
in a book it remains fixed that's the
problem what we're trying to do really
ultimately and so I'm very glad that
you've asked this question is is to try
and capture this language that it's not
a moving target language is living it's
a very living thing and the you know you
can get these books provide snapshots
what they don't do is a you know you
have to do another revision it takes a
long time for to print to another
revision takes a long time to print for
an automatic translation system that
doesn't have their needs to be no delay
they can automatically be fixed very
quickly and so every time the model is
redeployed if you deploy it yourself
privately then it all the changes that
you made our resident immediately in
that private model for shipping it in
being that
so that takes some time they get they go
through a process that's a periodic
thing but for your private model that
you own yourself the changes are
instantaneous and so that evolution of
language can be easily updated all of
the time and maybe it's you know it
happens a little at a time it's also
very hard to do it as an undertaking is
a big thing it's much easier if your
communities making Corrections as they
go and the other thing is you think
about it one person usually typically
creates her a couple of people usually
create dictionary lookups and
phrasebooks but tapping into the
community is probably the best way to do
it quickest and keep it more accurate
over time I mean crowdsourcing is just
really ultimately the best way to go so
that that's I hope I answered your
question okay
okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
