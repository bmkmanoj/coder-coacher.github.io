introduction I've been doing stuff in
the computer industry for many many many
years I used to be the youngest person
in the room now I'm one of the oldest
when I say that my first product was a
long time ago a thing called Sargon
which was the first micro computer chess
program in 1981 so I dropped out of
Columbia much to my parents chagrin so
that I could take a job at a company
called Hayden publishing so they could
test video games which we loaded on I
think the biggest computer we had was an
apple to at the time that year we won
the microcomputer international chess
tournament and we out sold a product
called visicalc which meant we sold
100,000 units and my dad had started a
computer store which was the first Apple
dealership in New Jersey so I grew up in
an apple dealership so I was at the Mac
launch and my Macintosh is signed by
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs and a whole
bunch of other people and I keep it in
my garage and it's cool i have a whole
career museum in my garage and so here
we are in 2015 and the movie 2001 a
Space Odyssey which I just saw a couple
of weeks ago is still the most boring
movie in the entire world it goes on
forever and forever and forever and the
only cool thing about it is the
artificially intelligent robot who goes
rogue Hal I'm sorry Dave and in 2001 we
launched a product called smarter child
smarter child was sort of a bot Odyssey
for us we launched it on to America
Online the instant messaging thing of
the day at that time I think at America
Online they had a huge user community a
hundred million maybe 150 million users
smarter child was a natural language pot
and I came up with the idea for a
natural language bot while I was sitting
in the movie Bicentennial man with Robin
Williams and and what I wanted another
boring two-and-a-half-hour movie like
while Robin Williams doesn't age we all
did and but what it was was like Robin
Williams was a bot who just like
Pinocchio wanted to be
so what happened with smarter child was
we designed all kinds of different
applications which we called knowledge
domains we built a complete development
environment called buddy script and we
launched the bot within about six months
so we grew we grew and we grew when we
grew and we grew our guys went to Exodus
at the time which was a network
operations center and there was this
little company called Google and Google
was having these servers these 1u rack
servers built and we saw those and my
partner Tim k who is my brother-in-law
Caltech PhD who won the Academy Award
for science and technology looked at
their service and said hey those are
cool can we have some of those and so in
order to support 30 million users we
were the second largest site in Exodus
after Google so we were using their
stuff and just trying to grow to support
the traffic and we'd have to order
servers like two weeks in advance
because they build them and and rack
them up and that problems gone away we
were I don't know at least five percent
of all of the instant message in traffic
in the world was then a bot and this was
when AOL didn't want our bot online and
the reason was we were breaking AOL it
was a problem with presents detection
that they couldn't solve right and
presents detection is like a urinal when
you stand there it knows you're there
when you leave it flushes so with us it
was like the bots knew when you were
there and then when you were there we
would talk to you and there was no
download so you added it to the buddy
list there was nothing as an impediment
to stopping this from happening and so
we found a distribution mechanism that
at the time was very difficult because
everybody was worried because the
download was fat and it was hard to get
things downloaded so we already had it
download we had AOL I am aim and icq and
msn messenger and so AOL would
periodically rate limit us and stop us
from going on the network and we had a
kid his name is Adam fritzler that was
literally a kid he was 17 years old that
we found online and he had broken the
protocols online and open sourced him at
pissed off AOL tremendously we hired him
and
his job was to sit there and every time
they would change the rate limiting
schema at AOL he would break it and then
we would go back on let me hack day well
in order to get there and then the guys
from Radiohead saw what we were doing
and called this up on the phone and said
hey we want to launch a Radiohead bot
and it turned out that Raoul Mujica who
was running AOL instant messenger at the
time a really good guy loved Radiohead
so we said hey we'll do the radio had
bought if you let this little thing we
have called smarter child on the network
and he said okay so we did that oh just
in terms of traffic we were doing
billions of messages and it was all
teens then it's all teens now we knew
that because we had the statistics we
should tell you we have the statistics
and we watched it from every single of
the major platforms and what would
happen is we would have spikes of
traffic when people would come home at
three o'clock on the east coast from
school the traffic would spike when they
dialed in the traffic dialed up you know
key dialed up and then the traffic would
spike again three hours later why
because the kids were coming home on the
other coast and then it would spike
again at like midnight and what we
figured out was happening was that all
their other friends were going to sleep
and the only person left to talk with
was smarter child and what they did
mainly was not what we thought okay but
let's talk a little bit more about
smarter child so here's what happened
Microsoft did due diligence on us they
sent a team of really talented guys
Steve lithic and a whole bunch of really
smart people from Microsoft showed up
they beat the heck out of pure Buerkle
often our engineering team our
engineering team was up to the task and
ultimately after a whole bunch of years
of trying to build something other than
smarter child which were instant
messaging bots for customer service for
time warner and major league baseball
and every client you could ever possibly
imagine we built hundreds and hundreds
of these things Microsoft decided hey
customer service might be a really good
thing to use this for cuz it'll reduced
our cost of customer service is an
actual return on investment we grew the
thing after I don't know 20 million
dollars of investment from Reuters
corporation and you know we were the
darlings of the internet I went to the
White House Correspondents Dinner as the
guy
Reuters i sat next to Jerry Yang it was
George W Bush was the guy that was in
office then it's a very weird time for
me so they paid some money for this guy
I think they didn't really pay money for
smarter child because here's what
happened by 2007 Microsoft realizing
that smarter child might be a little bit
of a problem because he was snarky if
you've ever talked to him you'll know
that and I can prove it in a second
smart child is an editorial problem bots
are not a technical problem bots are an
editorial problem because bots have a
personality when you're talking about
something which doesn't have a
personality which runs around behind the
scenes and does stuff for you that's not
a bad that's an agent agents don't need
personalities I offer you the matrix no
personality their BOTS need
personalities that was the key to the
success of smarter child he had a
personality in fact a friend of mine who
is a lead character animator by the nug
Frankel who is still a lead character
animator one of the top lead character
animators at Pixar was also an investor
in our company and when he came and
talked to smarter child the first thing
that he said is he said to me Hoff's key
we had known each other for a very long
time your bod is more popular than the
simpsons in terms of audience share we
were bigger than the biggest television
show in the history of television and he
said and the reason was because your
BOTS got an attitude problem we were all
from new york and new jersey that's got
an attitude problem so they lobotomize
smarter child and 2009 smarter child was
murdered they removed him from the
network they killed my baby we were all
very saddened by this because bot lives
matter when smarter child was pulled
from the network I went back to talk
with Microsoft and Microsoft had a
tendency to buy things back in the day
and in a moment of austerity what
happened was ray ozzie and Bill Gates
sat down with the team that was leading
bot development and they had just
purchased a company called tell me you
may know tell me as an integrated voice
response system which was really a
question-and-answer menu-driven type
product they spent 800 million dollars
on the acquisition and when they sat
down and looked at the technology at
Microsoft Research ray ozzie and Bill
Gates looked at our technology which was
basically scripted okay it was one way
to skin the boat at the time no machine
learning a limited amount of that we had
translated into eight languages at
Microsoft the mission was to translate
into thirty eight languages we had only
gotten to eight including simple
Mandarin we thought that was pretty good
nobody else even had one so eight we
thought was all right so Bill Gates said
to ray ozzie hey don't we already have
something like this andreozzi said no we
have six of these and so they killed it
rest in peace I am I bought back the
technology from Microsoft on a license
agreement in 2009 and i did a road show
on Sand Hill Road and I called every
venture capitalist I know and I know
every venture capitalist and they're all
nice guys and I went with the original
engineer Pierre Buerkle off and my
co-founder Peter leviton and we
explained to them that cell phones are
coming cell phones are coming and
they're going to have these things when
Sean Carolyn who was an investor in Cyre
one of the early investors what he said
was when we first came up with the idea
of series smarter child already had 15
million users and was growing by twenty
percent a week the market was talking so
they knew in fact Siri was the first
purchase of an app that Apple ever made
they had lots of apps in fact at the
WWDC yesterday they talked about it Tim
said they have two million apps that's a
lot of apps it's more apps than we need
it's more apps than I can fit on my
phone I can only use about one at a time
I use like maybe six apps I'm not sure
that the paradigm of bots being apps or
BOTS being web pages is an accurate
paradigm because that's two
domain-specific for a conversational bot
see a bot can do lots of things in a nap
properly done only does one thing very
well so there's a big difference between
a conversational bot and an app
our website so I like to think I don't
know if this is true that we were one of
the first memes what was the meme the
meme was what we called the captain kirk
problem which is trying to come in
smarter child to have sex with you and
that was sixty percent of all of our
traffic and remember the amount of
traffic we had this was a lot of traffic
and so we had a guy who would sit there
all day long and he would watch people
cursing at the bot and come up with a
curse word filter which by the way we
sold to Microsoft alongside now that guy
um his name is Chris Bray I don't know
if anyone has heard of Chris Bray he
runs a little website now called apple
com when the venture capitalists took
over smarter child they fired Chris
almost immediately because what did he
do SAT around and develop methods of
keeping people from convincing the bots
to have sex with them Microsoft had the
technology to prevent the Tay problem
from happening where if your bot talks
back your end users will have a lot of
fun hacking the bots I promise they will
try they will also succeed just like
Captain Kirk was able to defeat Landrieu
on the computer planet they will get him
in a logical loop and we had a problem
with a Santa bot because you know if you
said to this antibody you know I want to
sit on your lap it got a little kinky
that was a problem you have to be
careful of those kinds of things so fast
forward welcome five minutes welcome
smarter children you're all children of
smarter child we weren't even the first
pot right the the first concepts of
these things goes Alan Turing back right
it's way way back natural language
processing is one of those things like
you know flying cars we know there's
going to be a flying car and until you
on builds it we won't have it right so
when I was a kid really young I saw a
guy by the name of Alan Kay who was an
apple fellow and he played the piano
during his speech and what he talked
about was creating the future by
inventing it and that's what you guys
are doing right it took 15 years for
this dish swinging around
to become a fat again I mean is there
about phenomenon I'm looking around the
room I'm thinking yeah there is we tried
to do this we launched a platform we got
some users now there are 10,000 people
building BOTS when your platform does
something that you don't expect to do
it's mature that's what Steve lithic at
microsoft said when he saw our product
so why are your BOTS different than all
other BOTS don't guess my religion like
there are four kinds of bots right the
dull the foolish the heedless and the
wise and what I want to counsel you guys
to do is don't build dull BOTS and by
dull BOTS I mean like Dora the fish Dora
the fish doesn't remember what she had
for lunch this morning if you if you ask
Alexa which is a cool bond will talk
about elects in a second if you ask
Alexa I'm interested in the weather in
Miami it'll tell you the weather in
Miami if you say can you book me some
flights there it doesn't know the
anaphora of what does they're mean and
smarter child did we had phatak
expression we had an afro we'd all the
natural language processing stuff that
you need to maintain a full conversation
we were keeping profiles on every single
user in depth you see intimacy is a
matter of shared remembrance and
experience and if your bot doesn't
remember day to day or month to month
what your what your customer was saying
then your your BOTS an idiot sad or
e-bot don't build three pots build wise
pots okay if you ain't got that doremi
our problem was we never really even
wanted a business model the venture
capitalists behind the company was a guy
by the name of Andrew Weissman and the
Weissman's at union square ventures
partners in New York is a dear friend of
mine our plan was never to write a
business plan and to sell this thing to
AOL for hundreds of millions of dollars
before anybody realized what had
happened that didn't happen so we were
forced to look at business models what
are the business models the business
models are transactions advertising
subscriptions and development most of
you I think are on the d-side developed
bots for a living for somebody else
there probably are spots for each of
these types of models but I think
there's another way to go Alexa has sold
over 4 million units to date closing in
on 5 200 bucks each 2 billion dollars
it's by far the highest revenue
generator they've taken a firm lead I
was at the WWDC listening to what was
said what they said was something sad
what they said was series now going to
be opened up Apple has chosen now to be
number two we're opening up why cus who
else opened up Alexa is open so you can
go and you can program Alexa you can do
your home entertainment system with
Alexa you can control your Phillips you
lighting but the problem now is this
your business our business the business
we're all in is like Frogger okay you're
if you're hopping across the street in
Frogger you're going to get hit by one
side of or another and so there's a
platform problem no slide presentation
would be complete without the compulsory
slide of logos my compulsory slide of
logos I'm sure you all know which ones
they are are the platform choices that
you guys have to make I wish I could
inform you which was the better choice I
can't i can tell you something about
distribution though and that's how i'd
like to close today dependent is
unsustainable that's what we found we
were dependent on microsoft on AOL and
on yahoo to have our product up you guys
will likewise be dependent upon
Microsoft and Facebook and Google you
must find an independent path and you
must find independent distribution paths
there are several distribution models
and I'll close with this so the
distribution models I call them star
trek go where no one has gone before and
the world will follow you there
potentially do something new new is
important don't just do what everybody
else is doing Field of Dreams this
really actually works in our business if
you build it they will come that's what
happened with smarter child in fact we
used all of these the other distribution
model is the Manchurian Candidate you're
building sleeper agents when you launch
and you have traffic we got traffic
through sex chat we were then able to
use it to generate millions of dollars
of advertising revenue it wasn't our
plan but guess what once you're talking
with somebody in in conversation with
them you might be able to do something
else Manchurian Candidate and then
finally the craze a hard day's night
what happened with smarter child was
word of mouth distribution picked up and
we became a virus and so the reason for
our growth of traffic is these for
distribution models and so I urge you to
consider don't be dependent upon one
platform and consider your distribution
models look for ways to make money and i
should say in Silicon Valley have been
doing this a very long time for all of
you who know winter is coming so do it
quickly do it now and thank you for your
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
