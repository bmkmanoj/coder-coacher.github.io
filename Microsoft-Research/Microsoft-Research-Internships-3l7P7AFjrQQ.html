to bring in interns it's a very creative
place and it's a place that's very open
to new ideas and multidisciplinary
thinking when I look for an intern at
Microsoft Research I look first and
foremost for creativity and fearlessness
and a real passion to explore new ideas
at Microsoft Research we look for
interns that are generally aligned with
our research interests but most
importantly we look for research interns
that are passionate fun and full of
energy not only are they working with
many many other interns in their own
area but they're also working with some
of the best scientists in their
particular area area of expertise and in
addition to that we have lots of
programs and opportunities for them to
go out and around Seattle to hike to go
on boat rides so they have a really good
time in addition to working really hard
this is incredible experienced people
and if you have any chance to come here
I just don't think anything just come
here because this is awesome I can
compare it to anything that I had before
in my life so I highly recommend you yet
to come the first three weeks of an
internship
we usually brainstorm about ideas this
also gives an opportunity to take some
risks to really go out there and try
things that we might not have come up
with before without this kind of
thinking about these ideas that's great
for both sides the intern often gets a
publication out of it and we get to
explore some new areas that we might not
have had a chance to explore without the
interns expertise or without them really
taking a passion and following through
the long time so when I came into
Microsoft research I was really hoping
to work with top-level people in the
field and kind of learn from their
expertise what I wasn't counting on was
being able to work directly with product
groups and actually talking with PPI the
people that make the large screen
displays I got to have a lot of meetings
with them and show them what I was
working on and get some feedback on what
might actually become and be useful for
real-world products interning with
Microsoft Research has been really great
not only for my you know as an
internship opportunity and for my
schooling but also because I get to work
with a lot of people who actually make
products and new things obviously
outside of that has been really awesome
for my PhD because I get to work on
really exciting projects that actually
have benefit to communities different
groups of people and could potentially
change the landscape of certain device
ecosystems which is of course super
exciting as well
I wanted to pursue a research internship
that would complement the skills that I
have back in the graduate setting but
don't necessarily always have the
opportunity to pursue within the course
curriculum or so forth and being amongst
all the experts here and experienced
researchers I think it gives you a
fantastic ability to do just that I'm
working at with Donald Brinkman to
create an alternate reality game for the
sky buildings on campus but what the
design really came to be about was
creating a mechanic that could be
repeated that really brought together
people in those skype buildings
ultimately it was about what we could
give to people that they would want to
do again and again and what it would
mean to them instead of what interesting
stories that could create so they
created the stories from themselves
which was incredibly rewarding
experience I chose Microsoft research
for my internship because they're really
leading the field in animation
technology but also the implementation
of it so what artists can deliver with
these technologies I think doing an
internship at Microsoft Research is a
fantastic opportunity I mean part of it
is just the other interns that are here
during the summer you get to meet and
interact with people from all over the
world and these are relationships that
I've seen people develop during an
internship and then keep for many many
years there's no place where you're
going to have an opportunity to interact
with dismayed people certainly the other
interns and also the other researchers
it's an opportunity to talk to and
interact with the best of them we offer
a lot of resources here for interns to
use but along with that comes a
tremendous freedom there's such a
variety of different technologies
available through Microsoft that the the
scope of ideas that are possible to be
explored here are virtually limitless
