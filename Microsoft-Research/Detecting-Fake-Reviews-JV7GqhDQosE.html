you
hi my name is michael gavin from the i'm
from the LLP group here in amis our and
it's my pleasure today to introduce
professor bing new from the University
of Illinois at Chicago and I've I've
known Bing for full time I actually
don't remember now how long we go go
backward yeah Bing has done a lot of
work on on web mining on and
specifically on reviews including aspect
detection product aspect detection
sentiment detection and it was also as
far as I can tell that really the first
person to start research on fake reviews
from the problem off review spam and you
might actually have even have seen some
some public media attention to that to
that problem and it's obviously a big
one because it can just talked about it
it can really affect a small company
tremendously and so this is what what
Bing is gonna yeah you're talking about
and this is also this is part of a book
that just came out on sentiment and
opinion mining which is sort of an
overview of the field all right thank
you thank you very much yeah so this
problem is pretty getting pretty bad now
and the previously there was not as bad
but in recent years there are some some
sort of companies which is to call the
reputation management companies they
started do this and the writing centers
on the web and so it's um this has been
the opinion the social media has being
useful for quite a while even many years
ago so not really many years about three
three three years ago there were really
some sort of marketing company did
surveys some how many people what
percentage of people when they buy
something or when they used some
services they get do they read reviews
and the things about three or four years
ago was about seventy five percent and
now it's getting a lot bigger a lot
bigger and also people using reviews is
those the people analysis to the
companies the analysis of reviews is
also increased quite dramatically and
they also in terms of opinions in other
kind of four forums and the
and blogs and I think Mackenzie did some
survey a few years ago I think it was
also about three years ago they said the
u.s. is the US has about thirty to sixty
companies working on that and this this
may somebody else did a survey they said
now that's about 350 companies are doing
it doing something related to this to
get opinions from reviews from from
blogs from from sort of from Twitter so
we use this thing for decision making
and purchasing and the audio when you do
the elections and also of course for
marketing and their branding and
afterwards and you want to sort of after
you've seen this thing you want to do
some sort of actions so this will give
people are very very strong incentive to
do something to try to promote their
products products or services and this
is basically becomes a business itself
also yeah previous city was mostly
individuals who write it and the recent
few years and the people in the company
in in it they get middle minds in India
write it and now even us and lots of
small companies reputation management
company are doing this writing ready in
the figure reviews and what do we say
with we study this stuff we started this
particular research in in 2005-2006 for
time frame
actually it was related to a project was
was Microsoft the beginning what we're
trying to do at Microsoft that time was
try to figure out the people from
different websites I did the same guy or
not the same guy so and there was all we
did some surveys and the name what what
kind of name do you use in different and
different websites and then later on
were more interested to getting English
this particular topic of detecting what
we call opinion spam and so then we his
first start was the opinions in the in
the reviews and how to detect the finger
reviews ok so there's lots of people who
write this figure reviews and we call
opinion span and I sent you to try to
write undeserving positive reviews and
to promote those
products and I was too right unfair even
malicious sort of negative reviews too
to target some products and try to
demote them and whether we said also
it's become one business in recent years
and also customers are getting worried
about this thing and the lots of things
are being report on the web okay
and then there was lots of reports
there's just subset of those and this is
this is the one which is very
interesting is that my website I I
compiled a quite a bit a few honest
links the first one Amazon glitches and
Massacre war reviewers there was a 2004
what happens was the Amazon of Canada
made a mistake it was a system and then
they released the real name of the
reviewers and then they discover on all
the book authors write for themselves
even those very famous ones and when
they were confronted it reported go to
talk to them they say hello everybody
does it and then they also have one one
woman she was the writer and the she was
even complaining her friends and the
warm the friend she asked as a friend to
friends and family that writing one
friends only write all this is a great
book she said what kind of friend is
this only write a single line from my
book so he and the so that was the sort
of very early report and then lay down
early this year and that was the second
one was that one of the companies and
setting a products on Amazon they give
people give the customer for free and if
you write a positive review and this is
the small sort of a cost about $10 some
kind of same center so you can see that
two dollars for a star a view again this
one so the sudden II you can see the
sudden burst of reviews from from your
customers but of course this thing has
been done quite a long time ago and has
been going on by special about hotels I
give you a little bit discount and as
you do write something positive and now
another one was published recently the
person who wrote this fake
and he talked to two New York Times can
you attach and then there's another one
so now becomes interesting the Google
Places Google Places has lots of fake
reviews so this this this particular
person and this this one best what
happens he went to this report when to
do a investigation about something he
feel fishy and then this is a penny this
has been done by some reputation
management company and then he go to
look and he's sort of surrounding areas
businesses and he find out around 60 of
them were actually using this particular
service it's quite a lot of moodiness
and this one is also very interesting
this for ABC 7 News in Colorado
somewhere and so she also find a company
who is doing writing a lots of reviews
about a few few few sort of small
businesses a lots of people are only
doing this few businesses and so this
too when you have reputation company to
reputation management company to write
fake reviews for you they're fairly easy
to detect actually we'll talk about some
ways in which you can detect this type
of situation then these are some of the
services you can find a way but that
lots of them if you search for things
there on you'll find lots of company or
doing it for two or do it for you some
are expensive some are much cheaper then
also people put out put out there some
interesting sort of clues to allow
individual users to figure out something
when it's fake or not fake yeah but
which is it is really harder we did try
it some we try some experiment over the
students and there was very very
difficult it's almost impossible to to
figure out okay and what we did was so
we asked students to write some figure
reviews to which are on the products
you're familiar with and then write fake
reviews you have never used that product
before you know nothing about that
product
so for this part is a relatively easy to
detect for the products if you knows
about it it's almost impossible to
detect it's very very hot the right
heart attack then I did not give any
further instruction except to say you
just try to write it looks like sounds
like it real that's the only thing I
said what I'm saying to you you know
that category product for example
cameras yeah you're not they're not the
products not your own review about view
products right okay that category and
for example cameras they do video games
that kind of thing so they can they can
write pretty pretty real stuff right and
and also company our government not
doing it too and China also have China
is very bad I've been talking to some
companies which is doing which has
hosting reviews and this they said if
you don't remove this guys that review
is completed users I said the probably
50% of our fake quite quite bad okay
quite a bad so this was the somebody put
on the web and Vulcan international and
asked people on the web to write reviews
for them okay so use your best possible
grammar writing us English and they
always give 100% rating was high as high
as possible
keep your entry between now not too long
and this is this is the real one okay
this is real and that was caught like it
was caught by somebody
so who write this who write this fake
reviews okay write a few reviews so
business owner that's quite a lot okay
that's quite a lot and restaurant owners
and the book out there is the
songwriters and this two are
particularly bad again it's to a
particularly bad the book out this and
now it becomes everybody can publish a
book if you pay some money you can
publish a book so what they're gonna do
I mean they have they have to promote
this stuff I know so the band small
bands you know I have some songs and
their musics and their and they have to
promote it restaurant owner also had a
bit but now also the business in eating
a hundred type of small business they
also do it just now I was talking to
Michael and a few weeks ago a dentist
sent us the email which is a North
Carolina and the shallot and what
happens is that he has three practices I
guess we practice he's the owner of this
we practice and I want the practice
along the shop has one guy and he got
negative review okay and then this this
person who would contact us he was the
owner he'd go to talk to that person I
can find the person so what's coming out
okay how can you how can you get
something which is so bad did you treat
the patient very badly so they got very
angry with each other and then two days
a few days later and then he's other two
practices got a very nasty negative
review the his practice has been there
for long as no review at all and then
suddenly two very nasty review I showed
up and then he was very angry he was at
Wow
he must be from another guy and well
then what happens we go to do a
different investigation was then we also
find out those two this two reviews of
written was two different IDs here to
the new IDs and they were all written in
the same day exactly the same day and
this two person also wrote another
review on that same day and the both of
those reviews about food wise about
cookie another one is about cracker or
something I'm saying that so it's very
interesting it looks like this too must
be the same guy yeah and also the
retinas writing style was pretty good
and the writing was a very
nasty and say the the this Doctor Who
and the who and they charge him he
hasn't really nothing to do we have just
gonna wash your tea so helping and then
got chatting with a few thousand dollars
asked him to do something else in the
the cupboard was a fool of a fool of
coffee or Hamlet hua was very bad and so
this um this is sort of um this dentist
got very upset he contact Yelp and the
do all kind of strains trying to get it
removed and say this must be from the
same person but yahoo didn't do anything
think I didn't do anything and then and
we were talking about this thing and a
few days later few days later
that is certainly a few possibly review
short now possible review basically the
negative reviews us it was still there
and then suddenly a few positive reviews
show up before that there was no review
at all so my guess is this positive
review probably from himself or from his
friends and you can see the positive
review at least two of them was so
obvious and the so formal writing so on
dr. so-and-so fooling and it has been
very caring in our tree that's very well
it was a very very interesting and
anyway so this is it becomes so now I
really don't know who is telling the
truth I mean this this dentist himself
with the first review was written by him
all by somebody else he doesn't like
them doctor or something like that what
is what is going out I would so which is
very interesting anyway and so this is a
case and also some other cases yeah yeah
we look at we look at the apps
yeah yeah but this is just some of them
and so many of their men of them are
written by the person who actually
looked this those absolutely yeah but
what are the categories is it like more
focus on the entertainment or is it like
productivity where we see sort of alien
origins all over the place across all
the categories we see similar amount of
activity yeah we look at many many
categories it's very very similar
they're only saying probably this is
very big companies they are pretty
beautiful companies they tend to have a
little bit less but it doesn't seem to
be very true because if you we thought
about that it was the case okay but we
we investigate the Yelp and the lots of
very reputable restaurants and they have
a lot of reviews they have lots of
things as well
so what happens is they want to maintain
kind of a steady state so make sure some
people are always the sound review going
yeah not just say oh the last reviews
done two years ago I mean Oh what's
happening this two year has nobody
coming to this round or something so
they also do face as well okay and for
another case was we was something we
were students a find of fine and was in
a poor apps I think there was one
Chinese guy who wrote a bunch of apps
every time he who wrote an app he put
there will be five the reviews as good a
good good good
five everyone's the exactly the same
five guys since the good app oh five
stars and so we also talked to the to
Google Google has this Android apps they
also try to do something but they
haven't done anything yet yeah so the
freelancer individuals and the middle
men's and and even customer you get
discounted to write this big reviews and
I was also quite number of random people
who are just writing for fun for example
I saw a lot of good reviews
oh I'm gonna write a bad one there
there's some guys like that yeah
so this one was one of the review you
can take a look whether you think this
is a fake or not fake this was written
by my students in my class the American
students are undergraduate students
Caribbean whether you think so like what
do you think
it's a face all very kind of abstract
doesn't say anything specific I said I
was really good people are nice and
and congrats cracking its kind of talk
back to us what about this one
this view which was we
you got anyone the previous Almir this
is been a big day
what about this one this one I got from
the internet I was trying to show people
or some student some reviews I opened up
day this price grabber and just I sort
of somehow get this page and I saw this
review
sounds like picnic I don't know where
it's taken on it
this sounds like pain right this guy
seemed to notice this shot too well
alright I don't know this one I don't
know about this - I do know better this
is because it was written by a student
and this and he went to Royal Oak have
been that that was true she went with
the family okay and this you said this
this restaurant was not far from her
home but it's expensive she's never been
there
she knows this Russia and here I really
looked like real I would think this is
look more like to be real right because
he says I'm saying however I'm not the
one for clubbing and drinking so the
night there was a pretty slow for me
because that was not much else I can do
right I thought this sounds real right
and this one's more like to be fake
getting insane isn't bad about this face
anyway so it's it's very difficult it's
very difficult to really figure out
whether so that's that's shows the
difficulty for this particular problem
how do you detect them the first problem
is when you see it you don't know it
pretty much you don't know it okay and
then which makes it very difficult to
build models if you want to build a
model you have nothing to evaluate it
right and also this is logically if you
think about this logically if you look
at the contents this is a impossible to
solve problem right for example I can
say I write I stay in this hotel and the
ratify this is a good great hotel and
the staying I have a real experience but
I write one for this I put it for
somebody else so this review cannot be
faking the truth by the same time
because the hotel they're all similar
right if I don't mention a particular
location I mean everything is no not
much of a difference so in practice if
you think about this logically this is
impossible to solve
okay how to solve this problem however
you have to look at the behavior of the
person who wrote this thing you can't
wrote this thing so we study this we
studied this problem from 2006 we crawl
pretty much at that time if not all the
reviews from Amazon but a big chunk of
the reviews from we crawl for for about
2 months
I got 2.8 million reviews and one of our
meeting products actually Amazon has on
more products but many of those product
just to change your color and those are
anyway if we have postcards you know you
change the color of postcard change an
image a postcard so there's a lots of
those things but most of those postcards
and type of site has no reviews and no
reviews and the reviews all come with
this product IDs the review ID rating
and dates and these are the standards
things you've probably seen a song
yourself so this is an interesting plot
of the reviewer name of reviews review
and the reviewers yeah so that's there's
a few reviewers
written a lot of review yes
yes yes yes at that time that was not so
many no now it's much more yes and also
I had Bank boys and so vine voice is
basically their own reviewers because
their own reviewers today when they have
a new products they can send to the
person a test and they write a review
yeah so there was one guy who actually
wrote more than 15,000 reviews but now
and there's a few guys more than 20,000
reviews we're trying to crawl the game
of damage Oh so we we counted it sort of
this guy has to write ten reviews a day
things that they want Amazon stand
business average okay
Mandor his review about books about
books and this is the products so he's
again the the power law I mean some
product Scott's a very small number of
products got lost lots of reviews and on
average I think an time were computed
the average of the less than one number
products okay and of course we have lots
of tiny tiny program we do not cut into
the 1.2 million things with a 1.2
million things that the product has
reviews and anyway so this is an
interesting graph so what are the what
are the distribution what is the
distribution of different review stars
you can see is almost 60 percent of our
5 stars almost 60 percent of five star
and then there's 20 percent sort of four
stars so if you consider this to a
positive reviews it's almost eighty
percent are positive reviews which is a
little bit strange because people
normally don't do that you don't when
you are reasonably happy you're probably
not gonna write it it's only when you're
really unhappy I mean every exact myself
but I wrote only one review my life and
that was very unhappy with the cell
phone was quite a long time ago so this
this is something very fishy
very official why this why this is the
happening what is happening and so we
did some study and this and then what
happens is that this is uh there's a few
types of fake reviews the first type of
the fake ones I'm sorry a few type of
what it because spam reviews there also
are quite a number of reviews which just
give the the the brand some idea sort of
saying oh I don't like HP just never
bought anything from them I never bought
anything from them so this this kind of
review also think it is a it's probably
very biased and then this is a now
reviews and there are there's a few
types not a review sadism and
advertisement and assembly just random
text random text and this these two are
very easy to do to detect and you can do
some analysis on the using the product
descriptions and together was different
kind of information you're very easy to
detect this to type by this one that's
now here I can't even give you an
example
you know what is the fig review party
speed up how one person was there any
students in terms of people did not
purchase on Amazon but
at that time Amazon was I think the 95%
of our like that everybody can read it
no they did not buy did not buy it
though you don't know if they might have
bought it but they don't really have to
give exactly say I bought this thing
no but also you saw that this person
bought this product know that
information have to see on the on the
web verified it was called Amazon
verified purchase you can see it but
it's very proportion very very yeah so
she is trying to do something like what
are the reviews which is very harmful I
want to review from home phone so this
is a for example we have some way to
figure out the good quality products and
bad quality products and the average
quality products and then you can see
positive and negative reviews and this
if you are good products if you write a
positive review it's not so bad but this
happens also okay it's not so bad and
also if you're a bad review and somebody
ran a negative review it's not so
harmful okay it's not so harmful but
this few pretty harmful
they're pretty harmful so this is the
essentially one the a1 recluse people
normally I use if I say what is they
what is this sort of deviation of your
review which the other guys okay and
that's all where the in terms of
detection this will be the focus as well
try to detect this type of form so
that's there are now Oh even before
there are two type of reviewers and so
there's many individual guys we just
write himself and there for example
restaurant owners and there's this type
of people and they don't really working
with anybody and so they're also group
spammers okay groups members which are
especially they you want to have a small
business
oh you want to have a person who write
using multiple user IDs okay I'm gonna
be user IDs so this is the reputation
management company I'm doing quite a bit
of things like this over here and this
is getting a little bit more popular
than then that that particular situation
sorry okay so the the type of data you
can use in this domain the first thing
is they the actual review contents okay
actually review contents and this
includes a title and the the text and
the text review text and the metadata or
somebody called a site data or whatever
kind of things which is you have the ID
you have the star rating okay
this is our not text and time when the
review was posted and so I also put a
public and public those are the public
data which you can see everybody can see
and there's also some our private data
which basically our internal data which
is the website and they collect and for
example IP address the MAC address and
also cookie information and they also
can form those information they can
somehow figure out that geolocation for
you right or where the location you come
from and those are sort of primary
information and the sequence of clicks
this OB becomes the web sort of web
usage mining domain and so I I talked to
some of this company they do this they
detect nursing the status is very useful
actually very fun in the sense for
example if somebody write a review come
directly to that to that product which
is very like to be fake because some
people that's a company who advertise in
the service advertising the sort of put
up a request they want people to write
fake reviews they would just say oh
anybody wanted to write something would
write some part in real fast and here's
the link or give you something so many
people who actually write figure if they
just directly click that link then go
there oh they directly post those things
are fairly likely to be fake and another
thing is a very interesting thing is
that when people write with you
especially the owners dry reviews you
see this you can keep monitoring that
page come to that page all the time and
then one day he has something positive
and then you know no this is not quite
right okay
if you're not the owner of this
restaurant even now they are like
unlikely
to come to this let's round it I'm not
going anywhere else which is very very
very very interesting so they can use
this thing to detect I all this
information are pretty much very very
useful for example another one
interesting information will be if you
have a hotel right all the reviews seems
to be oh come from the surrounding area
then that's not quite right
right and you're not local guys I'm not
gonna stay in a hotel and just just for
for any reason okay and this is this is
the there are also text clues but those
are very difficult to to determine for
example I also heard from one companies
that this this guy and a whole lot of
many reviews and I want time all my wife
love this product and not a few days
later oh my husband loved this product
okay so it's something fishy about this
are not that easy to detect in terms of
the text I can detect you use a deep
text analysis I can't take analysis and
also there's quite a bit of information
and the private and public information
about products ok products so product
descriptions you can use one of the guys
writing something related and then also
the when the product was told I have an
apprentice salt now which is pretty used
for as well and the sales volume and
sales rank especially the sales volume
is falling if you can see for example
Amazon can do this thing very easily if
you see you know I saw this product
review comes in and what's happening ok
I was having auto sales volumes and
normally you you have a reasonable idea
of distribution sort of proportion of
people who might write reviews and the
sudden this come this products more than
that ok when a net but the the bad thing
is although this company can do a lot of
work can do lots of things to detect it
but they don't do it they pretty much
don't do it
I'm as only it's not doing much unless
they were caught by by so if thankful
for example New York Times or since they
they find out this in The Times I'm
gonna all go to remove it
the reason is this five-star reviews is
good for them it's help you to sell
products if you go to that website you
say oh this is got no review and I'm not
gonna buy it right if you see some
negative I'll forget about it yeah if
you some something something good Wow
it's probably something reasonable okay
some of the reasonable products so this
is retailers they're not doing much okay
they're not doing much we also have the
reviewer information you have the
profile and but in many cases they're
not really so trustworthy and
trustworthy but this can be public and
also something private for example
Amazon has lots of private information
for example credit car whatever all this
information if you're purchased before
also and and of course they the review
he wrote or you can analyze the string
of reviews has been writing and what
kind of products wrote and the services
wrote so the first the first work were
trying to do that was the beginning was
really really hard we really couldn't
figure out how to do this thing okay how
to do this thing and then I asked her
one my master student they say I want
you to go back and see whether you can
manually find something man you finds
I'm saying then we can use that stuff at
least if you can man you find something
let's just spend some time to find some
more okay now we'll use that for
training at least to get some
information then just second day come
back to me oh yes I found a mini okay I
find many what happens is he finds all
those reviews are very near duplicates a
little bit of a change okay a little bit
of a change then he find me quite a few
quite quite enough of them you can see
the guy change a little bit at the back
at the end or in a few words in in the
beginning of and if you were that and
it's sort of in the middle of some way a
little bit and then oh we said that may
be interesting we could we could do this
automatically right you can you can find
out you can just so have algorithm to
come do it doing the comparison and then
we can see a lot of things like this and
then we find out
interesting saying for example some
products actually the same guy wrote
about 7-8 reviews about the same product
same camera I know what is why do you
want to do that anyway you know that's
everything is all positive if you say I
mean if you think through what few weeks
later a few months later you feel this
camera is no longer as test at I thought
at the beginning you have to go back to
change your reviews there's no point to
write so many of them and they are all
positively all good okay and the soul
this is this is very interesting and
then we did this did this study we did
not consider this this one because the
same user ID a same product especially
is written the same day so you might be
possible you you click on the same thing
the submit button multiple times they
could submit in the same day so those
are not really reliable
okay now whatever and there's another
one which is not quite reliable is them
Amazon copy reviews which means not not
exact copy reviews again you can sort of
get different kind of products sharing
the same review for example you have a
pair of shoes but this is a blue color
that one it's a red color so they sort
of shared in reviews so you need to
remove those things those are fairly
into the room because they have their
the under review ID review ID the same
ID
I guess em ID and then we use this and
we got a few thousand of them or just so
we only work on the one category of
products or is manufactured kind of
products and they've quite a few few
thousand of these things under then we
use that to be our training data and
test data
okay trainee and test data and then we
used to adjust the regression to be the
model and so what are the features we
use I was review centric features are
just essentially the engrams
so those texts and grams and the rating
we use the ratings as well and then
there's also reviewer I think we only
use up to a bigram
okay background probably and the review
eccentric features that we review about
the reviewer that some different and so
unusual behaviors for example the person
wrote many reviews which are the first
review of their product
which is a fishing okay which is a some
fish it's a bunch of these things and
the products group Stan yeah I'm gonna
talk about that later the group spend
now gets very bad because of this small
business and the reputation management
companies doing this and then they have
to do group spam
I gotta go sir so so this this is sort
of worth looking at the reviews okay
we're not looking at the people yet and
not look at the reviewers yet and this
little this was then we did our
classification and then we get this a
you see 78% on the predicting of the
fakes on the on this duplicate near
duplicates kind of reviews and which is
the reason of what it's not hot it's not
easy okay this is obviously is a very
difficult problem no no no we did was
roughly I don't remember what was the
case it was was we did roughly the the I
remember was roughly the distribution
followed the natural distribution yeah
because we know it you because in this
particular case you cannot do 50 50 50
just on non reliable for example people
doing 50 50 by if you make it a natural
distribution the put for example the
proportion of this is only about 10
percent or 15 percent 20 percent if you
do 50/50 accuracy everything is so high
but if you go too low then they're going
to drop dramatically
you can drop dramatically yeah and so
since we're data - or I mean we have
been doing this thing or we do roughly
in the natural distribution and so of
course it's also interesting to say is
that reasonable to do this to treat the
duplicates as spam reviews is that
reasonable okay we sort of probably
reasonable because it's doing something
reasonably okay okay it's not that not
that bad okay not that bad okay then
then we we did after we got this result
then we analyzed some other type of
reviews some other toy reviews so
negative outliers so essentially those
guys right
very negative reviews they tend to be
heavily spent attempt to be able to
spend and those reviews that there are
only reviewers of the only reviews of
the products are also likely to be spam
this is this this one is obvious the
first one is not so obvious it's not so
obvious
I would I would have thought the
property the positive the review are
more likely to be spammed because from
my experience I talk to my students for
example I have lots of students from
India and they do it I hear they read it
so last year I got two students and who
said they've done before
no he didn't they didn't say they sell
himself the one guy said them to himself
there's other guy says my friends I know
so I'm not sure and this year in the
first class I asked have you
has anybody done it to reserve the hand
I read done reviews right for the
website
they said himself they did it and then a
two three weeks ago I asked him again no
more hands nobody's reasonably hands
anyone at the first time when I asked
there was two person rate of that okay
and then they know I was doing that kind
of research they're probably not gonna
get into this and and also the spam
reviews can get quite good helpful fake
the feedbacks okay if you write quite
carefully you can get fairly good
feedbacks and my also my students
knitting was the students he wrote the
camera review I was completely fake I he
got a lot of he wrote a very nice thing
rather you know every detail stuff but
he never used that product I got lots of
good feedbacks it's completed Vic I am
II think so so which basically means
this helpfulness oh now helpful is not
very useful okay and also if you do web
spam and then this is this can be figure
self right is this can be fake - can be
figure as well
so this um so we don't really know what
this is the tool yeah I guess so we have
no way to actually get the ground choose
and just we depend on this one is doing
something hello and then we try to test
another review we think there might be
that might be the case it might be the
case so that's a few more we throw some
chart to show what's the situation so in
the supervised techniques and people
have been doing and this another groups
recently I've been doing this wonderful
work now people they were they were
using Mechanical Turk to write fake
reviews and but it turns out we did some
analysis on this thing and it turns out
it's not really the true thing okay not
a true fake don't you fake and this
group they were they labor this they use
the opinions to label it they did pretty
much the same idea to do this but this
one is much simpler just use diagram it
is background nothing else in this
background and this one used the diagram
and at the openness sentiments and every
kind of piece of the information and
they labor themselves they use the
opinions data apini have those trust
trust and the comments everything they
got bunch of guys to read in this thing
and sort of think that probably think I
mean a nobody know exactly okay don't
really like exactly so these are
supervised techniques and then there's
also many unsupervised techniques
community unsupervised techniques and
this one was essentially we're trying to
go behind the scene right to see what's
the behavior this person you know what
his behavior this person and also what's
the behavior of the reviews and I want
to be here the reviews and so somehow we
try to uncover you know is any
interesting cigarettes in the way he
behaved it's strangely and the first one
and this basically two we published 2010
and then we we stopped this research
actually then the 2009 I whatever we
didn't really do much because we find it
was really really hard it was really
hard and everybody every time when we
submit the paper and they're always the
same comment how do you know this is big
and I use
you're doing it incorrectly are you you
know hunting you know this I would get
very very upset gettin I'm very
disappointed always and then we sort of
stop this stop this research and then I
was in Singapore I give a talk on this
particular topic and then this person
was doing something about research paper
ranking it does not receive paper
ranking analyze the reviews of research
paper reviews so they have been doing
kind of say and say I want to just try
that on the on the product review
because it's the same rating over this
time saying it's not much much of
difference got much of difference and
well Tori if you are looking at the
behaviors that they don't really have to
look at the contents okay no no look at
the text and then we come up a few
things and do this thing and then my
students also we work on something else
I'll give you a little bit of
introduction so the key idea is try to
uncover and to identify some unusual
behavior patterns okay
could be reviewers could be reviews
reviews and the the thing we're doing is
to try to find out unexpected rules so
this is this is basically a data mining
type of thing and so at that time the
first one with this particular paper was
talking about targeting so we try to say
the products they're either spam or not
spam okay so you're targeting some
specific products you can program and
then and also you could be targeting a
group of product for you for example a
particular brand of products so those
this brand it's getting people to fake
again if people are fake and also
reading reading deviations and since
this is the same type of problem when
you do rating in the in the review of
papers okay how do you figure out read
into it and also early rating deviation
people try to write same song there and
right at the beginning and then that's
this review the the rating gets lower
and the one lay down okay so now this is
actually true what happens I have this
my my current students is from India and
he said his friend is doing us
okay his friends are working for in
India working for a code of reputation
Callum company and he monitor he is in
charge of this product what does that
mean is no matter what you got to make
this positive okay this product either
you ran into you can you watch other
people write it you have to make sure
this is positive so he not money who
your star was I'm saying and I heard
watch no hmm somebody wrote a negative
memory and making it up so he started
right and he can he can create quite a
few quite a few accounts to do this he
did this type of thing so this is this
is the two end there because I verified
this is the students they said when
friends is doing it he said that he
didn't do it because he's it's too
troublesome because gotta watch this
thing all the time over a period of time
and it's not that interesting and so
then this this bunch of scores you can
do different combination linear
combination orders you can I can do it
and do a finally do a ranking you can do
an ranking on this I can you you can
sort of rank this reviews then we pewter
using the face to let the user to do an
evaluation yeah again we have no
conscience
okay just then the user to do a
evaluation give this kind of features
and let people to see it okay and this
this was completed data mining okay this
one is a complete data mined in the
sense we're trying to find the
interesting patterns interesting
patterns so when we created database ok
create database so this theory is
considerably review ID reviewer ID the
brand ID so Amazon actually have the
brand and also provide the individual
products under the brand and then
there's also class the select looks like
a classification looks like the cost of
creating kind of database and then this
is the classroom be positive negative so
five four five stars over positive and
three and below be negative
it would be negative and then you were
trying to find what it was called the
class Association use I mean my previous
life was doing mostly on the data mining
kind of
remaining again start to try to figure
out ours and do many so this is the
water we call the class associating you
it's not not exactly the cost for
classification purpose is better to try
to find all the rules so classification
is only find a subset of the same
switches that you know just for for the
purpose of a classification if he's
again classification that's good enough
but this type of ours that means trying
to find all of them okay all the rules
so for example you say review one that
brand new wine is positive so this is
the what if we call them class
Association here it's kind of
Association use because there's a use
then how do we know something is
expected or unexpected then we have to
do some sort of definition okay our
typical behaviors everywhere for example
I just give you some example and if
you're interested in the paper there was
some quite a bit of things that without
defined for example in this in this case
a review wrote all positive reviews and
products of a brand but Oh negative
reviews on a competing brand for example
all right so you can see and when you
have one condition this review equals to
1 then goes positive the confidence
essentially is the conditional
probability giving review of one what is
the probability of 4 is positive review
and this is in their mind people call
the confidence okay and 60% okay 6% then
when you extend this one more condition
okay one more condition and then you got
100% for example then this is the
fishing ok something's fish it but how
do you find this thing and it turns out
this you can define probabilistically
you can define the probabilistically and
for example in this particular case we
can we can do this you use the entropy
you can use in to be and then you can
compute the entropy of this particular
thing and also will compute the entropy
when you have multiple brand which is
essentially just like it if you know the
decision tree just like it this entry
branching out into two brands okay you
can control you can compute entropy and
those and the extra attributes
attributes now you can see the entropy
is changing dramatically so you can get
some sort of information gain and to
find out
strange about this okay and then you can
also analyze further for example this
two there's two brands actually other
people don't think that great but why
this guy give them so high okay and this
is the entropy and another one you can
use these um we will call it confidence
unexpectedness and for example you can
see the the reviewer one brand new wine
is positive okay and then you probably
the support was the actually the joint
probability because it joint probability
of something happens amount in how what
is the proportion for example of
database and what is the proportion of
those data records the contains both
contain everything contain all three of
them all three of them so the condition
and the consequent all content and but
in the in this case then you can define
fairly easily probablistic li basically
how do you do that is just given and I
don't really have to here but given you
have one continues okay and then you can
define you have a one kind of you lose
of course you have the joint joint and
also the conditional probability and
what happens if you say this two thing
has nothing to do each other they're not
related and they're completely dependent
you assume the condition independence
and then you can you can come back you
can compute what happens you've the
together if they are really not related
okay and then this is essentially this
will be the formula to compute that
committed assume the condition of the
independence which is which is which is
right because we assume this has nothing
to each other sort of independent and
then you can compute when they are not
independent right this is essentially
try to compute it when how much they're
not independent and now you can see
since like so this is this is just a one
day thing you can find out many reviews
which are not supposed to be probably
not really correct
now right there not right and you can
also define support I expect in this and
expecting this so this what happens is
this one I'm using a different measure
reviewer one product one positive that's
five them five positive reviews so this
one was this one was discovered and
automatically say was was very
interesting we find their citizenry how
come at the same guy right the ready
many reviews on the same product okay on
the same products and then you can go to
look at it and the solar guy basically
change a little bit and then put quite a
few reviews on the same thing again you
can define it's also probably Stickley
okay can you fine I don't really have it
here but you can define this probably
Stickley and then to define that you can
also define what is the unexpected and
what is unexpected and this you can this
this can be quite flexible because this
is nothing it's not something we come up
with manually ourselves and it's
completely defined defined the mind from
the data you can also find out brand of
a product relationship right brand no
kind of relationship we can discover and
they can define all this type of fur
what is unexpected what is it expected
and then we also do some evaluation
manually combined evaluation and
understand we also did something under
detecting using a graph can using the
graph and I need some sort of relational
model to model this thing and this this
this is a different type of reviews this
is the rating this is the reseller
rating Stockholm
this is the shop reviews and their store
reviews so store reviews that will be
different from the product reviews for
example you buy camera you probably
should only write one reviews about that
camera but store reviews you could write
multiple for example being there are a
few times and there can I say no every
time why your experience is different
different so the crowd the hosting and
why we did this was that time the Google
or the interest in in this thing I mean
interesting so Google probably was
working with
this company and that they were
interested in this particular site and
then we crawl the whole thing and then
get the mic class i'm dana mining class
to do this and then if i allow that some
guy wrote thirty forty reviews was in
half an hour anyway so but that was that
was easy to detect now and we we
represent this as a review graph can
really graph in a sense you have have
three type of notes
it's a heterogeneous news graph and
they're the reviewers and they have
reviews you have stores okay so yeah
hydrogens graph then use this graph to
capture the relationship you can capture
the relationship of this of this three
type of entities and whatever entities
and what are the things one of the
concept we define a few concepts so the
trust needs of reviewers and honesty of
review and the reliability of stores and
then you can see all these things that
are related to each other
it's a relate to each other for example
and review is more trustworthy if he or
she has written more honest reviews
honesty river so this is the type of a
story is more reliable it has more
positive review from trustworthy
reviewers you can transfer reviewers and
the review is more honest if it's
supported by many other owners to
reviews here is so you can see this is
somewhat like sort of PageRank all those
kind of things okay you wrangle his
algorithm sort of emulated and and then
you can you can model them in a
relational way okay relational manner
and we use this logistic function
it's just try to make sure you know some
you will reach somewhere then you should
sort of stabilize and get you stabilized
your your value and so so you can this
one is about honesty and other thing i
related this one is the reliability
versus the relational things going on
here and then later and then you can run
this in sorry I can run this with power
iteration now you can iterate many many
sort of iterations and now you get
something sort of stabilizing so in this
particular evaluation was we try to
compare what's the Better Business
Bureau so in the u.s. has a Better
Business Bureau you can see this what
happens there and what happened our
ranked errors and the fairly fairly
consistent you can see very consistent
if it uh Bella beans were saying this is
a good review good guy and then then
we're well sort of given up on fini good
- okay then the students also try to go
through the web and search for this
particular company and they see people
trust this company or not so here is
them how do we detect the group's okay
group tection and group detection is
actually easier it's much easier
individual ones the pattern is not so
obvious but when you do sense in terms
of groups your pattern becomes fairly
obvious very obvious all right and the
so previously we try to manually label
individual reviews whether the fake or
not which is it was very very difficult
but if you try to label groups it's
relatively easy can relatively easy
because the collective behaviors can
eclectic the favorite and so the in this
case was a group of people working
collusion right the right to promote
some promotion products and such spams
can be quite damaging actually quite
damaging and they can take total control
and the whole group then in this case we
have the algorithm which has three steps
three steps and the frequent pattern let
me see you with that okay and the first
one was trying to find frequent matter
because you can see whether this thing
the same bunch of guy has been reviewing
multiple products or multiple products
so that's very easy to detect from the
using the frequent pattern and then some
of them are just coincidence
for example apple products that might be
a bunch of guys who all review this
thing but it's probably okay you know
there are very popular products I can
probably product and they have setup
features and which is essentially
indicators on the cruise cake loose and
then later I will also use the
relational model to rank this okay in
this case well we have a bunch of guys
to actually label the data I can label
the data because in this case was not
that difficult to label and this this
was the real story from ABC mention to
you and what happens is the ABC that one
the reporters discover a champ positive
endorsement from a group of six metro
area businesses ranging from auto care
to this and we find this is from ABC
fine fifty Google user accounts only
post reviews about the same businesses
so they put behavior behavior like a
groups they have the post sort of
multiple products the same guy same guy
put in as well and this is the exactly
fit for this group detection exactly
detection and let me see and another one
which is I I mention maybe earlier was
also the case you can see this this that
this stuff this is the saying one of the
things we discover you can see this to
pick this this is about three software's
three different software's okay and this
is a person called a big Jung a big job
this is the real this is the from the
guy gives three pronounce only this guy
only reviewed these three products at
that time you can see all five stars
the dates December 4th December 4th
December 4th at the same day this
particular person I've seen in the
second one
December 8th December 8th this amazed
okay again the same exactly the same
product and you can see the another guy
and this is December force also exactly
the same product those three guys
actually there was another guy for four
of them for them they review and that
time only this three product I'm sure
brother if you look at the contents they
are very different kind of very
different but this kind of behavior if
you do data mining is fairly easy to
detect to find it you know funny
the only problem of course when you do
frequent panel Manning you need to have
reasonably high support which is caused
some trouble it does cause some trouble
because now we have when we did this
analysis was only for the manufacture
products which is a hundred thousand
people reviews long time ago now we
cross the game a few millions now then
you got to make this support very high
otherwise you can't find it which is not
good and because he's known as
Association those frequent man in many
is a grows exponentially yeah and the
number of pennants grow eventually well
I also try to deal with that problem and
then there's not a problem we were
talking to talking to companies so
company some companies try to implement
this algorithm Mohammed says they said
oh this this is probably it's okay you
can do this in periodically alright for
example in a few week or in the few you
can do this ones but is it possible to
do this online when this guy wrote it
submit it ah I know this is no good
which is the problem here this kind of
algorithm we can now run like that you
cannot run out online and then to the
purpose okay so one of the company are
saying in the DC area and they were
saying how do you do this in an online
kind of situation so this is this was
very simple to do and for frequent
panamanian what it says is for each
products each products you get all the
user IDs I only review IDs and for every
product you have user IDs you get a
transaction order we call the
transactions and then you combine this
transaction to find all the the guys the
bunch of guys who
sort of a review of few products we st.
no I'm not necessary the same time but
all of them but review this thing and
then you can also have a few for example
the cruise to further filter it and a
few for a few did this is a group time
window so when the bunch of guys doing
they're probably doing the similar
timeframe similar timeframe and that
group deviation and they similar at this
internal review rating similar and the
content similarity are they something
similar and they're also the member
contents m90 for example the same guy in
across different things are they similar
and also the early time frame then this
this type of this type of things so can
you can see and then we can again
computer models of relational models of
how the groups relate to individual
product products and members and the
products and a group and members
especially a guru member because the
groups and the members are related right
if your group is bad of course I
remember probably bad on member but and
then you can again you can do you can
define this mathematically sort of still
heuristic kind of way to define it
although and then enough to be
manipulating matrixes ok matrixes and
then try to compute a final ranking okay
final ranking and then we can you can do
evaluation this particular vanishing
with we did we did menu labeling my name
they bring by a bunch of guys a bunch of
guys and you can do the same are fairly
fairly accurately fairly accurately so
that's roughly would have been doing and
my research mainly was focusing on
sentiment analysis but just because of
was involved with Microsoft and I know
so when some time give talks on this
particular issue and people always ask
are you sure this you do the same
analysis are you sure this guy's a
trustworthy or not so okay let me do
something else see whatever can get some
try to catch some of these people and
now it becomes very if you have seen in
used as well quite a bit of
tres and in the public in the public and
next few weeks we also some some
reporters do you want to talk about this
issue they're still not not oh whoa is
this thing still kinda interested in
this
we haven't move into the social me other
type of social media for example you go
to Twitter there are also a lot of
people doing this and then the current
method still fairly simple very simple
and we have not really focused a lot of
time on this in a sense of where we got
very very disappointed in the first few
years and what about with some min that
I always give me a give us back
something not very good always that we
have a comments about evaluation and how
can you be sure
maybe Shawn so even for the different WW
paper we we submit we got lost this year
was to me twice three times every time
was that my student said okay I'm gonna
leave it so he went the label at nine
got accepted he got a eight eight of his
friends gonna live it and it turns out
the groups are much easier to labor
because the behavior is so obvious it's
obvious and then so that was the
basically the saying if you're
interested you can look at we have a
chapter which helped to talk about this
thing and sort of a survey there's some
wall but now there's some quite a few
peoples are quite number people are
working on this now and this is gonna be
a problem forever and it's gonna be sort
of what is could you do something right
now the guy also do something the arms
race is arms race whether you can but in
this has to be taught ways in some sense
I'm being working with I'm not numb not
working without talking to people in
China and here they're all doing it but
all these are not the retailers
I have not see a single red here is
doing it because it's actually good for
them to have this thing and also some
other company for example
I'm Eric Express he's trying to do this
- what they are trying to do is quite
interesting they tried to do this in a
sense they want to verify your purchase
so you have a credit card right so they
have the credit card information so you
purchase something you wrote something
on Amazon but then you but you bought
from the Best Buy they were figured out
so and they talk to me and they try to
work with Yelp yeah I don't know why not
interesting working with you and the so
they they are now they got a retailer
they said they didn't tell me which one
and then I also worked together was
other credit high issue I say if you
just do it yourself it's probably not
good enough
you gotta worker stuff you know other
issue of the crackers so to to verify
you whether you purchase something
somewhere somewhere or this particular
product okay and that's roughly about it
yeah
- sorry detective
regular detectives or fake reviews
trying to detect legitimate reviews like
good reviewers and good reviews
yeah there's some sentiment analysis
research or stream of the quality or the
utility of the reviews you can rank
those things - and but the problem with
those also the guy who is really writing
in well you don't know you can write all
the product features you know give very
nice comments and yeah yeah we did some
analysis especially if he read his paper
up to this dub-dub paper because we have
the because we have this labor data and
this time we've labored data so then we
can analyze the behaviors whether this
kind of things whether this kind of
feature does somehow separate people
separate groups yeah we did some
analysis on that and individuals away we
couldn't do it because you have no good
data for that
yeah yeah
no verify purchases one yes yeah yeah
yeah that's what that's what one man
you're saying another thing is if you
think about it that I think I personally
think this this thing can be done if the
company doing it themselves because what
we are doing here and I complete public
information if you think about this a
private information it's I think it's
doable at least you can catch quite a
bit of those for example y'all please
doing that but Yahoo is not doing a
great job in the sense I mean it's not
doing quite good job actually quite good
job and the but that still also fake are
there for example just giving examples
of dentists the situation I mean very
clear that fake weather yep did not feel
to this but Yahoo did a filter out one
to filter or two of them the first
review and as I said the first review
was somebody wrote a negative about this
particular particular sort of doctor in
one with his three shops that got
removed could it this dentist told us
how come knives in his gun he said the
first thing I saw it and then a few days
later disappear he's he's thought this
guy must sort of you know talk to Yelp
or whatever pay money to Yahoo whatever
to get it removed okay and I don't think
I don't think so I don't think so and
but then there's another very positive
review I believe this tent is a roll
himself got filtered also but that's a
few more that's still there so the
people actually believing that and then
China product when after a while a lot
of people I just do you know that these
are not good products eventually yeah
yeah faster since are lots of people
don't bother to write and also the
product may not be that great might not
be that bad so you probably don't go
there and I'm gonna say something Rivera
be unless is really bad take more
businesses yes yes well yeah yeah
for example the Google Places no it's a
big place people fake quite a lot yeah
allegation denial technique check is
lower that so you have both amigo that
we as parents so where do you find one
is painful in goes to play if we just
use individual spider-man stemming
technical just a minor deviation
technique what percent of the fake the
video we don't know we have no idea
we're just doing something whether we
just you know we just did some
evaluation 100 and other thousand like
that we can't go below because this is
very difficult to figure out
so because we do manual evaluation the
group was you know that's a very clear
features you thinking you probably
identify self introduced what personal
we have not done that kind of now don't
be interesting - yeah and the people
asked me to estimate the what for
example the New York Times that people
ask me the estimated what a percentage
of your fake I was a difficult question
a very difficult I told them 30% why I
have a reason okay I have a reason if
you go to look at the job
they out about 15% the about 15%
I have a good reason I was seeing a lot
of fake reviews I know I'm fake Yahoo
did not forget 5th if you didn't now
still this day so I give them you know
probably I told them I can't really do
this so so accurately but recently
garner or something have one reported he
said by 2014 they'll be going about 15
percent so a lot of people saying that's
that's the underestimate it's a very uh
Thursday because somebody says because
they have estimated they said fake
reviews and also the fake clicks and
fake friends and or fake followers
things like that so one of the guy who
wrote comment says they have been doing
this what he experienced he said his
experience and 90% of fake especially
their followers and also those who are
followers are all created so they were
trying to sell they were trying to do
something then they look at the
followers always follow has nothing to
do with my business
there's only saying that they got a lot
of followers but only you know he
believes 90% of my not right
if you thought I click from the axe
basically like google eyes right on that
yeah so that's all sorts of interesting
research need to be done actually in
this this area and that we have I mean
when we use the external information
we're always handicapped very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
