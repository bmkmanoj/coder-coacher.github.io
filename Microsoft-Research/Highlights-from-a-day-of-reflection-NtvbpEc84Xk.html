a time both to reflect on what's come
before and how we got to where we are
today and also to look forward and think
about the future we felt that the best
way to commemorate our 20 years was to
really honor our tradition of engagement
with the best and brightest researchers
in the world and to do it in as open a
way as possible
we have assembled six teams each of
these teams is led by a distinguished
external colleague of Microsoft Research
and a real leader in the computing
research community and we've already
presented to each of the teams a set of
questions designed to challenge each of
the teams to think about what advice
would make a difference for tomorrow's
leaders after the brainstorming will
reconvene in this room where we'll ask
you to report out on your on your
deliberations the results of today's
brainstorming will be captured on video
and offered on the web as a gift to
young researchers I just can't tell you
how anxious I am to see what you all
come up with now get to work
so we're gonna go right into the out
debrief outs from the ideation teams
let me now first call up the the Babbage
team briefed out represented it I
wouldn't ever tell somebody new in their
career aspire to mere competence I would
tell them find out if you find something
that you are really passionate about for
heaven's sakes go do that the world
needs people to do that this may be
going forward the way that computing
research should behave try and solve
some important problem in society to
advance the frontiers of computer
science if you want revolutions in
transportation or energy or healthcare
or education or scientific discovery or
national security than you need
revolutions innovations in in computing
ed was my advisor at at u-dub when I was
here in computer science and I want to
tell a story about ed mentoring style
and how he inspired me to do better and
so you know I was one of the first guys
working in it's not the first guy
working in it
in a new field which has since been
pretty influential and then growing but
I was one of the first guys working in
it and so I was very excited and I had a
lot of ideas I wanted to pursue and I
was very excited to achieve them and so
one day I'm in my office and browsing
the web and I look upon a blog post
where someone else is starting to work
on this kind of stuff and they're having
some idea is that that might be kind of
similar to mine and so I send it in the
mail and I send them you know look at
this blog post of them a link you know
they're they're not onto exactly what
I'm working on but they might get there
eventually
and so I expected that to be very
thoughtful in his response in the end
he's and he certainly was and so he
wrote me back a two-word reply that I
often repeat to my students it was run
faster the lesson I take away from this
is that work on things that you think
are fun don't try and have a plan in
advance too too much of a plan in
advance about what you want to do and
again the importance of like Ed
mentioned the importance of teaching I
mean this guy Tom who not have you've
ever heard of and well the Nitin doesn't
have haven't had any real impact in the
field
was hugely influential to me and so it
you can really impact people by sort of
showing them the way you've got to be
the architect of that vision and you got
a hold to that vision the way the
architect holds to the plans of the
building but you've also got to be the
chief engineer you've got to know
everything about what makes that
building stand and what and how to build
up from it's all a bottom-up building
process but you can't deviate from the
vision or you'll get some kind of crazy
building so be architect and chief
engineer there's advice for junior
people you try to pick mentors and not
one mentor but many mentors the best
ideas are the simple ones that others
had not thought out yes duh and you know
your goal as a student is to get that
that one where everybody else in the
audience does I wish I'd done that one
so Microsoft Research is growing in a
pretty substantial way over the years
the last 20 years of my life have just
been a lot of fun and frankly it just
seems to get more fun as the year go
spot had the years go by
rather than web I think that's how
important I heard that in the advice
today and resonated with me thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
