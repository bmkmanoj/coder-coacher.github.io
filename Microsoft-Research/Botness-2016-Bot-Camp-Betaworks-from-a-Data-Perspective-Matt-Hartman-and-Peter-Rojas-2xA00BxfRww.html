minutes about a kind of what we do obey
works but but from a data perspective
for BOTS of people are building so for
those of you don't know us we do two
things at beta works we build companies
and independently but highly related we
make seed-stage investments and so one
of those things in the category
investing is we're doing this thing
bought camp which which we mentioned so
what I wanted to do was share some data
from how what we're seeing in terms of
there was a question about what's being
built category specifically without sort
of going deep into specific companies
talking about which talking about some
data from the bot perspective and then
also we built a bot and so I want to
share some day with how people were
interacting with it yeah so we'll keep
it short but Matt and I are the
co-creators of something called bought
camp which is a program that we're doing
at beta works it's a program we're going
to take in 10 chatbot startups do sort
of like a precede accelerator program
with them and the inst the sort of
inspiration for this is that since i
joined beta works sorry about a year ago
Matt and I have had a conversation about
bots I think like a two-hour
conversation about bots like every day
since I started and then about three
months ago we just came up with the idea
for Bach am thinking about how excited
we were about the space we had already
obviously made an investment in howdy
with been almost a year ago actually now
and wanted to learn a lot more about the
space and frankly make a bet on chat
BOTS being a big thing and and trying to
figure out what the opportunities there
were so we opened it up we got 346
startups applied all bots and we're
going to pick 10 of those for the
program and the program will be 12 weeks
of product development branding user
acquisition data science fundraising all
sort of typical stuff you see an
accelerator but all focused around bots
and conversational interfaces and we
have an awesome set of partners which
you can see on this obligatory logo
slide and now we can jump in sort of to
the data which i think is the most
interesting part for everyone here and
Matt do
dig in on this so this is kind of hard
to see from up there but I think we're
going to share this more publicly so the
most fifteen percent of the applications
were enterprise and I don't think it's a
surprise slack is a big platform for
distribution and so I think that sees
case on enterprise we've creation tools
and platforms as the second biggest
category nine percent the third biggest
categories assistant / concierge eight
percent health care and wellness seven
percent Commerce six percent finance six
percent news and media and then we have
kind of entertainment travel education
to me the interesting thing here is that
if you take out assistance constant
which / concierge is eight percent and
if you look at travel which is five
percent and maybe one other category
those are the only human assisted
categories everything else is what we
think about is like actual BOTS things
that aren't just sending you to some
sending you to someone and then routing
it to a human and then routing back and
responding some things are probably
hybrids but I think it's interesting
that there was real kind of technology
there yeah and then we managed to tally
together the different platforms that
everyone was building for you'll notice
that these add up to more than one
hundred percent because a lot of the
bots built for multiple platforms which
is not surprising but what might have
been noteworthy is that SMS still the
most popular platform of people to build
for obviously I think a hundred percent
of those using twilio as far as we could
tell i think the the the weighting of
enterprise-focused spots meant that a
lot of the bots that we saw we're
building for slack and I think showed a
lot of the maturity of the ecosystem
there okay yes I mean we can again will
circulate days you have questions
specifically we can we can hit them
should we I mean get I'm sorry yeah so
this sort of depending on how you think
about it so this is like they actually
built an app but they had then the
notion of bots inside of it and then and
then you have sort of at the far end we
had a few on Alexa fewer than actually I
thought I thought would apply
we had above some of they were online
and then and then kick and and Twitter
surgery to the next one yeah so the next
thing we want to talk about was we built
this kind of fun bot called bought with
the CEO beta works as John borthwick so
he's British so everything's a pun and
so bot wick is a bummed so you can text
this number to see it and I've included
the number on the subsequent slide so I
can kind of keep going but some data
that we got from this is that people
said hello 19 different ways hello hello
bot wick hello mr. Bott hello world
hello hello oh hello what is hello so
all these different kind so yo bot wick
why you know home is my favorite so so
the intro message we found was actually
pretty important when you think about
not being able to communicate what the
drop-down menus are like what the thing
can do the intro Metra's becomes really
important so just so that you can see it
it says how are you today what would you
like to discuss you can ask me the
weather just say whether plus zip or the
news or ask me what podcasts the boss is
listening to i get to hit them to or
about a joke how about a joke i
highlighted in bold the things that work
sort of keywords for categories and so
we have on the back end we use dexter to
do regex french expressions and just
save a sense this is a relatively dumb
bot it is literally an Excel spreadsheet
we're on column a it's a regex match and
column B is the response to that
question just to give you a kind of a
sense of the simplicity of this so 200
Peter so we had nineteen hundred
messages to give you a sense of the
denominator 206 weather news podcasts
and then we have people asking questions
that aren't necessarily directly here so
how old are you how dot star you read it
what are you reading was reading time
what time is it and then ask people ask
for a joke a lot of most popular ones
were weather and joke which were the
anticipated ones the one of the things
that came up yesterday so I kind of ran
a bunch of data last night because I
thought it was interesting to to hear
this various a little bit cut off well
read them out people were talking about
the length of search queries and
I went back into the bot wake logs and
just looked at what the what the lengths
were and how people were interacting
with this thing which people kind of
fundamentally know is actually about
keywords even though they're asking
these questions we're basically doing
these red X masters to figure out which
keywords so an average the length of a
request was 13 characters the shortest
was to the longest was 50 now keep in
mind this is mostly done during herbs
all done through text message so that
probably influences the way that people
are asking the questions or the life of
questions but what's interesting was
just looking at one example the weather
category people would ask what's the
weather in a particular zip code tell me
the weather in a zip code weather zip
code weather and so people were kind of
you can see this in a much different
categories people are trying to figure
out what uh what kind of what the
keyword wasn't just going directly to it
we could also this sort of looks another
piece of 514 questions didn't have
answers you can start to see people
trying to poke around to see whether
there's keywords or Easter eggs in this
so we have various emoji lots of
profanity people ask questions like Alan
Turing are you happy are you my friend
and then people say like Bernie Sanders
drums equal MC squared happy birthday I
think somewhere in there is like Trump
and I think that was that was good i
wanted to go through that really quickly
but if you guys are any of you have
specific questions around any of this
data we're happy to answer them
thanks
to talk to our top 30
so so we haven't actually finished that
process so we're right in the very end
of the process so we are getting 2 i'll
i'll tell you sort of a broad view that
we have taken from on the investments
productive and tell me if you have
something to add here peter is that we
were looking for bots where there was
some level of depth somewhere so meaning
that like oh I was using kind of
internally uber as an example like
that's about but then it has like a most
step there are cars driving around and
stuff like supporting that bot right and
so whether that sort of deep data
science or a bunch of a bunch of data
that they're gathering or AI or some
kind of network it's being built that
was sort of the bunch of how we were
thinking about competitive moats I think
the other thing is um since it's a
precede program it's also meant for
people very very early and almost most
stuff was pre product or pre launch not
pre product but not everything was and
we were you know there was a pretty wide
breadth of where people were in the
product process that applied and we
didn't want it just to be stuff that was
we could have just picked stuff that was
out in market and had users and we
deliberately didn't want to do that and
the stuff we selected another question
whether any of that sort of surprised
you target us for two hours a day for
all
anything in though you thought well
that's amazing oh there's off I mean
there's a lot well we saw a lot of the
same ideas over and over again not
surprisingly i think that some of the
things that surprised us were around i
would say that that beta works
historically has been maybe more
consumer focused in the way that we've
approached everything but that a lot of
the the the most fully formed products
were around enterprise and it and i
think part of that was that the use
cases around bots and and when they make
sense our most fully realized in the
enterprise space specifically really
around slack and people being able to
integrate there and be able to have a
bot which is able to integrate into
their workflow or into some aspect of
the business and so we were I think
we're a little surprised by I mean maybe
surprised ourselves how much we came
around to seeing the utility of bots in
the enterprise space rather than I think
our original intentions that we were
going to have a lot more consumer
well the the that we had people from all
over the world that was something that
was really encouraging i mean people
from West Africa people from South Asia
Southeast Asia China South America a lot
from the US and so there was I think
what surprised us maybe not surprises
but I think what was interesting was
seeing that there are people building
bots all over the world and that it's
not something that's localized to the
Bay Area or just people who are you know
sort of within the this network that
it's people all over the world see it as
an opportunity to build and innovate and
make cool stuff and so I think that
because it was an open filter we were
able to get people that wouldn't
necessarily be part of the traditional
fundraising process that you know that
that startups go through so that was
pretty pretty awesome I think everyone
wants lunch I no idea but one more
question
I mean I think that the the so first so
we didn't we didn't bowl anything
there's a there's a bot called purple
which maybe you're referring to which
which has all caps which i think is it
they'll make a sentence and then
anything in all caps you can respond
with just that I think it's actually a
really good UI and a good user
experience to just subtly say if you
want to respond to this you can and here
and there will be more behind there I've
seen ones that say text em for more so
they'll send you one message and then
kind of weight to pull I don't know that
we have answers yet I think it sort of
raised more questions about how you
indicate what these things are supposed
to do one of the things that we've
learned from I think making the the bot
kampot from bot wick from seeing data
and inside of products like poncho is
that some we need to be all of us need
to be thoughtful about how to about
weather like where our lane is like are
we staying in our lane or we like how do
we react to things that are outside of
this core kind of vertical scope of
other conversations yesterday in the AI
and machine learning group were about
about the opportunities in go to go deep
in verticals but that sort of
necessarily means you're not going to be
able to answer every question and I
think that's I think that having a
personality to be able to respond to
things that are outside can be helpful
for the for the bok bok hee hee John I
think has like a random on magic 8-ball
answer that comes through for the Bach
hanbok we just said this is a dumb bot
and so we want you to help them help us
make it smarter any other questions
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
