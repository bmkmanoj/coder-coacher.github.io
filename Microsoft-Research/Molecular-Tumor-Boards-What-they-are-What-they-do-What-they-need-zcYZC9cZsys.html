hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay so it's my great pressure to
welcome dr. Jeff Schrager who is
visiting for us from Stanford and cancer
Commons so Jeff got his PhD from CMU
with herb Simon and and then went on do
a lot of interesting exciting stuff
including pioneering in e-commerce and
working on computing platform for
farmers so and today he will probably
talk us about tell us a bit more about
molecular tumor board which is an
exciting frontier in genomic medicine
and so without further ado yes Jeff
oh by the way for people who are online
you can actually hit a button to ask
questions so I will be monitoring your
questions and then as Jeff in real-time
so feel free to send in more questions
yeah you have to you have to write
annoyingly interrupt the speaker in
angle brackets and then to be clear by
the way that was softer I was working on
software for farmers not farmers just
that was not just a case it wasn't
wasn't obvious speaking so I'm gonna be
talking today about mountain bikes I'm
told which is what MTB stands for so the
original title of this talk was tools
for molecular tumor boards but I never
do this but just before we talk us
decide to reach change your slides which
of course I do
most of what I'm going to be talking
about is tools that actually are built
in conjunction with molecular tumor
boards or the equivalent molecular tumor
boards to be used for molecular tumor
boards and so I retained it to tools you
know to quote a famous Foss or bi for
end of molecular tumor boards and you'll
see how that how that plays out so this
is the outline so I'm gonna be it's
relatively short although that has a lot
of sub pieces and I'll start by talking
about precision oncology which is
essentially the problem that we're
dealing with is a decision problem which
is what drugs or more generally
treatments to give to who when or some
of the treatments could be non
treatments depending upon
any dimensions of the phenotype there
are many decisions to be made and that
sounds like a fairly simple problem and
in fact early on in medicine it was a
fairly simple problem so in the sort of
pre omec era there were you know
approximately ten different phenotypes
lung cancer breast cancer oh oh make is
so genomic is the word for basically
genome omec it's like you take star omec
right so genome egg metabolomic you know
no proteomic acts like EXO make blah
blah blah omec so it's just short for
everything Starwood yeah basically and
we're gonna get bigger actually very
quickly so there were approximately ten
phenotypes which were histologically see
now we're getting all the terms that's
not here unfortunately which were
histologically defined breast lung
cancer etc and there were a few chemo
therapies right and in that world you
can show what would happen if somebody
would show up and they'd do a biopsy and
then they'd select some treatment and
then there was some regimen for doing
the treatment and then they'd see what
happened right pretty simple model in
that world so this is the world of today
in the omec world and I would it's
pretty hard to show an infinite matrix
so essentially so use the technical term
11d zillion so basically it's an 11-2
zillion by eleven des alien dimension
problem where you have not only single
treatments but there are treatments
coming online all the time combinations
of treatments different plans for
different treatments all kinds of stuff
to beat on the treatment side and as I'm
sure you're familiar even if you've just
been reading the news there are
thousands and thousands tens of
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
of different dimensions on the general
phenotype side right so if you just look
at the genome you have and you know how
you count from sixteen thousand to three
gig worth of information just in the
genome itself of the patient and notice
by the way in cancer you're talking
about not only the patient's natural
genotype but also some tumor some
mutation which cause the problem
so there's genomics everywhere and in
this world
the workflow although it has the same it
still looks like a circle is very
different so essentially there's the
biopsy's you run the pan omics
essentially get all the data you can out
of out of the patient and the history of
it do some kind of complicated targeting
decision making some kind of complicated
treatment planning sometimes you can
test that the proposed treatment did
mice in other patients
hopefully first run the combo therapy do
much more time much more time short time
observation of what's going on you don't
have to basically wait five years for
the person to either die or be cured and
then they recur you know don't recur now
in 2011 we published a paper that was a
review of the different techniques at
the time the different problems at the
time in cancer and we claimed that AI
could cure cancer I'm not sure I would
claim that today in fact I would claim
the opposite today and we divide it into
three different kinds I don't expect you
to read this I just want to give you the
three different gross categories of
problems that we identify didn't go to
the paper if you care
there were knowledge opportunities
basically get all the knowledge there is
there were learning opportunities which
is essentially observe what happens when
you do something and then update your
models and there were planning
opportunities now most folks focus on
reasonably enough focus on the knowledge
and data because computer science is
kind of these days anyway as a knowledge
and data kind of field and in fact this
is the second part of this so it's it's
the obvious thing to do and so what have
we and other people have created our
knowledge and literature based tools for
tumor boards generally and I'm going to
show you an example of this because I'm
going to go to the fore by end of
version of this so this is a particular
project some of this I'm going to skip
through because it's going to be close
to newcastle for you folks so this is
focusing on the modeling essentially
really this is treatment selection or
treatment ranking so you do something
which implicates a model and then choose
a treatment and then it goes into
treatment planning so what happens here
generally is you say okay we're gonna
gonna scrape the literature get some
bunch of information which is
approximately the disease model it could
be a molecular model or not I'll show
you molecular and non molecular versions
of it and then use that in treatment
selections so this is sort of the
obvious thing and so what you're doing
is trying to take broad-based omics
broad-based research somehow mix them
together and come up with of course
answers to various questions the the
most relevant question for a patient is
which drugs are applicable to which
which phenotype but there are if you
have this data you can answer other
kinds of questions so a particular
instance of this is a project that we
did with blue gel and a tall and moose
Ellen it's an Italian name I have a
little trouble pronouncing it and they
had a bunch of physicians oncologists
that had formed this molecular melanoma
molecular map project right and what
they did is they went out and they built
melanoma molecular maps right and so
they went and they they were experts at
this and they built a bunch of
PowerPoint slides essentially so there's
no underlying representation to this and
mapped out there were like 20 of them
and they mapped out it's a very
complicated system as are all these and
then they did this other interesting
thing so they had all these pictures and
they said okay well what we're going to
do is we're going to go to literature
and we're going to create this thing
called the targeted therapy database so
the targeted therapy database was a
spreadsheet and it was built by I'll
show you this a little bit closer in a
minute it's manually created over a
decade of melanoma research by experts
in the field right and experts you know
biologists are really good at filling in
spreadsheets right they really like to
deal with them they could deal with them
very well and good so what they did is
this is down close-up of the same thing
they're all I just selected the b-raf
part so this is the the molecule the
gene of interest in this particular case
the particular mutation I said there are
lots of entries that protected that and
there are the reference the paper that
was scraped for that information and
they read the paper and they decided
basically one line per paper
approximately whether that paper for a
be ref mutation showed that this was
sensitive to whatever drug so this is
the drug sometimes the drug had an alias
so far that's relatively obvious the
the interesting thing is these columns
here the model is what kind of
experiment was done okay and the number
of cases which is sometimes irrelevant
if it's a laboratory experiment is how
many observations so in this particular
case of 537 is an observational study
with 37 human subjects all right
notice that a 6 some number of which
there were many this is just a little
piece of a thousand I think was a 1400
line table a 1400 row table a six would
be randomized called trial a set would
be a min analysis all right we'll get
back to this so it's sort of keep that
in mind then you can do and this is
where I'm going to go through this
relatively quickly because you'll all
understand it without me having to
explain it you basically do some fairly
simple straightforward statistics and
you can Spore
the likelihood that a different molecule
is going to actually have an impact on
no one AMA given that particular
observed mutation alright so we built a
tool to do this and the tool had a
couple of interesting features yes
they're weighted by the by the model
that's exactly right so they're weighted
by the model and the number of
observations right but other than that
the uniform right so that's why that
model is in there exactly so you take
that table you take the math that's
underlying it by this is published so
you can go to the paper if you really
wanted to see the math and do the
obvious thing built a web-based tool but
the web-based tool had several
interesting features that I want to show
you because that emphasizes this
interactive the interactive point I want
to make so the kind of inputs are the
state this is this was usually set to
the standard set of treatments so the
inputs are basically the observations
the tests and their results whether they
were consistent with that as il8 is
expressed this concordant is apparently
italian for yes
and this corden is apparently italian
for no and so you would set that would
set this but the interesting thing is it
would tell you first of all
which things that you had to test that
is to say it was ranking not only the
treatments but also the tests to do
right so give you a bunch of tests you
would fill in the ones that you did and
then you'd end up with some score that
basically says yea or nay you know
what's the probability that this is
actually gonna have an effect and it's
more interesting when there are multiple
things so I'm actually going to skip
forward to this one oh sorry so here
what's going on is it tells you the
references that is basically it shows
you the rose from the prevalent
hypotheses and this was very important
to the doctors remember we were building
this with the physicians that built the
table and so they insisted on seeing the
relevant hypotheses and seeing the
references because they wanted to be
able to basically go back and figure out
whether to believe it or not and what
that will come back to that because I
was very important that I said it's
actually just a picture the same
thinking again it's more interesting
when there is more than one hypothesis
in the set so it's telling you
essentially it's doing a what we call
this as drug ranking or treatment
ranking okay so this is treatment
ranking based on data that was supplied
by human experts reading the literature
and making a judgment as to what the
value is so you can do the obvious thing
and say okay well we're gonna semi
automate the reading of the literature
okay now it turns out to be extremely
difficult for reasons that I'm sure you
guys could explain to me better than I
can explain it to you but essentially
the way we did this was by just looking
for concordance relationships and then
actually going back and having to score
what the cohort which direction the
concordance relationships were the
problem with concordance relationships
is this is out of pubmed the problem
with concordance relationships is that
there are let's see two to the two two
to the twenty two thousand possible
combinations if you just do it raw but
the great thing is that they remember
it's the melanoma molecular map project
so they actually had drawn all these
nice pictures and so we could just focus
on the genes out of the pictures right
and so that's a fairly easy thing to
scrape out of the picture in fact
Mechanical Turk you can scrape the
relationships also so you you end up
with a bunch of relationships that
basically say the probability for a
particular gene let me see
actually only back up once
because a better example right so the
probability of this is what you really
want
you can't really get that that is the
probability of a cure given a treatment
in a disease characterization you can
get things like the probability that a
gene goes with a treatment and then you
have to actually score the direction of
that manually because we didn't have
enough natural language to be able to
tell what direction their result was I
still think there isn't enough natural
language um to do that so you can go
through and you can get that and you can
add those data in and then the then the
experts would look at that and they'd
have to score the direction but a more
interesting thing to do is actually use
exactly the same oh this is uh sorry I
had backed up I lost my place because of
backing up but basically we use these
things to constrain what the what the
coordinate relationships were over so
more interesting thing is to go back to
this and say ah well if you've got human
the ability to do human observations so
5:37 is an observation of seven so seven
subjects what's five one case study
right okay and there's thousands and
thousands of case studies in the world
many more than there are papers right so
what you can do is you can actually
start adding rows to this table for
every case that comes down the line
right now it's it's a little complicated
because they're non independent if there
are multiple observations but so there
are details but the idea is that
eventually if you added cases to this
then it's an extremely simple version of
a learning approach from the from the
data right now they don't have to
publish the cases all right you want
this to be sitting there you know
reading the cases that are coming in
through the tumor board I get two tumor
courts in a second now that's the
obvious approach that is the just
abbreviated genotype their genotype two
treatment models I give it a treatment
also but the problem is it's not a
complete solution not even nearly it's
not even like that the the the eighty
percent it's like more like the ten
percent of a complete solution and the
reason is that if you look at treatment
planning that is a little bit into the
treatment selection but more into the
treatment planning
it's really an incredibly complicated
thing and so you don't have to read this
I've kind of written it out here same
picture but now look at all the other
considerations right so you've got the
disease model whatever information you
grabbed out of literature which is kind
of that table
you've got the patient's preferences the
treatment history financial
considerations which is I guess the same
thing almost as drug availability and
affordability
you've got guidelines of what things are
legal to do what things have been
approved what things have not been
approved what you can get away with
tumor availability for testing is a
major constraint you might say well I'm
gonna do every test in the book but it
turns out you've only got a small amount
of tumor and every time you have to get
new tumor you're basically not only
expensive but it's exceedingly painful
if you can get it at all
so all of these kinds of considerations
are faced by these things basically it's
to add to it broad-based clinical
experiences where we're going all right
so the question is where do you find
broad-based clinical experience and the
answer is molecular tumor boards and
that's where I'm going to spend most of
them the detailed time here so molecular
what's a molecular tumor board so
molecular tumor board is a team of
they're not always in the same room
sometimes it's virtual sometimes it's
email but in any case it's a group of
experts in many different areas faced
with the problem of treating the patient
before them right and I like to think of
this actually more as an engineering
problem than as a science problem right
this is an occasional recognizes Apollo
13 one of the greatest scenes in any
movie any time when the astronauts are
falling out of the sky running out of
oxygen and this and they're faced with
figuring out how them not to suffocate
and they pour all this junk out on a
table and say we've got to find a way to
make this this I don't know which way it
went but basically this fit into a hole
for that using nothing but this and
that's really the problem faced by
molecular tumor boards also essentially
they it's actually an interesting
question let me get back to it because I
have a several different approaches to
it okay I mean that's there are many
practical issues right like that in
tumor boards so the way this generally
works in case it's
not obvious is that a patient shows up
who has progressed on whatever treatment
standard treatment they were given
usually so these are the most advanced
patients the tumor boards basically see
problem patients and that's good I'm as
bad that there are problem agents but
it's good if you focus about like the
tumor boards you're seeing the hard
cases right first of all so the tumor
board meets we'll get into what happens
there they come up with some hypotheses
and some treatment strategies and then
it gets fed back to the oncologist and
the patient they make a decision what
they're gonna do they try a few things
sometimes it comes back to the tumor
board all right it's sort of a hobbyist
workflow reimbursement is a big part of
it and actually the argument for
reimbursement is part of what that what
tumor board worries about right so
significant problem so they're facing in
the discussions they're facing is not
just which treatment to select but which
treatment to select and what to do with
this patient who's falling out of the
sky or worse give it all of these
considerations and so again there's a
group of experts in many different
fields that come together on some
timetable and some discussion often
remote an email to explicitly assemble
and I'm using model very generally not a
model in the sense of the pathway model
necessarily right but basically some
theory of what they're going to do with
this patient
importing the best current knowledge
reason from that theory it would be a
better word now the interest thing about
tumor boards is they expose their
reasoning to us right and so by watching
molecular tumor boards in process we're
watching the in process problem-solving
that these experts are doing and they're
doing all kinds of stuff I'll show you
examples of this they're using the
knowledge of open literature etc so
there's two unique kinds of things that
molecular tumor to deal with lots of
unique things so first of all they know
or they have hypotheses which they use
about what parts of literature too early
like what do we think really is worth
looking at okay they know what parts of
the literature are outdated right or
again I've every time I say I know that
means they operate as though they know
whether you know what it really means
for a piece of literature outdated in
some absolute sense is unknown but
they're operating this way I have to
make decisions um knowledge is not
available at all in the literature
ethical model all kinds of stuff
literature doesn't cover
right how to actually interact with the
pharma over getting this drug what are
the importance relationships between
these different kinds of things the in
the cross domain translations of terms
you know we mean this by this gene
foundation medicine means that by that
gene what happens if the gene isn't
there at all because it got ripped up
and they have heuristics that they use
to do this basically they're doing
practical knowledge and this you might
call scientific pragmatics right there's
another category of knowledge which is
that they basically are making arguments
pro and con so they're really trying to
work this thing out for the hypotheses
they give you the rationale for
rejecting hypotheses this is very
important because if you look at what's
in a an EHR you only basically see what
was done sometimes in the letter that
went to support it or in the notes you
say the reason that they chose that but
you don't see the reasons that they
rejected hypotheses right which turn out
to be you know I would think more
important but their net basically never
get anywhere this is totally lost
information they have this is sort of
the same as the previous one they have
implicit unpublishable knowledge
knowledge which you know there's no
experiment but it's in the
problem-solving they have to use it they
use it every day in their actual work
and they have the tumor boards have
stats on the cases that typically occur
which you could get by looking at the at
the data that came out of the health
records but basically they have that
information in front of them in their
heads the more so you might call this in
context knowledge right so it's
pragmatic knowledge and in contact
dollars the distinction isn't very very
important so we see what tumor boards
use and produce everything you're seeing
now is data is real data which either
came from stuff that went into a tumor
board or stuff that came out of a tumor
board or stuff that was transcribed in a
tumor board process okay and I haven't
distinguished it all so one thing that
tumor words do is because they're
meeting you know on a time schedule and
they really have to think about this you
get all these experts to think about
this problem is they really condense the
dimensionality of the problem for their
reasoning so for example the best
example of this is they never look at
the entire huge radiological history of
this thing a radiologist says here's the
important thing to look at right
they're like circle it and say
okay this is where the tumor is right
this is where the tumor was similarly
you get the history they also very often
these days molecular tumor boards will
actually pick a diagram out of a paper
off in a review paper and put it up and
say okay this is the thing we're
reasoning about is the Rast pathway okay
and actually if you look at this one
this came from a real molecular tumor
it's actually got where the drugs target
and things like that and the pathway and
stuff like that so they're struggling
with trying to actually do real-time
reasoning about this this situation and
then they'll give explanation so I'm
going to actually go on and give you a
better version view of this so here's
again data from the tumor board this
this data comes from across the bridge
actually tony blow it eww
so this is again the condensation of
this story right so they give you
relevant background knowledge as opposed
to dumping the entire health record they
this is just different selection of
background knowledge now from literature
and databases not from the actual health
record right so they went out and looked
at some data and said I don't know for
some some reasons relevant to them that
there are 44 of these endometrial
cancers with this with this mutation in
cosmic they pick up the literature that
they believe is relevant right and they
pointed out and importantly they often
least in my experience which isn't huge
they will I'll change it to sometimes
you can sometimes see them state things
that we can't find in the actual
literature which seem to be implications
of the papers but aren't actually in the
papers if you read them right so it's
essentially in context in context
reasoning about factoids so the facts
this is well now in fact means something
different in the concept of reasoning
then in the context that you would read
them out of a paper just probably why I
think reading papers is slightly crazy
if that's all you do
they also they create explanations so
after all of this stuff basically they
collectively decide that the this
particular FGFR mutation is the driver
of this particular tumor now they've got
a hypothesis about what's driving it a
model if you will all right and so now
they're going to create a treatment plan
right so they say okay we're gonna try
this drug and this drug and it turns out
they did this is a little history they
did try that drug some stuff about the
approved
will not approve of the drugs and then
this I guess is their bottom line
suggestion predicted that the bracken
check to mutations may confer simply the
PARP inhibitors which is what they're
going to try and use and sometimes they
get test results right they tried it
zoom report finds out what happened
usually fairly quickly like on the next
or a few meetings later whenever they
can get the actual measurements back so
this is just to point out various places
so you can find relevant models model
based reasoning background context I
said all of this as I was talking
through it so I'm just gonna page
through it this is just annotations on
the same thing that I said essentially
tests of hypotheses and outcomes alright
so that's what tumor boards do and go
ahead I'm gonna get to that exact
question right I'm sure I have no idea
what would happen my guess is that
they're immune to it essentially by some
sort of sign law that the patient does
but I don't know I mean no one's really
in utica to the lawsuit but I've never
heard of a tumor board being disbanded
because of a lawsuit but I may have
happened your point about the military
is interesting for a bunch of reasons
one is the DARPA has partly funding this
another one is that one of the pictures
when I showed the pictures of the tumor
board I didn't say this but one of those
pictures was actually not a tumor board
it was Afghanistan's war room they look
exactly the same to your point and I'm
gonna actually talk about some
technology that actually is using tax
the same if you think of them as
engineering teams or to your point
essentially a war room process it's
exactly the same kind of thing yeah
right exactly well while people are
dying and you know either in the field
or you know not so that's but that's the
thing that makes it more interesting is
that you've actually got lives on the
line right it's not like some random in
or disability or sedition support for
building a bridge some day in the future
right of course money could be dying in
that particular case but so I'm gonna
talk very briefly about some approaches
all right each of these is partly
implemented in certain ways so the first
is this thing we call epic which is the
tumor board case um
the idea here is that we want to capture
the reasoning that goes on in the tumor
board and use that to help reduce the
dimensionality in this problem basically
give you hints all right so we're
focusing on the broad-based clinical
experience so what we're doing here is
capture the reasoning and remember you
get pro and con reasoning so essentially
this is just repeat of what you get so
you'll see the genomic aberrations tree
blah blah blah blah case summary
personalized decisions and the
hypotheses and the rationales for that
policy it's the most important part of
these rationales for the hypotheses all
right and the rationales for the
rejected hypotheses so we captured these
things in the obvious way and what we're
starting to do now partly working with
my Fung and some others is take it and
code the the relational meta knowledge
out of it all right and currently this
is manual being mainly code as you can
tell by X's and stuff left out but
basically the the I'm I just manually
coded this page the idea is I believe
that the technology out there can figure
out that you know poly adp-ribose Rob is
a ribose polymerase as a part that kind
of natural language technology is kind
of a done deal what's not a done deal is
the relations this argument supports
that this is a fact which came out of a
database and supports this and this you
know contradict to that and that sort of
thing so that's the kind of stuff that's
the kind of meta argument that we're
manually coding now and hope to be able
to semi-automatically code by
essentially training on the manual code
and that gives you the explanation
structures here's just another piece of
it
so these references support whatever I'd
have to read it to support that fact is
so they pulled this fact out of those

I believe the existing technology can
code what that fact is what it can't
code is the kind of meta structure of it
partly because this was written out but
often it's just spoken in a conversation
right so you're not actually looking at
something that somebody wrote most of
the time so essentially what we're doing
is gathering it from tumor boards
semi-automatically hopefully something
automatically coding it and then that
could be used for a bunch of different
things for physicians they want to get
and this is physicians want this
physicians want to basically put their
cases in get similar cases out start
using them as evidence for their own
reasoning and reasoning
examples for payers you get advanced
intelligence on which standard therapies
are being considered by thought these
are the thought leaders right the folks
in these molecular tumor boards for
farmers it's a similar you're basically
getting intelligence about how things
are being considered by the thought
leaders in combination with other things
and really used for hospital systems
presumably because you can make the
argument to payers better this way so
these are just kind of technical well
the first ones on technical that's for
the patient's
so these are so as of two years ago the
number was zero okay as of now the
number of things that actually call
themselves molecular tumor boards is
probably 15 right wait and the number of
tumor boards that now get molecular data
and have to cope with it is 100 percent
essentially alright because essentially
they're getting molecular data some from
their pathologists sometimes patients
walk in with a foundation medicine
report right and say look I went and I
did this thing I got a report use it
right and so what generally happens if
that's not you dub is they call up
somebody in some other field and say
help we've got this you know pile of
genomic data we don't know what to make
of it so it's the number is rising quite
rapidly go ahead unit questions it's
just one where they're not meeting it
can be virtual either in time or in
space and so the time Virtual actually
usually it's both because what happens
in practice is a couple of doctors will
meet in an actual local tumor board or a
proximal tumor board and then they'll
say well we don't know what the hell to
do with this and so they'll call
somebody or they'll we're gonna send an
email to somebody describe the case and
you know send the f-m report to them and
then get some guidance back alright get
some information back they do ok it's a
very good point I said there was an
arrow for that but I bet it didn't make
it clear so they very often do
post-mortem so whatnot that's the wrong
word they almost always get information
back about the outcomes and that's very
different than normal electronic health
records so normal health record is
the person comes back for more treatment
you'll see that if the person is cured
you have no idea what happened they
could have died and going away or going
to another hospital or you know whatever
the tumor boards do follow up themselves
right so they'll basically the one an
admin for a tumor board will call the
patient off with a patient's family up
and bring that information back to the
tumor boards problem
oh so one thing you could do with this
is you could use this data to just
basically do the kind of usual
clustering pattern map pattern matching
cohort I'm sorry clustering cohort
analysis and that's a fairly
straightforward thing to do and I think
we actually you know existing machine
learning tools could do that in a simple
way but that's not actually going to get
you much distance over an 11 gazillion
wide problem and so lambda zillion is a
technical term so another approach which
used to be called explanation based
generalization and now it's code calls
the Bayesian networks is essentially you
use the explanation so notice that an
explanation is going to walk from a set
of observations through some proof that
is to say through some inference proof
may be too strong to some decision right
and so you can use this trace to tell
you which pieces of the space are
related to which other pieces of the
space essentially okay and that used to
be called EBL or ABG and these days it's
essentially the same thing as a causal
Bayes net process to do it statistically
go ahead it's very very sparse but it's
way less sparse than if you didn't have
that the knowledge coming from the tumor
boards because you've got the exact same
number of cases but a lot less guidance
now you could be misguided that would be
the only downside in other words if
they're going someplace that's actually
in the wrong part of the space which is
possible then but hopefully you would
learn that here by what the cases the
issue
right absolutely but they're all the
hardest cases so that's what really
comes down the line right yeah so almost
all of the hardest cancer cases end up
at a tumor board of the equivalent of a
tumor board the easy cases are easy
right so basically this is if nothing
else a way of throwing away the data you
don't care about you don't to look at
every bit of the EHR you don't want to
look at everybody's records because
that's dealt with essentially now I
agree with you it's not you're not going
to solve the problem entirely but it's
an additional source of data our source
of hints source of guidance essentially
so the second approach here is a company
that actually I co-founded called
kelabra sand what it did was essentially
used experts to build an expert system
and I'll just show you what it does so
the experts built a model just like the
mmm P folks built a model but the model
here again was into this sort of was
more explicit they both had a molecular
model and they just had a model in the
sense of set of hypotheses set of
clusters Karen phenotypes enid
functional phenotypes and there was a
tool and you could put in your stuff and
it would give you guidance now I'm gonna
go I'm the reason I'm going through this
is that I'm gonna go back to a picture
one thing is we these models were open
there was actually even an API to them
so you could actually go in to the
models and pulse actually you still can
as far as I know and published so peer
reviewed at at least an instant in time
right how a model gets peer reviewed in
general but the interesting thing was
our approach our answer to Watson was
this thing we called Norman and what
Norman did so notice this guy's face
this is Robbie Sal Jia he's one of the
top lung cancer guys in the world he was
willing to put his face on this effort
alright now the in effort no money okay
now the interesting figure about that is
they're not just him there's actually a
bunch of thought leading lung cancer
guys that girls yeah in this particular
set of people so what we were doing
initially was taking advantage of this
virtual tumor board if you will okay but
we wanted to do that in a semi-automated
way so in that's where our version of
Watson which we
Norman came through so what happened is
so any old time Star Trek folks will
recognize this if you don't look it up
Norman was the coordinator all right
so what happens here is we would pull
down the usual suspects from databases
all right and pull the data of what was
actually happening the apps which are
the actual instances you're seeing right
so those are the cases walking in the
door and Norman would essentially look
in there and look at our models and his
job was to update the models but the way
it worked was not automatic all right
what it would do is it would create a
case write it out using a template that
said you know a patient presented with
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla depending on
what Norman's sort of hypothesis for
updatable and send it to these guys all
right now
there was actually a human intervention
in the email part of it but basically
the idea is that you would write a case
out I'd give it to a doctor and say what
would you do in this particular case and
we would give ranking hypotheses and
they'd say you know yeah that's fine or
no that's not good because such-and-such
so the idea was to wrap in the experts
into the process we weren't just reading
the database we weren't just reading the
the knowledge data and knowledge bases
we were also winding the updating
process through the experts you might
argue partly because we didn't have the
technology to do it automatically I
don't think the technology can exist to
do it automatically at this point in
time if for no other reason then
dimensionality arguments finally and
this gets to your point about military
quite directly but I'll talk about this
thing called the bate actually isn't
that there's a another finally there's
just one slide so you remember you've
got this nexus of experts and they're
not always in the same room so how can
temporarily in spatial spatially virtual
MTBs
keep track of what's going on there's an
approach that the intelligence community
uses called ACH which is analysis of
competing hypotheses and this is taught
to intelligence analysts as the way to
analyze political intelligence right
what they do basically is they have you
know some set of hypotheses some set of
evidence they make a matrix and they're
trained to fill in everybody to feel in
every cell in this
as to whether the evidence is concordant
with the hypothesis disk or dinner
neutral suspected hypothesis that's just
the intelligence technology right you
can do the obvious thing it's just a
spreadsheet essentially so you might say
well what if you have a bunch of
different people doing this or different
teams at different times in place so one
approach which I call the the Google
wave of collaborative decision-making is
you have everybody pile on the same
matrix so essentially you take however
many analysts there are you build a huge
matrix which has this you know has like
hundreds of different hypotheses this is
usually like bomb Iraq don't bomb Iraq
so I like it that at the at the top
level it's these gross hypotheses every
piece of information you have and there
are like 10 analysts trying to make
consensus out of this right this is like
a terrible idea but I think it's
actually being used
that's very collaborative intelligent
alysus so another idea which arose from
an art project was this thing called a
Bayesian community the ACH idea is very
powerful because it's think of it as
these matrices are mind sized as long as
they don't get out of control one
analyst has one matrix or maybe a small
group of analysts has one matrix there
really will kind of work in their
problem think of one tumor board working
on one patient right or one science
scientific group working on one you know
one drug they would work on their
problem and the trick is how do you get
them to interact without knowing they're
interacting in some organized way and so
what you do is you give them each their
own ACH matrix you don't make them all
pile into the same matrix and then you
wire them together in the background
essentially the output wires from one
become the input wires to the next where
relevant right so for example of these
votes so this is a tumor board this is
some set of microarray analyses about
some particular drugs impact on a gene
all right and I'm totally making up this
example and this is a Senate person it's
the same picture in all of these and
this is something about personal
personal biomarker observations and so
to the extent that these guys need this
information they'll draw it from
something which has evidence sitting
under it the evidence sitting under it
is being worked on by a team just
working on that
problem right if these guys update their
results it'll bubble through the network
hopefully it's a dag if not I'm sure it
can be dealt with and you could change
basically the ranking of treatments on
the end right so this was an idea it was
implemented we can't tell whether the
intelligence community ever used it
because they of course wouldn't tell us
but essentially the idea is - it draws
on this idea that the ACH matrices are
mind size and that works very well for
the intelligence community and so you
can imagine a group team is at different
levels of science working on the problem
at the end you're trying to treat a
patient but all this data is coming in
the bottom all the way down to you know
sensors if you like there's a lot more
to say about that I won't go - so the
last thing just very briefly is decided
Global cumulative treatment analysis as
I implied there it's not just one tumor
board right and to your point you know
how many tumor boards are there there
aren't a huge number but there's enough
that it's not one and so what you want
to do is since you've got multiple tumor
boards you don't want them all doing the
same either smart or stupid thing in
parallel you basically don't want this
top right there's a trivially
parallelizable system which it now is
doing right because the only way to
connect them if you don't have the base
community model is through the
literature which is incredibly slow
right so there's no high throughput you
know there's no Hadoop communication
system or a connection machine
communication system would be a better
model so essentially it's it's hundreds
of these tumor boards operating all
seeing similar patients so the idea of
global cumulative treatment analysis is
that you in the normal case the green is
just the normal case basically someone
shows up you have a treatment hypothesis
if there's a if there's a best choice
then they do it if there's no best
choice if there's no acceptable choices
at all then you basically have to do
science all right but if there are if
there's equipoise if you don't have
statistical strength enough to make a
choice essentially what you do is you do
you do basically equivalent under
exploration
flotation tradeoff you say from
reinforcement learning you say okay
what's the best choice to be given to
this patient for learning purposes but
you have to be watching the entire
community in order to do this properly
now you might say this is nuts right
you'd need a giant connected computer
system watching all of the different
patients coming in all over the world to
do this right did anyone think this is
not just as nuts yeah but remember you
have very few patients yes you would
exploit it less efficiently but let's
say you wanted to well I don't know but
somebody apparently thinks that this is
a good idea because there is a giant
connected computer system called the VA
all right and the VA actually does this
so the VA this is called a point of care
trial and the what they do is a patient
comes in and if the patient they get
given you know choice a be a patient and
doctor get given choice you know a or B
if they have a preference the preference
gets given if they don't have a
preference the preference doesn't get
given if they they don't have a
preference normally it would be given
randomly okay but what happens in the VA
system is the computer chooses all right
and then there's a whole theory I have a
paper on this if you want to see the
theoretical reasons for it and and
you're right it's in many circumstances
it would be good enough to give randomly
but if you have a very limited pool to
choose from and the dynamics are such
then you really want to take advantage
of yeah exactly right I mean in cancer
it's that's the situation you've got
relative the dimensionality problem the
n is to your point very very small so
you don't want to replicate experiments
if you don't have to exactly right well
fair enough um so anyway this is called
global cubed of cubanelles to say
horrible picture I don't know I did have
a depict where you what you want to do
here but basically you want to somehow
have these guys interacting over making
choices in a sensible way right and then
recording in more or less real-time the
relationships between the choices and
getting them to do different things to
search the space
one is you just pick a random treatment
two is you send to molecular tumor word
they make a decision
oh no so the order is the other way
around so what if I understand what
you're asking which I may not quite so
what happens is the molecular tumor
board will often try and find a trial
for the patient once the patient goes
into a trial then it's chosen randomly
in the trial usually okay if it's an
adaptive trial which is essentially what
the point-of-care trial is but that's a
local adaptive trial then what happens
is there's some you know calculation
done about which arm to put the patient
in okay and there's lots of money
basically if you're really interested if
you're interested in statistics of
science the coolest place to look right
now is an adaptive clinical trials
because the you know really smart people
are trying to figure out exactly how to
use this information in the most bored
way and tools for they have plenty of
tools themselves but basically they're
their sensei runs simulations all the
time so I think I think the order is the
other way around
so this global cumulative treatment
analysis is trying to envision what
would happen if you could coordinate
over the tumor boards and have the tumor
verbs also inter coordinated through
something like a base community all
right so we're trying to do all of that
stuff simultaneously and there you have
it questions comments other than once
you've made thank you for your attention
the basic message is don't get cancer
yes exactly that I think they all agree
on that I think they all agree on that
one right know really from a from a
statistical standpoint it's a horribly
difficult problem in fact essentially
intractable so we're picking it the bits
and pieces of information we can get and
we don't want to lose information and we
don't want to waste subjects essentially
and so you know it's not clear random
would be by the way to your point about
random you're right that it would be
close if they went random but and
they're not even doing random what
they're doing is channelizing so what
happens is they all read the last public
report and they all do
a right so that's the worst possible
version of it right that you really want
to avoid okay
the trial system which I was describing
to you does randomize in the trivial way
the adaptive ones randomize in a
slightly smarter way the vision of it is
to do a grand version of the VA
point-of-care trial where you're
actually random the computer is taking
advantage of what's going on that's very
complicated because the the dynamics of
cancer are so horrible that cancer
generals horrible but the dynamics of a
report in the sense that you don't get
real outcomes data for a long time
even if you're looking at local result
local results like a tumor load so what
will often happen is not often but there
are cases where suppose you're treated
here x 0 and then so you have two
different treatments and one of the
treatments seems to be doing much better
than the other treatment well if you
start taking the data away from the sort
of the other way if you'd start trying
taking the patients away from the one
that's doing poorly and giving the one
that's doing well you're taking away the
statistical power of this set of
observations so there are cases where
they cross over again but you won't see
it because you've taken all the
statistical data a physical power away
from this case so the whole adaptive
trial thing is very very interesting and
complicated and fraught with ethical
problems yes absolutely right so well so
Phil it's either so the primary paper is
by C or e dot loved Horry
Orlov or e dot that dot Fiore I think
it's and once it's like Phil love Orion
Lu Fiore or it's Phil Fiore and lulav or
E anyway the point is if you look up
Furion Liguori and laborious furious at
Stanford in public health and we've been
talking to him about how to do this
global thing he designed the study right
that particular thing but there are
folks designing adaptive trials you know
there are many adaptive trials
designed lots of interesting work in
designing trials that take as much
advantage of the information as possible
so it's really a I call it I think in
the talk at DARPA I called it robot
science for real you know people talk
about a robot in a laboratory running
science well this is you know you want
to basically run the entire medical
community as though you had control over
it and we're actually making decisions
in a sensible way with respect to the
statistics that's very hard to do the VA
can do it right because they have a
giant connected computer system and they
control all decisions right to the
extent they can I mean patients really
control all decisions they also have
access to all the data right go ahead
what what why did why did he die control
this treatment why do you choose to
devote all the statistics um
well but that's the way trials work now
right and that I'm sure has happened all
the time but that's an ethical issue
that trials have faced forever and so I
don't think this is any worse than that
all right anyway we're questions thank
