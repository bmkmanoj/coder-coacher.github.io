what you're going to be hearing about
from the panel that you have in front of
you is actually something we've been
working on for about a year the nature
of what's being announced at this event
so this is our launch event is a
competition the president has launched
the climate data initiative to leverage
the government and in this case the
USDA's massive amounts of data to
stimulate innovation and to provide a
private sector entrepreneurship so today
we are launching the Innovation
Challenge with Microsoft and so for the
first time we're going to be able to put
all of this data in the cloud so that he
will be able to gain access from it for
queries that you might want to have
about USDA data national agricultural
statistics service collects hundreds of
surveys annually to the farming
community we also have geospatial data
that particular data set is called crops
cape it's an annual land cover data set
that basically over the last seven years
we have mapped every land unit in this
country from an agriculturist
perspective and the last piece I wanted
to mention was of the bed scape this is
a vegetative condition database so it's
basically its satellites doing scanning
across our country and giving us
indications of what is the vegetative
health over the entire growing season
we've now hosted this in our quick stats
database which is open and accessible to
everybody when we think about the
challenge our expectation is that people
will bring other data maybe data that
they've collected themselves or we don't
want people to be limited just by the
four datasets that we're making
available there's those are just a
starting point someone be creative and
come up with what are the areas in this
country are going to be suffering we
need to intensify AG production to meet
the world's growing population needs how
do we do that sustainably from an
environmental perspective but also from
a farm economic perspective personally
love to see things that allow individual
farmers able to make more nuanced
decisions about you know maybe crop
switching or allocation of
different crops and you know those of
those are the sorts of analyses are
completely possible with the data sets
that we have available the rough way of
saying is it's the most innovative use
of the usda data
