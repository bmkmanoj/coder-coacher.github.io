hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
alright let's get started I'm Phil fossa
from our p.m. team here in Microsoft
Research I had the pleasure of reading
warren burgers book this weekend on a
digital version found it super
interesting I don't know if any of you
have taken this precision questioning
course here at Microsoft most of us have
had some exposure to that and I asked
one what the difference was between the
PQ course and he said that you is more
oriented towards person the person
questioning or something like an
attorney or those HR person those kinds
of contexts where this one is more self
focused which I think it's allows us to
do a great amount of innovation and
great a lot of new kinds of thinking and
some of the questions I'm sure we ask
ourselves why should we really answer
that or where we get the truest
innovations so Warren's background and
writing researcher questing innovation
has peered in Fast Company it's also
appeared in Harvard Business Review and
wired he's the author of an acclaimed
book called glimmer and he this was
named the business book of the year best
innovation design books of the year and
a burghers appeared on today CNN NPR off
and all things considered which is a
pretty darn good resume and please join
me with a warm welcome for a reward
worker thank you
Thanks it's good to be here
so my book is about questioning so I'll
start with a question which seems
appropriate so we all know about the app
that sold for 19 billion dollars right
what's that
mobile messaging app and it's a good app
right I mean it serves a good purpose
but what if you had an app that could
help you whenever you had a situation
where you didn't know what to do you had
a problem that arises a new challenge
and your work or your life any kind of
change where you don't quite know what
to deal with right what if you had an
app that could help you start to deal
with that situation and figure out
basically what you need to do next I
mean that would be a pretty powerful app
I think of it as maybe a hundred billion
dollar app because if if mobile
messaging is 19 billion this is got to
be worth at least a hundred so an app
that helps you figure out what to do
next is basically something we'd all
want and the good thing is we all have
it because we were all born with this
app which is basically our natural human
aptitude for questioning and for asking
questions and as I think we take for
granted you know it's like kind of like
breathing right we all have always asked
questions and we continue to ask
questions but when you study questioning
what you discover is that it's actually
a pretty interesting mental process and
it's pretty complex and a lot of us
probably are using it to a partial
extent of what we could really do if we
were really using questioning well so I
studied it a little bit with there's a
group called the right question
Institute that studies questioning and
they shared with me this this definition
here which I liked a lot questioning is
the ability to organize our thinking
around what we don't know that's a
pretty powerful tool when you think
about it so you've got a situation where
you don't know what to do next you've
got a problem you've got a challenge got
something in front of you
what questioning does is figure out how
to attack it from all kinds of different
angles with why and what if and how
questions and kind of start to figure
out how to deal with this situation
trying to get your brain around it and
your your your understanding around it
so it's it's very powerful and I will
talk a little bit today about why I
think I make the case in the book that
maybe we're not using questioning as
much as we should in our lives and in
our work I'll talk a little bit about
why I think that's the case and then
I'll talk a little bit about how we can
approach questioning differently and
perhaps get better at it but first I
want to just start with a story that is
about how I it's one of the first
stories that got me sort of appreciating
the power of questioning as I was doing
my research and eventually I came across
a lot of other stories that reinforced
it but this is one of the first ones and
it involved at the time I was writing a
design book so I was looking for all
kinds of cool designed objects and
beautifully engineered beautifully
designed objects and I came upon this a
prosthetic limb that had been designed
by a guy named van Phillips and was
being was changing the way people used
prosthetics was enabling them to run and
jump and do things that a person could
never do before with a prosthetic limb
and I was I'm being somewhat of a
questioning person myself you know the
first one of the first things I wondered
is who would create something like this
who would dream up something like this
it's interesting so I did some research
on on Van Philips and I got in touch
with him and and I learned his story and
it's really interesting story so van
Philips when he was 21 years old he's
living a great life he's in college he's
a broadcast major good-looking guy
planning to go and be a news anchor when
he gets out of college and he's an
lead and he's runner and a water skier
and so he's waterskiing one day I think
this is maybe his junior year of college
he's waterskiing one day and he's being
pulled by the bonehead of him they're
going around a blind curve in the lake
and they don't see that there's another
motorboat coming very fast the other way
and there's some confusion that happens
and Van Phillips gets hit by the other
motorboat and he wakes up in a hospital
the next day and Peaks under his sheet
as he said to me you know I was
expecting to see my foot and what I saw
was an empty space and this was the
beginning of a big change in his life
obviously and so he goes to rehab in the
hospital and when he's leaving the
hospital
he's been fitted with a prosthetic foot
which at the time was a pretty standard
prosthetic foot as he described it to me
it was like a block of wood that had
some fold and was colored to look like
flesh color and it was completely
unresponsive to anything he wanted to do
he said the first time he tried to walk
on it he tripped immediately and became
very frustrated and said you know I'm an
athlete there's no way I can live the
rest of my life with this this limb so
at that point he starts to question what
currently exists and to me this is a an
important stage that a lot of people who
are innovators and questioners go
through which is and I think of it as
the it's it's the wise stage of of
questioning okay at some point they will
move to what if and eventually they may
get to how and I think of this as sort
of the the Holy Trinity of questioning
these three questions they often work
very well together
so in Van Phillips case the Y part was
just him asking you know with all the
technology in the world at the time this
is the height of the space program with
all the amazing engineering with all the
great materials why
am I stuck with this limb that looks
like it was made 100 years ago and so he
starts to research that why question he
figures out that well you know the
prosthetics industry at that time didn't
attract a lot of big dollars from you
know major technology companies and no
one really thought there was a great
market there so it was kind of an
ignored marketplace and so then van
Phillips says well you know I'm gonna
look into this myself and he he enrolls
in an engineering course prosthetics
engineering course one of the top ones
in the country starts working on his
what-if questions which are you know
what if we were to try different
materials on a prosthetic foot what if
we were to change the design what if we
were to borrow ideas from other areas of
technology how might we begin to apply
that so he's working now on his first
versions of first prototypes and now he
gets into the really hard part which is
the house stage and he has to figure out
how is he gonna make this work and you
know very very difficult very difficult
stage for him and for a lot of
innovators and a lot of creators it's
the how part is the hard part I mean
you've got you've questioned what exists
already you've questioned what might be
through ideation through your own
imagination but making it work is when
you start to get into some serious
prototyping and failing and trying
things that don't work in his case he
would create prototypes of a prosthetic
limb that he was using he was using a
material called carbon graphite which
wasn't being used at the time and on
prosthetic limbs and he would create a
prototype he did all this in his home
incredibly and the only thing he could
do the only way he could test the
prototype was to put it on and try to
walk on it or run on it and what would
happen then is it would break under him
would miss malfunction and he would end
up falling and it's a real real problem
I said to him when I talk to about this
I said didn't you get frustrated you
know when you would you know try to
create a limit and you'd end up falling
on the ground and he said no he said
because every time the prototype broke I
learned something so I'd say oh okay
you'd see that it broke a certain way
and it's a-okay
now I know a little more than I knew
yesterday so he eventually gets through
this incredible process and he creates a
serious there's Ben Phillips running on
the cheetah flex foot cheetah prosthetic
limb which was really quite
revolutionary he's still he's he's gone
through several versions and iterations
of this and it keeps getting better and
he this is one of the latest versions
he's working on like I said I can get
this to play you'll see him actually
testing it out so that's van guys almost
60 years old by the way I love that
device because it looks like an upside
down question mark so it really works
with my book and my story but he has
created what what's going on there's
tremendous compression force spring
force dynamics going on within that that
foot that he's created so it basically
explodes every time he runs on it it
just pushes him forward and it's really
an amazing amazing device
Oscar Pistorius used it in the in the
Olympics then of course things went bad
for Oscar Pistorius but we won't talk
about that so but anyway the then he
used it was really interesting when he
was developing that some of the what-if
questions he was asking were fascinating
and he shared some of them with me and
he wondered one of things he wondered
was what if you could have a prosthetic
limb that had some of the same
tendencies as a Cheetahs hind leg which
has which compresses every time the
cheetah jumps in a way that releases
tremendous energy the tendons in a
cheetahs leg are just compressed and
then explode
he wanted to recreate that in a in a
prosthetic foot and he did so he just
basically went through this you know
this kind of why what if how cycle of
questioning and I later found as I as I
studied other innovators that this is
actually a pretty common progression of
questioning it actually it parallels
with I don't how many people are
familiar with Design Thinking but it
parallels with the stages of Design
Thinking it parallels with stages of
creative classic theories of creative
problem-solving that have been around
for 50 years or a hundred years which is
basically when you have a problem you
have to kind of you have to kind of
first get your brain around the problem
that's kind of the why part what is the
problem why does it exist why hasn't
anybody solved it already and then you
move to the part where you begin to use
your imagination and then eventually you
get into prototyping and practicalities
how do you make it work how do you do it
you you you so you sort of understand
and then you imagine and then you create
and pretty interesting formula not a
formula I would say it's just a
progression that shows up a lot in
questioning and it's an interesting
thing to keep in your back pocket think
about because it can be it can be good
to refer back to when you're tackling a
problem but it starts with Y it starts
with that Y at the top and you have to
kind of be inclined to ask Y questions
that maybe other people aren't asking
and when I was researching the book I
thought about this I thought about you
know why why don't we ask why you know
why why is it that a lot of us kind of
maybe don't use this power of of
questioning as much as we might and it's
that that took me into issues of
Education which are pretty interesting
you know because the truth is we do
start out asking why a lot you know
everyone knows about kids and asking why
it's it's a very common phenomenon we
most of us have observed at some point I
actually had a researcher who studied
this and said that how the kids asked
40,000 questions between ages two and
five about 10,000 questions a year
that's my niece Bridget there
through the various stages of
questioning and I don't know if she
actually asked 40,000 but she was in the
ballpark I would say it's definitely a
big questioner the peak this is
interesting the peak questioning is
around four and it's girls more than
boys a recent study found that a British
girl at age four asks her mum 390
questions a day and she doesn't ask the
father as many because when she does he
says go ask your mum but it's it's a
that's the peak time and of course this
sometimes drives parents a little bit
crazy this has been observed by one of
the great philosophers of our time and
I'm talking about louis c.k who has
pointed out that kids it seems like they
just keep asking why and there's no
there's no end to it and there's no no
rhyme or reason to it and you know louis
c.k does a great bit I'll just read you
guys have probably heard it but I'll
just read a couple lunch meant because
it's really funny so so he's talking to
his four-year-old daughter or
five-year-old daughter and she's saying
why can't we go outside papa
and he goes well it's raining why well
water's coming out of the sky why
because it was in a cloud why
well clouds formed when there's vapor
why I don't know I don't know any more
things those are all the things I know
why because I'm stupid
okay I'm stupid why because I didn't pay
attention in school why because I was
high all the time I smoked too much pot
so it just goes on from there and it
ends up with it devolves to the point
where he's saying to his four-year-old
daughter because we're alone in the
universe and no one gives a about
us but that it makes it it makes
interesting point you know questioning
by kids can drive adults crazy because
and one of the reasons why which he
reveals very in a very interesting way
in that comedy bit it's a very deep
comedy bit but one of the things kids
are doing is they're revealing what you
don't
No as an adult they're asking you
questions and you're understanding gee
there's a lot of stuff I don't know I
can't answer any of these questions so
so parents get a little bit you know
sometimes frustrated but the real
problem seems to happen when kids go to
school and there's a there's basically a
questioning decline that I I compare it
to dropping off a cliff if you look at
that to the extent this has been
measured you see kids question and go
from you know hundreds of questions a
day to by the time they're in junior
high or high school it's like zero so
there's this really steep drop and
there's a lot of reasons for that some
of it have to probably have to do with
brain development and all kinds of
things but it's pretty clear that the
current education system is not really
encouraging it's not encouraging
questioning by kids it's not really set
up for that I mean even though you know
you may think well I see kids raising
their hands in class
well yeah but they're not asking
questions they're answering the teachers
questions in in the typical classroom
the teacher is the one who formulates
the questions the kids are trained to
answer them it's a it's not to say that
that's a bad way to teach but it was
designed in a different time when we
were trying to train people to just
memorize useful bits of information and
easy tasks and then to become productive
workers in factories let's say and we're
kind of in a different world right now
where we really need to do more than
just train people to memorize
information and give it back to you so
we really probably should be thinking
about how we can shift the education
model and people are doing this people
are working on this but shift the
education model so at least a little bit
of time is spent with kids trying to
formulate their own questions instead of
answering other people's questions
there's a great quote I came across from
Neil postman who's a social critic who
said that children enter school as
question marks and they leave as periods
so this is an issue that is a big in the
education world but then you know it's
also continues in the workplace you know
because it basically this is a lot an
issue for a lot of people in the
workplace can they ask questions do they
have permission to ask questions if they
do ask questions what happens is their
supervisors are going to be things that
they're a pain in the neck or here's
that here's a great one a lot of times
you ask a question in a workplace or a
company environment and what you hear
back from the boss is I don't want
people bringing me questions I want
people bringing the answers I want
solutions I don't want more questions
and which is a really bad thing to say
to your employees because what you're
saying is not only do I want you to
identify problems and opportunities but
I want you to figure the whole thing out
before you ever come to me I want you to
have the complete answer and then bring
that to me and of course that's not very
realistic you know we may be talking
about very complex problems that involve
the whole company should be working on
so there's an issue and I think
companies are coming to terms with it we
know that you know a lot of in the
startup culture there's a there's a
great appreciation of questioning and I
think larger companies are starting to
recognize the importance of this that
there's a real value in creating what I
refer to in the book as a culture of
inquiry which is just a corporate
culture where people feel very
comfortable asking questions and where
they feel that questions are valued
almost as much as answers because the
questions have the potential to do a lot
of things I noticed the other day an
interview with an executive by the name
of Satya Nadella
who just has taken over at Microsoft and
he was talking about this kind of thing
I mean he was saying you know Microsoft
has operated as if we had the formula
figured out and it was all about
optimizing so what he's saying there is
that he's concerned about people
operating as if the the answers are
known already and we just have
to figure out how to maximize and what I
think he's saying is that the questions
are really important within this culture
and he also says at one point how do we
take the intellectual capital of a
hundred and thirty thousand people and
innovate and he says one of the things
that drives me crazy is when people say
this is how we do it this is how we do
things here so I think this is a common
issue in in corporate America the idea
that we're in an innovation Society and
innovation business culture we know that
companies have to be innovating and
changing all the time so if we're going
to tap into the brain resources of our
company and the ability to ask great
questions that exist through the whole
company how do we do that how do we
create an environment where people are
going to come to work and they're going
to ask questions
instead of going through kind of the
routine I don't know the answer to it I
mean I'm working on it it's one of the
things I address in my book some of the
ways that I think companies can do it
but I'm just really at the beginnings of
the research on that and I plan to
really pursue that that question of how
companies create a culture of inquiry
but we do know it's important and we do
know that I mean this is not news about
the value of questioning and the
importance of questioning and the
connection of questioning to innovation
I mean Einstein was telling us this
decades ago he in stein said that he
spent ten times as much time on the
question as he did on the answer because
the question was the key if you get the
question right it's going to lead you in
the right direction so I think Einstein
would agree with the premise of my book
and what's going on now in fact is even
more extreme than what Einstein was
alive because of the nature of change
the fact that we're in this changing
dynamic changing world technology is
changing things so quickly that we now
have this situation going on which is
the questions are rising in value while
answers are declining the reason being
that as as you get into a world of just
dynamic change of exponential change
what happens is the answers become so
quickly obvious
they become so quickly incomplete and
they need to be adapted and changed
constantly and questions are the ways
that you do that the questions are the
ways that you update your answers and
expand upon them and figure out what
doesn't work anymore and what has to
work now I also you know when I was
doing the book it was interesting to
what I one of the things I did was I
traced back a lot of innovations I went
I looked at a lot of breakthroughs and I
went worked backwards from the
breakthrough to the origin and it's
amazing how many times when you go all
the way back to the origin you're at a
question you arrive at a question that
somebody was working on somebody
formulated somebody came up with that
question and that started the whole
thing that eventually led to the
breakthrough that one of the more famous
ones is you guys may have heard this one
but this is a question why do we have to
wait for the picture does anybody know
what that led to
or can you guess maybe yeah pull all
right so this was a question that was
the Polaroid instant camera so this is a
question that was asked by the
three-year-old daughter of Edwin land
and he was in brilliant scientist
engineer and he was not working on
cameras at the time he was working on
now believe he was working on polarized
headlights for cars and he was having a
lot of trouble because the car companies
didn't want to deal with him they had no
interest in what he was doing his
company was kind of struggling and he
goes on vacation with his family and his
three-year-old daughter and he takes a
picture with a standard camera at the
time this is 1940s early 40s I believe
takes a picture and says okay now we got
to send it out and we'll be able to see
the results and you know a week or
whatever and so the little girl says why
why do we have to wait why can't we just
look at it now and so that question
stays with Edwin land and he eventually
says he starts to ask why right he says
yeah come to think of it why why do we
have to wait you know is there
another possibility what if so now he
moves to the what-if stage right what if
we were to instead of taking the film
and sending it to a dark room what if we
had the dark room somehow inside the
camera so then he has to figure out how
and that's the hard part how do you get
a dark room inside a camera not easy but
anyway that led to the Polaroid instant
camera and you know this question here
this is the question led to the
cellphone Martin Cooper wondered this
question this question led to Netflix
Reed Hastings getting hit with huge late
fees by blockbuster when he returned
some videos late and he says why you
know why is this this is not a good
system you know people are getting hit
with these late fees all the time this
doesn't make sense
and he moves to the what-if stage the
what-if stage in his case was well what
if we could design a video rental system
that was more like a health club where
you have like a monthly membership why
don't we put those two ideas together
and then he was on his way all he had to
do was then get to the how part how do I
create a company like that it's pretty
hard this is one of my favorite ones now
this may not seem like a beautiful
question when you first see it but it
had a huge impact so what was going on
here was it's a football coach back in
the 1960s at the University of Florida
and he notices that the players his
football players are drinking a lot of
water on the sidelines but they don't
seem to have to go to the bathroom that
much so he's wondering why you know
what's going on here why is it the
drinking all this water and yet they
don't seem to have to go to the bathroom
so he shares the question with a science
professor at the University the science
professor says oh well I I I can explain
that to you you know they the water is
not replacing the the fluids the
electrolytes in their body you're not
getting replaced by water the water
doesn't have enough of the ingredients
to do that and so even though their
drinking water they're just sweating it
all away and then and that's why they
don't have to urinate so that might have
been the end of it but then the
sir took up that question he got
interested in the question and he kind
of took it from why to what if right so
his thing was okay well you know why
this is going on but what if we what if
we could come up with a drink or a
solution that was able to replenish
those fluids better than water does and
so he goes to work on it he goes in the
lab the University lab starts mixing
things up mixing up beakers and he comes
up with a drink concoction and he hands
it to the coach and the coach says I'm
not going to drink that and but we'll
try it on the players and then he says
wait a minute no actually we won't try
it on the starters we'll try it on the
practice squad and so as the legend has
it the practice squad actually
outperformed the starters that day
because they were better hydrated and
the result was they went ahead and
developed this drink at the University
of Florida it was called Gatorade and
Gatorade is now part of a twenty billion
dollar sports drink industry that came
out of that question so it's really
interesting when you trace back these
the power of a question of asking the
right question and the question that no
one else has thought of but is out there
waiting to be asked you see it in
products like nest you know this is Tony
Fadell a questioner he's been a question
of his whole life he's oh he said that
he said that he's always looked at
objects like his radio when he was
growing up and said well why does it
work the way it does and what if it
would what if you did it a little
differently and one of you so he did
this with the the household thermostat
you know he looked at it he looked at
this thing that everybody takes for
granted everybody has one no one paid
any attention to it he looked at it and
said you know here we are in this age of
technology and smart phones and smart
everything and we have dumb thermostats
they don't they don't do anything they
just kind of sit there so he eventually
reinvents it but the idea is he had to
ask those questions first he had to ask
why and the same is true with jack
dorsey up square you know jack dorsey
this came out of a question that a lot
of great questions come out of life
experience you see something you're
observant you notice that something
doesn't make sense it doesn't work and
you ask why
so in Jack Dorsey's case a friend of his
was a was an artist and was trying to
sell a work of art and had a big deal
almost ready to go through and then the
buyers of the art said here's our credit
card and the artist said wait I I'm not
a company I I can't take your credit
card and they lost the sale and so Jack
Dorsey then asks the question why is it
that only companies can accept credit
cards you know we have so many people
out there doing business on their own
and why can't they accept credit cards
and that eventually leads to the square
which which can be used in you know
anybody's tablet or iPhone so you know I
wrote about this recently in the Harvard
Business Review the idea that
opportunity is often right in front of
people but they can't see it and it's
because of the way they're looking in it
and I think what Jack Dorsey does and
what Tony Fadell does I think of it as
as a stepping back process right so they
look but they step back also they think
about it they see it they think about it
and they ask why and to me that's one of
the first things elements of great
questioners another thing they do which
I also said in this article is that they
released their inner George Carlin and
what I mean by that is you know if you
know George Carlin's work you know he
was one of the he was one of the
pioneers of a certain kind of comedy
that was observational and observational
of the smallest details right though the
smallest human details of what thing
what people do you know George Carlin
would watch little things right so he
said George Carlin would say like like
you know when you you lose your keys
right and and there's a certain place
you always put your keys right and you
lose your keys and you look there in
that place and then you'll go around
you'll check your pocket and then you'll
look again and then you'll go around
there and then you'll go back and look
again
and so so George Carlin was saying you
know why do people do that I mean
doesn't make any sense that they think
the keys are going to suddenly appear 10
seconds later but just by observing that
kind of human behavior he came up with
amazing observations and what I what I
am saying is that that kind of skill
also applies in the world of business
innovation it applies everywhere because
if you can make those kind of
observations about inconsistencies
things that don't add up things that
don't make sense things that are missing
if you can if you can see that and you
can question it you've got the first
step I think that this is the only multi
bullet slide I'll inflict on you but I
think there's a half a dozen things to
keep in mind about being a good
questioner okay one is seeing what's
there and what isn't so you not only see
the thing in front of you but you see
that what it could be what it should be
and you ask why isn't it that way and
that's what great questioners do great
question has also asked the stupid
question so they are not afraid to ask
the question that seems really
fundamental and it seems really basic
and a lot of times like Van Phillips
when he asked his questions he was
ridiculed basically by the prosthetics
industry you know when he said why can't
why can't a prosthetic foot allow you to
jump and run like an athlete
I mean basically people laughed at him
you know because it was ridiculous it
was a ridiculous question at the time so
the questioners are willing to ask the
stupid question they're willing to dig
deep and keep asking why you know the
five why's you know which goes back to
the louis c.k thing and the little girl
who keeps asking why you know when you
do that in an innovation context the
five whys can be actually very very
useful you know you sort of get to the
root cause of things you know why is
this a problem you work your way
backwards and you get to the real cause
of why it's a problem or why it's an
issue Toyota obviously Toyota introduced
the five wise decades ago and it was a
hugely valuable thing on the production
lines of Toyota because it would help
them to figure out why did this part why
was this part defective well you know it
came off the line defective why well the
worker did this and
didn't you didn't do part why well
because he didn't get trained on how to
use that particular part why well
because we cut that training program a
year ago why well because we were trying
to save money we're trying to hit our
numbers and we thought that hitting the
numbers is more important than the
safety of the cars so you kind of get to
the you get to the real the real issue
behind the issue another thing that good
question is do they imagine what if I
talked about this already you know you
they go from Y to what if and another
thing they do is they live with the
question so we kind of live in a culture
right right now in a world where we
expect instant answers to our questions
and we think that searches search
engines and whatever you're using Google
or using Bing or whatever you know we
can just basically punch in whatever
question we have and get an answer like
that and the really difficult questions
the ones like all the ones that we've
been talking about today you know
they're those people are living with
those questions for a long long time and
they're they're iterating through the
question that the question is changing
its evolving as they're working on it so
it's not like a instant answer you've
got to spend time with these questions
and then you have to move at some point
from asking to action and that's where I
go back to my own little progression of
why what if and how at some point you've
got to get to how how questions because
otherwise you know questioning without
action to me it's just it's philosophy
and that's okay not there's anything
wrong with philosophy but if you want to
get results out of your questioning
you've got to figure out how you get
from why - what if - how and how is
prototyping how is testing experimenting
trying things out seeing what works the
other day was Einstein's birthday and so
Einstein again I'll come back to him he
said the important thing is not to stop
questioning he also said never lose a
holy curiosity I'm Stan was like the
champion all-time champion of
questioning
so for Einsteins birthday I was thinking
about
some of the people I admire are some of
the people who are great questioners
today and it's not just innovators you
know it's people in the arts it's it's
people in entertainment so I decided you
know I'm gonna I'm gonna do a fun thing
with them what happens when people or
the people out there who are releasing
their inner Einstein you know and and
since it's a you know we live in a
BuzzFeed world I decided to do this with
some celebrities so this guy's
interesting I don't know if you can
identify who that is that's Benedict
Cumberbatch
so Benedict Cumberbatch is a guy who is
you know he's an actor but he's asking
questions about government politics he's
a really engaged interesting guy who's
out there questioning everything anyone
know who that is it's Laura Linney so
Laura Linney this is a great example of
how actors use questioning after taking
a part I read the script and asked why I
asked why until there's no more wanting
to ask every detail she's questioning
so it's interesting you know the same
kind of questioning techniques that
apply to invention and innovation apply
to art apply to perform as they apply to
so many things they apply to music
that's Kanye West releasing his inner
Einstein this is a guy who questions not
only music but then he goes into other
fields where he is a beginners where he
brings a beginner's mind and he's
questioning those fields which i think
is pretty great anybody know who that is
he's in my book that is Matt Damon
releasing his inner Einstein and Matt
Damon
you know he's involved in this water.org
cause I was just trying to bring water
to people who need clean drinking water
around the world he's working with a guy
named Gary white and everything they do
is is through questioning I mean it's
they start with what is the problem what
why aren't people getting the water
right now and it's amazing what the
reasons you find out I mean it's not
always the obvious thing you think you
know they discovered that political
corruption plays a huge role
because what will happen is someone will
come in and build a well system or a
water system but then somehow people get
in the middle of keeping that water from
getting to the people who need it and
all of a sudden it graft becomes
involved in all kinds of things so they
have to question why aren't the existing
systems working and what if we try
something different and in their case
what they're trying to do is figure out
you know what if local communities can
create the source of water themselves if
they have the right funding so that's
the big that's the beautiful question
that he's working on and that water down
org is working on my own beautiful
question is how might I get more people
interested in the power of questioning
so when I'm doing one of the things I'm
doing is working with this right
question Institute group and they work
with kids they go into schools including
inner-city schools and they teach
teachers how to do brainstorming
sessions where kids just ask questions
that's all they do no answers allowed
you just have to come in a problem and
try to come up with as many questions as
you can and try to attack the problem
through interesting questions and it's
pretty it's pretty great what you what
you see happen when kids start doing
that because they get really invested in
their questions they start to love the
question and then they want to work on
the question after the session is over
they like the question so much they say
I want to work on that question so it's
pretty great
pretty great system so I right now have
a site called a more beautiful question
if you have a beautiful question or if
you want to talk about questioning
there's I'm creating a community and a
discussion around questioning and I
collect I collect beautiful questions
from people and this is how you can you
can get in touch and you know the only
thing I would say in closing is you know
like it's really great to find yourself
a question to work on and to live with I
don't know if how many of you are doing
that already if any of you are but it's
a powerful thing
questions are very powerful if you get
invested in a question it will kind of
lead you along and it will stay with you
it's interesting you know questions are
more powerful than statements they're
more powerful than resolutions you know
you make a new year's resolution and say
I'm gonna drink less I'm gonna drink
more water because it's good for me
and then you never do it right if you
ask yourself if you pose yourself that
as a challenge in the form of a question
and you say how might I drink more water
in the future it's pretty amazing the
effects that'll have your mind will tend
to work on that and there have been
research studies done on this that show
that when you pose something to yourself
as a question as opposed to a statement
you're more likely to do it and the
reason is you activate this process
where your mind starts to work on the
puzzle it's a question how am I gonna do
it what are some possible ways what if I
try this what if I try that
so you've activated this process it may
be going on in your subconscious and
it's it's actually a very effective
thing and and particularly if you give
yourself a big ambitious question you
know how might I create some kind of
change in my life in my community in my
workplace it can be a very very powerful
thing and you can also share questions
questions are more shareable than
answers you know people will if you tell
other people you know I'm working on
this question I really want to figure
out how we could do a better job of this
or that all of a sudden people are gonna
be inclined to think about that question
as well and they might actually want to
help you they might want to help you
pursue that question so I would say you
know find yourself a beautiful question
live with it you know take it for walks
sleep with it because a lot of times
when you have a beautiful question and
you're working on it your subconscious
works on it all the time and and just
you know live live the question and
never lose that curiosity and that's it
so we can take questions I think
do we have time you have time for
questions right okay so does anybody
have a question after all that I was
more specific if you get into the habit
of asking questions which is good you
will run into a problem where you are
asking just too many questions are not
doing anything right yeah and then you
have a practical choice to make this is
the question I want to dig deep into
these are the questions I am NOT going
to dig deep into it right and why choose
a questionnaire and not choose question
B yeah and it's well it is I mean I
think you do have to you do have to
choose that that's part of the you know
like I talked about that process of why
what if how starting out exploring and
then and then trying to converge so you
start out it's like divergent thinking
right the beginning of questioning
you're exploring as many possibilities
and you may be exploring multiple
questions but at some point you have to
converge and you have to decide well I
think you just have to think about the
questions that are most important or the
ones that make the most sense to pursue
first as opposed to later and I think
you have to make some choices I mean
that's it you know you have to decide
which questions you're going to pursue
and then I think you have to think about
how you're going to pursue them and
that's why I think it's really important
you can the thing about questioning is
you can get trapped and endless
questioning and that's why I think it's
really important to think of questioning
as being action-oriented so you once you
have arrived at a question that is
interesting to you that you think is
worth your time you start to think about
how to move forward on it haven't had a
how to take steps even if it's small
steps small initial steps and I think
that's a big challenge for people I
never got that convincing on satellite
you was something Oh idea that's that's
so why choose one ID one question over
another yeah that's well it's totally
subjective I mean you would have to
figure I the only thing I could say is I
think it's a matter of priorities you
know some questions are more important
than others you know and you have to
figure out what what they are some
questions have much more promise within
them than others you know I mean what am
I going to have for breakfast is a
question that doesn't have much promise
right it's it doesn't lead to anything
but you know so it's all on it's all
relative it's all on a scale so as you
proceed through questions some are going
to
you have more potential in them than
others and that's that's part of the
challenge is figuring out which ones
have the most opportunity in them yep
so as an example when you have a
question when I have a question that I
want to share out with an audience right
right when does when does groupthink
happen and how do you break out of a
group big mode in that question right
where you're posing it you're sharing it
you've become a stumbling block in that
collection because all the audience's
are converging and you start to dumb
down the value of the question well I
think the groupthink is if I think of it
as a positive actually I mean I think
that what happens is when you put the
question out there to the group if you
can get everyone invested in the same
question and invested and really
seriously invested if you can create
that dynamic I think it's hugely
powerful because now you're going to
have people thinking about the question
from different angles from different
perspectives different history they're
bringing a different history to it
they're bringing different expertise now
the challenge is to get people to agree
on the question because a lot of times
people will say I don't really think
that's the right question so that can be
a challenge getting the question getting
a consensus around what is the question
we should be talking about and the other
challenge I think with questioning in
like a group setting is you know I you
know I if people say there's no bad
questions I think there are bad
questions and I think that some people
use questioning the wrong way you know
so they use questioning to play devil's
advocate or they use questioning to to
say well how much is it going to cost
they they're totally focused on
practical questioning which has a place
but not necessarily when you're trying
to do expansive thinking there you kind
of want more open-ended questioning so
that those are some of the problems I
see with group questioning is getting
people to agree on what are the right
questions to ask and getting people to
approach questioning with the right
spirit of you know we're actually
curious we're all curious we're trying
to get to something better
we're not trying to score points we're
not trying to be you know shoot someone
down or whatever you know some that's
that to me is one of the challenge and
say yeah you said that I've been
questions the examples
here I believe they are not necessarily
bad questions the situation is bad for
that question but it could be you're
right you're right no that's actually
true
well I do think though that there are
some questions you know it's a bad
question to me is like um a question
that doesn't really where the person
asking it isn't really curious about the
answer in other words they're asking the
question to make a point to show off to
put someone in their place right yes
ma'am
yeah let me come anything on Billy's
questions yeah there I agree that
unlikely you're probably talking more
about the practical questions and the
practical questions definitely have a
place although what what I think with
practical questions is you have to
separate them out sometimes and whole
they come in later you know the how
they're in the house stage so but when
you're in the why and what if stage and
they kind of want to push those
practical questions aside over yeah in
the back
more questioning their benefits for life
well yeah there's a lot right now going
on with sort of inquiry learning by
inquiry and and and I think that's what
that's what's being referred to there
and people are trying all different
approaches and I think they're all worth
trying I mean I don't think anyone has
the answer on it yet I think there's a
lot of experimentation to be done about
how best to use questioning within an
academic setting and there's probably a
lot of ways to do it
I mentioned the right question Institute
and what they're doing that's one way
you know that they have these very now
these exercises they do that last a half
hour or whatever so that's one way but
there's all kinds of ways I mean
Montessori does interesting things with
learning by inquiry and learning by
experimentation so there's there's all
different approaches and I think that
schools are just going to have to figure
it out over time and I think a lot of
them are trying to they're starting to
to work on it but the big challenge may
be is teachers have to it's a big
adjustment for teachers you know
teachers have to and I totally
sympathize with teachers on this because
it's hard I mean if they open up the
classroom to more questioning by
students there's a certain amount of
control that they're giving up and also
there are time issues that they have to
meet a certain amount of the curriculum
within a time frame and if they open it
up for questioning
it's not as efficient because kids may
be asking questions that are a little
bit off off topic and so then what do
you do so it's it's very challenging for
teachers to sort of do that reversal
where they they give up some of the
authority they give up some of the power
of questioning and they turn it over to
the students very challenging but I
think it's worth trying to do yeah
so you mentioned the questioning
behavior dropping off children go
through adolescence right but then you
framed it up in an academic context and
I was wondering if you'd look for the
status of experimental behavior amongst
adolescents across different cohorts
over time you know our teens today more
likely to do what they're told or are
they still kicking out crap and raisin
hell the way they always have yeah well
I mean if you're talking about like
questioning as a form of behavior not
see what I'm talking about with that
chart is actually verbally asking
questions in class your chart said what
as what as asking is if you look at the
nature of the human animal are they
truly getting less inquisitive no I
don't think so no it's just how it's I
think it's about how it gets six it's
about how it gets expressed I think so
in fact I talked about this with it with
one teacher education big expert in the
education world and she said you know
when we think those kids are asking less
questions they're still asking questions
they're just not doing it in class
they're finding other ways to explore
they're finding other ways to ask
questions but they're not doing it in
the classroom
so I think what's going on in the
classroom is just about whether or not
kids feel comfortable raising their
hands and asking a question and there's
all kinds of things that impact that
comfort level and one is peer pressure
from the other kids because I talked to
I talked to doctor this guy Jackie and
raqqa
you know he was he was on 60 minutes he
and he invented he's 16 years old and he
invented a new a new way of screening
for cancer and it's pretty amazing and
he did this you know while he was in
high school and so I I figured you know
he's like one of the smartest high
school kids in the world right and I
asked him do you ask questions in class
and he said no and I and he's incredibly
curious outside of class he's
questioning all the time is it he's
doing experiments he's exploring but in
school he doesn't and he said the reason
why is because number one his teachers
don't he can tell his teachers aren't
interested in his questions and number
two he said the other kids think it's
real
cool to ask questions so so you're
dealing with a multi-dimensional problem
there and I was writing about this the
other day and the blog mindSHIFT
and I was saying that what what teachers
one of the things teachers need to do in
addition to creating the space and the
safety and all of that is somehow they
need to make questioning cool and that's
really challenging right because if all
the kids think it's uncool to raise your
hand and ask questions how do you
reverse that you know and and I was
saying that maybe one of the things you
do is you know you you you help kids
understand that all this cool stuff they
love came out of questioning you know
all these gadgets and all these products
they love you know are a result of
questioning and maybe that's one of the
ways you start to change that the the
viewing of questioning but anyway yeah
quick but it says parents you know you
try it starts asking questions about the
age of two and three and like it's like
overwhelming reaction straight up what's
generally your based on the research in
front you done in terms of panicking
approach dealing with kids as they go up
through these phases well I mean I all I
have is anecdotal stuff like for
instance I mentioned Jack and raka and I
was curious about his parents because
obviously he's a great questioner and
and so what his parents do is they from
one from a certain age and I'm not sure
exactly when but maybe when he was six
or seven okay they started they stopped
answering his questions and started
encouraging him to answer his own
questions I thought that was a really
good method so he was he was a very
curious kid and whenever he'd come up
with a question they would say okay why
don't you start working on that question
and figure out how to how to answer it
and and you know their their rationale
was that they wanted him to you know
take ownership of his questions at an
early age I think that's pretty smart
you know I think I think it's initially
you can't do that with kids who are too
young obviously it's a certain age when
a kid is able to start exploring his own
questions but as soon as that age
happens I'm not sure exactly it's
probably different for different kids
but as soon as that age happens I think
that's a great thing to encourage kids
to answer their own question
and explore their own and before that I
think it's just patience you know being
patient enough to field and answer the
questions that you can without going
crazy you know because because you
definitely want to send that signal to
kids that the question is welcome and
it's unfortunately they will be getting
that signal the opposite signal in other
parts of the world so at least at home
you would want them to get the signal
that questions are a good thing they're
not annoying they're not bad they're not
whatever yeah yeah in in one of this
house Ken Robinson spoke about how the
school kills creativity and I sort of
want to get your take on is creativity
directly related to the ability to ask
questions or the wanted to ask questions
of curiosity in kids yeah from an
organizational link I mean when kids
grow up and for example let's say one
generation went tennis question marks
came out as periods right now they're in
the workforce right when we talk about
breakthrough ideas these people there's
a whole life cycle in the workforce
right so so the younger one's gonna ask
a lot more question then you look at a
lot of tech companies now right you have
the B startups with the really young
bright ones asking the why question
right coming up with things like what's
up yeah and the companies that have been
around for a while at the articles and
us to some extent are at that stage
where we have to reinvent is that
because people have to be retrained to
ask questions or as opposed to following
alright well I think what you know to me
it seems like what happens is that
everything is in cycles you know so so
the challenge for companies that have
been around a while is that they already
went through that cycle in the past of
asking the why questions and then they
got into a more established mode where
they're trying to sort of protect what
they have and or optimize what they have
feeling okay we've built we've built
something pretty solid here how do we
optimize it and get the most out of it
and and I think the problem with that
mindset it's very logical it makes a lot
of sense
but it doesn't make sense today like it
made sense what's that I it's its
channel I think it's I think it's a it's
a process I think it starts with the
leadership and the leadership has to say
has to set aside time for people to do
this kind of questioning has to make it
clear that this kind of questioning is
welcome because I think people can all
do it I think that even if people have
been through a long period at a company
where they haven't been asking those
questions that doesn't mean they can't
go back to asking those questions I
think it's just dormant it's a skill
that's dormant I don't think it goes
away you know i comfort zone people just
settle down to having universal yeah my
mind is what's up creating a safe
environment glass questions is right
yeah it's it's the environment but but
but you know the main thing is like I
odd I don't think people lose the
ability to ask those questions
I just think they've gotten out of the
habit of asking those questions it's
questioning is very much a habit it's
it's a mindset that's habitual so if
you're in the habit of looking at things
a certain way you're just more inclined
to do it if you fall out of that habit
and you're more in a routine kind of
mindset then that's your habit but I
don't think you lose the I don't think
you lose the tool you know to me that
that app you know that questioning app
is always there but what you've done is
now you've let it go to the back of the
of the you're not using it and so it's
got pushed to the back you know so the
question the challenge for companies is
how do they bring it forward and create
the safe environment so people are
willing to try to do that kind of thing
and one of the biggest challenges no to
me I think is that middle it's not even
the leaders while the leaders are
important leaders our leader has to
signal that this is welcome but then the
problem the real challenge is the middle
management right it's all the people who
are they have something to protect and
they and they maybe are afraid of being
challenged and so if they have people
beneath them asking questions that is
seen as a challenge to Authority or
somehow questioning their expertise you
know experts are there's a real
interesting dynamic between experts and
questioning you know experts do not
often do not like to question and they
don't like to be questioned so you have
an issue with expertise and you have to
deal with that and I think actually the
one of the quotes from from your new CEO
of really nicely addressed that I mean
he basically said you know you have to
you have to take that expertise that
we've all earned and figure out how do
we now take it and expand it and take it
in new directions instead of using the
expertise to keep doing what you've been
doing you got to figure out how do you
adapt the expertise and take it out and
you know that's that's challenging
that's that's a big big challenge yes I
have a feedback on the parenting
discussion that was happening how to
teach kids so I came across a very nice
BBC documentary on Richard Feinman it's
called the pleasure of finding things
out okay 49 minute video which is free
on YouTube it's I would encourage
everybody in the audience and if you
have not come across you as well that
very interesting way of teaching kids
how to constantly question oh and keep
that means he developed did he develop
this way of doing it oh no this was not
he talks about how his father taught him
okay start asking questions and why he
okay is that so yeah done by a British
guy named Christopher Sykes
what was it what's called the pleasure
of finding things out pleasure for
things are
okay great sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
