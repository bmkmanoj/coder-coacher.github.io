you
good afternoon it's a pleasure to
welcome Peter Ryan today peter is a
professor at the University of
Luxembourg the one and only yes
diversity luxembourg and is done many
things in security and especially is the
principal designer or native innovator
of the predicate a system and now
systems of various signs which you will
as soon as he gets his microphone reset
have an opportunity to start talking
about okay so many thanks to Josh for
the invitation to come and speak speak
here so it's a pleasure and an honor so
yeah for good eight years now I've been
working on this platter wat a scheme and
it has evolved quite a bit in the face
of differing requirements perception of
new threats perception of realization of
new cryptographic primitives and so on
so what I thought I try and do today is
give a very high level view of the
scheme and some of the indications of
how its evolved and the different under
the different pressures and so on so
sort of evolution of the species as it
were ok so the outline of what I plan to
present is first of all I'll just
quickly describe the problem we're
trying to address here I guess many of
you so Josh you won't learn anything
there but then I'll give a very again a
very high level view of Quetta forte and
there are some indications of how the
design has evolved over time and then
I'll start talking about a couple of the
more recent things the plateau vote a is
a polling station supervised scheme I
should say a few years back I ventured
rather nervously into the area of
Internet voting with a scheme called
pretty good democracy which was
developed with Vanessa Teague and then
most recently there's a scheme which is
a variant of pet ovata which
incorporates some of the ideas from
pretty good democracy so we get a
version called Parvati with
formation codes which well I'll talk
about the advantages and possible
disadvantages of that so that's the
outline roughly so I thought I'd just
people almost invariably particular side
of the Atlantic asked me why what does
the name mean why well if you speak
French literally it's ready to vote
latitude yes ready to vote but of course
it throws back to the the phrase the
French phrase better potty which is
ready to wear off the peg I guess in and
he was the idea was actually triggered i
was just riding a bus in in london and I
saw a pet emoji sandwich store which
some of you may have come across and of
course people tell him keep telling me
it's a lousy name in the US and I know
but I like it okay so what is the
problem with sort of bunch of us in this
field have been trying to address well
of course it's an ancient problem it
basically goes back to the origins of
democracy there's actually evidence the
Greeks were aware of the people would
try and undermine elections and that
there are actually archaeological
artifacts which indicate they try to
can't transfer trust from people into
kind of devices machines so really what
we're trying to do is make sure that the
outcome of an election is demonstrably
true 2mon strictly to everyone and in a
way which sort of cannot be questioned
in particular by that the losers but at
the same time because we have to
guarantee in most elections at any rate
that all ballots remain private okay and
of course what makes this problem i
guess rather kind of unique in say the
field of commuter computer science is
that unlike you know if we're just
computing an algorithm or something we
really don't have any objective way of
saying what the correct answer is okay
by definition of the ballot privacy
there's sort of no God's eye view of
what the correct answer should be and
the important point to stress here I
guess is that we want to achieve all
this in a way which minimizes the amount
of trust we have to place sort of
anywhere in officials software hardware
etc etc so that's the challenge we're
trying to address
and well sort of clearly conventional
systems sort of cheves some of this but
involve typically quite a lot of trust
in the officials and and so forth so to
talk about trust so have been dying to
write a paper for a long time with this
title how many diebold technicians as it
takes change in election so I mean as
you in the US know that sort of makes it
a major problem which I guess is have
been improving a little bit but it was a
big problem I guess two thousand ish
well right so that yeah so people are
based that I said historically we were
expected to trust in the officials
conducting the election more recently
particularly in the US where we have
sort of do touch screen dr emachines the
voters the electorate are meant so
required to trust the suppliers of the
the code and so forth and perhaps and
certifies in some sense and what is
really scandalous in my mind and I think
anyone here will dispute it in some
cases where people people are asked to
trust in code which is essentially kept
secret which no experts are allowed to
examine or only under strict NDA's or if
that and that really is a totally
unacceptable situation and of course we
see places in the world you'll all have
seen many pictures like this where
people clearly did not trust the
handling the outcome of an election so I
guess you also to know this kind of
stuff I think these figures are about
right there may be a little bit dated
now a very significant chunk of the US
electorate have been noting on
touchscreen machines which well until
recently I guess basically you'd have to
trust purely on the code inside it more
recently I guess we have VVPAT though to
verify paper audit trails but that how
much that helps is debatable ok so
that's particular in the US that's a
sort of background and of course there
are similar problems elsewhere in the
world so what basically cryptographers
in security folk
been trying to do is if you like take a
new approach and the design philosophy
behind this approach and I think this is
a quote at the top which I tribute to
you but a search is I a nice slogan I
think verify the election not the system
I'll i like this phrase because neither
i feel it's happening for some property
like integrity trying to guarantee that
it's fulfilled by sort of monitoring
auditing and so forth is the way to do
it not by trying to verify thousands of
lines of code and trying to show
yourself that the verified code is
actually was running in every machine on
the day etc etc that kind of assurance
is extremely fragile in my view so we
want to base the assurance of the
accuracy of the outcome the integrity on
purely on the basis of transparency
auditability verifiability whatever you
want to call it ok yeah skip that bullet
okay but just to be clear that doesn't
mean that we should completely skip any
notions of system verification and there
are other aspects where it's still
important to do that so we still need to
guarantee that the system will run will
run smoothly during the election we
still have to guarantee secrecy
properties which are not really ones
which you can guarantee by monitoring
they're not an enforceable property and
fresh to Fred Schneider's terminology
but so that really the crucial point and
it gets the one that I'll be focusing on
today is that assurance of the integrity
should not depend on the correctness of
the code okay should depend on auditing
and transparency and I guess that's a
work way of rephrasing the ocean
software independence okay so key
requirements I went so labor this will
go through a lot of them and I won't go
into too much detail and there's a lot
of softly behind these lots of people
have been working on trying to come up
with precise mathematical formulations
of these notions they turn out to be
extraordinary subtle bit icky when you
get to things like this that could be a
whole lecture in itself so i won't labor
these so clearly i guess the high level
property is the integrity as i say we
want to be sure that the announced
is correct correct correctly reflects
the legitimately cast ballots we need to
guarantee ballot secrecy at the same
time and typically with these more
sophisticated schemes we also have to
guarantee more so advanced properties
that can be phrased paraphrased roughly
as there should be no way for a voter to
produce a proof to a third party I used
some sort of coercer how they vote
that's obviously to try and prevent
coercion and vote buying problem and of
course there's lots of other properties
we also require but we'll skip over
those rather quickly for today anyway
okay so what is often called into n
verifiability or something I guess
sometimes fully order to audible I guess
that's the same sort of phrase there are
various phrases here I'll stick 2 into n
verifiability so the basic idea is that
we should try and provide voters some
way of assuring themselves that their
vote accurately reaches the the final
tally but we have to do this in a way
which doesn't reveal to any third party
how they voted and you can see this is a
pretty good trick if you can pull it off
its people have been struggling this for
the with this for decades I guess and so
what typically happens in order to
realize this concept is that voters get
some form of receipt the time they cast
their vote okay you'll see you
Illustrated how that's done in plateau
vaati but obviously other systems
produce receipts fire somewhat different
mechanisms and so that receipt has in
the hidden form encrypted encoded in
some way the representation of their
vote but in a way that third parties who
don't hold suitable cryptographic keys
or whatever cannot extract it okay and
so the idea typically then is that all
of these receipts should be posted some
kind of secure so-called secure web
bulletin board quite how you realize
this concept is another issue as well
get into today and so voters or perhaps
proxies can go to this check their atty
the receipt appears correctly there and
then there's some kind of universal
anonymizing tabulation process that goes
on afterwards and again I want use asala
fairly well-established cryptographic
techniques which I went going to the
details of today
so at a very high level sort of 15,000
foot level is that the phrase you use in
the US that's kind of what we're trying
to achieve here okay so to introduce
plateau vote a very quickly then so the
key idea is actually very simple so in
fact voters use a rather sore certainly
to say UK voters for example a rather
familiar looking paper ballot form but
what makes it different from the way it
would normally happen in say the UK is
that on each ballot form the candidate
list is independently randomized okay
and there's some representation we
either written on the form itself or
probably more likely the encryption will
be committed to where bulletin board and
will be a sort of pointer to that
printed on the ballot form there's a
representation of that candidate order
which is later used for tabulation okay
so the idea is a typical ballot form
might look like this okay so there's a
list of the candidates in the sort of
standard way at least for a UK votto and
I guess it's similar in the u.s.
although it would be a more complex
looking ballot but with a lot more real
estate spread across it but I'm
typically UK ballots do sort of contain
maybe tops about ten candidates in a
race so it's sort of okay so if you
picked up another one at random you'd
see a different ordering these
candidates okay and there's some kind of
properly pointer to a cryptographic
commitment on the web bulletin board on
the bottom right-hand side okay well
I'll go through the ceremonial slider
too but basically the idea is in the
booth the voter marks their choice so
panoramix in this case in the usual way
and in some way in the booth they
destroy the left hand part so it's
keynote you can do fun stuff in keno
and so that leaves what is now
constitutes to receive okay so well i'll
come up to the properties of it in a
second so the Voting ceremony typically
would be the voter would come in perhaps
pre-register in some way you know show
they authenticate themselves they would
be given sealed in an envelope for
example because obviously you need to
keep this candidate order secret from
officials and so forth really the voter
should be the only person who sees this
candidate order is given to them they go
to the booth yes actually destroys a
left-hand panel so it's destroyed flame
isn't really practice at all panting it
in water a would work but but you know
people usually turn it in to arts
maylene for in that just plain no word
well I mean we will have a perforation
or something down the middle so
hopefully they will at least separate
the two parts correctly how you actually
destroy it and I think the process of
destroying it is not so much the issue
it's how you enforce that it does get
destroyed is somewhat delicate nuts yeah
assured it would essentially do it then
a radius construct a lot of documented
documents from the US Embassy after some
work I'm actually in some sense you
don't need so much to destroy what you
need to do is destroy that the
association between the two so actually
some sense the destroying it is not so
much the issue an arguably no maybe some
context where actually would make sense
maybe to actually to leave them lying
there I'll come to that perhaps later on
if we have but enforcing the separation
of those two parts is is delicate and
that's something which maybe we'll talk
more about later okay so he goes into
the booth marks she goes into the booth
marks detaches and somehow destroys or
at least discards the left-hand side and
then can come out of with out of the
booth and goes back to the officials and
has the information on this scanned and
posted the web bulletin board and then
they will get some kind of copy which
should presumably be validated in some
there's some delicate issues there to
which we are starting to touch on
yesterday perhaps franked in some way
and possibly digitally signed to try and
sort of guarantee its authenticity make
it hard to to counterfeit again there is
quite a lot of delicate issues there too
which maybe we'll get into in discussion
and basically they can now take that
this copy away and later they can visit
use it to visit the web bulletin board
or possibly they might sort of give it
to help her voter helper organizations
to do it on their heart on their behalf
or something and well potentially we can
also keep additional copies of these
things because they're already there now
in encrypted form there are potential
for keeping various additional copies
which would seem not to do any harm to
keep multiple copies of these things
okay so as indicated previously these
things get posted voters or proxies can
visit check that they're all appear
correctly and then you know once we've
reached the end of a certain phase
assuming that any disputes have been
suitably resolved we can then go into
the tabulation okay so this could be
using anonymizing mixes and followed by
decryption in a verified fashion there
are standard techniques for doing that
or possibly with a homomorphic
tabulation you just manage them all
together into one big ciphertext
exploiting this or algebraic homomorphic
properties and then you decrypt that and
that somehow allows you to extract the
total in one decryption shot so you
don't have to decrypt the individual
ballots in that case which is the way
the anonymity of the ballots ballots
privacy's guaranteed there okay and I
won't go too much into all the details
but essentially all these steps they're
basically three phases that you have to
guarantee you happen correctly so you
can see for the correctness of the
encoding of your vote what you have to
do is guarantee that the ballots you're
given is correct is well formed in the
sense that the information buried in the
cipher text correctly matches the order
shown on the ballot form and we can do
that essentially by various forms of
random audit and again I'll talk a
little bit about some of the options the
procedures and the kind of audits we can
do to guarantee that then we need to try
and guarantee that you know all
legitimately cast receipts get fed into
the tabulation so that's basically by
this sort of checking on the web
bulletin process that I kind of
indicated in essence again there's some
subtleties I'm glossing over and then
you have to guarantee that all of these
encrypted ballots are correctly
decrypted in some sense and the output
countered up so the three phases you
have to guarantee that each everything
is done correctly to each of those
phases if all that's correct you've got
a sort of indirection which should if a
voter checks that their receipt is
correctly on the bulletin board they
should get a guarantee via this sort in
direction that their vote ultimately
gets correctly counted but in a way
because it goes via this encryption they
cannot show how they voted to a third
party so sort of makes sense roughly as
the soar three key legs of this argument
okay so few quick remarks about this
some of them will probably be in a
parity immediately but there's a few
which are sort of more subtle which as i
was telling Josh weren't actually sort
of designed in at the beginning I only
realized them a bit later on though
there are actually interesting
properties well first of all which
should be apparent that if you don't
have the keys to decrypt the
cryptographic values you cannot
interpret what this cross represents in
terms of a candidate in a vote the vert
experience is sort of fairly familiar
and the additional checks are of course
optional so the basic casting of a vote
is pretty much the same as you do it in
the UK anyway and here we get into the
sort of other more subtle properties
which kind of spin off of the design so
one very nice feature is you'll notice
that at no point does a voter actually
have to communicate their choice to a
device right if you can trust that with
or say a dr e or quite a lot of the
other even cryptographic schemes the
voter has to tell the device how they
want to vote and either that is just
directly cast supposedly or some kind of
encryption of it is generated or
multiple encryptions or whatever but in
any case that device learns how the
voter wants to vote and you potentially
have sort of side channels leakage
the way it's done in provo tape because
all the encryptions done in Dover in
advance you can see we sidestep those
kind of threats which is kind of neat
and another interesting point is that so
I remarked that the correctness of your
receipt rests on the correctness of your
ballot and so we can we can offer say
the opportunities to voters or two
independent auditors to to audit check
the construction of randomly chosen
ballots and this auditing process is is
particularly clean from both the privacy
point of view because obviously at this
point no vote has been cast it hasn't
even necessarily been associated
associated with a voter so the auditing
process hip poses no threat to the
privacy of the vote which is in contrast
with some other sort of cryptographic
systems and resolving you know who's
guilty if you like is clear-cut here as
well right it's simply an issue whether
the ballot is well formed or not nuts a
clear-cut issue if it's not then clearly
whatever device created that ballot is
cheating so this is in contrast with
some other schemes where the device
produces an encryption the voter ops to
audit it using vanilla challenge style
option so it's opened up and the
candidate is real and then maybe the
voter says well that's not the the
candidate at prime input on the screen
now there you have the difficulty you're
not entirely sure you know who's telling
the truth here so in that sense it's
kind of quite clear cut which i think is
nice okay and you can see that it
potentially can handle quite nicely
richer voting systems like ranked
Instant Runoff approval and so forth
okay so verification I probably need to
keep going fairly quickly I think I've
given an indication of these things
already cheers so I think we can
probably skip yeah I pretty much said
those bullets okay so let's carry on
okay so I wanted to say a little bit
about how the system is evolved so I'm
not going to go into a sort of great
deal of detail here but these bullet
indicates some of the sort of key
development steps or branching
steps if you like in the evolution so
the first version of petawatt a ship
apsa said earlier that i was inspired in
this by an earlier schemed you do to
david shower which use visual crypto to
do the encoding so i was very much
inspired by that and Parvati was in a
few largely an attempt to sort of
simplify both conceptually and
technologically procedures there so
Shaun's original scheme to use
decryption mixers which actually have
some quite nice features from our point
of view some technical features it
allowed us to very neatly deal with full
permutations of the candidates so if you
set it up right basically you can as the
thing goes through the decryption mix
you can basically unfold various
permutations which are applied in the
construction of the ballot you apply the
inverse permutations in the opposite
order so basically you can takes a
vector of rankings as it's fed through
the mix the vector is transformed in a
sort of contravariant way if thats they
always get the two confused variant
contravariant so what pops out at the
end is in fact the ballot with the
ranking represented in the canonical
standard order which is kind of nice so
you in the in the process you lose any
information about what the original
permutations were so that was a nice
feature but the course is a whole bunch
of downsides to decryptions as some of
you are aware right there are sort of
very inflexible fragile at the size of
the the encryptions grows the more mixes
you go through and so on so forth so
later variants move to re encryption
mixes which I guess some of you are
probably familiar with these in many
ways a much more elegant much more
flexible re encryptions can be done by
devices servers that don't know any
secret keys and contrast a decryption
mixes so basically you can have sort of
many as you want you can switch them in
and out and so on and so forth so
there's a lot of nice features of our
encryption mixes they're much more
robust flexible and so forth the floor
is that when there's no obvious way to
reproduce this rather neat trick that I
described for decryption mixes to sort
of drag
the ranking vector or whatever because
the rien crip Shin mixes you basically
don't extract any plain text information
as the thing goes through so the earlier
variants just use cyclic shifts so you
can just use exploit the hummer morphism
to easily handle cyclic shifts and
that's good enough for justice or
plurality votes just choosing a single
candidate at least from us privacy point
of view we then got a bit worried that
from an integrity point of view this was
still a bit dodgy because you can see
even though the cyclic shift is enough
to conceal the choice if an adversary
somehow is able to manipulate some some
ballots in an undetectable way he knows
you know precisely what shift to apply
to transform a certain candidate to
another okay so cyclic shifts are sort
of fragile so the next thing is we
actually went on with Vanessa in fact we
went on to a Florentine Square based
permutations if that rings a bell says
of affine permutations which kind of
counters that but it's still not sort of
rich enough to handle you know if you
want to handle ranked voting or
something and clearly it's still not
enough to conceal the information so the
most recent variants do go on to handle
full permutations but the trouble is
that as far as I've we've been able to
determine so far the only way you can
actually do that is if you have if
you've got n candidates you basically
have N in n encryptions one for each
candidate and that allows you in a sort
of fairly straightforward way to handle
full permutations and what I would
really like to find and so if you like a
little challenge for people is if you
recall the original scheme had a single
encryption to represent the full
permutation there's no way that these
permutation algebra algebra permutations
seems to mesh with simple homomorphic
properties well somehow somehow we'd
have what I the ideal would be to
a representation of the ballot which
just has to say a single ciphertext
which encode the whole permutation and
be able to feed this through a mix so
mimicking the rather nice property that
we had up there for example we can do it
naively but things come out at the end
with still the information about the
original permutation preserved which we
don't want to do okay so there's an
interesting challenge here and I I don't
know how to do that that would be this
or next step along that second bullet if
we could do it another thing that we
developed in later versions and this was
well partly to counter the issue that
well as I described it originally
there's some authority that generates
all the ballots and encryptions and so
on if that is corrupt or or leaks then
of course you have problems so it seems
to well that's one issue and another
issue is people pointed out click the
graphic style attacks right where if you
have a single device generating say the
randomness of an encryption if there is
a Trojan horse there they can actually
exploit subliminal channels leak
information to the outside so we looked
at ways to try and counter both of those
issues and I guess the neatest is to
have a distributed generation process so
there's a bunch of entities that
collaborate to generate the encryptions
and so forth in such a way that no
single entity knows or can control the
final value so you counter those kind of
issues so that was a further development
another thing that we worked on is the
possibility of print-on-demand ballots
okay the way I described it so far the
implication was that all these ballots
are generated in it in advance perhaps
some of them pre-ordered it in advance
and so forth that has nice properties
but on the other hand then you have to
worry about chain of custody issues with
this batch of ballots so arguably you
might be better off rather than printing
in them in bulk in advance to print them
on demand perhaps even in the booth
right there with the voter
so if you do this rather nicely you you
get so stronger guarantees that the
voter is the only person who sees the
candidate order assuming it's properly
destroyed and so forth but then of
course you get into issues that in a
sense you start getting to the standard
issues with other schemes that you have
to worry about the trustworthiness of
the printing device or the decryption
the device in the booth so you start
having to do random audits Bonello jizz
cut and choose and so forth but not
anyway we have constructions which can
handle print on demand they're quite
quite nice or are using paired onions
kind of notions so an onion which can be
decrypted by the device in the booth and
then another one which is decrypted by
the tellers later during tabulation so
there's some quite nice constructions
there so see how we're doing yes I've
got another 25 minutes or 20 minutes
yeah ok and so further possibilities
which have been explored although not
really I guess implemented or exploited
yet so one idea was to in addition to
the copies of the receipts that voters
walk away with is actually to keep
locally some kind of verified encrypt
paper audit trail i called it okay so
some local paper record of all the
encrypted receipts that have been cast
and this would be a way of sort of
backing up these kind of distributed
record held by in a distributed fashion
by the voters and various independent
and/or thought entities could in
principle go to this and check the
consistency with the web bulletin board
and so forth ok let me yes not dwell too
much on that another possibility which I
started thinking about later is so this
is all very well but it means still in
encrypted paper audit trail so for
people who are worried about the they
cryptographic aspect of this they may
not really find this gives them much so
additional Sean so one possibility is to
create an additional in addition to the
encrypted receipt some kind of human
readable procedure and
are some tricks you can have we
suggested for Plato vote a in order to
two as a side effect to generate a plain
text version of the receipt which could
be cast separately and kept as a paper
audit trail as well again there are sort
of issues there which Russian I just
discussed a little bit okay so i think
that sort of quickly went through some
of the key design source steps or
branches in the evolution let me just
talk a little bit about some of those
key design decisions which emerged from
all this so i've mentioned the need to
audit the ballots in some way and there
are various possibilities which bring to
mind here i mean the most natural 12
certainly your sort of security person
is if you really want to place the the
trust of the system on the voters
themselves is to give the voters the
option to randomly choose perhaps as
many ballots as they want and audit them
and so forth that feels nice in
principle but of course it complicates
the life of the voters and whether
that's really the way to go is not clear
so the other extreme is just who will
put the onus of this on independent
auditors or you could do it mix and
match of those and there's various
decisions here how exactly do you do the
audit procedure yeah again there are
various options we could use Pendola
challenges we could use some sort of cut
and choose so one option at one point
that i came up with it sort of quite
like that nobody else seems to vicky
like is to have two sided ballot forms
you have a platter bought a form on each
side near at you have three columns and
so basically the vote has to randomly
choose one side and well if they vote on
with that side conventionally and they
destroy the left-hand part but that
leaves a complete sort of virgin ballot
form on the other side which can be
routinely audited that has an advantage
that it sort of keeps track of how many
ballots each voter has because I mean
one of the issues if you allow well I
guess even been allowed challenges or
cut and choose is you've got voters
running around with multiple ballots you
have to be careful
they can't that doesn't allow them to
cast multiple votes so there's a bunch
of possibilities here I've already
mentioned pre-printed versus print on
demand another issue is are you better
off using homomorphic mixes versus mix
tabulations anonymizing mixes that's
again not entirely clear to me it
depends a little bit well to some extent
the complexity of the kind of counting
process you're doing another interesting
one is whether we should go for
everlasting privacy okay Plateau vote as
I've described it here is obviously
using public key encryption so in the
long term that may well be broken 1020
years hence is that a serious issue from
the point of view of voters and people
have come up with suggestions of ways
that you can have unconditional privacy
typically that sacrifices unconditional
integrity in some sense well when we go
into too much detail here so in
principle we could get everlasting
privacy but there's bound to be some
sort of trade off here so again that's
something we have to decide another sort
of interesting option so I touched on
verified encrypted paper audit trails so
I guess I'll mention this later in
threats but one of the issues that I
think could well be a concern with
verified schemes is sort of
psychological attacks okay so some
adversary put out some campaign saying
you know these guys claim that your vote
is protected by this encryption but we
can break this encryption away there's
an easy way of just reading how you
voted and even if this is complete crock
if enough voters believe this they will
potentially be coerced so how do we deal
with that well one option could be just
to take this v patch to the extreme that
in fact we don't let the voters walk
away with their own receipts so this is
the verified encrypted paper audit trail
a few slides back okay so in principle
we could just keep you know a
well-curated ve pad of the receipts and
use that to check against the web
bulletin board and place you know all
the owners of this kind of checking on
independent auditors and the curation of
this
so that would the voters were no longer
walk away with their own receipts and
that might mitigate some of these
psychological threats but of course it
takes the voters out of the loop in
terms of the amount of to the extent to
which they can contribute to the
assurance so there's a bunch of things
we've been thinking about I've actually
be interested in people's feedback those
of you that in the room okay so very
quickly some vulnerabilities that we
have worried us and how seriously we
should take these in comparison to other
kind of coercion threats is of course
interesting so chain voting is one and
that's a well-known attack with even
conventional voting systems but it
becomes potentially even worse for
verified schemes so should I quickly say
does anyone know what chain voting is
well I'll just quickly say I think we'd
probably have time so the idea is that
say we've got a conventional voting
system UK for example a coercer managers
smuggle out a blank form ballot marks it
up the way he wants and then intercepts
a voter as they arrive hence this marked
up ballot to them and says cast this and
come out with another blank one okay and
in theory in the UK ballots are a sort
of controlled resource voter is only
supposed to get one be handed one and
they're supposed to cast be seen to cast
one in the ballot so that means that if
they come out and give the coercer a
blank one that that's a fairly strong
evidence that it casts the marked-up one
and of course you can iterate this as
much as you want and this is potentially
even worse in a verified scheme because
of course you have these identifiers on
the ballot and they're posted later the
to the web bulletin board so the course
can actually check that the marked up on
that they gave the voters fetch up on
the bulletin board so that's kind of
tricky though we've have some
mitigations I'm not sure we've got any
of that are entirely satisfactory and
tricks like covering the unique
identifiers with a scratch trip which
shouldn't be removed until the point of
casting in the presence of officials is
one trick we thought about how feasible
scratch strips are I don't know
Italian attacks were yes that's I guess
somewhat related i mean if you've got a
complicated ballot with say lots of
candidates and ranked ranked voting you
can actually you can see that there are
you know n factorial possibilities you
coerce can essentially constructor
unique identify and say vote for this
candidate in the first place and then a
particular unique pattern lower down
which will with high probability
identify their ballot so again that's
something well that's not special to
quite a lot a this is common to i guess
most of these schemes the randomization
attack is that's worth mentioning very
quickly here because this is
particularly nasty one actually for
quite a lot a i think a particular one
and it's actually interesting because a
lot of the standard definitions of
corrosion resistance actually miss this
property which is kind of interesting so
the idea here is that the cursor just
says you must come out with a receipt
with the cross in the first position or
whatever some designated position and in
the absence of some other sort of
countermeasure that essentially
randomizes the vote to voters vote okay
so in this case that the coercive
clearly doesn't learn how the voters
voted so you're not violating any kind
of privacy property but nonetheless you
are influencing and by randomizing their
vote so that's an interesting property
in it particularly interesting to see
how a lot of the standard definitions
failed to capture that one well we sort
of touched on on this one i think i
don't really have time to talk about it
too much psychological attacks i've also
mentioned so let's try and crack on so i
should quickly mention some other sort
of competing schemes so the scan
integrity to which is a new scheme due
to shower I couldn't really i hope to
say a few words about these but i don't
think i really have time in israel have
recently developed the wombat system
which is actually somewhat similar in
the spirit i think to starve it kind of
well yes there are some important
differences either be okay ron a while
came back came up with a crypto free
scheme which attempts to give
verifiability without actually using
encryption again i don't have time
to go through that yeah I better crack
on okay so let me quickly towards the
end try and talk introduce the key ideas
of pretty good democracy and fertility
with code voting Oh with confirmation
codes so first of all let's mention code
voting which as far as I'm aware goes
back to shower min about 2001 so the I
so this is designed for Internet voting
okay and the idea is sort of very simple
you distribute code sheets through some
supposedly secure channel like mail to
the voters so these are in some sense
sort of private code books okay there
are random codes against the candidates
so in order to vote see that's the next
slide well that there's might be a sort
typical one okay so these are all so
essentially random codes to vote voter
logs on maybe authenticate themselves
provides to the vote server or their
serial number and the vote code of their
candidate of choice and in principle
they should get back they correct the
appropriate little skip back the
appropriate act code corresponding to
that candidate okay so that's kind of
nice you can see it sidesteps quite a
lot of the insecurities of the internet
the ACT code gives serve some useful
purpose in the sense that it presumably
partly authenticates the server you're
talking to it gives you some
confirmation that the correct code
reached that server but beyond that you
have no idea how that code is going to
be interpreted encountered so it's not
end-to-end verifiable so the point of
pretty good democracy was just to pick
up on that idea and try and add some
verifiability greedy ins and so their
basic two key ideas here one is rather
than allow the vote server to know all
these codes you know have a database of
them these codes are secret shared in
some way but amongst a set of Trustees
all right and also for a seat freeness
we suggest using a single act code a
code sheet that has some implications
which might have time to touch on so one
of these code sheet so a PG d code sheet
might look a bit like this so notice now
those
only sort of one column of codes okay on
a single unique confirmation code at the
bottom okay so the basic idea without
going through the details is again voter
logs on their client perhaps generates
an encrypted so they supply the the
appropriate vote code to the machine it
would generate some suitable encryption
under the public key of these trustees
along with a zero knowledge proof of
knowledge of that code for technical
reasons and basically the now a
threshold set of these trustees should
perform pet tests against pre posted
encryptions on the web bulletin board
okay and if the vote has submitted a
valid code for that code sheet one of
these pet tests should test out okay so
that will be flagged on the web on the
web bulletin board and they will then
collectively reveal through some kind of
threshold decryption the appropriate
acknowledgment code okay so the point of
this is that well basically assuming
that knowledge of these codes hasn't
somehow leaked out if the voter gets the
correct act code black that should give
them a strong guarantee that a threshold
set of trustees have collaborated to
correctly register their vote and
basically we can have plateau at a like
mechanisms to ensure that that is
correctly so decrypted interpreted later
and counted that's the rough just very
quickly that sort of make sense that
level so again I probably have to crack
on a little bit so on the web bulletin
board we might have an encryption
there'll be say rose for each code
ballot in this case so a serial number
and then we have pairs we have an
encryption of the appropriate code along
with the candidate and these are all /
muted in some way separately pur muted
in fact in a platter or tail light
fashion for each each ballot okay so in
essence what the trustees do is I guess
alongside this would be posted the
encryption of the coat the submitted
vote code they would do a pet test
against each of these and if they find
that one
sout as having the same code buried
cryptographically inside they flag it
and then they decrypt the
acknowledgement code okay so that's the
gist of it very quickly so I need to
crack on so crucial point about this
which does make both the necessary bit
nervous about this is that of course if
knowledge of these codes leaks out then
you know the integrity cannot clearly be
undermined and that you know I freely
admit his a serious drawback so I
certainly wouldn't allocate this for
high highly critical elections but maybe
for low criticality elections it is at
least an improvement on code voting i
think you'll agree yep okay I think I'd
better crack on the other bullets okay
well as various things that we saw would
like to do to improve this which I guess
I'll skip on it would obviously be nice
to have a better way of and we've
actually got a very nice construct
distributed construction of these of the
stuff on the web bulletin board but of
course the sod of it is that at some
point we have to decrypt all they
extract this and print it and distribute
it so we have that sort of privacy
bottleneck at that point so if we could
sidestep that that would be nice okay so
let me just then quickly round up I
guess we did start a few minutes late to
go huh actually about you know okay so
we should finish within the hour okay so
let me then finally touch on this sort
of newer idea of bringing this pretty
good democracy mechanism into petrov
otay so we bring it back into the
context of supervised dwelling station
voting okay so the idea is basically we
cast a plateau vote a ballot in in the
same way except we use that this
mechanism the background so that the
voter ideally should get the correct
correct code verifiable checkable code
immediately at the time they vote of
course there are issues of availability
on line of the threshold sets of
Trustees but that's that's a mere
implementation practicality
okay oh and I should point out here that
when we do this whereas for the Internet
scheme in order to guarantee receipt
freeness ie the receipt greenness
basically means that the voter shouldn't
be able to construct some sort of proof
to present to a third-party how they
voted in that context we use a single
act code okay to preserve that because
if we didn't if we had distinct act
codes for example being posted to the
web bulletin board any coercer who sees
the web bulletin board and the code
sheet can obviously deduce what what was
voted but here we can actually because
we got the plateau vaati randomization
we can actually reintroduce distinct
that should say confirmation codes I
guess yeah ok so again skipping over it
quickly we have a nice distributed
construction of a bulletin board which I
won't go through of course we have to
print these things that's so the
underlying printing might look like this
typically so again we have a randomized
candidate or in the usual fashion a
middle bit where the voter puts their
marks and then we have some confirmation
codes in the third column right so this
third column is kind of new and in
practice what I was thinking about was
some kind of way of implementing this
idea where we actually have the codes or
initially concealed say under a scratch
trip or with invisible ink or something
ok so voter gets a thing like this takes
it off to the the booth makes a mark
destroys the left-hand part again and
now takes this and they should be
instructed to leave the scratch strips
intact I hope to this point okay so they
take it back again to the election
officials this is scanned submitted the
web bulletin board and the idea is that
again so threshold set of Trustee you
should register this in the pretty good
democracy fashion and return the
appropriate confirmation code okay and
once the code has reached the there you
go
the polling station then the scratch
trip the appropriate scratch trip is
scratched off and we hope that the codes
will match and so that gives the voter
and observers some sort of stronger
assurance that in fact the vote the vote
has been already correctly registered on
the web bulletin board and so the idea
would be well I'll skip over that but
basically a copy for example photocopy
could be made of that which the vertical
now walk away with okay so i don't think
i need to do well you can see if we set
this up right it essentially meshes with
pretty good democracy you can use the
same mechanisms as as as petawatt a
sorry okay one interesting point is that
if you think about it if you're familiar
with integrity to you can see how
there's something scan Tegrity two ish
potentially emerging here but I guess I
better skip on that okay so I'm pretty
much at the end so hopefully that's
given you a very quick skate over the
sort of developments eight years of
development of Parvati so future work
well we want more rigorous proofs of the
cryptographic core of the scheme against
you know suitably defined properties
even pinning those properties down as I
say is is delicate in itself but we'd
also like to do a broader analysis of
the system which you know includes the
procedures and the human being is not
just the sort of cryptographic core of
the scheme that's an interesting
challenge too we've made a start on it
but I think that's a little quite a long
way to go with that we want to offer see
to do more trials deployments some of
you aware we've currently been working
with people like Roland at the back with
folks in victoria state in australia to
look at adapting it for use there I
personal a little nervous about this it
seems like we jumped into the deep end
because they have a phenomenally
complicated voting system there and well
it's not entirely clear the Puerto vote
is in fact the most suitable system to
try there but you know that's another
discussion point will certainly look at
everlasting privacy I'm talking to her
on Van de Graaff and people in damn
start week this is actually probably
fairly straightforward to do justice
kind of put an everlasting privacy back
end on to Parvati there are lots of
issues I mean everybody writes a paper
in this topic says we assume the
existence of a secure web bulletin board
to my knowledge nobody has really looked
seriously about how we actually
implement that maybe you know something
but they're being a few attempts but I
don't think any of them really quite
achieve it it may be that auditorium
constitutes a useful at least building
block in there and just a little joke
just to show i like i like names I'd
love to come up with a quantum version
of this whole thing and we call it quite
a teleporter that's okay so we're pretty
much at the end what are some of the
issues here well and I think it's fair
to say we have quite a few potential
candidates now really trustworthy
auditable systems they exist but to date
very little deployment has happened they
both mainly just sort of this tin the
laboratory so far why is that that's an
interesting question that seems to be
quite a lot of resistance to these
things people don't like the
cryptography don't understand the
cryptography and so forth can we
overcome those hurdles how best do we
overcome them I think are interesting
issues skip that one yes I didn't I
thought I was going to have five minutes
draw a conclusion to itinerary I that's
probably pretty much the conclusions
okay so I'd like to just thank various
people have helped in the evolution of
fertility and while the evolution of
that the subject in general should also
thank the funding agency in Luxembourg
and I think I can stop there no thank
you
hmm total toys use whatever you
mentioned Independent Order drops that
will do they have to be independent
candidates can concede elections so if I
bought more ok so the monarchist
candidate concedes I should be fairly
happy and it's fairly easy to have the
coke the bells counted by a democrat or
republican and one occurs in the
Communists only the same room oh so
depends what you mean by they won't have
to be independent from parties necessary
I will make sure that are you installing
yes sorry i meant you you would have a
bunch who would be independent from each
other but they may they may well be
associated with the parties or you know
the wood versus the women's electoral
league or something and things like this
so they don't necessary have to be
individually independent from parties
but there would be a bunch of them which
would be mutually distrustful and here's
what i was trying to say yeah and other
women in picking archaeology become
remarkably good at continuing documents
but across a cut even a straight cut
cause a mistake by from the archaeology
you better have a nine millimeter of
extra between the part you throw away in
the parking key yes yes there are
forensic sort of issues threats there if
we're not careful i mean one of the nice
potentially nice countermeasures to this
issue of well rather than enforcing the
destruction left hand side one
possibility is to have lots of decoy
left hand sides so lying around so in
that case it that's an alternative way
you don't so much hide or destroy the
information has mask it by potentially
spurious it will separate and you
especially the link in the separation
strict had better be returned desert to
the voting stinkin and destroyed under
control that maybe you doin ere flame
yeah yes alright so there are indeed
issues like that here so this decoy
strip idea is nice but if you don't take
care you know about this forensic
matching issue then it doesn't
necessarily help you so yeah there are
issues are i mean there's a whole bunch
of issues about how to counter threats
of
retention of the left-hand side but
well I do a couple things that can came
up for me one we're talking about how
print of arcade with codes sort of
converges with scintigraphy to the salts
that potentially and when I was looking
at it thinking of the scratch-offs trip
and the burden of giving the
scratch-offs trip to a voter and say
don't sweat it Oh difficult but don't
scratch the itch the invisible ink trick
we worked nicely there are as voters
don't normally carry around invisible
ink revealing pets yes okay that's true
because done with invisible ink perhaps
that could be revealed by the
appropriate people and appropriate time
meaning best with it because it's
visible products that's just extra space
there yeah now that's a that's a good
point yeah okay we don't allow virtus go
into the booth with coins in their
pockets oh yeah yeah they've done nails
no no thatthat's that's a good point
yeah yeah I mean I could have perhaps
elaborate on that ski integrity analogy
but time permitting but maybe there are
other questions before what we do look I
another question that might you you
might have some inside out right and
that's that one thing that occurs to me
that you really want for for pretty
volatile permutations and
the ballot printing all right is we have
homework encryption functions where the
function is edition and we haven't
whether a function is multiplication hmm
would be useful here if we had one where
the basic operation was a permutation
and then perfectly combined the
ciphertext to get a result in
communication do you have any thoughts
into whether or not that could be done
sounds when they're over a permutation
yeah from you just eat be very useful so
I'm not aware of any right you are mine
mm-hmm that's nice basic where this is a
research yeah exactly strikes me to be a
high-risk research proposal hopefully
not that high risk it seems like it's
one idea that there's there's no reason
the fundamental reason wins but one that
doesn't fully on the more forget
multiple operations yes once
inauguration about every day yeah that
would be cool i mean i've wondered about
that but I've not found out every time
you write down this major station majors
just dishes and vacations yeah a little
painful but I guess I'm doable sure
they're even matrix multiplications
just a relatively clean homework
encryption systems it was nice away
detection so hmm orientations I would
optimistically think there might be some
nice clean way of doing that yeah
yeah we're very happy to talk more about
that yeah I have looked around a bit I
spoke to ryan at one point of office he
couldn't we appointed me at poly at that
point which obviously doesn't really get
you my any closer yeah
if there are no people who might be good
the sort of thing but I think we have in
this room maybe some people that's cool
very happy to discuss that fully further
questions
