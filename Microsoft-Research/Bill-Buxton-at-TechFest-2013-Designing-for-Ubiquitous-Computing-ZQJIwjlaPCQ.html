principal research program manager here
at Microsoft Research and behalf of the
whole organization I would like to thank
you for taking the time to be here with
us today I have the pleasure of
introducing your final session of the
day someone that I am extremely pleased
to call a colleague and a friend and it
is very hard to explain in such a short
intro the passion and dynamic
personality of Bill Buxton and I'll tell
you a little story about Bill that
actually comes from this morning when we
were trying to come up with kind of a
theme for his intro because I said bill
we can't just do the standard bio for
you that just won't do and I said what
do you want to focus on and bill said
without hesitation we're in the land of
Jimi Hendrix let's go with are you
experienced as a team and I said okay we
can do that and so in the spirit of that
I'm not gonna take you through the usual
bio information if you know and then
Bill found himself in Toronto in the
winter of 1987 working on computers
because you can find that information
about his illustrious career and has
many contributions to art and science
well on the Internet so what I am going
to focus on are some experiences that
you might not know about Bill or be able
to find other places that I think really
will give you some idea of who this man
is and also should inform some of the
things he's gonna talk to you about
today first of all he's a very
accomplished road cyclist which is one
of my favorite things about Bill that's
also my sport he's also an international
mountaineer the backcountry skier as a
matter of fact he's one of those
backcountry skiers that doesn't like ski
lifts he says you have to earn your
turns by hiking to the top and that's
very bill he's a proud Canadian you know
he also has 20 years of experience in
rock and roll as both a saxophonist and
a synthesizer player and on that point
one of the interesting things that I
will point out about Bill in his career
is that he was one of the first folks to
develop the whole notion of capacitive
touch which the original work was done
in 1984 at the University of Toronto and
was based on trying to build a drum to
drive his synthesizer and they actually
published that work in 1985 which was
the first mention of capacitive touch as
a mechanism in the computer science
literature he also wanted me to point
out that while that work was done in
1984 that Mark Zuckerberg was born that
year
so think about that for a minute but
another thing bill wanted me to mention
because it's his proudest moment at
Microsoft is that he had a font the
Buxton sketch named after him after he
helped one of our business units and
that was something he really wanted me
to mention so without any more
information because I think that tells
you a lot if you don't know bill that
will help you understand who this man is
I will give you the very very very
experienced and varied bill Buxton thank
you so good afternoon and it's a
pleasure to be here by the way
international mountaineer is not the
thing only in the sense here's the class
of how we can all be world-class at
anything is ever friend at climbing
buddy named Barry Blanchard
he says the world's best mountaineer is
the one who's having the most fun and by
that standard any any one of us can be
world-class at what we do you just have
to be having the most fun and getting
the most out of it
and by the way she can kick my butt on a
road bike so I'm a rookie so the topics
ubiquitous computing so let's let's dive
into that a bit and I'm gonna frame
before I go into the depths how I'm
gonna approach things and I know you
came here to have a lecture on
philosophy and that's why I've brought
up Marcel Proust and but in some sense
this is one of the most interesting
quotes that I have about how to think
about research and creativity and design
and the notion is the only to voyage of
discoveries not to go to new places but
to have other eyes and in some ways my
objective in the time we have is to try
and help bring different optics to the
things that we all see day to day
because I think that we live in a world
where people confuse invention with
research and that seeing the world in a
different way and taking what's already
there is actually the key to creativity
and the key it's not having some
brilliant new idea I've never seen that
happen just new ways to see things that
are already there now we're going to go
along this path and there's another bias
I have is I want to be a historian when
I go up and and this is largely driven
by things like William Gibson
this line that we've all heard but the
future is already here it's just not
uniformly distributed in the work this
so-called fast-moving world of high tech
there's solid data from the National
Research Council I summarized it in the
paper called the long nose of innovation
that says that any new idea by the time
it reaches maturity takes at least 20
years and tell me that's fast moving the
mouse took 30 years from the time it was
invented in 65 till it became ubiquitous
in 1995 and and that's despite the fact
the first commercial mouse which was a
rollerball Mouse was released in 1968
the same year that Engelbart give the
the mother of all demos Parc didn't get
one till 73 the Mac came out in 84 and
yet I used one for the first time in 71
but it's things take time
so there's a rule I have is if I can't
what somebody comes up with an idea and
says this is gonna be the great thing in
the next five years if I can't see 15
years of history leading up to what they
just told me then either we haven't done
our homework or we're way over
estimating when it's gonna be mature
according to statistics so my examples
are nearly all going to be things that
you know about as opposed to some fancy
new idea that should give you confidence
not that I have no ideas and so that's
your seat belt the thing about optics
and the thing about history that's
what's going to keep you secure because
every once in a while they may seem to
wander off topic but I will start with a
historical precedent and this is my late
friend Mark Weiser who I worked with
when I was at Xerox PARC and we were
part of a team of his developing this
thing called ubiquitous computing and
and Mark wrote this classic paper in
Scientific American and I came 91 about
ubiquitous computing and I'm not going
to talk a lot about it but I want to
make two points because they're relevant
to a game something you can hang what we
talk about for the rest of the afternoon
about and one is is that ubiquity means
everywhere so that's not the hard term
technology computers digital
technologies are everywhere the harder
one to wrap our minds around this notion
of transparency so what does that mean
because sometimes people say use the
word invisible that's not what it means
it means it's transparent in your
day-to-day work of they play a day life
the technology doesn't intrude simple
example if the dining room table were in
the bathroom it would stand out if it's
in the dining room you don't even notice
it likewise if the toilet was in the
dining room at the table instead of in
the bathroom it would stand out if it's
in the bathroom it doesn't stand out
it's not that you can't see it it's a
question of it is it in an appropriate
place serving an appropriate function
such that it doesn't impede upon the
activities that are normally taking
place in that particular location this
is what my wife calls wearable computing
about were you spell wearable with an H
it's about location now in the notion of
ubiquitous computing at Parc in those
days they really were a bunch of
computer scientists and and or we were
and and the we really we're focusing on
computers in fact on three different
form factors we called live bores these
wall mounted displays slates with pens
Wireless that would network devices and
even these things called Park tabs which
were handheld devices that were wireless
they were actually X servers running
clients that could run on these other
devices and the whole thing was a
wireless network all networked together
and the notion was would be two Z's and
three C's of the board's tens of the
slates and optimal tamal tens of the
tabs are like post-it notes that these
are all going to become really cheap now
tie this because there's a demo that
many of you may have seen outside where
we're using a handheld device with a
whiteboard and you sort of say hey 20
years ago
she's more than 20 years ago it's a long
nose it was a concept it wasn't working
there it takes time it's not about the
concept where the great ideas come is
when the ecosystem is ready to absorb
these things that they're ready for
primetime it's all about timing the
mouse even though it worked at the very
beginning you needed bit map displays
graphics GPUs and so on to to mature and
software applications before you had the
full ecosystem in play
that's interesting a technology and a
doodad or a good idea you'll notice in
fact already with this I did the
industrial design not the final design
but of the park tab that you could hold
the PDA the mobile device in one hand
and I used a trumpet again music is
influencing things trumpet valves and
proportions of trumpet valves so that
the same hand that held it could operate
the three buttons so in fact if there's
three physical buttons but you'd chord
like a trumpet and get the seven
combinations and so you could use that
in your left hand and when you walked up
the live board it was like the Queen who
has this brown ball called the orb and
her scepter in these formal photographs
or ever Buckingham Palace or so a statue
of Queen Victoria and you'll notice he's
sitting on the throne with an orb in the
left hand a sceptre in the right hand
and that was the stylus and the park tab
and there was a picture of Queen
Elizabeth doing this and not Victoria
and and you could work at the board and
this would be a peripheral device and
when you walked away it would take on
its own identity gosh we saw that today
that doesn't make it a bad idea it
doesn't make a plagiarism it says that's
the nature of research it's about
incremental refinement and standing on
the shoulders of those who came before
it's not about something brand new out
of the blue and that's what we do is we
try and take things and refine them and
refine them and find them to the right
over state of research well enough that
you can hand them off that's the job and
I'd say if I was going to say a subtext
to my talk today is one things we have
to do is break our students and our
colleagues and our investors out of this
notion that it's about this out of the
blue invention by these magic people and
black that where the great new ideas
come no it's dogged work and research
research is a fundamental part of
innovation it's not a just invention but
we need different eyes and we want your
Biggers computers and we want things
transparent and so I asked the quality
question what is this and no this isn't
of Rene Marguerite redux so Nate Byars a
basketball does anybody know what this
is
come on somebody's knows that this is
tickets take a stab at it
innovation is all about risk
a basketball okay well that's one answer
isn't it and I'm an academic so I could
say well it all depends on your
perspective so it could be a basketball
it could be a picture of a basketball
and in fact it is that's an NBA
regulation basketball you could use that
in a game it's qualified I think it
might even have NBA certified on it but
it is that's one perspective that's one
set of optics so let's take another set
of optics there's six of these inside of
it
these are inertial sensors they're
strapped on the inside distributed
inside the ball oh the ball has
batteries inside to power the inertial
sensors and it's actually wirelessly
charged that's the charge in Pat
platform it's on there oh and by the way
it's got a 10 meter 90 foot range
because it has Bluetooth transmitter
inside as well and so all the data from
those inertial sensors are transmitted
wirelessly in real time at 6 kilohertz
anybody asking ballplayers here alright
do you know on a three-pointer how many
rpm the ball should be doing when you do
the shot guess what
between 2 &amp;amp; 3 precisely 2.2 2.5 is the
norm ha stats will tell you you do it at
2 just around over 2 Hertz
you're smart likely to go in and out all
other things being equal did you know
what angle you should release the ball
out the optimal angle 48 degrees 48
degrees and if you measure with this
ball the top players there with theta
consistently within plus or minus 2
degrees the ball tells you everything
digged out how hard you're bound but
you're you're dribbling by the way if
you wanted to in good project for
student is you could actually use this
since place of your keyboard so you
could actually send your email by
sending binary by the bounces okay see
that's lateral thinking as opposed to
the lateral pass okay they but the point
I'm getting out here is this a good
example where this is
either a digital appliance or it's a
basketball and answers yes and it's not
what people normally think about and as
a Canadian I'm proud to say that this
they appear to be working on a hockey
puck - I'm not sure what that means -
just tell me how bad my game is but but
there's lots of other things and we
could we could go through all of these
but all I'm saying is you could make
your own list of images of things that
don't look like computers my mother in
her 80s who could never and never would
touch a computer she could work a sewing
machine which was a computer and I
couldn't she I was more incapable of
understanding what I never said how
sewing machines worked I mean how do you
get the thread in and out through the
cloth I mean it's just and how did
program these things she could work
those but she couldn't work a computer
but she was working in a computer she
just didn't know it and all of these
devices are round embedded in the
environment
and I and we all know that but I want to
put this here as a reminder to the
nature this range and the quantity of
gadgets that are digitally enabled that
are starting to populate the ecosystem
both in terms of range of devices and
quantities of any of the devices in that
range because we're going to get to a
place where I say the good news is
there's a growing industry in demand the
bad news is it's going to bury us and
it's going to stifle the market if we
don't do something about it but because
I'm going back as a historian I'll say
there's nothing new here one of the hot
topics people have right now is oh man
we're gonna make do gonna have new kind
of smartwatches what an incredibly great
idea well I happen to collect things for
about 35 years oven collecting things
not to be a collector I never knew was a
collection I just thought I was doing my
research by having reference objects
that I could test and use to learn from
so there's a couple of these this watch
I just happened to have it on
I stole a I don't them all this is the
world's first watch with capacitive
touch sensing and it's an LED watch and
you touch it
and it turns the LED lights on because
you know if they're on all the time the
battery's gonna drain in a day but
that's not just the fact that had
capacity n-- 76 by the way but it's not
just that this is the watch to the best
of my knowledge introduced the notion of
double-click in order to drill down
deeper
so single touch tells me a time a
double-click tells me the date right
this before these things were happening
on mice but if the point is it's just
it's really interesting
who knew why didn't we know right if
you're working the space if you don't
know the history what business do you
why are you doing this you're probably
gonna reinvent the wheel who can afford
that this watch act it's in my briefcase
but I don't have it on I only have two
arms it's the first calculate nor this
is the second generation of the first
calculator watch is from citizen from
1978 from from citizen but engineers the
first cop later watch that came out of
Japan
you notice that already they hadn't
figured out their standardized on the
keypad to enter things and so around the
bezel you have these little buttons that
are indented so you can get the ball tip
your ballpoint pen to type and enter the
numbers and the arithmetic operators and
that's how it operated but there was
this really fascinating thing that comes
out of this as a designer I just love
and I love this watch I love wearing it
because those same indents that are
there for a perfectly practical reason
to get the ballpoint pen so you can
actually operate it because they're too
close together for your big fat finger
they actually give it a jeweled fast
because the faceting the how they
reflect light they give the whole watch
it's like having diamonds around the
bezel except their functional diamonds
and it's it's faster and just watch how
the evolution comes about the control
and how we started to experiment for
these things
um this is my favorite watch this watch
is from 1984 which you've already heard
is the year that Mark Zuckerberg was
born but also the same year that the
first Macintosh came out now this watch
I have here and this watch is really
fascinating because it looks pretty
plain and simple it is a calculator
watch it's a calculator watch has a
small
seedy displays you see the top but
mostly it's just an analog face but to
enter I just do a stroke down to enter a
one and then I do a plus sign to enter
plus and I draw a seven to enter seven
and I draw an equal sign on the crystal
and I now found out that yes children it
is eight so the point I'm getting at is
what why is why am I talking about this
this is a watch from 1984 it cost $99.95
it was mass-produced in 1984 and it had
a capacitive touchscreen on it and it
has character recognition built in it
that works and by the way the watch
still works unlike most of our computers
from 1977 or sorry 1984 but more to the
point compared to the touch devices you
have today how many of them can you
enter data ice-free
write down names and numbers because I
have another watch it's the one beside
it on the top right hand corner on the
slide which was reached the same year
that also had a data bank so you could
enter names and phone numbers 50 of them
count them 50 and when you searched and
did retrieval using character
recognition alphabetic and numeric it
would even do automatic word completion
okay
1984 that is 18 Moore's laws ago that
means the chip in this today would have
250,000 times the compute power a
quarter of a million roundabout and so
instead of breaking our arms patting
ourselves on the back for how genius we
are about making all these new hot
gadgets like smartwatches in this now to
say what the hell have you been doing
for the last 20 odd years actually
nearly 30 and and I don't say that but I
can't say that because that's the long
nose that's the way it is and actually
the most innovative thinking do is you
even cocked a long nose to 15 years from
20 you're a genius you're in business
but the point is if you don't know the
history you don't know how well or badly
you're doing and if you don't have this
you can really say hey with 250 over the
court of a million times more compute
Powermatic and I'd Bluetooth this I
could add memory I could never be a
peripheral my phone it could bind it
could actually tweet without looking I
could write down phone numbers out of
the phone book with well my geezer eyes
are looking at the phone book and
assuming you still have a phone book and
an enter but the point this is stuff to
learn every one of these things teaches
us but this one's really cool too this
is the most beautiful jeweled
it's just lovely designed to
manufactured watch from LG came out in
2009 this is a total smartphone this has
got full-size SIM chip in it Bluetooth
Wi-Fi address book email what else am I
missing here calendar camera and video
conferencing it is the total Dick Tracy
package 2009 so I'm not trying to say
what's going on today isn't interesting
but it becomes actually more interesting
if you drop the hype and view it in
context in the history of things and see
it as a continuum and they can start to
see how we doing and not get dazzled by
this latest to do that but the things
are happening and we can learn from the
history about what's going on and here's
one of things that I think I've learned
I've be tend to have learned and that
you can characterize in some sense the
history of interactive computing in
three phases and because your three
phases each phase is characterized and
delimited by the miracle of its
existence so I'm going to give you three
miracles as well see it's better than
Proust right now the first one is 1975
so let's just say arbitrarily it's with
the Altair computer when that was
released and anybody have one of these
by the way it wasn't cool what's it
amazing
I know and there was no keyboard there's
no display right you got heat this guy
who gets off spends money on blinking
lights and he loves it still Vic yeah
because it was emotional right right
it's it's it's it started something and
from that face things started to get
better we started
keyboards and displays you still had to
save your text buffer every 30 seconds
because the editor was gonna crash how
many people remember that come on give
me a break
you're not that young okay we're all
only 28 right there 39 so but the point
was the miracle was it worked and people
actually buy it and that was the whole
thing
technology dominated the whole stage the
thing was from us as computer scientists
select legend ears and industrial design
now that were still in decimal designers
to computer scientists selector engine
ears we got these things they worked it
we could build businesses around them
and it got better and better and better
it's the functionality started to happen
and then we got to this point where you
you could in fact relied and when you
and when your texture did crash you were
furious interesting right what did that
change when did it change that you
didn't expect it to happen it stopped
happening and when it did happen force
action you were upset it's interesting
right so we get to the end of that phase
that's sort of maturity phase one phase
two happened around 2007 the iPhone to
give it credit is probably the catalyst
that at the tipping point it wasn't the
cause but it was the most iconic example
of that Microsoft Surface which is now
called pixel sense was announced the
same time that brought the same type of
character but it was really interesting
because the functionality didn't change
the character of the interaction changed
and the miracle was it not only worked
it flowed the functionality was
essentially the same the previous
smartphones had touch screens IBM
released a smartphone in 1993 that had
the entire front of the phone as a touch
screen it only two buttons an on/off
switch and a volume control was called
the Simon and you'd used icons it had
all the same properties that sent the
same applications but it wasn't the same
experience this changed everything it
flowed and that's kind of where it's not
kind of that's where we are today and
and that flow and that quality of
experience is what's in a
the proliferation of all these other
gadgets that I've been showing in the
blue slide before and you slide that you
could have produced just as easily as me
but this takes us to the third face and
this is where I want to go and the third
phase is you can't see the computer
there's no gadgets you look through this
window into the information space of the
stuff that's relevant to you and it's
accessible right in front of you with
with nothing intruding I'm not saying
that's the office of the future of the
home of the future it's a metaphoric
image the miracle here is that stuff not
only worked well not only worked and not
only flowed it worked together with the
other things in the ecosystem and that
is as significant of a transition I
would posit if not more to the long-term
health of our industry and the benefit
of our culture and society and our
clients as any of the other stages and I
want to explain to that why and it's
because of the well-known Buxton's
crackerjacks principle okay who here is
old enough or he's unhealthily enough to
remember the tagline the slogan for
Cracker Jacks
the more the more you eat the more you
want alright so as it is with our
appetite for Cracker Jacks because of
surprise inside and the more you eat the
sooner you get the prize that's the
other benefit with our digital devices
the more I get the court is the more I
want to consume the markets based on
that that's what the growth is because
everybody insists on growth but the
problem is if you eat too much you get
full you might even get sick but your
appetite goes because you can't hold
anymore you've you're at capacity and
exactly the same thing happens with
these doodads all these gadgets all
these things that are starting to
proliferate
our technological ecosystem and we will
reach a point of saturation and I'll
explain why this is my scientific so I
am a professor and I so if anybody
doesn't if there's any designers here
and you there's I'm sure this
mathematicians and scientists here can
help you out explain this highly
scientific thing of scientific
visualization that about to show you
this is on the y-axis complexity and
time is on the x-axis and this shows how
the declining complexity of individual
devices through this wonderful thing of
phase to the flow but here's the
crackerjacks thing playing in the red
line the accumulative complexity of a
bunch of simple things still goes up we
do not even though reduce the complexity
and the quality of use of any single
thing the overall complexity of our
environment is continually increasing or
else there's no growth in the market
right and there's this thing called
god's law that says that the number of
brain cells you have how fast they fire
and how much you can remember and how
fast you learn is a constant and by the
way that's a very godlike thing because
the truth is as my age is telling me
they actually go downhill really fast
right now the point is this is that any
of once you get above the human
threshold of frustration or what might
be called the complexity barrier that
the functionality and the things no
longer have value you're full like you
ate too many Cracker Jacks and that's
the challenge how do we avoid that
problem and the and I'd argue is
precisely by stop focusing on the
individual devices as if they're islands
it's no longer about the device Phase
three absolutely depends on phase one it
has to work and it has to flow but
that's no longer sufficient going
forward I would argue in how we
conceptualize our products and services
if we want to sustain the growth
and the and the health of our industry
and the benefit to our customers whoever
they may be a classic example this
literally is a picture of the remote
controls in my living room on the coffee
table any one of them I can explain to
you with no problem
there is nobody my family who can
explain how to turn on the VCR and
connect it to the projector I mean it's
a you have no idea how many I could be
in Beijing and get a phone call from my
wife who's trying to watch a movie which
is got friends at the cabin right I'm
not joking
thank God for Skype if you can work it
but you can work it that's the good
thing right
so so here you go and you say well
alright let's how do we avoid this if we
anticipate it soon enough before we hit
the turning point we can fix this and so
there's two rules that I think that we
can apply to everything we do going
forward to help do that and the first
rule is the foundation rule every new
product and service must provide great
experience and excellent value that is
it works and it flows it meets the
criteria of the first and second phases
of of interactive computing but that in
itself is not sufficient to green-light
the project that's not good enough if we
want to go in the long term the second
rule is but each of them us also reduce
the complexity and increase the value of
all of the others in the ecosystem
things must work together that is to say
if I add something it not only has to
increase the value of all the things I
already have it has to reduce the
complexity of all the things I already
have and furthermore all the things I
already have have to reduce the
complexity of the thing I just bought
which already in itself had great value
and reduced the complexity okay I might
be losing you because this sounds like
having your cake and eating it too it
shouldn't be possible so can it be can I
give you an existence proof
and if I take go back to the seatbelt
right the futures already here it's just
not uniformly distributed if I can't
give you some examples the show where
you've already benefited from un'ytu
subscribed but because of optics you may
not have noticed it then I should shut
up and go home refund your money but I'm
not gonna do that I'm gonna give you an
example here it is
that's not my actual car but to say
model year and color of my car it's a
Ford Escape
that's not my actual phone but it is the
phone I use now individually each of
these things have value they perform the
functions well the well designed and
they're competitive but what happens
when you bring them together some really
interesting things happen what I'm
driving to my car and I have my phone in
my car
question please somebody answer this one
where is the phone it's in the car
that's not the right answer anywhere
else no it's not where's the phone
that's getting better it is the car but
not quite I think the only the one good
answers yes or everywhere or who cares
it's not about the phone those are three
answers I like although you got you got
a good that was a good one just it's it
is the car the point is this think about
it for a moment technologically speaking
when you're in the car driving if you've
got sync in your car or whatever you use
in your car the only things being used
in the handset are the simchah p-- the
bluetooth chip the battery and a little
bit of logic the speech recognition the
microphone the speaker the address-book
are in the car and by bringing these two
things together you have the synergistic
thing that happens and they they're
unified but it's even more than that
that's just
technological sense who can tell me the
name of the interaction language that
people will tell you is the interaction
language used in Windows mobile phones
I'll accept the old name if you want ok
Metro or modern alright I would put to
you if you're using Metro or modern
while you're driving your car you should
lose your driver's license in fact you
can't you you should you don't need to
when you're in the car not only does the
underlying hardware change 90% of it
changes but the entire interaction
language changes from touch and eyes
which are the dominant human through
here with respective channels you use
and working with modern to speech in and
speech out period ice-free in hands-free
as it should be so we've had a 100
percent change interaction language and
a 90 percent change in the hardware
while I'm driving so now watch what
happens I parked the car I'm still
talking to my son on the car I pick up
the phone the handset as the car shut
down I walk away and I keep talking and
nobody notices the miracle the miracle
that happened in the course of that
conversation and that transaction 100%
of the UI changed because it's now back
to Metro or more modern and a hundred
percent of the phone is in my hands and
you didn't notice it why because it's
not about the phone it's not about the
technology it's about the conversation
it's seamlessly transition the hardware
software and the interaction language
and we don't even notice because it's so
well done it's like plumbing you
shouldn't notice it except when it's
broken and same with this it's seamless
it's elegant it's beautiful and it puts
a smile on my face every time I
encounter it but it reduces complexity
increases value when I bring the two
things together compared to a fuddy
we're working independently in the same
context does that QED proof
at least one one counterexample doesn't
make a proof but it's a good start I
want to talk about the mechanisms that
online here that are essential to say
about the qualities that are going on
what's going on here what we saw with
that car example on the phone is what I
said would say at the technological
level is an example of seamless
aggregation when I bring the phone
together with the car into a new entity
with new properties and disaggregation
as I move apart and that aggregation and
disaggregation take place seamlessly you
know that inconsistency of Technology
gives me consistency of experience in
terms of quality of what I'm doing
there's my intention but at the
functionality level the service for me
there's something else going on there
which is be what I call it with
characterizes graceful augmentation and
degradation of capability these are
separate one sort of for the second is
from the human perspective the upper
one's more for the technological
perspective the bottom has got to do
with intention the upper row in terms of
facilitating platform now what's
interesting is that when we do this you
might assume that aggregation and
augmentation correlate strongly so I
bring things together - I got more
things so I get more more I've augmented
the capabilities and you could say
absolutely when I bring the phone
together with the car I've seriously
augmented the speech capabilities
recognition and synthesis capabilities
of my phone and likewise when I get out
of the car I've clearly degraded the
quality of the speech recognition in
today's technology they they're
different but there's also things
happening in these other directions
because
like when I'm driving with the speech I
cannot play solitaire right by speech
there's lots of things on the phone that
it's capable of doing that I can't use
rightly so while I'm driving so I've
actually in aggregation in this case in
the car example I've augmented parts but
I've degraded other parts and conversely
when I get out of the car and a return
to Metro
I'm degrading some of the speech other
things that are car specific context
specific but I've augmented capabilities
that I they're appropriate when I'm not
driving the car and I have eyes and
touch and the thing about this is I
don't notice this and I don't miss the
stuff that's gone if it's well designed
because you know by the context how to
do the appropriate triage what to
amplify and what to attenuate if you
will and how to do that technologically
and what I'd like to say here is that
these things here are transitions
they're not States right there this
remember I talking about flow the flow
now goes meta and it's not about the
flow within the device but the flow
within the relationship and the change
in social relationship among the devices
and this has to be done by design and
the sum of the qualities that have to
drive the aesthetic and the design in
the attention detail technologically and
just design wise are here in terms of
the grace seamlessness in gracefulness
and all that of course presumes
reduction in complexity and non
intrusion so I can focus on my primary
task this is now you can sort of say
well this is kind of obvious but I'll
say no it's not if any of you've worked
in designing user interfaces and stuff
like that you will have encountered
places where you've gone and you've got
the new design and somebody's done
screenshots of the new interface on the
wall arrows showing how this screenshot
goes to here and this button takes you
there and so on and so forth I'll
explain why I'm pull this out by
making the worst joke that's my favorite
joke I ever made up
what do transitions and Canada have in
common
pardon miss that but I sure nobody knows
her they're pretty close here's the
opposite here's my answer
they're both dominated by the states I
almost got kicked out of a conference
for saying that but they thought I was
American it was a usability
professionals Association they thought
it was very inappropriate that I was
making jokes of Canadians expense but
they didn't realize but it was in Austin
Texas that I was actually Canadian I was
I was right ragging on the Americans but
that's I just thought it was funny that
people were supposed to be designing
systems have so little sense of humor or
so anal-retentive that they can't play
with ideas but anyhow it's it's
fascinating it's we live in a rich
varied world but the point I want to say
is this it's a serious point that
historically our tradition is you're
anchored at your computer to work and
the context physical social mostly
doesn't change as we have we're mobile
devices and transitory like we saw in
the car
even in the middle of a conversation in
the middle of a transaction all of those
parameters of context social spatial
whatever you want can change in the
midst and the system has to adapt and
change degrade aggregate disaggregate
seamlessly to make those and so my view
is this this is what happened for flow
by the way the people started to spend
as much attention to the detail of the
transitions as they did to the that the
endpoints the states at the endpoints of
those transitions and it's exactly the
same thing here as we have these
transitions in terms of these devices
coming together coming apart it's
critical that they be appropriately
designed and as much attention to detail
as the landing places in the places
departure and this is stuff that doesn't
photograph well it doesn't appear in
magazines it's time to be as obvious as
you got this font wrong for this
particular interaction or design
language but the feeling is way more
important than the visuals my repent
spend way too much time on the ocular
centric and not enough on the gestural
and that that visceral part of the body
language so we come back to the car
example I sort of say well let's extend
the example why single out the car why
not have my Canon EOS 5d hook up my
phone if I've got spent the money
because that's not a camera by the way
that's a highly capable computer that
happens to have light in and pixels out
and it's got more signal processing in
the space shuttle hat so when I have it
beside my phone why can't it pair as
seamlessly to my phone as could my car
so that when I take a picture of my SLR
but I can control depth of field and all
these things it goes immediately there
and I can send it off to Instagram why
wouldn't that be possible
right I mean all I have to do to change
a relationship here with a person has
come this close and do this he knows
that this is weird but at least he knows
I was there but if I caught this
computer and wrapped my arms around it
has no idea there's being molested right
and and the point and just getting a de
said if you go to the washrooms here and
wave your hand in front of the paper
towel dispenser it will respond to you
but your computer won't unless it's
empty right but but dead batteries are
in computers do but the point of getting
that is that there's all these cues
about location proximity that can really
affect how we do these things but the
fact is the complexity of getting my
images from there to my phone would be a
lot easier if my phone could couple to
my camera as seamlessly as a couple to
my car another example I take my surface
RT it doesn't have a simcha pin it why
should I need one I've got one in my
phone if I bring them close together the
fact
is right now I can and I do use that I
can connect them by Wi-Fi so it can
actually get off on the 4G network
but most people don't know how to do
that and by the way you're charged
double the connection the the data
charges at least if you do that and some
carriers won't allow you to do it but
why but isn't that weird you can have
your car connected to your four SMSing
and other things to your phone and the
nobody cares in terms of the carriers
but when you have your laptop they
charge you through the nose and it's
really hard to connect so what how does
that make sense
but but would it make a difference
you've now to reduce the complexity of
doing that you now only need one you
don't need another charge another card
another bill to pay it's a unification
things are simpler but I bring our
example up not to complain but to point
out that it's not just about the
hardware it's not just about the
software the topics what we need to do
here it also involves redesigning the
business models and redesigning the
partners and redesigning not just the
relationships amongst the devices but we
negotiating and rethinking who are your
partners and what are your relationships
in terms of business and as we move into
the society of appliances it's not a
technological play it's a social
cultural play who are your partners how
do you work how do you work together how
do you join because the society of
appliances live within the Society of
people and so let's go on further and
give you another example of how this
from the business and the whole part of
this and business technology in design
how these things fit together bus
shelter big Nike ad on it so I walk up
to the Nike ad and they pull up my phone
and I point it at the ad and I click a
button and it sends a cross and up pops
a route map that gives me all the
information relevant centered on that
particular little corner where I did it
at that bus shelter so I can get that
stuff I can use the touchscreen on my
phone to control the interface on the
screen or my voice just as I would with
a touchpad on my laptop to the screen on
my laptop because quite frankly why
would I use the dinky little screen here
when Nikes gonna offer me this great
big honkin display the get let's me see
the map in its entirety it's way better
and then I can just pull it back and
hear the information I wanted and to
leave leaving nothing behind there that
I that was private and having nothing
that's a malicious on my phone in
complete security interesting by the way
that's exactly the same scenario but
just with different costumes on that we
saw in the demonstrations with the
office thing with the phone coming up
now I want to think about this for
perspective this example shows how this
notion society of appliances and
ubiquitous computing fundamentally
changes advertising online right up till
now advertising online has been really
annoying pop-up ads on top of the
applications which you put up with
because you get stuff for free the
services for free what this does is
completely reverse the roles I have a
pop-up ad sorry I have a pop-up
application on the ad the advertiser
gives me real value they get value
because you notice I've put a Nike want
a water marked Nike swoosh in the middle
and the foveal cone of vision quiet
advertising in the map so Nike gets
their imprint they it's all monitored
and all of a sudden you change
everything because it's really hard to
compete for market share and advertising
on browsers on desktops but this is open
turf but it comes back to who you're
partners now who does the backhand who
does the network's who surfs up the ads
who monitors the data who if they're if
you're doing transactions like buying
things back who does the accountant
acceptor that how does that happen
and I suggest if you're an online
advertising you don't normally think
about outdoor advertising companies as
you're really important partner going
forward you know what is said about
these things change because it's where
things happen every place you see a
poster or a sign paper or otherwise it
is going to be an interactive display in
the next few years and the question is
can you connect to it can you not what
are the nature the transactions how do
you do it how do you make it seamless
how do you
trustworthy secure and have value for
all parties concerned and who needs to
be your partner to make that happen and
that's just one example but it starts to
bring this thing we used to realize
we've got to get the experience right
we've got to get the technology right
and we have to get the business right
and as we move forward it's not enough
like it wasn't phase 1 to primarily just
focus on the technology we need at the
table in the discussions from day one
business experience design and
technology at the table to drive it
because these three competencies are
essential to get it right to make it
flow in the society appliances at the
same standard that we saw starting in
2007 with the flow on the individual
devices now Microsoft example we're
doing stuff around this besides the car
you could see that smart glass starts to
fit into into the pattern of going down
this path it's just one but I'm trying
to sell a concept not a company not a
product this is stuff we work on here
because that's our job within research
but what I will say is that no matter
who within our industry of technology
and I wrote this out because it's really
important get this right that in the
future the quality of experience will be
determined by how products work together
in concert with the rest of the
ecosystem not just by the quality of
experience of any product on its own no
matter how good that experience is and
that is the challenge for the future
growth in the future value to actually
let us get on with their lives and the
quality of life the quality experience
in our business life or home life or
educational life and and and if we get
it right it's great and the kind of
exercises do a mood board like this pull
these things up and then start saying
for every one of these things
what couplings could you make let's say
there's a gas pump there why is that
there because the gas pump is a computer
where the display is liquid
but it has an LCD but when I go in my
car which is also digital and pull up
the gas pump when I fill up with gas why
isn't that display giving me a diagnosis
to tell you your tires are low all this
other stuff and by the way why doesn't
fill up my mp3 player at the same time
it fills up the gas tank and give you
that opportunity because the gas pump is
just a kiosk that but it knows it's a
gas pump it knows where it is and knows
you have a car and it has your credit
card already I'm not saying this is what
should be I'm just saying okay possible
business opportunity what happens we are
talking about the camera but all of this
heart rate and other stuff I'm your
jawbone the the earpiece why can't that
hook immediately up through bluetooth
through the same channel to my digital
SLR that also is a video camera so I can
use it to narrate the video and use that
as my microphone or you can go through
this I actually don't want anybody
messing in my avalanche beacon which is
the top left-hand tomb because my life
depends on that but but already the
refrigerator think about that for a
minute the refrigerator is the most
important information appliance in your
home you can leave a note for your kids
your wife that's where you put it all
the stuff that's important that that's
way before Facebook when you post stuff
up so everybody can see the pictures
report cards all that sort of stuff
unless I'm just dating myself but
colleagues at Cambridge our ms our
Cambridge did approached me a few years
ago where they just did simple thing
they mounted a slate on the fridge where
you could text to the fridge as opposed
to a person so now you can just text to
your kitchen to the fridge just like hey
I'm gonna be late for dinner but I bring
at home I'm bringing home takeout or the
first person home can you turn on the
oven right you could text to a location
the technology doesn't change it's just
how things are integrated you can start
to change these relationships but these
working with these pairings is just
really really interesting but ultimately
you don't just close on this and then we
can takes to have some time for
questions is this it's it's exactly what
this theme is all about connecting the
dots where the dots are the devices
through the needs the services of the
context to the players the people
they're always in this amorphous
ever-changing network that we that
passes for our lives
and how does the thing how do things
adapt in such a way that the technology
recedes and let's just quality of our
work our daily life and our play a day
life and our family a day life actually
improve because the technologies we make
now it seems to me that the closing
counted say is this face one was by God
it works we can sell it that was the
miracle the reason why I feel so
strongly about phase three is this now
that we can build anything what should
we build what and why and that's a value
statement because to answer that you
have to say what is my value system like
what is important because we actually
can do pretty much anything now and I
just say most of our technological
training has not equipped us to answer
that question but as citizens and as
humans it has and that's where design
and social sciences can actually come
and contribute as full-fledged members
of the team to help us make the best
answers or at least approaches to these
questions that fuss that are possible
we're just human we don't have to get it
right but it's our own fault if we don't
try so thank you very much have you
happy to take questions
