so panthea is going to tell us a story a
very local story about an example a
really great example about their work in
astatula the story starts in New York
but it's going to take us back to around
the world thanks Panthea so I didn't
realize the three words I supposed to
give head to relate to my story so
they're probably less relevant um huh
you want stand over can you see me great
um so we're at this conference we've
made great strides in open government in
civic technology in data-driven
policymaking I think folks here have
made significant contributions in this
field but as we know many people oh
thank you but as we know many people
even here you know right here in New
York often live under the radar live off
the grid and the issues of access go
beyond just digital divide as a designer
working on governance and development
issues fields where economists often eat
anthropologists for lunch this is
something that I've been thinking about
a lot lately and in the era of big data
if McKenzie says so it must be true as
we become increasingly reliant on
capital d data I'm thinking about what
might exist in the negative space who
are we not capturing in our data sets
and how might we serve them so a few
months ago I met a young woman from bini
um I will call her fought to that's not
her real name she was adopted by an
American preacher who had gone to Benin
and had brought her back her family had
been really excited she finally had a
chance at the American dream so she
moved in with her new father and mother
in Queens and she felt very taken care
of she was very happy to be here and
they started her on English lessons and
she was going to be able to enroll in
school something that had been a
longtime dream
her but even at the outset some things
seemed strange so whenever they left the
house her mother would hold her by the
wrist keeping a firm grip and she said
that was to keep her safe she was not
allowed to have any possessions other
than her clothing and all her materials
were regularly searched for any
particularly any information she might
have any pamphlets or any materials and
if those were found they were
confiscated um she started working at a
school that the family owned in
Manhattan working really long hours and
when she asked about her own education
something that had been promised she was
told that she was being ungrateful and
that she should stop asking um at first
you thought these were more just u.s.
customs you know maybe something that
she would have to get used to but then
things started getting worse she the
preacher started doing bad things to her
at night things that she still struggles
to talk about today and sorry and
so her visa expired her visa expired and
she wasn't allowed to get anyone she
wasn't allowed to get a new one and so
she was an undocumented alien now and
something that she was told repeatedly
that the u.s. government does not look
on kindly yea sorry I'm something that
the u.s. government doesn't look upon
currently so thought too was a victim of
human trafficking and she's not alone
there is that there's 300,000 2
1,000,000 traffic persons here in the
united states new york city itself is a
hub of human trafficking and throughout
her trafficking ordeal which lasted
three years thought you tried to get out
several times she was scared she was
confused she didn't know what she could
do and who she could turn it to you um
and her just I've been portrayed so you
know who could she trust again and so
the question for our organization and
we're working with an amazing victims
assistance organization here in New York
was how do we reach someone like fatou
and how do we help someone like her and
the answers aren't always so clear the
same tools that we use to make our lives
easier day to day often actually have
unintended consequences for I'm someone
in her position so services like Hopstop
like Google Maps help us get to meetings
on time help us plan our commutes
planner days fox news traffickers use
these tools to make sure that she would
get home at exactly the time she was
supposed to from work otherwise there
would be consequences we're accustomed
to cheap and easy communication around
the world you know being in touch with
family and friends has never been eat
easier for faulty this caused a lot of
stress her family in Baneen wondered why
she never wanted to talk to them we want
to see you they would say it doesn't
cost a lot of money but she always had
to make excuses for why she didn't want
to talk and why despite the ease of
connection in the modern
day she wanted instead to disconnect and
while many of us are working on
streamlining and improving civic service
delivery standardizing data formats
making sure they're accessible across
platforms and agencies the thought of
linked data was terrifying to thought
you as an undocumented person she
thought that one look at her papers and
any of her papers would mean that it was
all over would she go to jail would you
be sent back home disgraced and so this
meant that whether she when she was sick
she wouldn't go to the doctor when she
saw a police officer on the street she
would cross to the other side and you
know as we try and make her world more
connected and efficient this was
actually something that was terrifying
to someone in her position penso oh
sorry goodnight um so to reach someone
like faccia we needed to think of other
ways other approaches and you know we
needed things that were accessible
trusted appropriate and relevant
attributes not unlike what we'd use to
describe services that we ourselves want
to use and so it's a long story of how
we got here and I'd be happy to talk
about that further but we settled on
check cashing shops um now you know
despite what we might think about check
cashing shops and Bing see what I did
there thanks you know users of being
think of them in certain way good job I
love of course um um and so and and so
for but for people for people like foie
to check cashing shops are accessible
across all the traffic persons that we
talked to these were actually a place
that they could go to even when their
movements were tightly controlled
traffickers realized that they needed to
let their victim the people that they
controlled send money home to their
families or to pay off their debts
sometimes their debts where as a result
of coming to the u.s. and they were
trusted these were actually community
during hubs we spent a lot of time there
watching people and you know a lot of
financial institutions don't look too
kindly upon certain segments of the
population and they will let them know
that this was a place where they were
welcomed service was good to them and so
people hung out here so that was the
platform we decided to use but what
about the tool it was going to have to
be appropriate so many outreach
materials in many campaigns for victims
of trafficking use images of chains sad
people battered women bruised women but
you know one woman told us my life is
sad enough I don't want sad pictures I
want facts I want words tell me what my
rights are so images like this did not
go over very well and we you know we
spent a lot of time talking to people
and we realized that the term
trafficking actually didn't register you
know trafficking was something that
happened to other people it was
something that happened to stupid people
and you know even if the term did
register for them and and so you know we
spent more time with folks trying to
test different words different language
often in sort of a mad lib style and we
found out what did register which was
passports most trafficked persons had
had their passports taken from them and
it was a means of control and it was
something that they obviously wanted
back more so than getting out of
trafficking and so you know we spent a
fair amount of time sort of in check
cashing shops thinking about what the
places where they would have a bit of
privacy were where they would be able to
interact while someone sort of may have
waited for them by the entry and we saw
you know these little boxes sort of
being used for handing out different
types of materials so we started
prototyping and testing with different
folks and materials that you know we
made ourselves and we started sort of
testing the language the the size and we
developed different cards they can you
know even if your materials are searched
you for example can have metro cards and
you know things that fit and could slip
slide back and so this was a really
exciting program that we worked on here
with safe horizon is the organization
and they're wonderful and so now they're
working with a range of independent of
check cashing shops in a couple of
different boroughs in New York so you
know that's my story I think as humans
we are biased towards looking for
information in places where they're easy
to find and easy to work with so
nowadays that largely means digital and
online or we tend to get information
from familiar sources and people but I
hope we can sort of consider what we
might lose in the process and I think as
many of us are working to build a more
open and connected and efficient world
to think about people like flat ooh and
think about how we might integrate folks
like that into our research and design
and planning processes and better serve
them thank you thank you can Thea
we're actually running out of time and
lunch is here but I think it's if
everyone can I know we have lots of
questions for each person if you can ask
them individually during lunch I'd be
great but thank you so much for all of
the talks in panthea you really brought
it home to New York so thank you for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
