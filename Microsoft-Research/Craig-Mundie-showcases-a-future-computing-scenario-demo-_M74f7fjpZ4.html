explore what a natural user interface
would be like and also to presume what
would happen when the computer begins to
have context to have more memory and to
bring those things forward to improve
the interface so for example let me just
start and and and right since I'm
pursuing zero-carbon research you know I
can start to to write that and it says
okay you know that's probably what
you're doing so just like today it helps
you fill out the names on your on your
emails there's no reason that you know
give an appropriate context it can't you
know anticipate what you want more and
just finish things for you so I'll just
circle that as a gesture to indicate
that i want to that it's correct and
i'll say i want to do a search on that
so I'll go out and basically use the
internet to collect a set of documents
that relate to this or that I've been
accumulating regarding this and of
course at this scale and and resolution
that's not very interesting but i might
say computer organize it for me and you
know we can take the metadata that's
there and cluster these things around
different parameters that might make it
easier for me to navigate you know
clustering around research or
publications that you know that that are
relevant news stories you know
colleagues work so that computer zoom
into research and so here you get a
another map of a lot of these documents
and and I can do I tracking now to
basically just sort of look around and
look at the screen and each time I look
at a different place you know it sort of
pops up one and will end on on this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
