let me show you a see if we've got this
there we go so as han was just saying
you know I i came to Microsoft 21 years
ago to start microsoft research now the
environment that I came out of was a
university environment just like the
environment that you have you know I
came from Carnegie Mellon University and
and really that was where I learned to
do basic research that was the
environment in which I I built my career
and so when I came to Microsoft 21 years
ago I came with the mission of really
creating a basic basic research
organization that was like the
environment that I had at Carnegie
Mellon I really wanted to create the
equivalent of a Carnegie Mellon computer
science department but in the context of
a software company in the context of
company like Microsoft now in those days
21 years ago Microsoft was a very small
company now I know for many of you that
may be hard to believe we had just a few
products we had a few thousand employees
and really it wasn't the kind of company
that you would necessarily think would
want to invest in long term basic
research but the board of directors made
an important decision they decided that
it was important to invest in the future
and invest in the long term and that's
when they came to me and that's when I
came to Microsoft now as I said you
might go was to create the kind of
environment that you have any university
but do it in the context of a company
and in the course of doing that very
early really the beginning of Microsoft
Research i adopted a mission statement
that i thought would lead the
organization you know through its
history to do just out so first and
foremost you see the first left hand
side of their of that slide that's the
first part of the mission statement in
the first part of my car
researches mission statement is to
expand the state of the art in the areas
that we're doing research and that's
really not that different than what you
would be doing if you were doing
research in a university notice there's
nothing about that statement that says
anything about Microsoft what that's
really saying is that if we're going to
do basic research in an area we want to
make sure that we're pushing the state
of the art that we're advancing the
knowledge of mankind in that particular
field or that particular area because if
we're not able to do now then ultimately
I believe that we were not going to be
very valuable to Microsoft we have to be
at the cutting edge now the second part
of the mission statement you see in the
middle there does relate to Microsoft it
says that when we have good ideas when
we have solutions to problems when we
have new technologies we work really
hard to get those into practice and to
get those into use and the course the
best way for us to do that is to work
through our product groups and to get
those ideas and technologies into
Microsoft products because those
products go out to over a billion people
around the world now ultimately the goal
is really that last one and that's to
ensure that Microsoft has a future so
why would a company like Microsoft
invest in basic research when it was
very small it's because it believed it
was going to have a future and it
believed that that investment would help
it realize that future now we've grown
from basically just me you know 20 21
years ago to now having research labs
all around the world in fact more people
work for Microsoft Research outside the
United States then inside the United
States if you look at that map you see
our research labs in redmond washington
Mountain View California New England New
York cambridge england bangalore india
beijing china and you also see a number
of our advanced technology
lives in Egypt in Israel Germany so
really we've grown and we've expanded
over the years and we've just continued
to to move forward as an organization
now I said earlier that you microsoft
made a decision very early in its life
to invest in long-term basic research a
lot of people when they think about
basic research whether in the university
or in a company they look at it and they
say well why do you invest in it it
costs a lot of money it doesn't
necessarily produce immediate results
you know if you're doing research in a
university you're not necessarily
producing products you're not
necessarily producing immediate
financial benefit for anyone so why make
those investments the same thing is true
for for a company like Microsoft there
are three answers that I think people
most often give and while they're true
in a way they're not necessarily the
whole truth some people will say well I
know why you invest in basic research
you're doing it because you want to
create intellectual property you want to
create technologies that are going to go
into your into your products and that's
certainly true I mean Microsoft Research
we create more patents for Microsoft
than any other part of the company our
patents are arguably of more scientific
value in fact the I Triple E has rated
Microsoft's patent portfolios having the
highest scientific value in the field
and the technologies we create have a
huge impact on our project on our
products so that's great but I would
argue that's not the main reason you
invest in basic research but it's
certainly a great benefit another idea
another thing that people suggest is a
reason for investing in basic research
is the second point which is problem
solving we have great people we have
really smart people just as you and the
university have great people it's very
smart people we really are good at
solving problems in fact i just love
solving problems
you come with to me with a problem you
know I love just figuring out what the
issues are trying to find a solution
that's it's a lot of fun I've been
trained to do it I'm pretty good at it
and the people that we hire very good at
it so certainly that's a benefit to a
company like Microsoft and in a
university environment you could say
it's a benefit to the to the society
that you're able to solve problems but
again it's not the the main reason I
think that we do the investment
sometimes people say well okay I know
why you have an investment in basic
research you're a you know you're you're
a early warning system right you you can
see the future because you see what's in
the research labs and so you can tell
the company when there's a new
technology or something coming on the
horizon and we do that but none of those
things I think are really the
fundamental reason why you invest in
basic research they're all incredible
benefits but they're not the fundamental
reason the fundamental reason you invest
in basic research is really for survival
you know if you're a country or a
society you invest in basic research
because you believe it's going to be
important when there's going to be a
problem in the future to have the smart
people and the ideas and the
technologies that allows your society to
survive then of your Bush who helped to
create the National Science Foundation
in the United States he wrote a paper on
this subject people that really argued
that the United States should invest in
fundamental basic research this was
right after World War Two that we should
invest in basic research because if
there's a new war or a famine or a
disease then the country would have the
intellectual resources to survive that
well I think for a company like
Microsoft it's really the same thing you
know if there's a new competitor if
there's a new technology if there's a
change in the business climate then you
really want to have the people and the
technology and the ideas that will let
you change
rapidly when change is necessary that
will let you adapt to a new world when
you have to adapt quickly and I think
it's a statement about the the value
that microsoft research has brought to
Microsoft that Microsoft still exists
today because the Frank reality is that
almost none of the companies that were
Microsoft Spears 21 years ago still
exist they're almost all gone and even
the few that may still be around don't
do the same things anymore they're not
relevant so really it's about survival
and investments in basic research are
about survival whether it's survival for
a society or whether it's survival for a
company now Microsoft Research in its 21
years has had a tremendous impact on the
company many of the pieces of Microsoft
that you think of today originally came
out of Microsoft Research so what became
the digital media division of the
company and now is a important part of
our entertainment &amp;amp; devices business the
xbox and things of that sort our music
business that was something that was
created by me in Microsoft Research we
turned it into a product group and we
spun it out to our product organizations
in 1996 I started the first e-commerce
group in the company all the natural
language and speech technologies in
Windows and Office came out of microsoft
research so we have consistently created
the technologies that have helped to
drive the company forward and create
actually large parts of the company that
you see today you see on the screen just
a few of the products that we've had an
impact on really every product that you
get from Microsoft has had some
influence for microsoft research whether
that's in the technologies that that are
underlie the product whether it's in
some cases the product itself or whether
it's the technologies that are used to
create the product
now I'm going to show you a short video
to show off a very particular technology
that has come out of Microsoft Research
really come out of fundamental basic
research in program analysis and program
generation and that is now having a huge
impact in the most recent version of
microsoft office it's just now being
released so the technology is called
flash fill and I'll let the video speak
for itself I'm cement Galvani from
Microsoft Research Redmond I'm going to
tell you about a new feature in Excel
2013 called flash fill which had its
origins in Microsoft Research suppose
you have a collection of Social Security
numbers that you see in the first column
and you want to format them by inserting
hyphens as you see in the second column
if you have hundreds and thousands of
these rolls then doing it manually would
do very cumbersome a more principled way
to do this would be to write an excel
macro but if you are a non programmer
like most Excel users then you would be
stuck but now you can use the flash to
feature to automate this task by just
the press of control e which is a
shortcut for flash fill the flash will
feature builds over our program
synthesis technology that can generalize
examples into programs so this is the
opposite of program verification
methodology that is used to generate
test cases from programs to expose bugs
in those programs and this has seen
decades of research but now program
synthesis does the rivers it takes test
cases or examples and generates programs
that are consistent with those examples
in fact we generate a huge number of
such programs but we have efficient data
structures and algorithms to compute and
represent such programs then we use the
machine learning technology to rank
these programs we take the highest
ranked program and run it on all the
rows in the spreadsheet to give the user
the output that they desire now in
general it might not be possible to
learn the users intent from just one
example as would be shown by the second
scenario where I have a bunch of medical
billing codes some of which are missing
a right bracket at the end by some of
which have a right bracket suppose my
goal is to clean this data by add
the right bracket wherever it is missing
so if I give one example then flash will
generalizes it into a simplest program
which is to add a right bracket
everywhere maybe this is what the user
wanted but otherwise the user would
observe that rose 62 rotan are all
incorrect and the user can fix any one
of these rows so the moment I fix row
six then flash fill is able to fix other
similar roles accordingly flash will can
also be used to perform complicated
extraction tasks so consider this
worksheet that is lot of customer data
in the first column so suppose my goal
is to extract the constituent elements
all that I have to do is to give an
example in each column and hit control e
flash fill can also synthesized programs
that have limited form of conditionals
and loops as is illustrated by this
scenario where I want to generate an
abbreviation if you want to learn more
about this technology then you can look
at our csem research highlights paper
you can also use this feature yourself
in excel 2013 so what I find really
exciting about flash fill is that this
is really the first time that automatic
program synthesis is being distributed
out in a mass-market product we're
suddenly giving ordinary people the
ability to automatically create
effectively new programs that transform
their data simply by giving a few
examples this is fundamental basic
research being applied in a very simple
and easy-to-use way that anybody can
take advantage of and the consumer
preview of office 2013 is freely
available for download so I suggest if
you're interested in seeing how this
works download it it's just purely magic
to play with it now one of the the big
changes that's been going on in the
field of computer science in the last
few years comes from the fact that we
have built the world's largest database
systems huge data centers we're
collecting enormous amounts of
information and we're providing an
environment and where we're
processors can access that so this this
new world is sometimes referred to as
the world of big data where suddenly you
have not just terabytes of information
available but many many petabytes of
information and it's letting us think
about new ways in which we can solve the
world's problems for example you may
want to collect all the information from
all the hospitals and all the doctors to
try to come up with new understandings
of the way in which the you can provide
a solution for different diseases people
are looking at genetics and they're
saying if we could just collect all the
genetic information from a large
population suddenly we can tackle
diseases like aids or hepatitis C or
malaria that we never had an ability to
do before or suddenly we can attack the
problem of personalized medicine we can
design medicines that work for specific
individuals and know that they're going
to be deadly for other individuals now
one of the projects we have going on in
Microsoft Research in Cambridge is
looking at the problem of of the world's
climate and the world's ecology and
we're using the notion of big data to
tackle that problem we're collecting
information that comes from many
different sources about the world's
climate and making it available for
scientists and researchers around the
world so I'm going to run a short video
to show you that the the name of the
system is called fetch climate I'm a
researcher up Microsoft Research
Cambridge I'm in the computational
ecology and environmental science group
the mission of that group is to carry
out computational science that should
let humanity manage our natural
resources better as part of that
research mission we develop new software
tools predictive models in geographical
information services that should allow
people to carry out that kind of
cutting-edge research more likely today
like
you fetch climate which is an easy fast
way for anyone to extract complex
information about the climate either
just with a few lines of code in a
program or even just through a browser
so here's our browser running fetch
climate i'm in redmond it microsoft
headquarters so i'm going to zoom in on
the area around redmond and i can just
really easily draw a square here to a
populated grid and hit fetch what's
happening is this is a silverlight
application which is communicating with
an agile service that service is looking
over a large number of large data sets
and it's choosing the best date of to
answer the query is then doing a whole
bunch of complex mathematical
calculations and sending the result back
to our application running in the
browser the answer of that query is now
being visualized on top of being mapped
by a dynamic data display which is
another prototype tool that comes from
our group because either interactivity
we hover the mouse over here we can see
for instance that the average
temperature in this place is about 2.8
degrees you can download data so we just
hit download we get a choice of formats
and we can see all the information that
we would need from that query it's got
different times as well so we can do a
query for a fraction of the year or even
a fraction of the day and then we have
the air temperature data itself we have
the provenance so the data source that
was used to supply this information and
we even have an estimate of uncertainty
that uncertainty is something that the
experts find really hard to assign to
data that was a research project in its
own right and yet that's always supplied
every time with a fetch climate query
now we can for the browser version we
can run multiple copies of feta climate
at once and so I'm going to show you a
couple of examples of fetches that I did
earlier so here's one of wind speed over
the eastern US that's the kind of thing
that you might want to look at if you're
a energy company or the government
planning wind farms and in this fetch
I've put a string of locations across
Africa and for each of those locations
I've extracted 60 years worth of
rainfall data and we can just hover over
one of those points and see what's
happening to rainfall and unfortunately
this looks pretty worrying because it
looks like there's been a steady decline
in rainfall over the past 60 years the
kind of thing we probably all seen in
the headlines recently African droughts
and so on so thanks to fetch climate
anyone can get that kind of
information really easily it's live it's
ready go and find it have a go and
please tell us what you think so again
that I think the key point here is that
you know we are now able to provide that
kind of service to anyone to individuals
that want to learn about the world the
earth climate and the areas in which
they live and how the climate has
changed over the last few years over the
last 60 years of the last hundred years
but more importantly to scientists
because this kind of data is actually
very difficult for scientists to
accumulate themselves but we're able to
do that put the information in windows
azure and provide a simple interface for
people to be able to examine and look
out so that's a great application of big
data really helping to solve a problem
that really helps the world now the
theme of this conference is is this
notion of being able compute naturally
and I know a number of you have probably
seen Xbox Kinect and really Xbox the
Kinect part of xbox was really the first
time that real-time 3d computer vision
was made available to ordinary people in
their homes and it really transformed
the way people thought about the way
they interacted with computers now me
and my family were probably not
surprisingly on the beta for Kinect
before it came out publicly and I
remember my two boys at the time my
young boys the time they were like nine
and ten I think and I remember the first
time they played with Kinect and what
was interesting to me and what got me
very excited about the product was the
fact that not only did they enjoy
playing the game using their whole body
to control the game but they actually
had more fun celebrating after they won
the game because when they jumped up and
down their character on the screen jump
dump it down and you could see that they
in their minds had made a connect
between themselves and their own body
and the character on the screen and the
virtual body of that character and that
was very very powerful I knew at that
moment that we were going to have a
tremendous hit now what makes connect
work is really a lot of very exciting
new research in machine learning and
computer vision and that's a connect was
really a great example of Microsoft
researchers working extremely closely
with some of the tremendous people we
have on our product organization to
build a new kind of experience that
really changed people's perceptions of
the relationship between a computer and
a human being the fact that the computer
now had senses like we did it could see
and could interact with us in kind of a
physical way that was new that changed
the way people thought and not just the
way people thought in the consumer
marketplace it changed the way research
is done researchers around the world
have adopted connect as a technology
that they can use to tackle new kinds of
user interface problems now connectives
is one kind of solution to the problem
of how do I interact with the computer
system in that case there's a remote
camera and there's you standing in front
of it and you're gesturing but what if
somehow the camera was part of you or it
was it was on your person and the system
was able to detect simpler personal
actions that you might take well some of
our researchers have been looking into
that problem and created a system called
digits and i'm going to show you that
video digits is a wrist-worn 3d hand
tracker for gestural interactions on the
move now I've mentioned before that you
know microsoft research has had has
grown to be a pretty large organization
we now have over 850 PhD researchers
around the world and we are the number
one publisher of basic research in the
field of computer science
but however big we might be we're still
a tiny fraction of the larger scientific
and research community and one of the
things that has always been part of our
mission and something that I instituted
as part of Microsoft Research in the
very earliest days our efforts to really
reach out and work with the broader
academic community and to support the
creation of new talent new scientists
new researchers in both computer science
but in the broader collection of
sciences so if you if you look at some
of the things that we're doing within
Microsoft Research today you might
actually kind of wonder gosh that that
seems a little a little off the beaten
path we're looking at solutions to to
the problem of personalized medicine
that I mentioned earlier we're working
with researchers in the AIDS community
to find a vaccine for AIDS we're coming
up with new technologies to address the
problem of hospital care and in
management of patients we're looking at
environmental modeling and we're looking
at ways in which we can improve the
purity of water in things like the
Russian River Valley in California we're
also working to make sure that there's
going to be a next generation of
scientists we fund fellowships and
studentships around the world we support
faculty in their research and we have a
vibrant faculty fellowship program that
we support in every region in which we
operate we run the largest PhD
internship program in the world with
over a thousand PhD were interns working
each year in some part of Microsoft
Research so those are really in some
sense you know that's part of the
process that we believe is important
that we have to go through in order to
make sure that there really is going to
continue to be a lot of great new ideas
a lot of great new technologies coming
into not just the field of computer
science but into the engineering and
science fields more
oddly now I I want to come back to the
topic of natural user interfaces one of
the most natural interfaces for people
is human speech and for the last 60
years computer scientists have been
trying to find ways to understand and
recognize human speech now in the
beginning when people first started
tackling this problem they looked at it
largely as a pattern matching problem
and the earliest systems attempted to
take the waveforms that came out of a
speakers speakers voice and match them
up two waveforms that they knew
represented certain words unfortunately
that approach was extremely fragile
partly because everyone speaks
differently but also even a single
speaker will often say the same thing
differently depending on the other words
or the context in which they're speaking
you've probably already noticed me doing
that now in the late 1970s there was a
major change in the way people decided
to do speech recognition this was work
being done at Carnegie Mellon University
and the idea was to use a statistical
modeling technique in this case hidden
Markov models to make the transit to
really be able to take a lot of data
from many speakers and produce more
robust statistical models of speech now
that was a huge improvement and over the
last 30 years speech recognition systems
have become dramatically better than
they used to be they still make a lot of
mistakes but in in limited domains it's
possible
to do very successful speech interfaces
so for example in the United States when
I call my bank I'm talking to a computer
i'm not talking to a person the computer
can amp answer simple questions about my
bank account or if necessary it can
connect me to a real person if i have a
significant issue that I want to discuss
I'm sure you've heard of Apple Siri
product which answers simple questions
Microsoft Kinect has a robust speech
interface that allows you to control the
interface and even allows you to issue
commands in the middle of games still
these systems have a lot of errors and
the error rates for arbitrary speech
have been in the twenty to twenty-five
percent range well a few years ago
researchers at Microsoft Research at the
University of Toronto came together to
develop with another breakthrough in the
field of speech recognition research the
idea that they had was to use a
technology in a way patterned after the
way the human brain works it's called
deep neural networks and to use that to
take in much more data than had
previously been able to be used with the
hidden Markov models and use that to
significantly improve recognition rates
so that one change that particular
breakthrough increased recognition rates
by approximately thirty percent that's a
big deal that's the difference between
going from twenty to twenty-five percent
errors or about one error out of every
four or five words to roughly fifteen
percent or slightly less errors roughly
one out of every seven words or perhaps
even one out of every eight so it's
still not perfect there's still a long
way to go
I I think you can see that we have
already made a significant amount of
additional progress in the recognition
of speech now one of the problems that
we've also been trying to solve for 60
years is machine translation and again
in just the last few years the
combination of statistical techniques
and big data have allowed us to do a
much better job than we previously were
able to do in being able to translate
web pages or other kinds of information
into other languages for example today
being translate which is Microsoft
translation system that comes out of
microsoft research being translate
translate millions of pages a day for
users into their native language it's
extremely heavily used service now if I
want to have what I'm saying be
translated into Chinese we can take the
text that comes from my voice and put
that through a translation system it
really happens in two steps in the first
instance we take the English and we
convert it more or less word by word
into into Chinese text and I think
pretty soon we may see that up on the
screen so what happens is we're
basically taking the English text and
pushing it through the translation
system we then have to reorder that text
in chinese because the word order in
chinese is not the same as the word
order in english to produce something
that begins to resemble something that a
Chinese speaker might say so now we're
taking the things that I'm saying and
we're converting them into Chinese text
now the last step
that I want to be able to take in this
process is to actually speak to you in
Chinese now the key thing there is we've
been able to take a large amount of
information from many Chinese speakers
and produce a text-to-speech system that
takes Chinese text and converts it into
Chinese language and then we've taken an
hour or so of my own voice and we've
used that to modulate the standard text
to speech system so that it would sound
like me so what you see now is the
result of that change I'm speaking in
English and hopefully you'll hear me
speak in Chinese in my own voice
again the results are not perfect there
are in fact quite a few errors jiggle
people move on may come in shooting Jean
screams out fool there's much work to be
done in this area central phone me on
Yavin boonville yah wah but this
technology is very promising you into
the TV show thingy oh sheila and we hope
in a few years that will be able to
break down the language barriers between
people Sean info woman chillin uncle
