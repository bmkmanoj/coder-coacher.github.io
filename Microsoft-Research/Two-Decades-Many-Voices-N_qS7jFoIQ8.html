strongest computing research
organization and computer science is the
world's most important field in terms of
changing our lives microsoft research
has some of the world's greatest
researchers working on all types of
problems from applied through blue sky
problems if you look at the history of
corporations there's always been no
maybe one company that would put money
into basic research in computer science
and right now that one company is
Microsoft basic research is important
believe it or not for the economy for
society and for humanity if you want to
make big advances you need to take big
risks and to basic research is about
risky research it's about stepping out
from the usual frame and trying to do
something different I think it's
remarkable to think that gates and
Myhrvold made this decision to create
Microsoft Research in 1991 when
Microsoft was a tiny company it's
amazingly farsighted Microsoft Research
exemplifies is how a leading-edge fast
moving company can actually succeed in
preserving a high quality and basic
research organization and use it
effectively to deliver products open
collaboration is very important for any
large research organizations because the
kinds of problems that we're trying to
solve they're not solvable by
individuals or individual organizations
they're only sellable by virtual
collaboratory that involved multiple
partners what's important to realize is
that Microsoft while they provide
financial support for the research much
more important as they provide
partnership in any research partnership
comes from
linearity from sharing directions from
consistency of interaction and that's
one thing that microsoft research has
delivered we look forward to the fruits
of that over the next year's our field
moves so quickly that we cannot predict
two or three years out where our
technology will be all I know is that
it's gonna be different from what it
looks like today I think that twenty
years hence microsoft research will be
able to look back on what by then will
be the longest continuous
uninterruptedly greatest research lab in
computing technology the world's ever
seen what I anticipate is that Microsoft
Research is going to remain the greatest
computing research organization in the
world and that's gonna help the world
move the field of computer science
forward it's really impossible to
forecast what's gonna happen and that's
the exciting part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
