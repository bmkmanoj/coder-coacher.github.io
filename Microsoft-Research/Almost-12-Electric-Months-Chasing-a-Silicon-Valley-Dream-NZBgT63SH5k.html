thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm pleased to welcome
HAP Klopp to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series he's here to
discuss his book almost about
entrepreneurship lessons and failures in
the Silicon Valley hat founded the north
face and served as president and CEO for
two decades he has since run numerous
companies and spoken around the world on
adventuring leadership entrepreneurship
and the human side of management he has
appeared on national television and in
several publications including Forbes
and The Wall Street Journal please join
me in giving him a very warm welcome
thank you thank you and I'm glad to be
here I would like to sort of preface my
comments by telling you that my epitaph
if there's ever one written is going to
be often wrong but never in doubt I'm a
classic serial entrepreneur and so all
of my comments kind of come from that
direction as mentioned i founded the
north face right out of business school
after i finished stanford the a lot of
people thought we were crazy we had no
fear of failure we created a whole new
industry there wasn't an industry we
created backpacking by taking materials
from the Vietnam War and applied them to
general camping we took aircraft
aluminum we made tent poles and pack
frames we took parachute cloth we made
sleeping bags tents and funky clothing
and that was a basis of it well I can
tell you that most people thought when
we were talking about this and as I was
leaving school they they thought we were
crazy that nobody would ever buy
backpacking here but as I said it's two
and a half billion dollar company now
I'm no longer involved with it but it's
a the idea may not have been so bad
admittedly you know when I left the
business school i have what i call that
NC to a look no clue at all but we knew
what we wanted to do we really want to
build a great business and so we set
about doing it and and we had no fear
that's the great thing about leaving
school you're not leaving anything
behind you're just starting something as
you go so we
had this attitude that you know we
avoided all the naysayers because we
didn't believe that anything was wrong
we felt if we could build a company that
was maybe 10 million dollars in sales
made a million dollars a year that that
would be a great thing nothing like a
billion-dollar company we didn't really
think about that but I can tell you the
same things apply now that applied then
and I would encourage you to to have the
same attitude which is basically you'd
realize that the next ten years going to
be the best years of your life don't
don't listen to the newspapers don't
listen to the news don't read it on your
your computer because all you hear is
bad news if Jesus were to walk on water
today the reports in the media are going
to be Jesus can't swim because
everything is negative and that's way
it's interpreted and so you have to
avoid that and if you want to be a great
entrepreneur if you want to build a
great business effectively what you have
to do is live with risk you have to live
with uncertainty you have to live with
failure but that's not the worst thing
in the world has Mark Twain said about
vogner music it's not nearly as bad as
it sounds and let me tell you about that
because what if you look around now if
you look at Silicon Valley and look at
the attitude that's there what you find
is a reuni kamar cabool atmosphere that
doesn't have fear takes big chances
attempts to dent the universe it's an
environment which encourages people to
take risk and that risk is what's
differentiating people right now in this
world if you look at it I'll come back
to it later on but the world is in a
malaise if you look at the problems in
global economics China in particular if
you look at the climate change issues
that are happening the number of wars
around the world I mean all those things
can paralyze you but the reality is if
you start a business and drive a
business you're in control those aren't
the things that drive it and what you
see is the attitude that you have and
you see it inculcated here in this
company in this town you certainly see
it in Silicon Valley a little bit in
Boston but you don't see it in Dubuque
you don't see it in a lot of other
places around the country so what you
have to do is recognize that there's
something really neat something unique
that is you that is special that's
actually going to win now most of you
know Steve Jobs obviously Jack Dorsey I
think most people know jack dorsey in
Twitter square Marc Andreessen Netscape
now he has andreessen horowitz max
leviton paypal slide Yelp worked with
Peter Thiel worked with Elon Musk pretty
good crowd you know what's common
amongst all of those people they all
failed and got kicked out of their first
business now anyplace but silicon valley
that would be a blemish on your record
people would be afraid of you they
wouldn't back you again but as you know
from the record that all of those people
have they've been embraced people really
like them they like them because they
failed because there's a feeling and
that feeling is that you if you're in a
highly scalable rapidly scalable
business what you have to do is make
fast decisions you have to make quick
decisions and they have to be ones that
you're certain of and the issue of
failure helps you make those decisions
now there's some vases that I know in
Silicon Valley that will tell you
they've told me they won't fund a new
company unless they see a few people in
management who have already failed in
another business not failure because
failure is great its failure because
they learn and they know what not to do
if you want to scale a business rapidly
you can't afford to organically build
your team the way you could do it if
it's a slow growth so you're looking for
people to step in we're going to take
action and act like they've been there
before now if you look at Silicon Valley
it's primarily funded by venture capital
companies venture capital companies have
a five to seven-year funding cycle they
invest and they want to get out within
that period of time they look at their
portfolio usually it's about ten
companies that they'll invest in they
expect to to be home runs be actually
the unicorns that you're going to have
they expect to to be outright failures
and the other six what they have there
is companies that they have to get rid
of because they don't want to give their
limited partners back shares so they
will sell them off merge them out
whatever they can do to get rid of them
and usually the management
and usually the initial shareholders
friends and family don't end up with the
money the VCS end up with the money so
in essence 8 out of 10 of the companies
in Silicon Valley fail but if you were
to listen to the press or if you look
and read all of the stories it seems
like that's not the case that everything
is a unicorn that starts at Silicon
Valley started you're going to be a
billionaire it doesn't work but it's
okay because you can come back again and
again and again now those who go to
Silicon Valley and I speak with a lot of
universities that have immersion program
for people coming in are trying to find
out what's the silver bullet you know
what makes a difference there ensure its
universities in the attachment the
universities to the business community a
number of students coming out they're
really smart and quick and with the
latest knowledge and there's a lot of
financing financing comes from VCS it
comes from banks banks will invest in
companies will loan you money when you
don't have much in the way of asset
silicon valley bank is a classic example
you have lawyers and you have an
accountant's who've taken companies from
inception to IPO and they will do it pro
bono at the outset or they'll at least
defer their fees until you're rich and
they can take you to an IPO but all of
those things could be taken anywhere
else in the world I can tell you I've
worked in New Zealand I've worked in
Europe I've consulted companies around
the globe and it doesn't happen in a lot
of places it's there that you can do
that but you can take all of those
things and they try to set up in
development groups and they still don't
get the successes that we get in a
Silicon Valley environment and the
reason is the culture is different the
culture is what's really the
differentiator and it's a culture which
embraces failure as I said it's a
culture which doesn't put a blemish on
your record if you if you fail if you've
tried something really great it always
welcomes new if you're trying to have
scalable companies you have all sorts of
new ideas you have a new ideas such as
agile you have a new idea such as design
thinking David Kelley's work that he has
he's got the idea start company and it
but he has the design school at Stanford
that always talks about it's basically
rapid iteration quick decision-making
throwing things out that don't work also
if you think about it here's an example
from facebook
Mark Zuckerberg their new headquarters
they took over from sun microsystems a
few years ago has a lot of different
pods the headquarters pod where he's
located and some others are located
changed their building inside in the
first 18 months they changed at nine
times and zuckerberg comment was we have
to move as fast internally as we want to
move externally now you can imagine what
it's like and how disruptive it would be
if you have nailing wires coming in at
everything every two months but to be as
efficient as it is in Silicon Valley
that's required yet what the difference
is is really what you have is a culture
that's defined by failing forward and
Thomas Edison probably said it best he
said you know I've never failed i've
just found 10,000 ways that something
doesn't work and that's really the right
attitude to have because and and it's
really true most people say that Thomas
Edison invented the light bulb Thomas
Edison didn't invent the light bulb what
he did was buy a patent the patent for
an incandescent bulb but only lasted
about three seconds and what he realized
was if you've got the right materials
together you could come up with a
long-lasting light bulb and so what he
does he said about taking the table of
elements and he just tried every single
element singer Lee and in combination
until he came up with the right one that
lasted but his attitude was I'm not
failing when these don't work I know
I'll finally get to the right selection
as I see it it's really the scientific
method applied to business the
scientific method is probably most of
you know is basically taking our
hypothesis in science trying ideas
against it rejecting those things that
don't work in business for some reason
the general thinking the general
knowledge is everything's got to work if
it doesn't work get a bigger hammer and
make it work but but why not apply the
scientific method to business try things
iterate quickly decide fail forward if
it doesn't work reject it move on it's
okay now I wrote the book which we
talked about almost that they have back
there for you and I wrote about it to
talk about failure I wrote to talk about
the environment that exists in a
high-pressure startup in a company
partly because nobody writes about
failures when I talked with the
publishers I said go into the bookstores
and see how many sections you have on
failure
not any and I said but bookstores are
failing so maybe that's their problem
but another reason to do it is basically
if you read about some failures you
don't have to repeat it it's the old
opium you learn on other people's money
other people's mistakes it's a lot
easier to do that I can guarantee you
you'll make plenty of mistakes on your
own even if all of the mistakes that we
write about you learn and don't repeat
some of the ideas that are in the book
they're really five basic reasons why
this company failed and they're told in
a narrative nonfiction way so it's it's
entertaining it isn't the seven
effective habits of highly effective
people nor is it for piece of marketing
at those sorts of things it's a story
told in real life how it is in 12 months
the up and down all of the greed the
hubris the friction the excitement the
possibilities but buried in there are
five reasons why this company failed the
first one was that you can't have
multiple cultures in a small company you
can only have one we had a classic
conflict between sales and engineering
and we described it as do you make what
you can sell or do you sell what you can
make the engineers the R&amp;amp;D people always
wanted to make a new product they never
want to make two we couldn't do a B test
because no two things were the same the
sales people always wanted to make lots
and lots of what was selling you needed
to have a balance of the two but for
reasons I'll come too we didn't have
that so we had these two cultures
conflicting as we went through the
second thing that caught us up was a
myth of overnight success overnight
success takes years there's a few
outliers instagrams and others but
usually it takes a long time to be
successful and but that's not the theory
and that's not what people here and
particularly around Silicon Valley
people are drawn by the muses of Satan
we're going to get rich overnight well
that happened to this company it was a
company making miniaturized portable
power that could be embedded in any
consumer good to be able to be able to
make people more mobile and take all
their devices with them could write heat
on demand and clothing provide charging
and running of any device but and it had
fuel cells that have batteries and
everything trying to hook together we
had a visit from one of the
largest companies in Silicon Valley that
was into consumer goods and the moment
they showed up all financial discipline
all business disciplines went away
because the CEO believed that instantly
this company was going to buy us for a
hundred million dollars or two hundred
million dollars so all the things that
we needed to do to build a long-term
business were thrown away well they
didn't buy us four hundred million
dollars they talked with us we talked
about doing some joint development but
everything else went out the door
everybody who believed in the overnight
success ended up suffering as a result
of it the third thing that we ran into
is the old adage of when you run out
business you make bad decisions we ran
out of business once the disciplines
dropped we ended up two million dollars
in debt and so we had to make decisions
about products of rolling to the market
what we did was make a critical decision
we didn't invest in manufacturing
engineering ongoing we had rd
engineering but we didn't test for
repeated use thousands of times in the
field and there was failures after a
period of time in the field so they had
to be a recall because we didn't invest
in that last thing it was only going to
be about another fifty thousand dollars
but we just didn't have it and didn't
invest in the next thing that caused it
was failing to plan is planning to fail
once again because of the belief that we
were going to have a hundred million
dollars by the end of the year basically
not to worry right the fact that we're 2
million debt no problem a story that
kind of underscores that is that while
we're 2 million in debt i went to the
CEO and i said i don't believe anybody's
going to buy us at the end of the year
but i think i can get raised enough
money for us to be able to get us
through and if we have a payment plan
people probably persevere with us and i
said i don't i know i can't get 2
million right away but i think i can get
500 700 thousand dollars I i was able in
three weeks to get them seven hundred
thousand dollars to fund the company we
had a plan to pay hundred and
forty-seven thousand dollars out over
the course of the next few months to be
able to keep everybody at bay while we
raised the rest of the money in case we
didn't sell out at the end of the year
we got the 700,000 n we got it in in
three weeks I was pretty proud of that
because you
it takes a little bit longer to raise
that type of money I looked at the bank
account the day after we put the money
in the company and you know how much
money was left in the bank account the
next morning forty seven dollars we
didn't have enough money to pay payroll
that day so I went to the CFO and I said
what the hell's going on and he said
well you know I said we don't have
enough money for payroll he said well I
left enough in the bank account for
payroll I said what happened to our plan
we had a plan we're gonna pay 147,000
the rest he said well the CEO had to pay
other things I said well I've got two
problems with that I said the first
problem is that not only do we not have
enough money but we had a plan the plan
just went out the door we're gonna have
to find more money i don't know we're
going to find it the second problem i
have with that is our whole discipline
is again broken down what's wrong and he
said well I left enough money in the
bank account as a while go look at it so
I looked at it looked at it online and
matched up against the bank balance but
you know I'm thinking to myself you
can't have money come in one day and
it's gone the next morning those checks
have to have been written two weeks ago
they never told me about it well I went
back and I said what happened here are
three checks that don't show up in the
check register hey so I don't know I
guess the CL wrote him on his own I've
never seen those so so we didn't have a
lot of discipline but once again this
belief that we're going to get rich by
Christmas don't worry about it it's
going to be covered over at the end the
fifth point we had was basically a lot
of people in the company believe that
innovation is solely invention a better
mousetrap company if you just make
something new it's going to be great
innovation is a combination of invention
plus commercialization if you can't
actually take it to market earn
something you're going to lose and this
company didn't focus on that because we
didn't think we had to we thought we
were going to sell patents for money I
guess but anyway all of those things
what brought this company down now
there's a lot of other types of mistakes
that I've seen in other companies I've
worked with that I'll just tell you
about come back to them later on but
these will also bring you down as it did
this company arctica that I was involved
with the first one is if you had the
wrong business
this model a lot of people just won't
admit failure on their business model so
if it isn't working they just try harder
and harder to push the same model
through but it's the old joke about the
fact try doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different
result it just doesn't happen sometimes
you've got a pivot I have seen hundreds
of business plans for companies and I
can say without exception I've never
seen one business that ultimately adhere
to the business plan again I've talked
with a few theses and I said what do you
think of business plans say so we always
ask them to do it but we never read them
I said why is that they said well we
know that's not someone is going to be
there we've just had to figure out do
they know the discipline of how to put
it together and what all the issues are
but we're not going to rely on that
we're in a row and the people actually
to come up with the right pivot the
second thing that I think I've seen
happen a lot is too much complexity you
know you bring in the Mackenzies of the
world Baines Accenture and they come up
with these elegant solutions to a
problem they're so elegant and there are
three dimensional capabilities that the
only people in the world that can
possibly execute them are the consulting
companies it is a lifelong employment in
reality execution is required in
business that requires simplicity
requires a lot of people working
together it isn't this academic study of
what is going to happen I tell people
keep the main thing the main thing
figure out what it is you're doing focus
all your energies on that and that's how
you win another thing i see is lack a
sense of urgency that exists out there
there's an exponential rate of change in
society ninety-five percent of all
patents ever issued were issued in the
last five years that's not all great
patents of course a lot can go through
but it is a logarithmic change that is
happening and the society is moving so
much faster in today's world that we
have to respond in a quicker way if you
don't do it you're going to lose out and
I can tell you a story one of the things
I've done since I've sold northface
consulting and I I generally like to
work with smaller companies because you
feel more impact of what you're doing
but I ended up with a large company guys
told me all sorts of problems they said
on in and so I went into his office he
was late to the meeting but I figure
interview a lot of people around the
company and then come up with a
conclusion everybody inside the company
knows what the problems are most people
just don't want to speak about them so I
i looked at he came in and I knew this
wasn't going to be good for my
consulting practice but I said you know
I think I know what the problem is right
now so what is it and I saw what's you
you said what do you mean I said you
look like you hate your job basically
it's really true that's why are you
gonna motivate anybody he said well you
know I stay at home I read my emails you
know I checked the news I have a cup of
coffee checks newspaper he said whatever
I can do to keep from coming into the
office you said when I finally can't
come up with a reason to stay out of the
office I come in I saw well why don't
you quit is if I only have 15 more years
til retirement well that mentality kills
large companies that's why small
companies can survive because they don't
have that they have this fear of failure
they have a desire to survive there
willing to change on a dime and be able
to do that a second cause of failure
that I've seen is the inability to flex
between having sort of collegial
decision-making and have been very
decisive decision making a lot of people
like to be liked but great leaders
aren't always liked great leaders make
tough decisions if you set a collegial
environment that works fine except when
you come to a crisis when you get into a
crisis you have to have quick
decision-making and somebody has to step
out there now if you're going back and
forth people may not know how to deal
with you but the reality is you have to
make quick decisions and a story that
underscore is that is a story of a
climbing friend of mine during birth he
was climbing Everest he had done it as a
youth he no longer could do it so he put
together teams of people and he put
together a team of six people four of
whom had already climbed Everest and
they were going up this route and they
made it tamp three bad weather was
coming in which is a usual problem up
there and at Camp three he called
everybody together in his tent he said
okay let's vote on which way we're going
to go to the top of Everest well the
or people who had already summited
Everest did not want to go to the south
call which is the easiest way there's
already steps there the Hillary steps
ropes in whatever they wanted to to want
to climb some rock to want to go on a
nice route the two people who had never
climbed Everest of course want to go
south call because they wanted to get it
into the record book so they argued all
day long and at the end of the day they
packed up went down the hill that was
the end of their climb they failed the
reason they failed is during first at
that point didn't say I'm the leader and
this is decision we're going to have he
wanted it still to be collegial another
reason companies fail is basically a
lack of passion a lack of passionate
commitment to success if you're in sales
I'd ask you when was the last time that
you cried when you lost a sale literally
cried that it cared that much I can tell
you some of your competitors are
thinking that way and you have to care
that much to be able to win you have to
be that passionate about it if you're
that passionate and you're the leader of
the company leader of a section leader
of a group what you will find is people
follow you because what you say is often
forgettin forgotten they usually tell
the speaker that thirty percent of what
you say is remembered what is remembered
is the passion the commitment the
direction whether you're you have their
back if you're leading it and so what
you want to be is that leader is that
passionate individual everybody's drawn
to and follows so another story about a
friend of mine that I was reminded this
weekend so I bring it up again his name
is deke Buick and deke Buick was this
skier in my day is he was a guy that
whenever he was in town the word was
around the bars or whatever they keep
Buick is here let's go ski with him
because everybody wanted to ski with
deke well the reason was he was so
passionate and he committed to it but
one day a dick was getting ready for a
race he had his downhill skis on he got
on the wrong run and he ended up on a
ski jump he flew off the ski jump hit a
tree 30 feet in the air
crash to the ground hold him in and a
sled and he said doc patch me up i raced
tomorrow and the doctor said you know I
don't think you understand you you
you're going to full-length cast
tomorrow you're not gonna race and think
he said you understand doc I'm Dickie
Buick I race and dr. so how are we are
we going to accomplish that he said very
simply he said all you do is put my full
length gas in a racing tuck I'll race
tomorrow now he did race he didn't win
because at that level you can't win but
the passion and the commitment to being
involved in that was why Dickie Buick
was followed by everybody and as a
leader that is what you want if you
don't have that and your competition
does you may lose out to them now as I
mentioned you know the world around us
is in a malaise with exception of the
tech world most businesses are in a bad
shape because of the China problem the
international global problems problems
of whether the problem climate change
population explosion but we don't want
to let that drag us down because it's
going to stay that way until somebody
makes a difference and we are the people
who can make the difference it starts
with optimism positive mental attitude
you know I tell people follow my rule
the 8020 rule don't tell people your
problems because eighty percent don't
care and twenty percent are glad you got
them the reason we are where we are in
the business world today I believe is a
fair failure I think it's a land of
can't but I believe that we can I mean
experts know all the reasons something
won't work but the experts are the ones
who are failing us it's a society
dominated by lawyers and MBAs which are
risk averse professions I mean lawyers
are the ones who write a ten thousand
word document and call it a brief that
gives you some idea of their approach to
it but what I can tell you is don't be a
fair afraid of failure use failure to
learn and I'll give you is some comments
that maybe we'll stick with you that
I've learned that you can apply as well
to try to get success from failure the
first one is
is don't confuse planning and strategy
with execution execution almost always
wins as I said earlier these great plans
are put together by the Bane's and
Mackenzie's accenture ease that are too
complex they won't win in the real world
when execution is there the second thing
is avoid perfection paralysis in this
exponential logarithmic change of
society there's not time for perfect
information Voltaire long ago said it
best which is basically perfection is
the enemy of good you have to be able to
make quick decisions in today's
marketplace a third one is it always
takes twice as long and it costs three
much three times as much as you plan I
don't know why that's the case you know
I go out and do consulting and I would
think with 40 years worth of experience
and failure and success I would know
that but every new situation seems to
generate that same thing so you have to
plan when you're asking for money or
raising money you have to plan for the
fact that it may take longer it may cost
more doesn't mean there's a bad idea the
next one is sometimes cheaps expensive
and expensive is cheap referencing back
to when we didn't do the engineering
necessary to take a product to market a
little bit of extra money would have
made the difference get a number and a
date together never get one if a team is
reporting to you and they just give you
a number they're going to hit time down
to a date by Tuesday we will do X if you
don't get those two together you don't
have any commitment you don't have any
accountability next point is that you
know it's not price its value that the
consumer is looking for always look at
that when you're developing your product
or your service today's world is a
knee-jerk response to the lower price
because people don't know how to put
value into a product but the consumers
are looking for increased value if you
look outside of the country right now to
the two countries that have been driving
the demand for lower price in product or
in services it's been China and India
both of those societies have costs that
are going up at eight nine ten
percent a year the marketplace isn't
aware of that yet but that's coming to
an intersection that is pretty amazing
in the apparel and footwear business
which I know 15 years ago the cost
Chinese labor in manufacturing assembly
was twenty one percent of the United
States this last year it was sixty-two
percent and is increasing dramatically
now one year revalue the you on that
will give them a one-year hiatus but the
reality is those costs are going up the
marketplace costs are going to go up as
a result of that put value in and the
consumer will want that it's not price
its value constantly remember that keep
your plans flexible the only constant is
change the environment around you is
moving so rapidly if you don't have a
response to that changing environment
you have a risk of failure probably the
most important thing I can tell you that
I've learned is and this is for certain
is how do you motivate your people
there's only one short way higher
motivated people you cannot use pay
schemes you can't use any plan to take
somebody who's not motivated and do it
if you have a team figure out how to
move them elsewhere or how to get rid of
them because if they aren't motivated
they'll drag you down and the final
point I'd say and this is my own and you
probably see it in the north face but is
a commitment to providing absolutely the
best quality that ever exist that's the
hardest thing to copy people
reverse-engineer your products
reverse-engineer your code reverse
everything as soon as they see it but
quality is something that is very hard
to compete with we had a slogan which
were put on the wall of our company at
the north face when we design products
which guided everything we did and that
slogan was taken from Rudyard Kipling's
book The Merry glouster but he said they
copied all they could follow but they
couldn't copy our mind
so we left them sweating and stealing a
year and a half behind and that was the
guiding mantra for everything we
developed now people say well quality
but that's really hard to do
particularly in this world where we're
cost-sensitive I'll give you a story
before I close and that story is about a
friend of mine peter glenn who is in
china and japan and for those of you
who've been in tokyo you know the Ginza
areas high-rise department stores no
google boutique stores well it was two
o'clock in the afternoon he was having
that usual slowness that people get when
they're traveling if there's if I get a
little bit of caffeine and get into my
system I'll be okay I'll be good to go
for the rest of the afternoon but
there's no small coffee shops so he said
well where do I get a cup of coffee
probably at the top of a department
store you're going to find that there's
a coffee available is probably a
restaurant probably not going to be very
good but I'll go up there and i'll get
my caffeine load well he went up there
got to the top and he was immediately
impressed because they seated him
quickly and you know people were well
dressed they're speaking to him in a
couple languages he said that's pretty
good because doesn't happen to me
everywhere I go and they gave him a hot
towel and he said you know we'd probably
sell more coffee if he got a hot towel
with it but still expecting a mediocre
cup of coffee quickly the coffee came
out very strong aroma and he was amazed
because he looked down at it and on top
of that cup of coffee was a dollop of
cream sculpted like a rosebud he's
thinking this is pretty good and he
started to stir and they then no sir
wait for a moment and while he waited
the heat of the cup of coffee turned the
rosebud into a rose petal why would you
go any place else to buy a cup of coffee
it's that simple if you can think about
your product you think about your
service and think what you can put in
there people can't beat you out so i
would use those things to suggest that
you don't have to fail failing isn't
something you should set up to
accomplish however if you fail it's okay
because in today's world people want
somebody who's going to learn try and as
Steve Jobs they tried to dent the
universe
so thank you I'll open it up to
questions small speeches we have some
questions yes what do you think about
the culture of accelerators or is that a
don't are your folder no i'm in berkeley
but i'm around san francisco better so
like TechStars and yep it founders is to
tune all these different places it I
think accelerators work in some cases it
depends on the individual accelerator I
mean that is but some don't work there's
a company that I was mentoring and they
were trying to import a number of foods
ardent Artemis all foods and wines from
Europe and one of the demands of the
accelerator was that they immediately go
out and sell some product and the guy
said well there's a bit of a problem
with this I have to have the rights to
import from companies I have to have the
governmental approval for things like
importation of wine and they said well
if you don't do that you're not
following our accelerator process and he
said well I can't sell anything because
I you know I can't do it if the
accelerator is inflexible and doesn't
fit your need it's a problem but I've
seen a lot of companies use that as a
tool for initial capital and discipline
and as we're trying to speed up getting
into business time is our major enemy
and accelerator can compress that time
because what it might take you a year or
two years to learn by talking to your
friends and talking to other
entrepreneurs and talking to people are
out there you can go in an accelerator
in a six-month period of time you're
going to learn all of those disciplines
but ultimately the accelerator is not
going to be what makes you successful or
not it's going to be you and if you use
the process and understand the process
don't go in and expect them to provide
you all of the investors you're going to
get don't expect them to provide the
differentiation that you want they just
are going to bounce that back I've seen
probably half are great the other half
of you know like society not quite so
good
yes an online question um he says thanks
have what's your process for learning
from a failure also do you how do you
balance trying out too many things
versus giving enough time for each idea
to mature and succeed well it's kind of
few questions there I mean the first one
you know how do you how do you learn
something for failure I mean the first
one is basically have to sit down and
admit a failure and to give you one idea
one of the things we was a big failure
at north face is we had the wrong
business model the better business model
was a model which was by phil knight at
nike and what we did is we want to grow
one hundred percent a year two hundred
percent a year that was exciting and the
usual theory that you know the faster
you grow the better things are going to
get the faster you grow the more capital
you need and phil knight had figured
this out before he went into it well
Phil you know people think of Phil as a
marketing genius and i can tell you both
from knowing him and from knowing that
the name of nike for two years was blue
ribbon sports before they converted to
nike I'd say he's not a marketing genius
but he's a financial genius and what
what he'd figured out that others hadn't
figured out was he needed vendor
financing to grow so he went up to a
vendor called nishio ey japanese trading
company initially why basically said we
want more business that he'll get more
business if you will fund my product you
buy the product on my behalf and you
fund it all the way to the retailer
which case I'll go to go to my bank
they'll advance against that receivable
and I'll be able to grow and you know
the nice review I said that's great but
we're at risk he said no you won't be at
risk because I promise you I'll do two
things the first one is i'm going to
give you all my purchase orders from my
customers and i will not order one pair
of boots that I don't have an order for
most of us were buying a let him in poor
put it in the warehouse trying to ship
the extra he said I won't buy any of
that and that's why to this day nike
still has a forward order program is
that the second thing I'm going to do is
I'm never going to go into a foreign
country on my own money I'm going to go
in on somebody else's money and he said
I will go with the distributor I will
give them a contract and that contract
says I can buy it back at some
point in the future if it's successful
it's not successful or if I don't have
the money I won't buy it back if it is
successful then I would maybe buy it
back when I go public he used that model
they said well you know you're we're
funding you and he said yeah that's fine
because Japanese interest rates are one
percent charged me eight which was
cheaper than what we had here in the US
you'll make money on your money you'll
be able to grow organically at whatever
rate we can grow it he did that he grew
it until he owed them over four hundred
million dollars he went public paid them
off now the subset of that story is this
review I probably said oh 400
million dollar count growing they don't
need me any longer what they did is they
said what are we going to do they drove
30 miles across town and went to a small
company called columbia sportswear and
did exactly the same thing with Tim and
Gert boil exactly the same formula and
they did the same thing until they went
public and then they bought an issue a
way out niche where you I didn't apply
after that but if you learn from that
strategy if you learn from that you go
out and say ok you let's use vendor
financing as a technique to grow let's
not just try to constantly refinance
which is what we were doing at north
face and every year I was out financing
the company over and over again now the
second question you were saying how do
you balance trying out too many things
versus giving enough time for each idea
to mature and succeed well when I
consult with companies I generally tell
them there's two words all I tell them
its unique when I see them but it's
always the same two words this is what
success is the first one is deselect it
doesn't matter what company I look at
they already are trying to many things
and trying to accomplish too much I mean
Steve Jobs was asked when he went back
to Apple how he was so brilliant to pick
out the ones that were going to be
successful because he was you know if
they took over from Scully he said there
were a lot of great ones I just knew we
couldn't do all of them he said I threw
away a lot that probably would have been
good too what I knew was if we focused
if we deselected we were going to be
successful
so you just have to deselect it's okay
you can't be all things to all people so
the other thing you need to put into
your products into your service is
something called unobtainium unobtainium
is something that they can't get from
anybody else that's what everybody wants
instead of trying to make something
that's exactly like some somebody else
is offering make something that is
really unique and if its unique that
will carry the day even when you have
troubles getting to market speed
delivery problems put on their taenia
min other questions yes you mentioned
quality other you balance quality and
time-to-market how do you balance I'm to
market well hate to keep quoting him but
Steve Jobs introduced the the Apple
iPhone do you have any guess about what
percentage of the initial iPhones were
returned thirty percent in his case and
and frankly because Apple usually didn't
originate anything I mean the copied
product and came to market he had to
move rapidly in his case to be able to
get there because he wasn't making a
unique product any unique offering so
his trade off which he made I think the
right call on was where we're going to
have inferior quality but we'll make it
okay to people just take it back thirty
percent what the hell give me a new one
and people weren't that upset with him
if you've got a really any coughing or
if you're offering service or if you
were offering software that's critical
to company's operation will say your
essay p or your oracle and you come in
and your system doesn't work and it
falls apart and the business is you're
serving fall apart you're out of
business so in that case you have to
have an extreme focus on quality ahead
of time to market so you have to look at
the impact on the market the impact on
the ultimate customer that you have to
determine where you're going to make the
trade offs and it always this trade-off
it isn't binary absolutely perfect or
absolutely bad but it's like do we get
to a level of acceptable
a Minimum Viable Product or not and and
you define the Minimum Viable Product by
looking at the customer understanding
the customer get in front of the
customer to test out there and ask them
what they really need don't get your
in-house group all deciding but a
Minimum Viable Product is because it
won't reflect the real world other
questions yes what do you see as the
biggest challenges for four people
coming from large companies getting into
the startup stock market the question is
what do you see is the biggest challenge
for people coming from a large company
going to a start-up or a start-up
environment there there a myriad of ones
but as we mentioned just earlier we were
talking about it is that when you're a
small company the really exciting thing
about it is that you can make fast
decisions and you can pivot and change
that all the responsibilities on you but
also the joy is on you because you get
the ego feedback when you're in large
company it's better to get along and
move along than to make fast decisions
now we always press for faster decisions
and difficult decision making but when
you get into that small company you
can't wait around and you can't have as
much certainty of going to the market
but the penalty isn't is high either if
you take a reputation of a large company
and they fail on their delivery to the
marketplace it has dramatic impact if he
fails a small company and deliver it
isn't going to impact very many people
you may not be critical to the people
you're selling to so the big challenge
is how do you address in your mind to
move quickly and not necessarily rely on
the services of three or four different
people who may know things usually a
small company doesn't have the breath of
management it doesn't have people in
quality assurance and manufacturing
Supply Chain Finance and so you have to
guesstimate which one is most critical
to your survival and if you've been in a
large company you say well I need all of
those in a small company you won't have
all of those so how do you deal with
them and how do you prioritize our stack
rank what the most important things are
for success in your variety
yes imagining about hiring motivated
people right I I'm curious how you are
balancing motivating the people that
you're already in your RM purses the one
are you hiring the 12 motivated people
because a lot of time those out people
maybe the motivated people may not have
the skill sets all right needs that you
know maybe figurines how are you going
to grow them in where is this you know
well the first thing is are they
motivated or not you know you can d
motivate people probably more than you
can motivate them in business you know
you basically treat me like mushrooms
you keep them in the dark cover them
with manure and that's it but what
you're really trying to do is find
people who are eager to learn and so
your interview process becomes the first
step the interview process is trying to
define what they're interested in
usually people use the interview to ask
the same questions that show up on your
CV well I mean I've never seen a bad CV
in today's world you're an idiot if you
have a bad CV because you just go online
take the Seavey's that are there you
fill in that and you come up with a good
cv asking the same question is going to
get you the same answer I try to go
outside that and ask about things and
one thing is are you passionate about
anything tell me what you're passionate
about is it music is it sport is it art
is it design you start talking with
people if there's nothing that you can
resonate with if nothing's passionate I
pass on the individual no matter how
good that is now you may end up with
people who have a limited background
because they may be very passionate and
very but they don't have the skills in
there then as your job as a manager to
allocate work to them gradually don't
give them something that's going to
swamp them and is going to ruin their
self-esteem or is going to get you in
trouble because they basically let you
down so you parcel out what you give to
them and you get more authority more
responsibility as they grow but start
with that person who really is
passionate about it and is willing to
work 20 hours a day because that's the
way they are not because you tell them
to do that because you don't tell them
to do that it's just you know they're
going okay I'll go home let me let me
work on this I'll go to school I'll take
a class
I'll do that that's what you're looking
for there's another question only one of
the questions bed sort of a follow-up to
the to the motivated folks I would say
that certainly at Microsoft people are
starting to work for longer periods of
time than they used to I'm wondering
about you know so you're not always the
love every project you're on watch be a
manager of someone who is demotivated
how do you you know if if they're a
motivated person but they're not in a
motivating place how do you help faster
well if you can you try to move them
around if you're developing a new
project a new product development
there's two ways you put a team together
one way is you have a dedicated team it
take people from every division and you
bring them in in that case you have a
better chance to try to get the the
really select people who really are
motivated into your group if the other
one is basically that you're tasking
people out on a period there's a lot of
challenges there I mean first of all the
one that a manager is willing to free up
is often the person who's the least
valuable to that because they don't want
that to work so so you have a challenge
so what you have to do then is sit down
and try to bring together this group and
talk about the vision people don't
follow people they follow visions and so
what you have to do is talk about what
you're doing that is so great that they
can be drawn to it when they really see
that you're changing the world with what
you're doing you get a different sort of
person that if you say listen what we're
trying to do is make this product a
little bit cheaper and we're going to
knock it out six months from now people
go yeah that's great but you know I know
that's a job and I know that's what I'm
supposed to do but they don't get
involved in it the same way so you try
and set up something which is a goal
that transcends a normal job and when
they realize that they're going to
change the world when we introduced that
North Face we introduced a tent we
worked with a guy named a buckminster
fuller and Bucky had pretty unique
designs and geodesics and he was a
wonderful person to work with but
instead of telling people were going to
make another tent we told them two
things one is you have a chance to work
with buckminster fuller and Bucky is one
of the true design geniuses of our era
and the second thing is we're going to
saina tent that can be replicated
anywhere in the world with local
materials that we will end up creating
design that will house all the homeless
people in the world and we did create
that design hasn't rolled out north face
isn't really interested in doing that
but when people knew they had a chance
to work with Bucky and that they had a
chance to solve the world's homeless
problems it elevated their thinking way
beyond just making another goddamn tent
you know because who needs another tent
there are plenty of temps out there and
plenty good tents out there time for one
more question one more question we have
time I guess I've answered mall villa
priest wait someone's got one it's not
