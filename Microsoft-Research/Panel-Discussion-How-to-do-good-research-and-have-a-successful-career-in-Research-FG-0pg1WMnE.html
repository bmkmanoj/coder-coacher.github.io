hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
well welcome it's fantastic to see so
many young people here relative to us
you're young I know you don't consider
yourselves young but relative to old
people up here you're young so first let
me tell you who is here with us this is
an amazing group of people we have here
first is Anna Dunn who is a
distinguished scientist he is the
founder of Microsoft Research India so
I'm sure that many of you have read
about him I heard about him he has now
left MSRI in chandu's capable hands but
he is always in the heart of MSRI
okay next is rico Malvo so Rico is a
distinguished engineer and the chief
scientist of Microsoft Research Redmond
so Rico has had many positions he'll
tell us a little bit about his positions
when we when we go on okay and then the
next person so we have actually two
people from Microsoft Research India so
next we have Sriram and I'm going to
mispronounce your last name because I
always do this so may I just call you
guys by your first names yes okay so
Sriram is the assistant managing
director of Microsoft Research India
Shriram is also a principal researcher
he he started out as the assistant
managing director under undone and now
is the assistant managing director under
Chandu and really is essential to
Microsoft Research India next we have
Chris bishop who is from Microsoft
Research Cambridge England he is also a
distinguished scientist he was for a
long time
assistant managing director I think have
you stepped back from that
kind of I don't know anyway heat T
desert gray he's he's a TV star in
England too for his science next is
Victor ball Victor is one of the leading
researchers in networks in the world is
in Microsoft Microsoft Research
Redmond he leads the network effort
there and he is also a principal
researcher so now this group of people
who have been doing a lot of management
are gonna talk to you about research
careers how to have a good research
career so so will will see for some of
us you know we've been doing more and
more management and less and less
research recently but hopefully we can
make it relevant to all of you and I
know even though we heard that we're not
going to talk about how to get a job at
Microsoft Research I think that you know
getting a job at Microsoft or some other
high-tech company is probably something
that is on the minds of a lot of people
here and so we will try to address some
of that not in terms of the the
mechanics of how to get a job but in
terms of the wonderful things that you
can do the ways in which you can impact
the world and the way in which you
become a researcher who can impact the
world so what I want to do actually is
start out with each of them telling us
maybe a two to three minute synopsis of
their research career but especially
focusing on ways in which their research
career was not a linear progression
because I think that for you know for
many of you out there you look at our
CVS and you think that it was a linear
progression and that if you get off this
linear progression there's going to be
some problem and in fact I doubt that
there are any
of the distinguished people here in this
front row who have had a career that's a
linear progression you know you have to
take risks and some of the things that
you think are wrong turns are actually
the magic so we'll hear a little bit
about that let's start with honor done
thanks Jennifer
probably you know my experience in some
sense many of you will actually
experience in your future so it's my
delayed too that I did my BTech in IIT
Madras and I know many of you from local
you know institutions colleges and
experience is not that different a lot
of class studies you know good grades
looking for you know career
opportunities but you know back in the
days when I did it there were not
carrier opportunities India so naturally
went to do a master's degree in the US
and in fact back when I did you know on
my undergraduate there was not even a
computer science major in India and it
just started after I left India I went
and did a master's degree in computer
science in the US and I said you know
I'm tired of studying studying studying
I wanted to go get a job work make money
and enjoy life so I did but in fact I
think many of you from the you know
statistics that I know about what is
happening in India will do this because
back in the days when I was studying I
think about 30 percent of you know
graduates of elite institutions in India
I went towards graduate school and PhD
and now I think the number is little
less than half of that I believe and the
reason is because there are a lot more
jobs and you all will probably finish
and go get a job in one of the IT
service sector industry right companies
Infosys TCS are we looking at third year
of 40 students mostly how many of you
are in the final year raise your hands
so have you already interviewed for how
many of you already have a job lined up
when you finish and how many of you
expect to have a lot of job lined up by
the time you finish and
and how many of you are thinking of
going to graduate school our master's
program it's more than it used to be so
I'm happy and how many of you are
honestly planning to go to a master's
program and how many of you think you
want to go to PhD so you know I was like
you when I that you know I've done with
an off course I did all masters not
bachelors I was done with my masters go
get a job I worked at Intel in you know
in Portland Oregon in the u.s. I was a
program and actually a very nice job but
after about a year or two of doing it
one thing I realized is that I was sort
of solving problems that were given to
me I mean they're very interesting
enough problems technically challenging
but somehow I felt like I had a certain
limited scope of what I have to do I was
working on writing systems level
software and it was just not fun enough
and so I started reading in and of
course there was a lot of spare time and
started reading and I started reading
about brain and artificial intelligence
and so on articles and books and things
like that and then over a period of time
I realized that if I kept on doing my
job doing my programming job doing my
programming job there was never a time I
was going to actually explore those
things and it was pretty obvious reading
those articles that computer science was
going to be the one that was going to
create the next you know up mind
artificial intelligence and so this is
exactly the reason I quit my job went to
go do my PhD spent you know six years
doing it I worked in the area of
computer vision and what I did not
realize you know when I went to do that
was not simply the fact that I would
study a subject that I cared about and
you know new ideas but that I would have
an opportunity to think freely and solve
problems that I found interesting with
absolutely no constraint whatsoever in
other words it is a one job right apart
from being an artist which of course you
know you won't get paid much here's one
carrier I found that you can just do
whatever you wanted because you found it
exciting because it's found it
interesting and you you prick the
problem you solve the problem and
there's actually a community out there
that's willing to pay you give
jobs for it that's willing to take you
to conferences in the most interesting
you know exotic places in the world like
you know Miami or Hawaii and somebody
even pays your travel for doing that and
you're gonna talk to really smart people
that are doing the same thing and you
know and usually the smartest set of
people are out there so a lot of fun to
talk to and crazy people because they're
all you know what do you call they are
not your stereotype people who they're
all a little bit wacky and really you
should do it for the fun and and do it
because you can actually learn a lot
keep on learning and you get paid for
keep on learning and keep on changing
your mind about what you want to do and
go to fun places and be with fun people
all right
thanks Anna and then thanks Jennifer my
name is Rico Oliver I'm very happy to be
here I've been to India many times and
it's always a pleasure to me I really
sympathize a lot with you folks because
about 40 years ago I wasn't in the same
place and there's some things in common
between you guys and me because I grew
up in a place where the weather is very
similar to here the place is very messy
like it is here and lots of confusion
and complicated traffic and all of that
the in the other side of the world the
difference being you guys are a little
bit above the equator and where I grew
up is a little bit below the equator and
that place is Rio de Janeiro Brazil and
since I was your age I really wanted to
be an engineer I remember very as a kid
I would pick up toys and destroy them
and try to assemble them back again
failing most of the time but I really
liked tinker with stuff and I would like
to grow and do more and and that sparkle
was in me all the time is still in me
today just as I'm in a minor common is
still as a chief scientist I still write
code I still saw their pieces of
circuits together so don't let that
Sparco ever go away because here here is
because you have that sparkle but one
thing I want to tell you is I went to
unlike on and on who wins
great school the iit a one of the IITs
for his undergrad I actually went to a
much smaller school but I had in my mind
someday I'm gonna go to MIT and do cool
things
and sure enough I ended up there and one
thing I would like to tell you about how
to grow a career in engineering and
research in engineering be it Electrical
Engineering computer science and all
these related fields is that don't be
much afraid don't pick up a model that
you have to go that way and linear as
Jennifer was saying it can be very
nonlinear you can step one way or
another I'll tell you one example of
that when I was at MIT three students me
and two of good friends of mine we had
just finished the qualifying
examinations we're about to get our
master's degrees and then the two of
them one of them 24 the other 23 told to
me okay Rico by you we'll see you later
we don't wanna do the speech DS stuff
what is that about and then Brian told
me Rico his words were there is money to
be made so I'm gonna go do it and you
finish your PhD because you seems to be
reasonably smart and then you're gonna
come work for me guess what happened
Brian went out his fall he founded a
smart kemal company that company started
in his in its first two years with about
40 people 20 percent of the people on
that small startup had PhDs and it was
necessary for the success of that
startup the research that was done by
these people it was a video conferencing
company that was 30 years ago and we
produced the highest quality video
conferencing equipment that you could
have today you over in Skype in your
machines but at that time it was really
just in the eighties to do that and then
a little more than five or six years
later the company actually grew up to be
above a billion-dollar
so when psychic was saying think about
it can you start something yes you can
even if you only own your twenties and
it may actually work and I had the
experience of doing that I had
experience of going to academia and
teaching and then at some point I went
to Microsoft and I've been there more
than 15 years and it's a great place
where you can do research and
engineering
I still do research and I've been in
managing any management from managing 10
people to managing 400 people and one
thing I want to say to you is that don't
be linear back to what Jennifer said
experiment with things sometimes you're
gonna do a project where you invent an
idea you go to the computer you make it
work and then you go what how does that
work then you think a little bit more
about it you try to abstract that out
and be a little more theoretical
sometimes you start on the theoretical
side wow this abstract multi-dimensional
think I think I can cut a hyperplane
here and do some stuff and I see but
what do I do with that and suddenly you
may end up designing some completely new
thing that came out from that very
abstract I would recommend to you try
all of that don't assume one is better
than the other you may end up doing very
well in many of these different models
and the world needs even that little
startup with 40 people that 20% were
PhDs the world needs people with
graduate degrees in engineering
otherwise all this evolution of
technology won't happen all right
yeah thank you my name is Elam like
Anand then I also studied undergrad here
and I went to the US and I like on and
then after my master's I never thought I
would do research I took up a job I
worked in the semiconductor company
called Xilinx for five years I wrote
various kinds of software for them and I
was actually quite happy and like Anand
then doing what I was doing but once I
was given a problem of they had a lot of
bugs in their software and as a result
the circuit that they wired into the
chip was sometimes different from the
circuit that the customer started with I
mean the customer gives a circuit and
then you compile it and then program it
and because of bugs the final circuit is
different from the original circuit and
this was very annoying for them it cost
lots of problems so they asked me to say
you know you're a smart guy you can
maybe build something that actually
checks but two circuits have are
functionally equivalent it's a very
interesting problem it's it's it's a
combinatorial problem it's an
np-complete problem and for a very large
cycle it is very hard to do and I tried
various ways of doing it
and with varying degrees of success and
then someone told me that in Berkeley
there are some people who are doing that
so I I used to show up there Ken
McMillan was actually teaching a formal
verification course there so I went
there and it was I fought it
unbelievably fascinating that you could
actually check that two circuits are
equivalent for really large ones and I
built a based on those ideas I built a
combinational equal ins checker for for
Xilinx which was I some time a few years
ago I checked with someone it is it is
in use even today in that company but
then I like those techniques so much
that I end up ended up leaving my job
and going to Berkeley and doing a PhD in
verification and I do my PhD in Hardware
verification and after I finished my PhD
Jim laddus he once came to give a talk
at Berkeley and he enticed me to do
verification of software and then I
joined Microsoft research and I worked
on software verification so most of my
changes in my life have been very
nonlinear because I met someone and I
got interested in some problem and I
got sucked by the problem and and and I
I was in Microsoft in Redmond and and
not linearly I moved to Microsoft
sitting here because I made out of them
and he and he created a lab here and
most of my choice of problems is by my
accidental meeting of very interesting
collaborators so I just live my life in
a completely unplanned manner I
recommend you do the same okay so so my
name is Chris and this is actually a
very easy question for me because my
career is in has been incredibly
nonlinear I guess it really goes back to
when I was when I was quite young before
I was even a teenager my parents took me
to see a film called 2001 a Space
Odyssey and it's a great film if you
haven't seen it and it depicts this
computer called how that was sort of
super intelligent and I was fascinated
by the idea of a cup of a machine that
could be intelligent and but I decided
not to go into computer science or into
artificial intelligence because the way
in which research in that field was done
at the time just didn't sort of appeal
to me it was about writing rules and
trying to sort of mimic intelligence it
somehow it didn't feel right my
imagination was caught by something
rather different which was physics I
love studying physics at school so I
went to university and I studied physics
and I then went to to do a PhD at the
University of Edinburgh in in
theoretical physics and at that time and
today as well it's a very exciting field
so I did a PhD and I was very lucky I
had a couple of fantastic
supervisors David Wallace and Peter
Higgs and I had a tremendous time and
one of them by the way just won the
Nobel Prize last year so I was I was
very fortunate and working with great
people and that's a that's one great tip
I think for research is to work with
great people if you get the chance to do
so but I did this PhD and it was very
abstract very theoretical it dealt with
particles that were very hard to detect
and it was very abstract at the end of
my PhD I wanted to do something
practical I wanted a shift and do
something that was going to be useful
for the world
and I got excited by by a problem I
think is very exciting today I can
illustrate it with this bottle of water
so as little fact of physics that this
bottle of water contains enough energy
to power the city of Bangalore including
all its transportation lighting heating
or cooling everything for probably
several hours but the challenge is
getting the energy out of that water so
tremendously difficult we've been
working on it for half a century it
might be another half a century before
we get there I don't know but I decided
that I wanted to work on this problem we
call it fusion the idea we take the
hydrogen and we turn it into helium and
it releases lots of energy so I worked
on that for about eight years now if
there's time Jennifer a little story
about when I was working in fusion
research at this time I'll tell that
later but I was working in the fusion
program and around about the sort of
late 1980s something rather exciting
happened sort of across the way in the
field of computer science there was this
technique called neural networks and the
idea had been around a long time but in
the 1980s late 1980s and people figured
out how to make neural networks work
properly a neural networks really caught
my imagination because they could solve
problems not by being programmed but by
being taught they could solve problems
by looking at examples by learning from
data and that resonated with that
thought I'd had way back when I was a 10
year old of how we might build
intelligent machines so the idea that a
machine could learn to be intelligent
really got me excited and then they did
something which was you know with
hindsight quite smart I learned about
neural networks but then I applied them
in the field of fusion now one of the
tough things in research is having new
ideas it's hard to have new ideas it's a
bit easier to take other people's good
ideas from a different field and bring
them into your field so I was probably
the first person to bring neural
networks into the fusion field I had a
great time because I went around and
picked off all these problems that were
really easy and I published lots of
papers and gave lots of talks and had
lots of fun and I enjoyed it so much I
decided I want to do this full-time so I
I moved to University I became a
professor in the computer science
department and that was really the third
phase of my career so I went from sort
of theoretical physicists to fusion
researcher and finally to computer
scientist and that's what I do today so
I work on neural networks and other
machine learning techniques and and hope
one day to be able to help us take this
take this next step towards this goal of
truly intelligent machines so a very
nonlinear career thank you very much
it's sort of hard to follow a team
personality but I'll try he is actually
a pretty big personality in the UK so I
was born in New Delhi I was very lucky
my my mother was doctor the product of
the partition they'd come to Delhi
they'd built their own life they had
seen some really tough times in their
lives and so they left me alone so I
grew up in an environment where it was
either engineering or medicine yes it's
probably still is right it's that or
that but I think it's gotten better in
India you've got a lot more other things
going on now too but they didn't put any
pressure on me which was sort of
surprising because every other family I
could see was you know that's what you
had to do but I was good at math so that
was good and then I really wanted to do
physics as you said and I actually
joined Delhi University and you know did
physics for a while but then it sort of
became there was some family
circumstances which caused me to
actually change and then end up doing
engineering but during that part time I
met a cousin of mine who was a physicist
he still is he's a professor in Jawara
Nehru University in Delhi and I spent a
summer with him and he was it was very
influential on my my growth at the time
because I really he would talk about the
purity of science and he would talk
about you know how it was so important
to have something of your own which was
separate from everything else and there
was nothing but knowledge pure knowledge
that you could have and you talked about
just when he would get
would get bad in his life he would lock
himself in a room and just you know do
the math or the science and feel
completely purified from all the other
stuff that was going on anyway that was
just I was a kid he didn't matter at the
time but it was sort of fun I started
doing engineering and then like most of
you getting a job was the most important
thing I got a job but then at that point
I ended up in a place where everybody
around me had a PhD I didn't actually
had done a masters but not a PhD and
that was in dislike of Incorporation I
actually had a job from Microsoft Oh at
the time and I walked away from that and
went to Dec but but there was this whole
set of people who had done would all
have PhDs and then they were always I
was coding right I was coding I was
building systems but I would see the set
of problems that they were solve and I
decided that that's what I wanted to do
I didn't want to sort of just be you
know a court monkey I didn't want to
just bear systems so then that inspired
me I applied for some program in Dec I
got selected for it and then I did my
PhD when I came back I started to sort
of work on things and then then it
struck me at that point that I was very
since I came from India I was very much
into you know how people didn't have any
access to any some of this technology
and Wireless was just budding at that
time and it's me it sort of became very
obvious that that was the way to connect
to get more and more people connected to
the world so I pretty much devoted my
entire life since then to that single
problem of course it manifests itself in
very different form because you take
little steps but these little steps when
you take you actually don't have don't
know the you know what implication
they'll have and I've been sort of lucky
in the sense that the little steps I did
take actually have had very very serious
impacts so so research for me was really
or getting to research from me was a
series of incidents and mostly people
that like most of us who who had some
lasting impact on us and of course this
desire to sort of and not feel pressure
societal pressures to do things the way
they're supposed to be done but just
sort of follow whatever you know you're
instinctively we wanted to do it so just
so that you don't only hear the guys
stories I'll tell you my story too
quickly so mine was very nonlinear if I
had to map it onto one person it's
probably closest to Chris's but it's
more nonlinear so I grew up thinking I
wanted to be a doctor so I went off to
college and I did a bio major and then
thought I really don't want to be a
doctor I you know I want to discover new
things so uh and as I was doing pre-med
I took some physics which I thought I
wouldn't like and I fell in love with it
because it was a great way for me of
looking at the world like Jeannette
Wayne talks about computational thinking
for me his physics way of thinking
everything I looked at I started to
model which was so much fun for me and
so I decided I would go off to physics
graduate school which I did at Princeton
my father was very disappointed
seriously because he wanted me to be a
doctor
he's not disappointed anymore and and so
I I went to physics graduate school and
I did mathematical physics because I
love math not apparently very useful for
anything but a great way of viewing the
world came out of there and everyone
said okay get a professorship right away
I said no no no I want to learn more do
more before I have to start teaching did
two postdocs then decided to get a job
as a math professor so I was a
mathematics professor for 12 years
working on phase transitions and then
heard about this really cool problem of
phase transitions and computationally
intractable problems so you know like
Chris was saying when you take the
insights of one field which are found by
really incredibly smart people and
you're the one who takes them to the
next field
but he thinks you're really smart
because you're bringing these brilliant
ideas they're not I mean you know a
little bit of credit for realizing they
might apply but it's a great thing to do
to know different things and go into the
world with these lenses and see the
world through these different lenses and
so I started doing that it turned out in
my physics class at graduate school
there had been a guy who founded
Microsoft Research Nathan Myhrvold so
eighteen years ago he said come to
Microsoft everybody thought I was crazy
why did I go to Microsoft I didn't know
how to code there were no mathematicians
there there were no physicists there
there were no theoretical computer
scientists there I was giving up tenure
I have a wonderful husband who's sitting
in the first row Christian Borges who
also gave up tenure he gave up a chaired
professorship in Germany and we went to
Microsoft and we started this group
called the theory group which brought
together mathematicians and physicists
and theoretical computer scientists and
over the years you know this mathematics
way of viewing the worlds as a graph as
you heard you know it applies to these
big social networks and then I realized
Oh social okay so I know math and
physics and I actually I know some some
computer science now but if you don't
think about human beings as Raj told us
you miss everything you just do stupid
models that don't correspond that how
human beings really act so I pitched
forming some new labs first one in the
Boston area and then one in the New York
City area with social scientists as well
as computer scientists thinking
computationally and mathematically and
with physics models and so that's what
I'm doing now and I just I think that
you know you don't have to do it in a
linear fashion you do have to be
passionate you do have to be willing to
work hard but the amazing thing about
research is that you know you get this
vision and you can help to create
this new world and you know it's just
it's so much fun because as the world
around you changes the more lenses you
have the more you can view it from
different perspectives so I know you
guys want to get jobs and you want to be
nicely self-supporting and everything
and that's fantastic but if you want to
dictate your own future a little bit I
think PhD is a great thing to have of
course you don't have to have it I mean
you know Bill Gates didn't have it and
you know didn't have an undergraduate
degree and you know Mark Zuckerberg
didn't have and these are amazing people
you know see jobs amazing person
but don't just think linearly and don't
think I want to reach the top because
the top doesn't really make sense okay
think I want to reach something
interesting and how do I do that
so that's that's my advice okay so now
for the
so um the next question and we're not
gonna have very much time it looks like
but so maybe just a couple of you will
answer this there's this balance that we
all do between doing things in depth and
things that are important and we know
how to do and taking risks you know and
I think in the beginning you can't just
take risk take risk taste take risk
because you have to be deep and learn
how to contribute to something but one
of the problems of growing older is
somehow it's easier just to keep doing
the same thing so how do you balance you
know yourself among those quadrants that
you saw in you know in Kunduz picture
this morning how do you over your career
you know sometimes do sustaining
research sometimes blue sky but
sometimes disrupt it you know how do you
balance risk and depth this way yes
maybe I can use this as an excuse to
tell my stories I think it provides a
little a little answer to this this is a
fun story but it also taught me a lot
about research and it goes back to the
time that I was a very junior researcher
I just finished my PhD I just gone into
the into the fusion program we're trying
to get the energy out of water
essentially and I was lucky enough to
collaborate I was in a team of five
people working on a problem I hadn't
posed the problem somebody else who had
realized this was interesting but I was
the most junior researcher and I was
collaborating with some you know one
very famous people you know that people
were very well-established researchers
and I should just explain briefly the
idea is that you take you take the
hydrogen out of water and then you heat
it up to two hundred million degrees and
you trap it in a magnetic field a sort
of magnetic bottle and hydrogen turns
into helium and produce lots of cheap
clean energy but the problem is this
this hot gas this plasma is very
unstable and the written because it's
unstable that's why fusion research is
so my fusion is so difficult so
something's come up with the idea that a
change in the shape of the magnetic
bottle might get rid of
very important instability and if that
were true it would be a very significant
result so we're working on a problem
that we were very excited about because
if we get rid of this instability we'd
have done something really special and
and so we worked very hard we did lots
of algebra we wrote the software we ran
all the computer experiments we plotted
the graphs and it was a negative result
the instability didn't go away so we'd
worked very hard we're very excited it
was a rather disappointing result but it
was a useful result to know so he
published it it got published in the top
journal and then we kind of went on to
different projects winter separate ways
and a few months later I realized we've
done something not quite right and not
that we've done anything wrong our
results weren't wrong but we've used
would use the wrong quant we'd use a
dimensional quantity instead of a
dimensionless one it was a very subtle
point but I got very excited I thought
maybe if we redid the calculations and
redid the plots in a different way using
the correct quantity it would make a
difference maybe we'd get rid of the
instability after all so I went
excitedly and talked to these you know
more established researchers and they
said yeah Chris technically you are
right but I it's unlikely to make a
change I don't I don't think you know
it's really worth going to all the
effort and bothering with and but I'm
just kind of you know young and stupid
and naive and ignorant and all those
things and I kind of really wanted to
pursue this so I and I got hold of the
code and and the person had written it
took me through it and and I made the
necessary changes and got him to check
them and so on and I spent several weeks
redoing these plots whom I thought was
the correct way and on to my amazement I
discovered that this instability did go
away and this was this was very exciting
and and I said of course we've got to
publish this and my my colleagues my
collaborators were incredibly generous
they said well Chris you know you did
this if I hadn't you know we published
the first paper already you did this
extra bit you went this sort of last
mile probably you should publish it as a
so author so we're very generous they
let me publish this as a as the sole
author and it was fantastic and I ended
up the next twelve months I was invited
to give Kino
every major fusion conference around the
world about six months after we
published the the the world's biggest
fusion experiment multi hundred million
dollar experiment in Oxford conducts its
of experiments and they verified that
this effect was real it was incredibly
exciting and it made a tremendous
difference to my career and I guess the
the thing that I learned then and by
then I'd probably pub published half a
dozen papers a dozen papers but when I
look back on the eight years that I
spent in infusion there was one paper
that really made my career and the
dozens of other papers if I'd never
written them if I only ever published
that one paper my career would have been
just the same so the the real lesson
that I learned is that in research it's
better to do just one one really
important thing than hundreds of of
merely good things so it's it the
answers a little bit tough in a sense
but it's really you know if you want to
do well in research have a great career
really make yourself think about
important problems go after those
important problems and persevere really
stick with it those problems will be
easy to solve because somebody else
would have would have done it so pick an
important problem and persevere with the
problem so that that was the lesson
either a clear one Oh was clarify a
couple of things Chris said because some
of you may not have understood that and
the reason is because most of you
probably are not exposed to research he
talked about publishing papers dozen
papers one of them and this is an
important part of the way in which you
do research see when you do research you
know you don't just solve the problem
and then go away
researchers is it's a community process
it's an entirely social process all of
us here you know who are researchers are
talk to each other we don't talk to each
other you know like meeting in a place
or having a conversation but we you know
let other people know about what we did
through these mechanisms like write it
as a paper publish it in a conference or
a journal now this is actually
an important test of your caliber when
you do that there's a huge process of
review the results have to be good the
pavement has to be well-written and
there is a some organization or a
committee of you know research senior
researchers that select it and once your
result
you know result you know gets published
and of course you often get invited to
talk about it and that's how you
communicate to other researchers what
you did and that triggers you know some
reaction on their part they are
influenced by what you did and may go
and work on some other aspect of the
problem and goes back and forth and I
you know community forms around a
problem so Jennifer asked about you know
going in depth or bread bread it's
something that you'll figure out when
you go out there and engage in research
but what I would say if you start by
solving problems and go deeper and
deeper you don't start by you know doing
an overview however once you get there
you'll find there's a lot of you know
site problems other problems similar
problems new problems that that you'll
encounter that will naturally take you
to where you want to go so the beauty of
beauty of research actually going into a
carrier in researches you actually don't
have to plan your life at all and and
you know you you get taken to different
places simply by the fact that you know
once you do something you get influenced
by something else and it's it's kind of
you know it may be nonlinear but it's
not entirely discontinuous and you learn
and the things that you learn from
solving one problems will apply to
another the methodologies will apply and
I mean the whole journey is like a
journey in the middle and you don't have
to 1020 colleagues in an office you have
one hundred thousand two thousand four
ten thousand colleagues around the world
it's very rich experience
can I quickly add something so I think
everything Anand said is correct the
other thing I would just add to that
actually this is not answering the
question you asked but I guess we went
in a different direction so we'll go
with that when Allen says is the other
thing that is very important is to
surround yourself with very smart people
I think that is to me that has been the
key because they up your game right no
matter where your limits are your limits
get extended if you're around people who
are critical thinkers who can actually
challenge you who are not afraid so for
example when you if you go to grad
school which I recommend and we which I
you know encourage you to do be bee
completely open about challenging your
professors I know the culture is
different I've grown in the same culture
I understand that but it's up to you to
change it you're the young generation so
so I challenge them they are smart
they've got experience and similarly
when you find jobs it's not just the
money that should attract you it should
be the caliber of the people you're
going to work with because they are the
ones that are going to influence your
life as you move on and they will keep
pushing you to the next level of things
that eventually you'll end up in a place
where you hopefully you really like
believe it or not we seem to be out of
time or about pardon yes we're we're out
of time for the fixed part of this which
is fine so I hope hearing all of this
kind of craziness about this journey
which is a wonderful journey and it's
different for each person and you bring
in so many things and you think about
all the kinds of things that we heard in
the talks this morning about advancing
the state of the art about asking the
questions about how your technology is
being used and not just saying I'm a
computer scientist I'm a physicist but
what would a psychologist say and how
are people gonna look at this and then
also understanding why there is this big
gap that had talked about in the jobs
and computer science but if there's
somebody sitting out here
who doesn't have a degree in computer
science and it's the key I did the right
thing
no you didn't do the wrong thing you can
take that mechanical engineering degree
or that math degree or that physics
degree and you can do computer science
and you can do data science yes you have
to learn something but you know it's not
I mean I didn't know how to code you
know and I went to Microsoft and started
a group it's okay
I knew something okay and and hopefully
all of you know something and make sure
you know that something well
each year microsoft research house
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
