in this short video I'm gonna walk you
through adding the Microsoft translator
widget to your tumbler so that it can be
read by people all over the world I'll
let you know upfront that this will
involve a little bit of coding but
whether you know how to code or not the
steps are all pretty easy let's get
started here's my tumblr dashboard first
I need to get the code snippet to
install the translator widget on my page
I'll open up a new tab and go to wwm IQ
soft translator comm slash widget here I
can look through all the different
options of how to customize the widget
for my page I can change the website
language in case I write my posts in a
language other than English I can change
the color of the widget so that it will
look better on a dark or light
background and I can let other people
suggest alternative translations to the
ones provided by Microsoft translator
I'm fine with the defaults here so next
I'll just copy all of the code in the
grey box and go back to tumblr from my
dashboard I'll click on customize which
will take me to my customization screen
now I need to add the code that I just
copied from the translator widget site
to my tumblr code up here in the left
under the name of my tumblr theme you'll
see it says edit HTML when I click on it
it shows me all of the code I just need
to find the right place to add it every
Tumblr theme is going to be a little bit
different but as a general rule the best
place to add the widget code is just
before the body tag to find this press
ctrl F to search the code and then type
in the less than sign and the word body
this should highlight the body tag in
the code now you can just paste the
widget snippet right after the next
greater than sign most of the time this
will be right after the word body now
press update preview save and exit out
of the customization screen
now when you reopen your blog the
translator widget will appear at the top
of the page I'll just test it out here
quickly here's my tumbler in Spanish
French and Arabic there are a few things
you'll want to keep in mind first the
theme that you've chosen may slightly
affect the way the widget looks in most
cases the widget will still work the
same but if you don't like the way that
it looks you may want to change your
theme also there are some themes that
may not let you use the widget for
instance some themes may place an
overlay above the widget which makes it
so that you can't click it next you
don't necessarily need to add the widget
snippet right below the body tag if you
know how to code or just want to play
around you can add it wherever you want
what you've done here is create a custom
themed tumbler if you ever switch to
another theme you'll have to reinstall
the widget this also helps in case you
put the code somewhere that the widget
doesn't quite look right you can just
reapply the original theme and will look
just like it did before you added the
widget code lastly just a note the
widget will only work on text that is
typed into your Tumblr posts it won't
translate anything that is contained
within an image thanks for watching this
video you should now be able to add the
Microsoft translator widget to your
tumbler so that can be read by people
around the globe if you need more
information about Microsoft translator
and the widget you can find it at WWE
Microsoft comm slash translator thanks
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
