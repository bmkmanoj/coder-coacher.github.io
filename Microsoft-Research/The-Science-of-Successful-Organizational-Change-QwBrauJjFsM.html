event where we're hosting Paul Gibbons
the author of the science of successful
organizational change my name is JP
manty I work in culture and change here
at Microsoft and I had the pleasure of
reading Paul's book and reaching out to
Paul to try and ask him how some of his
ideas might help us in our culture
change here at Microsoft and so that led
to a series of extremely valuable and
interesting conversations and connected
with Amy Draves to be able to host Paul
here so the the really great thing from
my perspective as somebody who geeks out
on a lot of this culture stuff I read a
lot of books a lot of research follow a
lot of experts Paul's book and his
thinking really influenced and changed
the way I think about culture change and
systems that drive human flourishing and
so it's a real honor and privilege to
have Paul here today please welcome Paul
Gibbons thank you thanks thanks JP and
and thanks Amy for making this happen
and thanks to Microsoft I'm having had
to come clean I'm having a kid in a
candy store experience now I've grown up
I grew up programming with computers and
playing with computers and Microsoft's
been part of my life albeit I was in
Europe and so your 6,000 miles ago is a
little inconvenient but part of a part
of my life for one way or the other for
almost 40 years or thirty five years now
how old is Microsoft by the way 30 79
was it 30 39 years old fabulous it's
great to be here um I wrote this book
and I hope you'll evaluate F of one of
the discounted copies and if you can't
do that I hope you avail yourself one of
the very very expensive copies that are
on sale afterwards I had an argument
with my publisher I submitted this book
in the end of 2013 and she called me up
one afternoon she said I got some bad
news for you I want you to take out a
section and so a great personal risk and
I'll put that SEC
into this talk because I think it's
something that I want to say that she
felt would be too controversial so
perhaps it may or may not be
controversial to you you know the title
of the section was there's all this talk
about happiness making us miserable so
everywhere you look we have happiness
screaming at us from the bookshelves and
Barnes and Noble is smiling people with
beautiful smiles and tans both telling
us that happiness is important and also
telling us how to get it and I don't
think that either of those two things
are necessarily true there are lots of
ways to define the value of a life the
Greek philosophers talked about virtues
and the good life is being the virtuous
life now that sounds very moralistic
today but they didn't mean moralism in
the sense that we might use it today
them encourage prudence temperance piety
rationality and reason freedom
friendship those are the things to the
Greeks that were constitutive of the
good life and not being happy and so I I
invite us to conduct a thought
experiment to someone summiting Everest
are they happy is that the way with the
first thing you think of did mother
Teresa organize her time around being
happy Nelson Mandela environmental
activists who are trying to make the
world a better place at least in their
mind are they are they happy is that how
they think about things what about a
schoolteacher what about the parent of a
sick child are caring for a sick friend
does that make people happy and so by
narrowly defining the good life in terms
of happiness I think and this is one
contribution rose from the Greeks
is the more you try and seek happiness
the more unhappy you'll be one of the
things I do say in the book I think is
quite an entertaining there's no more
guarantee of unhappiness is comparing
yourself to someone and thinking that
you ought to be happier that they're
happier than you you're you ought to be
as happy as them so I think it's an
error and we have good news though the
psychologists in the last fifteen years
of the 21st century if you want have
come up with a notion that's really
close to what the Greeks did 2500 years
ago
and it's called human flourishing now
how many people have heard of human
flourishing is that an ignite so made
its way into the of course the og
consultants all have all the hands got
shut up in the air so perhaps this will
be of some interest um human flourishing
is the notion that yes happiness is
important but you don't get happy by
focusing on happiness so there are four
other dimensions to human flourishing as
contemporary psychologists think of it
one of them is spiritual fulfilment but
that effectively means doing meaningful
work work that matters work that makes a
difference the second thing is doing
work that engages you fully that uses
the maximum of your human capabilities
the third thing is having nurturing and
productive relationships nothing
predicts well-being and wellness more
than having great relationships the
Harvard Health Study when the largest
cohorts ever studied that was the
predictor of longevity and wellness
rather than other outcomes and so and
then finally achievement we're human
beings we are drawn to achieve to climb
the Everest go to the moon to build
corporations and cathedrals that's one
of the things we do and so if you look
at all five of those dimensions you
begin to get a rounder picture of what
the good life might be so this is a talk
about business and it's a talk to
business people and so why do I mention
that is that the question I have and I
think it's a question I'm dissatisfied
with the answer is that is work and
workplaces as currently designed are
they designed to promote human
flourishing is that one of the things
that we take seriously when we build
corporations today and the answer is I
don't think we do I don't I think people
as human beings one of the things that
makes work valuable is that it has
special meaning for us do we design
workplaces around meaning for people do
we design workplaces so that people are
maximally engaged so that we're using 80
90 percent 100 percent hundred ten
percent of what people are capable the
exhilaration of using all of yourself
one psychologist guy called Mihai
Csikszentmihalyi
the most unpronounceable name in
psychology Hungarian name to find flow
experience you know sports athletes
by being in the zone chess players talk
about being in the zone and the ball is
this big so he defined flow experiences
when you're using so much of your own
capacities the world disappears it's
almost becomes a meditation or zen-like
so maximal engagement and then are we
designing workplaces for relationships
for networks and communities are we
designing workplace for politicking and
infighting and you know we design work
places that are deleterious to the
formation of humors these are we
designing workplaces so that human
beings can achieve things that matter to
them and I think largely the answer is
no largely we design businesses with
other things in mind is there one
provocation I have is that we ought to
be thinking more about designing
businesses around human flourishing so
the three more if you permit me a little
bit more of a philosophical digression
before I go into science and
organizational change which is as we say
ending on what it said on the tin so my
my further of philosophical digressions
are if that's one thing that we ought to
design businesses around is human
flourishing here's three more the thing
that I love most in life is science I
think science is one of the things that
dignifies human civilization signs our
name a few other things and
unfortunately science by itself without
business would stay in the laboratory
bench or an obscure journals of Noma
never reads business to my mind if we
insofar as we're able to bring
technology and science for the
betterment of human beings the seven
point four billion on the people it's
businesses who perform that role and
that to me is a sacred role that to me
is the sacred the job that businesses
does scaling Science and Technology um
the other thing and this is a notion
that comes from mark Karl Marx who's not
the most read management thinker in the
Canon don't terribly popular in the
United States although Donald Trump I'm
sure is considering adopting so this was
probably not so so he had a notion
check this out as a notion that work was
what dignified us as human beings and
there was enormous dignity not just in
working though in working together
that's what we did
incredibly specially and differently as
human beings has come together to create
magical wonderful things that none of us
can do by herself and in our culture
unfortunately clarify the individual
rather too much and we don't think about
to do anything of any value in a complex
world today for the most part you need
you need gangs of people whether it be
cathedrals or computers or the
international space station or the
internet or whatever it is
so workplaces ought to be places where
human beings can come together to create
magic that we can't do by ourselves and
then and then the final thing is
businesses and this is my great hope the
21st century ought to be do things that
are a value to humankind
so when I think about that one of the
one of the things I think about is if we
had a get an individual if you had a
very dear friend who was brilliant and
talented and you saw them wasting their
life with trivia the trivial and the
mundane you're really disappointing to
you would it not well as I look at if
you look at a human civilization if you
take that a step further if you look at
what we do as a civilization with all
the talent and the brilliance and the
energy and the vision and the
imagination of what humans are capable
and you look at the things on which we
squander some of our intellectual
resources are we working on the right
things
do we need thousands of people to design
a new kind of toothpaste yeah do we need
all of the heart all of the economic
energy and all the vitality of our
civilization is enough of that pointed
towards things that increase human
flourishing human wellbeing around the
world and I think the answer is clearly
no and we ought to be able to and this
is a great hopeful 21st century design
economic structures and that includes
business that promote human wellness
human flourishing in ways that we don't
and redirect our energy towards things
that matter and redirect our energy away
from the trivial away from the mundane
way for the banal and away from the
vulgar I'm using that word and the words
the way that Latins use it the base if
you
and so that's a great hope that I have
and so with those philosophical
reflections and that was the bit that
got struck from my book by the editor
all those 18 months ago so I hope that
wasn't um wasn't too tedious if I may
talk about something that is in the book
it's about behavioural change and if I
may be overly blunt we suck at
behavioural change we're really really
bad
we're really really bad as individuals
we're really really bad as businesses
and we're really really bad as a society
and so you know this first I had an
idealized notion when I was 33 about how
people might change their was if we had
enough reasons enough rationality this
is an Aristotelian notion we would
automatically change and so I was a
little disappointed I became mentoring
consultants in 1993 I went to work for a
British bank called Barclays Bank
we designed a risk management framework
I was a mathematician on the team and we
and I wrote you know under 50 pages full
of equations we wrote 2,400 pages worth
of report for Barclays Bank in England
we charged him four million bucks
there's a nice little living back in the
day they did nothing with it nothing it
landed on a shelf and eventually he
found his way into bottom drawers and
then from bottom drawers it find its way
into circular filing cabinets this is an
extraordinary thing I thought because I
was an idealist thing magic was all I
know this guy's gonna make a difference
silly me
and in fact they did nothing with it and
what Barclays failed to do was to mind
the gap between thinking something is a
good idea and actually doing it just
pretty big back gap and in corporations
we ought to be able to align our
behaviors with our strategies with our
intentions with our plans it's a tricky
thing and we're not too good at it as
though most people who are comment on
organizational change would say the
thing that dams lots of organizational
changes if inability to change behaviors
so if you'll permit me a personal
anecdote in 1980 I was working in a
laboratory
University of Wisconsin are studying
cancer and I apologize advance the
people who are and animal rights people
or ninety vivisectionist people's anyway
I was experimenting on little white mice
it's the nineteen eighty I didn't know
any better anyway so I'm expecting a
little white mice I'm getting a little
white mice cancer and I'm studying the
effect of the drug that I'm giving them
on RNA and DNA synthesis using work
right and you know the noblest outcome
from that work we understand DNA are
they synthesis in the effect of this
talks and on mice and we help you know
design a cure for cancer it's not
without noble purpose and the toxin that
I was administering to the Vice came
from cigarette smoke scald dimethyl
benzene thirteen and it's a big paula
cyclic hydrocarbon and it gives mice
cancer because human beings cancer too
and so what I used to do is I used to do
my experiments they used to got in the
parking lot in smoke and for 20 years I
smoked a pack of Marlboro red a day so
here I was producing cancer research
firsthand with my you know all my
rational faculties at my disposal one
would think and the younger on having a
smoke ingesting the same thing which I
saw delivering cancer before my very
eyes a strange thing isn't it so a by
then medieval in the 90s I wanted to
quit smoking and then again I was
confronted with behavioral change of the
gap between intentions and actions what
I wish to do with my life and how I wish
to live my life and how my life actually
looks and I society it's a sad thing
about the obesity epidemic you know I
would say something and partly worldwide
where people can afford to eat it but
it's a sad thing about the obesity and
ninety five people of percent of people
who are obese want to lose weight
it's an enormous public health program
but it's not a public health problem
that people are sincere their intention
wanting to be thinner for whatever
reason only five percent lose ten
percent of their body weight in the
given year none of those them many of
those relapse the year after this is a
sad thing so as a society and as
individuals and as corporations we're
really really bad at behavioral change
and behavioral changes matters what
comes out of people's mouths their
intentions
is a beautiful thing but if they have
behaviors don't line up mm-hm what have
you got you've got I believe the
technical term for it is B yes the gap
between what we desire and what we want
and what we think is important and what
we're actually able to do so why does
this come about this interesting
question and if you'll forgive yet
another philosophical digression it goes
back to the history of ideas and history
of psychology so psychology is to be
part of philosophy and then about 1900 a
group of experimental psychologists
began to do psychological experiments so
it became a science in its own right in
my view it became a science in a way
that chemistry became a science in 1650
yeah it's still super primitive still a
lot of sidled suku pseudoscience still a
lot of hokum still a lot of myths still
a lot of pop psychology corrupting
psychological science as it is but
anyway we have psychological science in
the early part of the last century
couple guys called BF Skinner and Jamie
Watson perhaps you've heard of them
their ideology or their methodological
approach to psychology was called
behaviorism and you recognize some words
from behaviorism you'll recognize
stimulus and response rewards and
Punishment characteristics so those are
all behaviorist notions and every time
you punish a child with what we call the
naughty step in England what do you call
it in America who'd be caused a naughty
step in America you put a kid down
timeout timeout was that we've got you
call it timeout every time you
incarcerate a criminal to change their
behavior ostensibly you're endorsing a
behaviorist philosophy which is that
human beings change their behavior in
response to environmental stimuli
punishments and rewards every time you
compensate an executive with stock
options ostensibly
to increase their performance you're
endorsing a behaviorist notion of
behaviorist philosophy and as you can
see some of that legacy persists today
so it was largely discredited
intellectually in the 60s and 70s
methodological II it wasn't very robust
it's also coercive so any time you try
and coerce someone with a reward or a
sanction or a punishment you're
indifferent to their internal states
their mind their thoughts their feelings
so behaviorism was coercive so enter the
really really cuddly hippie 60s in the
time of humanistic psychology and what
we decided in the 60s 70s and 80s that
to change behavior you wanted to change
thoughts and feelings first that makes
sense right you want to change people's
insides to change their outsides how
many people have heard something like
that and change your incisors change
your outsides is some sort of
psychological mantra okay and so that's
what we do so imma change consultant for
my sins for the last 20 years I've been
in organizations helping create
behavioral change on my good days or so
much on my bad days sermon organizations
we're trying to change and generally
speaking I don't do it through carrots
and sticks I do it through inspiration
vision business cases rationality on one
dimension you might say on emotions on
another dimension and so that's the
model of how we change behavior that we
inherited from the 60s 70s and 80s so
question is does it work well there are
two problems who's never had a fight on
Facebook with someone from an
ideological opposite come on now get
those hands up you all have Donald Trump
friends on your in your who has ever
presented this friend with facts to
counteract contradict their point of
view you have was your experience of
doing so you had some positive
experiences that make not usually no not
usually
who else has been able to change
someone's mind with the presentation of
fact none really work right well anyway
so there's dude at Michigan State
University is a Miss Brendan Nyhan he's
professor there in public policy Brendan
Nyhan talks about something called a
backfire effect so the backfire effect
is just won't surprise anybody who's
ever had a fight on Facebook right if
you provide someone who's reasoning is
what we call in psychology motivated
reasoning emotive reasoning if you
prevent someone who's ideologically
committed with facts you know what
happens to our opinion they strengthen
it in that extraordinary thing then the
climate change deniers and the
anti-vaxxers and the world full of
people who
you think when we had science at our
disposal and we presented it in front of
people
beautifully arrayed in front of them
they ought to say thank you thank you
for the benefit of your wisdom I shall
change immediately it doesn't really
happen that way so but even let's say in
organisations we were able to change
hearts and minds right so we are so say
I'm a super-duper charismatic leader I'm
a fantastic change manager I'm really
good at creating intellectual rational
business cases I'm SuperDuper good
inspiration and motivating I involve my
stakeholders really really well I'm
beginning to change hearts and minds so
say I do that super well do behaviors
follow well do they not nearly often
enough because as we've discussed and as
we've explored and as most of us know
from our own experience as a gap between
people what people want to do what they
desire what's in their heads what comes
out of their mouths and what they're
able to do and so that model that
two-step model is fraught with problems
so here we are we come through the 20th
century we come into the 21st century
this would be a horrible talk yeah this
guy come in from England and all he did
was tell us about all horrible things
that don't work in the world so let me
tell you about some things that do work
in the world but I want to preface it by
saying the following we haven't won the
game of changing behaviors don't by any
stretch of the imagination so when I
said that the social sciences are like
chemistry was in the 1650s I wasn't
kidding
you know I I my impression of the social
sciences is were still groping around we
need a certain amount of humility about
what we find out in the social sciences
but there are some things we're learning
and it's something I call in the book
nearby be Hoch behaviorism ever like
most authors today ever after the
neologism which makes you seem just to
set you apart from the crowd
so my neologism is near behaviorism and
the way it works I'm getting the three
examples of the way it works so one neo
behaviorist idea comes from a guy who's
spoken here I think recently you guys
have had Charles Twohig
in recently sohe's Superbook brilliant
book practical book lots of insights I
won't try and comment on his you know
overall an excellent contribution so
there's some three things about habits
change his books call the power of habit
that we need to know and these are super
practical so one is motivation isn't
your friend so we all think in order to
change our habits we need to motivate
habits motivation is like this
motivation is related to arousal of the
synthetic nervous system yeah so that's
one thing our state of how much
excitement we feel no not that kind of
arousal no not know the other kind of
arousal the physiologist talked about
and it's also related to the narratives
we have which change yeah so our level
of arousal and the enactors they produce
our motivation what's up and down who
some days you're feeling it and some
days you're not so when you have a habit
habits tend to run transcend motivation
and so the very powerful idea and books
like the power of habit is once you get
the habit your motivation can do what it
likes but you have the habit so that's
one thing and there are two really
SuperDuper practical tips one is mini
habits and I think this is a fascinating
idea so if you start really really small
what does your intuition tell you if you
meditated say five minutes a day for six
days consecutively or you meditated one
day for thirty minutes which is better
was your intuition tell you every day
how come because you're building a habit
yeah and after 30 or 45 or 60
repetitions roughly speaking it'll be
ingrained and you know I know people you
know a guy a guy who's been meditating
for 20 years he can't not this guy
cannot go to bed without that's it he
just can't you know I was like brushing
his teeth you know like feels weird to
him and so once you have a habit like
that your motivation may fluctuate as it
will but you have a habit so many habits
is an excellent way to get yourself in
the game the second way is a 30 day
challenge and this is something that's
really really fun to do in your own
lives and your personal lives and your
professional eyes is take on a 30 day
challenge so I use an example from my
experience as a parent so if I
to my son you know I want you to do 30
minutes extra math until you finish high
school just six more years right he look
at me as if I was from Mars and it would
be a fight every single day well we set
a challenge in April he said look you
want to do really well on this test in
May here's the deal
let's do a 30-day challenge do 30
minutes on Khan Academy every day for 30
days and then you're done you know what
he doesn't suffer about it all he comes
straight home well he throws down his
back he doesn't do any minutes Khan he
gets on with his life
we're done with 30 days and you know
what he said I'd like to do another 30
day challenge this one he's gonna write
for 15 minutes today his certain amount
of talent and creative writing so a 30
day challenge is long enough so you
begin to get the habit but it's short
enough so it doesn't feel like a life
sentence right doesn't feel like you're
awesome I like how am I possibly gonna
manage right so those are really two I
think
SuperDuper practical things that we can
think about one we want to change habit
so there's two more things in the area
of neo behaviorism that we can think
about when we change behaviors in the
21st century one is called choice
architecture has anybody read a book
called nudge anybody one two three or
four so half a dozen of you that's
tremendous is one of the most important
books and I think that's been written in
the last 15 or 20 years and I think its
power has not even begun to be tapped so
Thaler and Sunstein wrote a book called
nudge and they are employed in fact the
UK government has actually got a nudge
team I think they called the behavioural
insights team using what I'm about to
describe in public policy evidence-based
Public Policy so making public policy in
accord with what the science would tell
us such a strange thing you know strange
straight thing especially living at the
time we do because public policy is
determined by what ideology politics
dogmatism
habit ritual whatever you want certainly
not rational right certainly not
evidence-based so this book the
behavioural insights team are really
working hard to create evidence-based
changes in public policy based on this
idea of nudge so what's the idea of
nudge the idea of nudge is you can shape
people's behaviors by changing the
environment okay that's not super duper
radical shape their behaviors by
chaining the environment but the great
thing about it is you leave them at
liberty to choose
so in a sense is not coercive it's
certainly not as coercive as rewards and
sanctions punish them if they do it and
reward them if they do the opposite
right it's not that question so here's
an example if I'm a school cafeteria
manager and I want the children suite in
a more healthy way I can put research
shows the healthy food at eye level or I
could put it early in the line so by the
time they get to the Doritos and the
pizzas down here and the coca cola's
they're gonna fool ya tray so that makes
sense right in research that's what they
do they pick the stuff that's I'll ever
learn early on the line so I can arrayed
the choices that choice architecture
it's called of the lunch line either so
they eat more healthily but how else
could I arrange those choices so I make
more money so I could do the high margin
stuff up front the drear's and the
coca-cola and the pizzas and the profit
processed food I could do the older food
that's about to expire like the doing
supermarkets if the old stuff at the
front but one of the things I can do
using choice architecture is promote
healthy choices but the kids can still
have as much pizza and Doritos as they
want but I'm a making easier for them to
make the right choices so that's choice
architecture in a nutshell is changing
the environment and there have been a
lots of experiments done in various
spheres in it I still think it hasn't
reached deeply into the organized
organization development change
management organizational behavior word
world
I just don't think organizational change
practitioners who do what I do for a
living are paying enough attention to
some of these ideas and perhaps we are
here I mean has to be an interesting
conversation here so some of the things
they've done is most people save far too
little so even when there's free money
on the table like an employer
contributes to your 401k they match the
contribution or some percentage of the
contribution people leave that money on
the table they don't take up this 401k
option so one of the interesting
experiments and again the idea the
wonderful thing about this is you can
measure results they ran an education
program for this side of the room on
savings the virtue of savings they had a
financial wizard wise guy up there
telling people they ought to save more
and 401k enrollments went up 7%
on this side of the room they use choice
architecture which is basically arraying
the choices
in a way that was pro savings if you
will one hundred percent increase so
here is education trying to change
hearts and minds and hoping the behavior
follows and here is choice architecture
and so one of the other striking
examples for this is organ donation so
some places in the world they have like
95 percent organ donation like Austria
right you know why you know why
Jeff topped out you're an organ donor
unless you say you don't want to do this
too gross right in the United States
mostly you have to opt in there are some
states have switched from opt-in to
opt-out you know what happens it goes
from like ten percent to ninety percent
that's choice architecture at work
because you can change the default
settings so those are some ideas and I
think again these are things that we're
still learning how to do this book only
came out in one thing I think nudge came
out in 2009 or 2011 she's a relatively
recent idea and I'm skating a lot of
popularity
I think thankfully in the right circles
and so um the very last idea on
behavioral change that I'll close with
it's called behavioral specificity so we
think about resistance to change in a
really weird way there's a concept that
is all throughout the organization
development change management literature
is written change and so the way I was
taught it when I went through this huge
investment in my education as a change
guy in 1995 is that resistance to change
was either they objected to the
rationality of the proposal so they
thought it was a bad idea intellectually
as possible or they had some emotional
response so they were afraid they're
angry they were threatened in some way
so that's entirely too narrow a way to
look at resistance to change so we've
already talked about one way that people
resist change is Cristin habit it's not
that they don't want to there's nothing
they don't think it's a good idea it's
not that they're not motivated they have
habits to do otherwise but we don't
think about resistance to change enough
in the organization development change
Mountain community is how do I change
people's habits
and that's really the way we want to
think when we work in culture we think
of culture I'm gonna be super
controversial here as the words that
comes out of people's mouths and that is
really really the tip of the culture
iceberg because you know what just not a
lot of Correspondence we know what comes
out of people's mouths and the behaviors
they actually follow you know if you ask
me what my values are I sound like a boy
scout yeah
really do I live like that absolutely
not I don't do anything like horribly
immoral right just want to hasten to add
but it's not like a life full of
integrity and vitality honesty and
drifty and service I mean I would love
it if it were but it's not you know I'm
very human in design but if you add do
value surveys and organizations we
frequently try and change culture and
organizations through changing what
comes out of people's mouths and we do
spend a lot of money there's a huge
industries it's probably a billion
dollar industry I think assessing
culture in organizations I think it's a
waste of money because you're assessing
what comes out of people's mouths and
then to change it then you try and
change what comes out of people's mouths
and I just don't think so if you look at
culture as a collection of habits as a
collection of rituals everything from
the way we conduct meetings to the way
we respond to emails if you look at
things like that culture as a collection
of behaviors well then there's something
tangible and meaningful that you can
change and so I think the culture change
industry needs a little shaken up and so
hopefully that's not too offensive to I
hope there's no one in makes their
living doing culture surveys in the room
so those are two ideas on I think the
way we need to think more about
behaviors and organizations and when
I've seen change fail it's inevitably
because people didn't spend enough time
thinking about the behaviors that we're
gonna make the change go they didn't
spend enough time helping the users use
the system helping the people in a
restructured organization helping them
behave differently which is what really
matters and so you know my career my
early change management career was
peppered with examples of trying to go
in and try
change behavior in organizations and
finding often that we've been called in
too late and that people were already
leaving in droves and that they were
trying to restructure an organization
without thinking it's all about changing
behaviors or change people's minds or
changing people's cultures so it's with
all of this stuff on behavioral change I
I want speaker there's a certain amount
of humility you know if someone says oh
you're an expert in change
I almost blush or cringe inside because
I don't think you know idea about what
an expert is isn't someone who's
skeptical or humble or much of a learner
we think of an expert as a guy the
ant-like the answer guy and I certainly
in the world of behavioral change don't
want to present myself as an answer guy
just because I think in the 21st century
the answers haven't been found but there
are some encouraging things and I think
we need to focus more on behaviors and
less on hearts and minds now people say
that sounds super duper callous I don't
mean it to be callous what people feel
and what they think has value in its own
right not just because it's a way to get
them to do what you want so I think
there is a place for engagement and for
hearts and minds and for having people
and organizations committed to the
mission and rationally committed to the
business case of the organization but I
think that's a value in its own right
and I think we can change behaviors in a
way that in a way we need to involve
them for sure in changing hearts and
minds but we can't assume ever that
behaviors will necessarily follow so I
painted I hope something of an
optimistic picture at the end I mean
we're learning a great deal about
behavioral change in the 21st century
and I think if we're going to create the
kind of corporations the kind of
businesses that I'd like to see I think
the kind of businesses that Microsoft
would like to become communities where
people come together to do magical
things that they couldn't do by
themselves places where we can scale
science and technology for the benefit
of humankind seven point four billion
people on the planet places where we
nurture relationships and where nature's
to grow and where structures that don't
have people fighting for resources
politically with one
if we can structure organizations and
decisions an organization around
evidence it would be a wonderful thing
and if we started to work on things that
more things that valued you know human
beings and organizations you want people
to engage with their work and to find
meaning in their work
why don't you stuff that values I I
submit you know this perhaps to
judgmental thing to say but you know
spending thousands of people trying to
launch the two hundredth kind of
toothpaste and the world is free sharing
a way of the amazing capability that
human beings have in the world our
imagination their intellect their
creativity their ability to work
together to create amazing things you
know just the pyramids were built long
ago over 3,000 years ago or something
like that that's a long time what are we
doing today that looks like a pyramid
what are we doing today that looks like
notre-dame cathedral because those were
monuments to the maximum what we could
achieve with art and science and
architecture and the time what are the
cathedrals that we're building today
you know what are the important projects
that are going to dignify us and two
hundred three hundred and five hundred
years people are gonna look back and
said look what those guys did
extraordinary thing and so I'd like
business to spend more time thinking
about that and a lot less time thinking
about the thousands different kind of
toothpastes which I not sure we need so
anyway thank you thank you for your
patience
have I gone overtime maybe we got time
for questions I don't know I hope I left
some you have any from the internet okay
great great great yes
my favorite diagrams you have in your
book is the four quadrant validity and
usefulness diagram where in the top
right quadrant it's the most valid and
those useful methods one of them is
Dweck's conception of growth mindset
versus fixed mindset yeah that's
dependence oh there's the wonderful
wonderful thing about that is it's
evidence-based isn't this lovely right
yeah so if you look around Microsoft
meeting rooms it's your big witness
you'll see little check boxes that say
are we is this meeting a growth mindset
meeting or a fixed mindset meeting and
in terms of changing people's behaviors
it seems obvious enough how and that
meeting you could say okay how are we we
have the habit of asking this question
but mine is from a choice architecture
perspective yes it seems like the front
of the buffet line if you will in the
meeting like that is to have what we've
always had right use fixed mindset a
meeting so how do we apply a choice
architecture framework in in the context
of establishing a growth mindset the
best question I've ever been asked
that's a really great question
so what we want to do is structure the
environment of the meeting so that
people will you know one of the things
it's a wonderful book the growth mindset
but I'm also just in the growth
behaviors that have to accompany the
growth mindset since I'm interested in
behaviors so she's what she's done is an
enormous value but I think you're
thinking along the right lines it's sort
of behaviors so how would you know
you're a movie camera watching this
meeting and recording this meeting how
would you know you can't see inside
people's heads how would you know the
growth growth mindset we're being used
so I think that's one possible path is
along the routes of behavioral
specificity how do you know someone in a
meeting is adopting the growth mindset
so that's interesting it's interesting
provocation I hope that's that's thing
and so the other question is choice are
is around choice architectures it's what
can we do in meetings you know and this
is a trivial example which I'm I don't
want to make too much of but
people hold meetings standing up in
order to change the rhythm of the
organization those 60 minute meetings
that make us all want to well I won't be
vulgar but anyway so so I think you've
asked a good question I can't come up
I'm not gonna come up I think you've
asked the right question and I just want
to like as I said it's well the best
questions I've ever been asked not
trying to give too glib or too fast and
answer to it but it's something I'd
really like to spend some time thinking
about that would be fun and perhaps if
you'll give me your card I'll have an
email exchange about it yes please hey
so culture change hasn't always been
just in business um I'm curious about if
you have any ideas around like not not
to glorify but like the way the Chairman
Mao do the Cultural Revolution in China
like you basically had to go into just
sack everybody thank so so if if a new
CEO was coming into a company you know
like though to burn it to the ground and
rebuild it oh yeah
perspective I mean like that that there
are other ways of changing behaviors
right like yeah peer yep you know like
did you have any firing everybody's a
really good way of changing sometimes
the stick isn't big enough yeah I'm not
big fan of sticks I mean they don't work
right the categorically categorically
don't work they change behavior in the
short term but you know if you throw
someone in jail you know they don't do
they'll commit many much crime where
they're in there this is a rout they're
back at it right now there's a lot and
there's a lot that goes into that
equation but punishment is very very bad
to change your behavior
what you do is buy your children lots of
therapy in the 70s some of the
industrial advanced they started out
like doing way more like performance art
where they would someone knew how to
play an instrument they would actually
give him a different instrument so they
would just have them like going and do
something that you've never done before
deliberately to get completely different
sounds and they
reigns's so that they could then like
you know manipulate it and we've paid
and right so so by so so we even not so
much firing everyone but even just
putting people in area a new situation
and your viewpoint changing their
experiences entirely like do you think
that that might like some twisting sorry
it's really linked to this growth
mindset question and the troika
architecture that would that would help
us growth might set of agriculture if
you will that's interesting it's almost
like you know again it's very good
question
so most like sometimes people have been
taught to write or draw with their left
hand and that different experiences and
that's a little bit like what you're
doing is asking people to play a
different instrument one that unload not
the one they're expert in or primary and
that's fascinating you know I think by
the way chairman mao's that great fan
obviously but one of the things he said
that's really intelligent has its own
Astra Maui throw democracy he says much
too early to tell I think that's quite
brilliant you know we think about change
we think far too narrowly and far too
short term about things so women's
suffrage was the beginning part of the
last century right we're still fighting
the fight 100 years on Emancipation
Proclamation in the United States is
1865 and in Europe they were freeing
slaves in the eighteen in the 1700s
right we're still fighting the fight you
know so the all of the great work of the
European enlightenment around human
rights was done 250 years ago we're
still fighting the fight on human rights
we're still figuring out in a sense the
implementation problems of these great
social change so social change takes it
looks to me like many centuries and so
the great ideas from the European
enlightenment democracy freedom liberty
freedom of expression free religion on
that great stuff we're still figuring
out like how the implementation looks I
think that's a cool thing the so people
get really frustrated the European Union
I may be political and philosophical for
a moment because it looks like a mess
from here right but forget 50 years into
the United States history you're a
bloody civil
toilet but Norden really told the place
apart European Union it's not even that
old was just barely that old so there's
interesting things these things I think
take a long time and part of the problem
or the problem I think as businesspeople
is were far too short-sighted partly
driven by the economic structures and
the need for capital the need for
demonstrate returns on a quarterly basis
and to need to feed the great mall that
is Wall Street yes JP a question about
building like conscious business or
systems of human flourishing I was
struck by a quote from the founder of
Whole Foods somebody asked him how would
you how can you make a big corporation
conscious and is that is that possible
his response was he thinks it's a much
more better use of energy to start a new
conscious business and so I'm thinking
about how startups have this opportunity
you didn't create a culture that is has
a much greater chance of being a
flourishing system but I'm seeing that
happen at Microsoft where I think
there's a positive change moving and so
as far as scale goes of shifting culture
have you seen any great examples of that
either in a smaller company or a larger
one present day that we might learn
something so the constant the
consciousness thing is an interesting
thing cuz it means so many things to so
many different people for some people
have a rationalistic conception of us
some people have a more spiritual
conception of it but let's take
consciousness for a moment just
awareness of the environment and enhance
almost like a mindful awareness so
that's really things holacracy tries to
do so how la crisi tries to get
everybody in the organization has since
closer to the customer so they they can
sense tensions between the purpose of
the company and where they want the
company to go and the as is what they're
feeling in the moment right there and so
that kind of consciousness and that
processing of tensions is something that
I think is one of the admirable things
about the Halak recei model is anybody
I'm not speaking
how much mumbo-jumbo is that Halak recei
a lot of mumbo-jumbo right a lot of
consulting speak it's a new
organizational model based around
organizational democracy it's really
good idea there's some interesting
there's some flaws with it but are some
interesting things about it is that
pointing the right direction this is an
example of that but just as far as like
for Microsoft holding a space of trying
to continue to make our culture better
do you see anybody that we can learn
from that um that has kind of done it
before and been successful whether small
or large cuz I see one of the things I
love about your book is you address
complexity which this is very much
complex organization and I just think
it's a an opportunity to continue to
explore to both learn from other people
as well as recognize that were unique
well there aren't you know the world
isn't replete with examples of huge
corporations radically changing their
culture like I don't think I'm very few
you might say IBM you could say IBM but
that's in fact I mean it's the only
example that springs to mind can anybody
else think of an organization a
corporation in the world that radically
had meant to their culture yes please
sir gee if you look at the period yeah
become the new I call as the operating
system an i or world of the industrial
yes yes yes possibly a very good idea
possibly a very good example what do you
think like Apple Apple was like in the
dump they were they were going out of
business and then jobs came back and all
of a sudden everything turned around
what do you think he did I think that he
printed things had a very strong like
guiding principle he burned it down
yeah it's an interesting idea so one of
the theories about organizational
cultures is really dependent on the
founders behavior and the founders
values and it's very hard once it's kind
of embedded ingrained embodies is very
hard to shift it so organizational
cultural theorists set it off this is
true and say that this place inevitably
has a whole lot of Bill Gates and Paul
Allen and whether you know the founders
values
rituals structures culture symbols
running around if that's true is that
true you know there's still a lot you
still feel a lot of bill gates in the
hole you know what I mean
I as accurate or not I don't know
hypothesis you think the culture is
changing yes/no question a lot of
leaders who got where they are now
yep thrived in a different environment
I'm not so sure whether or not those I
think there's a tension in leaders
feeling willing to change and delegate a
lot more of their responsibilities may
their most not having giving it to
people a new culture that sounds
positive sounds like that is happening
it's more about a lot less hierarchical
there's still legacy people are around
who are trying to chip their way of
operating so that sounds like this is
cool you know as someone who does a
bunch of research you know I'm up here
and y'all are down there but I could
really really spend like two weeks like
just roaming around this place and young
people talking to people learning from
people and plus that's my cookies in
this joint right let me tell me other
questions please yes please you look at
organizations how do you look at virtual
organizations because I have now
probably 80% of my meetings internally
or Skype I can go weeks without seeing
people on my team how do you how do you
see that because those relationships
those those you know norms and things
like that are very different when it's
all over Skype we have they're the same
but they're nevertheless almost every
bit as fixed right the virtual meeting
has its own rituals and its own you know
some operating system if you want as
well how much difference does it make
the difference between a virtual
organization and an organization where
people are physically co-located see
what people are thinking when you're in
the room I mean the thing can you see
into people's heads your total it's
amazing when you don't see people for
months at a time yeah if you see them
right right right right I I like you I
dunno 95% of my time over I was gonna
say Google Hangouts no I'm just kidding
over Skype one of my buddies did Roy
make it here no he didn't make it here
one of my buddies just when your Skype
people one of your Skype developers a
cool guy I think the impact of virtual
teaming really has to do with how
passionate or engaged are the people in
the virtual environment like it worked
you know 80% science and tech organized
part of the government which you think
would be horrible place work but 80%
scientists who worked for scientists
around the world yeah before the
internet was founded by not quite as
ridiculous as it sounds and it was it
was phenomenal to see the networks that
they had worldwide with people they
didn't have video conferencing back then
they they were using IRC and you know
totally you know not media rich
interfaces right and yet their serve
passion and ability to support each
other around the world and share
research like just open my eyes to what
the Internet and bringing human beings
together around an important mission
could be and so I think the virtual
teaming all depends on whether people
share in the same mission and actually
are engaged and then sense of person the
people even though just your question
can you establish the culture in your
organization which is structured
entirely virtually or do you have to
have some physical colocation some flesh
to flesh I - I think so what we're
talking about is more sociology and it's
this is it's all about the the storming
and norming yeah like when the group
first gets together but the group
decides what the norm was the normal
ways of behaving are and and if you have
someone that's cognizant of that or like
a straw
leader then you can have a very strongly
supportive community like in that in
that group but if you have someone that
just wants to broadcast their views and
no one else you know everyone else will
just fall asleep on mute you know the it
so it's it's really like about like this
is that is the water like a nice
temperature is everyone invited into the
pool or is it like just frigid and like
a nice lady and that's and that's
something that's based on like the
individual members of that community
like one one person saying hello to
every single person that signs in full a
completely change the way that the rest
of the meeting goes hmm interesting
yes so I'm struggling with whether or
not incentivizing the behaviors you want
will work right after hearing you talk
and so I'm trying to I underwent
incentivize the people that I work with
yeah and and I and I tailored the way we
approached our work yeah and how
leadership spoke to them in a way that
ticked all those boxes for that but yeah
what would it actually elicit behavioral
change or is that gap so wide that I
should just make those changes the new
de facto standard and yeah just make it
harder for them to operate it in a
different model but the latter for sure
yeah the latter for sure a lot of for
sure but I mean we want to use
incentives carefully so so incentives
the way that behavioral psychologist
will talk about are specifically rewards
and sanctions so they wouldn't be for
example the sort of very good work you
do is communicating what's important and
setting standards and holding people to
account and delegating accountability
and all that kind of good management
practice that wouldn't be considered in
the way that I'm using the word
incentives I've got lots of hands in the
air but I think you wanna you want to
say one more question
this is my only trip yes who's it gonna
be yes I didn't know it's worthy of the
last question um you talked about in
your book of it and exactly who is
saying about how sometimes extrinsic
rewards well take over intrinsic rewards
yeah you want to hear about that
I'll hear a little more on someone
you're talking about you know if one of
our groups gives out a reward to three
people a record or out of a group of 300
people like how does that how do you
reward intrinsic rewarding so the cool
thing is okay so anyway there's
intrinsic motivation external motivation
thing 1965 two groups of children
controlled group an experimental group
you give him a bunch of magic markers
children love to play with magic markers
y'all got kids it goes on the wall it
goes on the seats it goes in the carpets
everything that's expensive and hard to
replace so kids play with magic markers
right that's what they love to do so
what we would say in psychology would
say they were intrinsically motivated
right they play with magic markers
because it's a good in its own right
right so then you say okay we're gonna
do an experiment we're gonna reward
these guys so two groups of kids control
group and spend time with good these
guys over here
whatever marshmallows or whatever
candies trees whatever and lo and behold
what happens unsurprisingly the kids who
you're incentivizing right they play
with markers more awesome right
experiment behaviorism works except only
problem what happens when you stop the
rewards the kids who were incentivized
no longer interested magic markers why
is that because you've killed the
intrinsic rewards with the extrinsic
rewards okay
so that's fairly well-documented
phenomenon psychology so I think it's a
pretty cool example now we still live if
we want to create organizations where
people are maximally engaged and
spiritually fulfilled and involved you
know nurturing relationships and
creating value for things that matter in
human beings all of that kind of stuff
we need to get away from this idea and
we try and manipulate behavior through
rewards and sanctions yeah I teach an
MBA class and they're a bunch of you
know really motivated and smart kids and
it's a private school and so they're on
the wealthy side these kids
and the number of times in this mba
class these kids say to me there's kids
30 kids now say to me but what about
incentives if you don't incentivize
people they won't work if you don't use
center phase people they won't innovate
it's complete b.s and it's it's a sort
of dogma that's been fed down to us
human beings love to work you know the
people in this room very talented bunch
of people right if you all like had ten
million bucks tomorrow right all right
you take a little time off to chill
right but that wouldn't be the end of it
for you right you wouldn't say give me a
hand Mike on a bottle of tequila that's
it for the rest of my life right
you'd figure something to do with your
creative energies because that's what
human beings do they love to create
stuff so this kind of notion that we
need to be one of course we all need to
meet our physical needs our needs for
subsistence of food for water and for
shelter and everything like that but
beyond that and there's decades of
research it's just hey isn't a very
substantial motivator once you reach
whatever that amount is seeing the
prices around here it's probably 200
grand a year but um once you reach a
level it's no longer motivated but we
live in this fantasy somehow that
applying incentives to a system will
motivate people but you know frequently
with senior people they're pretty
motivated already in fact when you meet
people like you and like some of the
people other smart cookies around
there's a different motivation since
they were 12 you know and you know what
if you took away the reward okay that
might be a thing but adding more juice
more incentives more finance to the
system like that it's not going to
motivate people who are super duper
highly motivated and super duper highly
productive already so fantasy in this
mistake that people make I think it's a
misuse of incentives so I hope that's
not too preachy we a Manish I do want to
have one one more guys say your name
correctly Mahesh I think of an exact
senior person that you can't quite
motivate with money on how do you you'll
never change I tell you
it worked with a lot of senior people
over a lot a lot of years you will never
change the behavior of 50 year old adult
male with those kind of carrots and
sticks
hey I'm sorry they're pretty stuck in
the eye you know I'm sorry I we're of
the same tribe here you won't change you
won't change
you won't motivate people who are so if
someone's working 80 hours a week and
you try and motivate them to work harder
what are you gonna do is it gonna work
you're trying to Center buys them there
pay him a little more where they gonna
work 82
no right where you got to push against
in a systemic view of organizations
using some complexity theory to
understand you've got to push on the
chemistry we say the limiting reagent
the thing in the system that's missing
that will make the biggest difference
and in human performance if we were to
think about what are all the variables
that determine human performance right
say like take someone on a call center
someone sits up for a living right what
are the variables that determine the
output of that individual in the call
center hmm time to resolve issues how
good the product is how the marketing is
how good the system sport is what the
management behavior is how big the team
is what the processes are everything
like that but you know if I say we have
a problem performance in the and cause
such you know people say first
motivation it's something called the
fundamental attribution error in
psychologists you blame the person of
all the myriad of variables in the
system they say you know what happens
when you try and motivate someone with
an incentive who's already working 80
hours a week you know how motivating
that is and because you're telling them
that they're the problem when you try
and motivate them you're pushing against
the wrong part of the system to try and
increase the upwards that makes any
sense I mean I'm I'm going through
something
if you're trying to make sodium chloride
right and you have a whole ton of
chloride and not very much sodium you
can add a whole ton of chloride to the
system you won't get more salt because
the limiting reagent is sodium so
similarly if you're working in an
organization where people are super
duper motivated and you want to increase
the output of the system adding more
motivation is probably not gonna get the
job done it's something else yeah if
they're already precisely precisely what
I'm surprised I would say there's this
notion that somehow if the system isn't
producing outputs that people are
slacking it's nonsense
it's really really really one of these
nonsense ideas but anyway I've gone on
too long you've been really super
indulgent thank you very much for
listening to me I've enjoyed every
