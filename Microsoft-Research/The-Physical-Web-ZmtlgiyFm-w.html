you
well welcome everybody we're very lucky
to have Scott Jensen visiting us today
and Scott is is an old friend from a
long time ago used to come and spend
time with our group many years ago and
has done various bits of work with us
over the years Scott's at Google now but
actually he and i were an apple at the
same time except i was an intern and
Scott was you're working on the Newton
and also system 7 design was that right
yeah so I don't think we ever actually
bumped into each other when they were
there and then since then Scott spent
time working for symbian you were a
product designer at symbian is that
right director of design and more
recently at Google in charge of mobile
UI okay right so lots of different roles
also scott gave the closing plenary chi
last year and has written a great book
called the simplicity shift which he
wrote a bit just explaining the British
Library some years ago but 10 years ago
now isn't it yeah yeah so we're very
lucky to have him here today and he's
had a mishap with his laptop which he
will may or may not explain but so no
slides which is a nice refreshing change
for us so welcome to go well but they're
really really good slides I'm a keynote
junkie and they work really really hard
to make sure I've got no bullet points
and lots of animations and I don't have
any of that today so um but with a group
like this I don't want to give my full
on talk I've actually been in the UK
since well I've been traveling back and
forth a bit but I was at Cardiff a week
ago at the web is conference and last
Friday I was at full frontal the
JavaScript development conference and I
kind of have my full 45 minute kind of
like Roadshow and I feel like the crowd
like this you I can get to the point
quite quickly explain what I'm working
on right now and then open it up for
questions so I really appreciate that's
a little bit more interesting to do it
that way anyway
so specifically the the back story is
that i was at Google for number of years
I left creative director frog design and
one of the stories that kept coming up
was that I was when clients had come we
tried to get them to do a web page first
but this is you know a couple years ago
when everybody was kind of like I have
to have a mobile app after awesome I
even wrote a blog post called app myopia
is also tired of people just being you
know focused on that and and then we
would do it out for them and then they'd
come back so you know for five months
later kind of no one's installing our
app you know and and whenever people
talk about native versus web they always
get stuck on the fact that native
Scrolls smoother has a better UI and
that's true but it's kind of moot if
nobody installs it right so that was
just kind of one thing it kind of parked
my brain and then kind of orthogonal
thing was this idea that smart devices
today are all requiring that you have an
app to interact with them you know nest
withings bathroom scales you know the
Fitbit all these things require an app
which is fine it's like the only choice
you have but if you believe in Moore's
law at all there's probably going to
millions of these things and I think it
kind of the math this doesn't work out I
mean you're stuck to install millions of
apps and even if you don't personally
know millions of devices the point is
that long tail will kick in and if I'm
passing a vending machine in Berlin i'm
not going to download an app to buy a
candy bar right we actually a phrase for
at frog we kind of call it the thin
crust of effort it's like the the amount
of effort it takes to install an app has
to be amortized across the number of
times you use it so if you're using
snapchat or Facebook or whatever of
course you'll install the app that's
perfectly fine but if you're going to
use at one time that then makes no sense
whatsoever so that was the problem it
was fundamentally aux problem and I
started searching for a technological
search for it this is what we could do
and in fact it's kind of exactly what
the web is good at the web is good at
the long tail of almost anything and if
you stop thinking about applications and
you think more about say data so like
this bus stop can tell me when the next
bus stop is or this movie poster can
tell me you know we show times or
frankly a lost dog could have a kind of
phone numbers to how to like
you know you know run if you with the
owner these are all micro things very
very long tail very very trivial but I'm
not going to have an after each one of
those things it makes no sense so the
conclusion i came to is that the web
needs a discovery service because we're
so we get so excited about the Dom in
the browser and all the things that go
in that little white rectangle and it's
pretty cool it's not all of stuff but
the fact is that on top of this Dom we
have this archaic horrible medieval
thing called the URL prompt who is major
claim to fame the last 25 years if I hit
T it autocompletes to Twitter you know
and so we've taken the most amazing
rendering engine the planet we've put a
DOS prompt on top of it if you care i'm
a microsoft might be care what nobody i
think you guys are beyond das props to
so the point is is that we have
continued to label aber this amazing
system with a very kind of 80s
technology where have to type dub dub
dub CNN it's like it's insane it's kind
of really backwards and mobile phones
are bristling with sensors so why can't
we somehow automate that process hence
the effort its discovery service so i
tried a bunch of different technologies
I tried kind of piggybacking on on Wi-Fi
SSID s I worked on low 23 which is a
disaster classically to disaster and
then bluetooth for came along and it was
just the right kind of thing it kind of
had that UDP mentality where it just was
just a broadcast thing it was
connectionless so what we've come up
with and this is an open source project
we have a github we announced the last
month I'm kind of like on tour to talk
about it and so what we have is we're
using the the advertising packet a
bluetooth low energy by the ways how
many people have kind of a running
understanding of how bluetooth low
energy works just curious yeah that's
that's fine because it's I don't get too
geeky on you guys but it's just like
it's it's got some really lovely
properties and the main one is the
advertising packet it just sends out
this packet and it's completely
connectionless it just goes and goes and
goes and so you can be in a room with
10,000 people and they all get the
packet most of the time but you know it
is radio but the point is you know they
they usually do so we put in the
advertising packet the
you know CNN com we're not going we're
not doing an ID we're not doing a lookup
service we literally want to just give
you the URL because the whole purpose
here is to not only be open but to be
federated so that we get rid of this
kind of lock in that requires you to go
to a centralized server there actually
is an an i phone app that uses ibeacon
so that if you get you take the ID you
look it up and you convert it into a URL
and you go to it but it completely
misses the point of the web it's a
centralized server that server goes down
and you're toast we want to you know
have this beacon tank take me to CNN and
I just go straight there there's no
intermediary at all so that's what we're
working on and the way it works is that
just wants a second it just broadcasts
and I salt it does I mean there's
nothing else do it right and then the
phone comes along and the phone has got
an application and I totally appreciate
the irony that I'm asking you guys to
install an app it's not using a penny
more I mean I get but this is a
prototype right we're just trying to
just like just you know bang the rocks
together and just see what happens right
so we're using it kind of as an
injection mechanism to get this into the
system so you install the app and it
behaves like an operating system
extension and we have it running on iOS
and Android right now and so you get a
you unlock the phone it shows up like I
can see three beacons and you click on
it it just shows you the three that are
nearby and then you click on it and then
just takes you there I mean it's really
that's it it's not a complicated
technology and the thing that we're
doing right now is to just simply use
the power of the URL so that it can be
used in multiple ways so for example if
I if you blanket a building with one the
same URL we de doop it so that we only
show you the one so that you kind of
have the same URL where you go it's a
trivial thing to do the thing where we
haven't put in yet we're thinking about
it is if you do a hash in the URL so say
you go you know cool cafe calm / you
know hash 0 1 and 0 2 and 0 3 and you
put put one underneath each you know
table in the cafe you would also ignore
everything past so you'd only show that
you're in cool cafe but when you
actually click on it make your order it
would actually send the 03
and then you place your order it would
know you're from and then the food could
be delivered to your table this is the
metaphorical example but it shows you
the power of URLs but because of the
microprocessor in here you could say
something you know ampersand T equals 24
and it would just it would be a
temperature sensor and it could just put
the temperature in the URL if you wanted
to or the URL could be a rotating token
to give you security anti spoofing so we
feel there's not a lot of flexibility in
value of using URLs the other thing as
we find that there's three ways in which
this could be used the obvious way is
that just a better QR code right but but
I hate using that example because QR
codes kind of suck and everybody thinks
that you're at school they order QR code
but I can do 50 at once 150 meters away
and it's a big difference so the idea
there is i go to bus stop the bus stop
and tell me that the next bus is coming
in three minutes really nothing fancy at
all I actually think is very
transformative the more we play with
this the more the idea that anything can
give me information from a cap to my
luggage to a toaster oven can give me
support information i think that there's
an awful lot of really useful if trivial
things where everything can basically
just talk a little bit more so we're
kind of calling that just like the web
poster model the next one is the what we
call cloud pass through so i bought a
vending machine on craigslist i rented a
truck i picked it up I almost throw up
my back they're really heavy and I
brought it in and I just ripped all the
guts out the best part was that it had a
little bill thing that takes bills and
when I open it up there was twenty-seven
dollars in there the person who sold in
my head and cleaned it out so I got a
little discount but because of 70s stuff
it was as completely impenetrable there
was no documentation so I ripped it all
out put in a Raspberry Pi and then
hooked that up to a WebSocket node
server in the cloud so the URL is being
broadcast I go to the URL and it says
hey you rock candy bar and you click a
button so for my phone I click on the
button in a bit just as a post event and
that basically just sends into the
server the server then since a post down
to our Raspberry Pi and then just spins
a relay and then it drops the candy so
it goes through the internet and I am
stunned I mean for me
designer I should know that demos work
right but it was astounding I could talk
to blue in the face and then I bring all
the chrome VPS by and they're just
grinning because i can drop candy bars
as fast as they want to it's kind of
funny that that was that was what got
them excited by my project you know um
so just amazing that was that but people
often are critical of this idea because
it seems really complicated that you
have to have a machine that's sending a
Bluetooth signal and having some type of
interconnectivity Wi-Fi or ethernet
however it's changing really rapidly so
there's a company called sig Fox that's
French I don't you guys know them
they're making gsm modems in quantity
they're selling them for like three or
four dollars they have annual you know
data plans down to a buck that's a very
very small data plan so you probably a
bigger one but the point is it's getting
fairly cheap so things can become like
Kindles they can have their own and as
things start having their own
connectivity and I have my own
connectivity the this URL bridge is just
a way for me to kind of talk to it
really easily so that seems like a
useful thing to go in the future the
other thing is but then the third use
case is not possible yet but I think
it's the one that people get most
excited about which is I get the URL I
go to the cloud like all the other ones
but then the web page actually has
javascript in it which then can then
open up a bluetooth low energy
connection and then connect straight to
it now Bluetooth Low Energy has a very
simplified model it just has gas
services and gat is kind of like I
support heart rate I support temperature
or I support you know any other service
and then you know what that services and
then you can kind of push and pull
values it's quite limited but very quick
lightweight so the intention would be
that the vending machine we have a
vending machine service or a parking
meter we have a parking machine service
so I go to the URL other cloud do
whatever kind of payment you want to do
I pay for my parking and then it opens
up an encrypted Channel no I cryptid
token to the things with a gat service
sends it down and then the parking meter
coming out so you've got 30 minutes so
the revolution that we have a smart
devices was that through applications
the the device could kind of steal my
screen and have a uniform
well-understood interface on my my phone
well now you can actually steal the
internet connection to so so many people
are trying to do smart parking meters
and cities and
in crazy things with mesh networks and
things like that well this just goes
away it's just gone you connect to it my
personal hope is that I'll be able to
get mcdonalds happy meal the toy in it
and just pull up my phone and you could
just play with it right there because
it's really cheap at this point I'm
ordering these things in quantities of a
thousand for five bucks but I was told
if I ordered them in a hundred thousand
I could pry get down to a buck and
that's today right it's going to get
even cheaper and frankly at that point
mostly cost us the battery at the point
so you can't do this Bluetooth
connection yet chrome has a Bluetooth
Low Energy library behind the Chrome App
Store because it's a permission model
thing however once this project got a
little more traction they got excited
they're now negotiating with Mozilla to
say hey let's make sure that we just
take this thing and make it a standard
so that really supports it so that way
we can kind of get bluetooth low energy
as part as well as a library and work
through all the permissions issues we
want to be careful about that and
that'll probably take six to eight
months maybe longer to get in the
browser but we're kind of taking along
the long haul here so then that I think
that opens up enough a lot of
possibilities so that's what we're kind
of called the direct connect model we
think that's me pretty interesting to
try that out the one other thing I'll
tell you is that we've worked really
hard to work on privacy and security
because people get really worried about
things like this so a couple things the
advertising packet sends out a packet
constantly there is something called a
scan response packet which gives you
more information and we're not using
that for two reasons even though it's
very painful because it means our palos
much smaller if you use a scan response
packet it means that the receiver has to
connect back to you which gives them
your mac address which means that you
can be tracked so that's a bad idea we
want to avoid good Wi-Fi does even
though more and more operating systems
are scrambling the mac address so it
could be academic the other reason we
don't do it is that if i send this out
to a thousand people and they all ping
me back they're just going to
collaborate and the vast majority won't
connect so it's a congestion issue
bluetooth low energy was certainly not
designed to handle high volume it was
meant to be like mice and keyboards it
was not meant to broadcast don't
research to be very careful with that
the next thing that we're doing and this
is why it's all open source
that the phone will gather the four or
five URLs around and then it just
gathers those up and sent into a proxy
server and that has two values one is it
the product of this proxy server can
cash everything because we take the URL
and get the title the description in the
favicon which gives you the metadata to
display it nicely that saves the phone
from having to scrape everything
manually huge data segments to the phone
but the other huge privacy implication
is that I walk into a mall I see that
the stores around me and the stores kind
of go oh look at the X proxy server is
asking for it completely hides the users
in you know interest from you know so
that they can't see that it's a huge
benefit as well a couple people have
been really grumpy and they say but yeah
but I have to trust the proxy server it
could catch yes that's why it's open
source pick a different one you know
it's meant to be federated so you could
use are you know the google app or you
could use the microsoft app or you could
use who knows the snapchat app i mean is
the point is it's meant where we're
trying to create affect the two
different ecosystems an ecosystem of
totally open URL broadcasting things and
a whole series of most likely
proprietary clients but then look at
these things it's kind of equivalent to
websites and browsers and that's what
we're calling it the physical web
because we're trying to basically just
take the web and just push it the
hardware it's really a very very
straightforward you no idea but we're
hoping that by open sourcing it and
allowing these clients to do their own
thing we can kind of have a more
competitive system where people can try
two different things if we went through
a single centralized server I think
people would get worried but you know
and someone has some people have even
said I'm going to write a client who
uses no proxy server whatsoever I'm like
good luck you know you're gonna have a
huge data hit on the phone but that
would kind of maybe be the and it has a
it has a huge privacy issue that when
you walk into the mall the websites now
know you're in the ball so I actually
think it's a very bad idea for privacy
reasons but anyway these are the kinds
of things that we're trying to talk
about so this is where we listed a month
ago we've had tremendous press which was
completely surprising an accidental I
think it's because it's so open in so
many Internet of Things things are just
so app story you know they want to lock
you into the prior
Terry system and Google is really
adamant this cannot be a Google product
this must be an open web project and
we're doing it in such way right now
that we're trying to get comments and
feedback and I'm actually a little
disappointed almost all of the feedback
has been more like tin foil hat Google's
going to eat my children kind of
comments versus you your security is
screwed up and you can fix it this way
you know we're trying to get the
criticisms and how to fix them as
opposed to we just don't trust you and
you're evil you know and that's just you
know so we're most people frankly I
would claim like it too much I want
there to be more criticism so that's
pretty much the majority of my talk and
my slides runs the same thing but as you
can tell I'm trying to Prime you guys to
like ask hard questions and to push back
on it so and that's what the github is
for we hope you guys ready raise issues
so that's my overall talk and I'd be
happy fit cushions we model to in model
retard this is it because why would you
use model three of every device already
as a gsm connection well that's the
whole point though is that if i had a
mcdonalds happy meal toy it would
literally have nothing but Bluetooth Low
Energy chip in it and that's massively
cheaper to make right and why would you
blue energy and not something like NFC
and I'm see it's great but I have to
like get on top of it right if I want to
be in my house I want to control my
stereo system I don't wanna walk over to
my stereo system a tappet I might as
well just push the day long but that
mental math i could have a very short
range kind of in whatever you're calling
these things oh well these are just
basically maker kits we don't want these
to be publicly we don't these to be goo
we are not going to sell these for much
law we're just giving these away to get
to see the market yeah the physical will
forever webs in concept right so I could
have physical web objects in the real
world day it's not it's not doesn't have
to be pleased though energy right oh no
thanks bring that up we actually this
next week we're going to actually try to
support a mdns over Wi-Fi for exactly
this that reason in fact one of the
biggest issues with this is that this is
great for public spaces
but it allows my neighbor to turn off my
TV right that's a huge issue and we
acknowledge that on the github right
with this is a good like if we sort mdns
then of course your opportunity Wi-Fi
the dance with mdns is that I have three
TVs three TVs my house I'm afraid to say
and I'll get all three I haven't and so
one of the things we're calling with is
that you could still broadcast the the
IP address use mdns to get the full
information and then use the bluetooth
to kind of say oh well you're actually
of all of the 17 devices in your house
you're close to this one and you then
just going to match them up so we think
mdns is a very in that way we're
basically where the discover URLs in the
wild project we're not the Bluetooth URL
project Bluetooth is just new black
right everyone's using it everyone's
have their phones just the easiest way
for us to go right now yeah so what are
common properties in my single date on
it that could be pushed into this kind
of protocol you're saying so when you
put this pound or wrong table number or
let me so you use that as an input could
you think of you know refreshing data it
would be reactive by default or or like
that's a common property that maybe
every datos also might want to have I
think it's just four points here there's
how flexible URLs are and then there's
the what kind of metadata could you use
which i think is your question so we
think the metadata was really
interesting and the question that is
what part of the ecosystem does the
metadata need to be in right we are
actually adding support for JSON + LD
which is effectively a way for any web
page to return back up a blob of JSON in
fact we just had a prototype gun
literally yesterday I mean I'm afraid
they're they're really boring there's a
plastic box at phoebes you know when you
push the beep it changes to a gas
service that lets be discoverable so you
can set the URL these are meant to be
kind of like arduino bluetooth LE
devices totally not secure it's just
really meant to quickly you know
prototype something up quickly the but
so by adding json-ld and what we've done
is we've supported schema.org actions so
we just did it so that the the the
vending machine does the Jason + LD
which returns back the get address
and then the the proxy server supports
that and now it goes down to the my
android wear watch so I walk up to the
vending machine I can see the vending
machine I swipe over and it says get
candy I tap it and it spins and drops so
but we're trying to have all this
metadata come through the web we want to
we're trying to focus really really hard
to have the Bluetooth part or possibly
the mtns Wi-Fi stuff to be just about
discovery in fact kind of our geeky
nickname is that where the proximity DNS
team you know and then build it and
really layer it and so we build
everything so we don't do any payments
we don't do any identity we do we do no
security you know because we hope that
we can kind of layer that on top and if
we stick to our knitting and do that one
little thing we can be really focused
know if we think we need to add more to
it we actually have a field of bits that
we think are is going to be useful to
optimize avoiding the round trip to the
metadata server like for example one
thing we're talking about is that we can
say that I'm captured so let's say that
every light bulb here has the URL
associated with it and it's got a
restful interface like Hugh light bulbs
but I really want to talk to the
lighting system and the lighting system
talks to the lights on my behalf so that
bit would be really really lovely
because I can see them and I can ignore
all of them it's not security it's more
of a of a hint to the ranking so I would
hide all of those and I would just show
the lighting system so that's an example
of how we could use this bit field and
but like i said if you're willing to go
to the server you can get anything you
want we it's a really optimization yeah
in the cafe case or and when you have a
situation we have lots of vending
machine beside each other I'm do you
identify which one standing frozen yeah
I mean what we have discovered right now
is that we are sorting by signal
strength and its really lousy you can
kind of be good if you're within a meter
but it's still really bad so we're
thinking is that the vending machine I
mean Khloe FIFA Pepsi to co-pending
machine you don't have a problem if you
have three coke machines in a row that
feels like a slightly academic point but
it needs to be discussed so what we were
hoping would happen is that in addition
to sending down the the command you
would either
web page either give you identifying
information but there's also the likely
problem that two people can do at the
same time and we're going to fight for
the same candy bar so when you click on
it it might say okay Scott here's your
snickers so but I definitely agree with
you I think this needs to be discussed
and figure out ways I'd like to think we
come with a solution though you know and
it gets much much easier when you a
bluetooth low energy because then you
can do things I mean the connection
because then you can you could say you
can walk it up to the page and when the
page loads it connects right to it and
it kind of goes it'll help this one you
know so then you could really really
solve that problem that a lot yeah Scott
you won't be Kevin bull no yeah in a way
the car technical challenges attractable
they it could be solved but isn't that
more about how how this is an
infrastructural problem about how you
get these things into the world and you
mentioned price which is obviously a big
one but how are you addressing that they
may legitimately a problem yeah I mean
effectively what we're trying to do is
reinvent SMS from it from a from a from
a structural point of view and we have
no illusion that this is a monumentally
hard problem so we're taking right now
is we're kind of calling the growl for
macintosh approach do you guys remember
girl for macintosh okay so it was a
program that was you would install
aftermarket it gave the mac superpowers
and then developers header then to take
advantage of the API but they would they
would ask you to saw a girl first and it
became and it became quite large but it
slowly worked its way up and eventually
of course Apple then just stole the
alien built it in we're trying to the
same approach which is to say we want
this app to be installed and it's only
meant for research labs and for you know
PS i was like the BBC resource a day
they really want to play with this we
just want people to play with it we want
people to get excited by it we wanted to
be kind of this demand pull we want the
idea to be vetted and and and figured
out and basically the community to
decide if it's a good idea that's a
really important first step then the
idea is to have other you know the real
critical step is to get this built into
operating systems so or frankly it's
probably build into browsers so that
being and firefox can both offer their
own alternative to it that's what we
really need to get you know next so I'm
obviously lobbying the chrome team to
put this in behind a flag
in short period of time at full frontal
and that a student who is like can I
port your your client to Windows Phone
I'm like yes because frankly I think
it'd be awesome you get this ship and
windows phone before Android and I'm
very happy to go on record have it
recorded go public because this will not
work if it is considered to be a Google
first or Google only product now that
being said I'm not answering your
question I'm just telling you how I hope
it comes out I do feel though that when
you kind of explain it to people and
they kind of go will the alternative is
to use apps for the rest of our life
well that's even more intractable so the
question is we have to kind of develop
that kind of desire for it let's try
this reform instance even get some
traction and if not then I think we'll
have to try something else or frankly
give up if nobody wants it because well
I must be really honest if the world if
the community doesn't want this idea
it's not gonna happen so you sort of
approaching it bottom-up letting seeding
the idea and the technology whereas you
could say the reverse was at the App
Store itunes where they said this is the
platform and everyone else has to sort
of plug into it could you approach it
that way I just something I mean Apple
got away with that an awful lot of right
now people are actually fighting Apple
more and more on that issue I think that
the world has gotten more sophisticated
I just don't think that works anymore
especially when you're trying to do
something that's kind of broad as the
web this this has to be perceived as the
next level of the web and I just feel
like it would just kill it personally I
mean it's really possible that Google
could you be the first to market by
putting this into a chrome and I knew
that we may have to do that but a little
me would be a little sad if that was the
only thing that would happen I would I'd
really love someone else in fact I even
pitched I know Pascal finet who's head
of research at Mozilla and I pitched him
on this and I just said why don't you
guys don't make mizzou windows OS phone
just a phone written in JavaScript make
it a phone that actually embraces the
web and so I try that and he there were
just too busy with other things they
couldn't do it so I'm hoping that some
platform we use as a differentiator be
at first but that I'm not answering your
question I'm just telling you know what
we're trying yeah
battery life how does that impact sort
of scenarios where you can use Amish in
a vending machine if you don't really
need a battery right you're right like
deer populations right there right
whereas if I had into the battery life
heck I could I could document the
construction materials used to build
this building right and what's the
battery life of these thing is it and so
we're we're on a scale do you do you see
you sort of it first taking off well
there's always answer your question
there's the direct question of battery
life next one is beacon density right
the thing is like clearly if I go into a
chemist every bottle of paracetamol will
not have one of these things in it i
mean even even it better which was
Infinite that'd be insane right but
right now this is a year old board
running a twenty thirty two battery it
runs for eight months if you change the
url every hour it'll last for about a
week right so you know the changing of
the URL actually takes a lot of energy
the next generation is chip should last
two years and it'll just keep getting
better we disempower analysis on this
and found out that the vast majority the
powers actually taken out by the
processor blood is low energy is
actually quite efficient but we really
do feel like the world is broken up into
two very big camps those with mains and
the batteries and but I'd like to think
that for a while at least if you have
something that lasts for two years I
think that kind of is quite useful but
then it but I think your use case those
that you want to like fire and forget
you just want something to broadcast me
forever and I think we're probably
always away from that that'll be a
different use case entirely but frankly
I would think even one thing we haven't
talked about and actually this falls
onto your Wi-Fi question which is once
we start getting clients that are
harvesting URLs we could start frankly
using the web as well so if website if a
city would upload say a KML file of all
the data of all the bus stops in the
city you could then make every bus stop
have a URL as long as the client is
willing to fire pits GPS and you know do
that I think that's another extension to
this model when you talk about which
then would require batteries at all
right but I think that's kind of a
next-generation thing the other thing I
don't comment on make my legs to
reminded me of this I think taking URL
going to web pages is going to be
considered to be like the really boring
thing with this technology is the
obvious thing to do right now but if you
can imagine that they all have
connectivity and they all have restful
interfaces you could also imagine that
these things could fire up discover each
other and hit the restful interface
isn't self configure that would be kind
of another I think a little more science
fiction but that's kind of where we can
go with this and so not just simply just
say yeah your dog is lost you know so
any more questions not sure if this is
really successful 99% of URLs are
valueless and just noise in the person's
life yeah um there's many variations of
this question a lot of its author on
spam sometimes run fishing some of its
or you know so there's I think uh
there's no silver bullet I think there's
a couple of answers one is I think Bing
and Google both offer safe safe browsing
api's and fishing ap is so that would
take care of maybe the first fifty or
sixty percent right so you just simply
just you know just get rid of the crap
there is a UX issue about how you then
kind of organize things you know like
what's the primary things I hinted
before distance is a meaningless value
we've tried really hard to avoid
gathering any user data at all but we're
feeling like we have no choice at some
point we're gonna have to do it which
means if I'm in the mall and I see these
75 beacons which ones have been click on
the most just kind of use page rank you
know kind of that kind of model if you
do it properly and you signal it so that
you're not gathering any personal
information is just anonymized data I
think that'd be incredibly powerful I
also think that whelp experiment with
different UIs I mean right now is just a
list most likely we can come up with a
much better UI than just a list to say
hey we're going to show you what's
important so I think we're gonna have to
grow into that so it's it's it's kind of
being overwhelmed versus being spammed I
think the two different conversations
and again on the github we call it out
as kind of the next generate that one of
the topics we want to explore as well
because you're right I'll be thrilled to
find one right now you know follow-up
question does it make sense I just it
just made me think that I wonder whether
what you're proposing which I like is so
far from the App model
because you know I had this weird
experience where I am great at all of my
hifi you know I boarding ramp I bought a
new DVD player I bought a new TV every
single one of them had BBC iPlayer built
into it yeah and there was a sense that
was so cheap to get this functionality
that it didn't really matter if if if it
was all thrown at me as if it was equal
and Sonia had to make a strange choice
of which particular device I engaged
with and it sounds like too it sounds to
me like the purpose that device
manufacturers are trying to make apps
that are dedicated experiences for their
particular device and I wonder whether
even if this is masked by Euro L where
whether to some extent you're doing the
same thing you're creating a unique URL
to a unique experience for that device
that to all intensive purposes may just
may as well be a nap all right another
thing you could do is just launch launch
the app automatically and the experts
might not be distinct but I end up in
this situation in my living room for
example where I have these three or four
devices all saying launch me launch when
we launched me that they're all kind of
it you know yeah you know they'd all
about that there's still all about their
unique experience is still the sony TV
try to send me to the sony site you know
that you know some samsung hifi try to
send me to the sound suicide you see
really no I totally agree i think
frankly the my toaster ovens prog-rock
gonna try to sell me extended warranty
insurance too which is so I mean to me
this is just the web and how you use it
needs to be discussed and will evolve
over time so I don't want to say that's
on top of me and you can wash my hands
of it but I i feel like the alternatives
that I mean I'm trying to solve the
problem that you have 20 apps in your
house and you can install them that's
the problem trying to solve your kind of
I think going on to the next problem
beyond that which I agree with but I
would argue that's not the problem I'm
trying to solve at this point yeah yes
I'm a related questions I don't quite
see how you solve them when you mention
the Philips hue like I've been
experimenting with the lights Xbox i'm
going to doesn't even at my house and
you know they come with a nap you get an
iOS app and
and that its kind of problematic but I
don't see how you know your comment
about the lighting system rather than
you so let's say that each of the bulbs
has got one of your things in it at some
point I have to talk to the lighting
system and I'm wherever that instead of
implementing I'm still talking to
Annapolis that life x rather somebody
wrote to manage my bulbs right so I
don't quite see that what the real
difference is well the difference would
be in the case the light bulbs is that
let's take the easiest likely scenario
that life ex-rights a light management
app which broadcast a URL and then it
discovers all of the other life x bulbs
in the house and then you go to that app
and you configure it and you say this is
the bedroom never all that kind of stuff
and then as the app captures each one of
light bulbs they have restful interfaces
that says you're captured and that
changes that bit and it flips the bit to
be captured so then what that means then
is that when I walk into my house I just
no longer see the light bulbs i only see
the lighting system right so I mean and
that can be taken care of many different
ways I that's this bit was just one
example of it but I think that was the
idea is that if we get more
sophisticated systems we want but I
think we want to create systems of
systems we don't want have everything
being at the top level and in that sense
life ice is done with the mesh network
are you doing it with no precise it's
suffering oh and this is the problem
being at google google has so many
different projects I kind of go how are
you related to nest like I have no idea
they're over there you know but it's
like they have this thread system and so
forth unlike I I the thread is all about
having a backbone and data and an event
model and they're doing all that's
nothing to do with me if a thread object
wants me to discover their web page that
makes things percolate the network good
on you but that's that's that's not my
thing so I think though that this idea
of systems discovering each other and
then hiding each other to simplify for
the user and possibly order your issue
is the kind of thing that we do have to
talk about absolutely yeah restful
interface restful interface is a web
technology that ledge 'take any URL and
then just add another thing on the end
of it so for example you can say let's
say that the like life x yeah I have a
life x 47 two three four five six which
is one of his light bulbs / info you
that webpage and returns back JSON that
says I adult life x bulb and here's my
commands and then any other you just
keep adding it's a clever little trick
on URLs you just keep adding another
thing to the URL and it returns back
information well as our EST it's dead
doesn't mean no address no it's it's
rest full yeah so that's just one way in
which you have a web at httt based
system that can communicate there are
others yes sir kind of reflexes question
about infrastructure this is who's going
to how you can agree on the api's you
say you know here's the light system do
all light systems have to have light
bulbs in them and essentially the
structure of that API that you're
exposing absolutely so I think there's
two separate issues I love to kind of
make fun of the fact that the inert of
things it's just stupid term and that
people confuse the Internet of Things
with smart devices smart devices in much
more tractable right I have one at the
talks to one device and it's my washing
machine it's my light bulb it's my
whatever okay the end of things is this
you know Jetsons view where everything
talks to each other and there and and
that's just a mess right I completely
agree with you I'm trying to solve a
smart device problem right I have no no
claim on the end of things problem
because you're right so most likely the
dumb thing is that that life x will have
a life x app the controls life x bulbs
but it won't talk to you well i can't
solve that problem and i would argue
that that's not a problem that i want to
solve i want i want those guys to figure
it out in fact frankly the thread
project nest is trying to tackle that
problem and more power to them you know
so sorry i don't be cavalier but i just
i want make sure we're really i'm trying
to as you can tell i'm trying to really
draw a very fine line but what i do when
it real stuff
the github is is a google / physical web
physical dash web org my email is scott
j google com very much want to have
conversations and if you guys have other
ideas if you think mdns is a bad idea
you think is another way we should do it
get there's a way to add security if you
think there's a privacy implications
even thought about this stuff needs
shaking so please contact me let me know
