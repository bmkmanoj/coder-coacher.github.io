you
so without further ado I'm very happy to
introduce the stop-and-frisk group the
first speaker Siobhan
Wilma Dunbar from Pace University
followed by Derek sands from Brooklyn
College offs al-hussein from City Tech
and Hana Pugh Gaucho from Baruch please
join me in welcoming everyone tonight we
will be presenting to you an empirical
analysis of stop and frisk in New York
City the stop and frisk program has been
quite active in New York City for some
time and the basic procedure behind the
program is that if a police officer sees
an individual that he or she deems to be
suspicious in any way then that Officer
has the right to stop question and frisk
that individual at his or her discretion
this program has many potential benefits
such as creating an atmosphere of safety
in society and reducing crime however
annually about half a million people are
stopped with only 6% of these people
being arrested that means that 94% of
people that are stopped are presumably
innocent that's hundreds of thousands of
innocent people being stopped every year
and stop rates are also disproportionate
across various demographic groups for
example 87% of all stops are made of of
black or Hispanic individuals while
there are only 53 percent of black and
spanning individuals in the population
so that means that there are more stops
of these people than there are people of
that demographic in the population and
the legality of the stop and frisk
program has often been argued such as
the violation of fourth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights but no one really looks
at the social cost of this program which
is the burden placed on innocent
individuals in society innocent being
those who are stopped and not arrested
which is again the majority of those who
are stopped in the first place our
research focused on two main parts the
social cost again the burden that is
placed on all of these people who are
stopped and not arrested as well as ways
we can improve the way that stop
decisions are made which we looked at
with two different types of models
so first we'll focus on the social costs
in order to measure the social cost we
have to look at the stop rate and once
more we focus on the stop rate of those
who are innocent because the majority of
people who are stopped are presumed
innocent at the end of the day and we
calculate the stop rate by dividing the
number of stops of innocent individuals
by the total number of people in the
population this is also known as our
yearly per capita stops which is the
estimated number of times that someone
is expected to be stopped in any given
year and we estimate these stop rates
for each demographic groups broken down
by age sex and race in order to
calculate our stop rate we use two main
sets of data first we looked at the stop
and frisk data obtained from the New
York Police Department which gives us
the of the recorded number of stops and
between 2006 and 2012 alone there have
been about 3.8 million stops we also use
the census data which has two main parts
the Poon's data which gives us detailed
individual population data and the
block-level data which gives us this
detailed information also by location so
for the purposes of our stop rate we
focus on the stop and frisk data for the
number of stops of innocent people and
the census booms data for the total
number of people in the population and
here we have a plot distribution of the
yearly per capita stops once more the
estimated number of times that someone
is expected to be stopped in any given
year broken down by the ages of those
who are stopped recorded in the stopping
first data separated by males and
females and we can see that females have
a drastically lower stop rate than males
but in both sets black individuals rank
the highest of all people who are
stopped and if we look at the highest
ranking group of those who are being
stopped we can see that 19 year old
black males rank the highest with about
one point two stop rate so that means
that if you're a 19 year old black male
you can expect to be stopped at least
once or more every year and since blacks
and whites are so often compared
if we compare this to a 19 year old
white male we can see that an individual
of that demographic is only expected to
be stopped about point two times each
year so that is a big difference on stop
race between these two racial groups and
let's not forget our females if we look
at 19 year old black females they rank
the highest among all females who are
being stopped and they have only a point
zero six stop rate each year so this
plot gives us a visualization of what
the social cost of the stop and frisk
program is and helps us to quantify that
and we can see that this is the social
cost the burden that is placed on all of
these individuals who belong in these
demographics and are being stopped so
often every year but are presumed
innocent at the end of the day
good evening this is a random sample of
10,000 stars from the stop-and-frisk
dataset each dot is a stop recorded from
that data and as we can see from the map
there are some locations where there are
more stops than others and so what we're
going to do in this part of the talk is
quantify how much location affects the
stop rate for certain groups and to
measure the stop rate by location we
created a grid of one kilometer by one
kilometer squares where in each square
we have the number of stops for a
certain group as well as the number of
people that live in that square as we
just heard from Chabon we see and know
that certain young males are being
stopped more than others and so what
we're going to do is focus on young
males that are being stopped differing
differentiating them by race and so here
is the stop rate for young innocent
white males innocent for us who mean
that when they were stopped they that
stopped did not result in an arrest
young will mean that they range from the
ages of 18 to 29 years old and stop rate
again is that it's the number stops in
proportion to how many people in the
population gray squares are where the
stop rate is less than 0.25 and so we
can see that as where a person is less
likely to be stopped the highest stop
rate for a young innocent white male is
in Coney Island at 0.5 which means that
on average they'll be stopped once every
two years
well these white empty spaces are where
fewer than 100 young white males live
and we use a hundred to be more accurate
with our stop rate calculations and
here's the stop rate for young innocent
black males
we can see that there are very few great
squares and many different shades of
reds and oranges the highest top rate
for a young innocent white met a young
innocent black male is three points in
Jamaica Queens which means that on
average they're going to be stopped
more than three times in a year okay um
15% of all stops made by NYPD are made
in public housing buildings and while
7.4 of New York City residents live in
public housing buildings and here in
Brownsville Brooklyn 4,000 they average
4,000 stops a year and of those 4,000
stops 3/4 of them are made in public
housing and here's a stop rate for young
innocent Hispanic males a few more gray
squares and less intense Reds and here's
a side-by-side comparison of the three
groups along with the average stop rates
and the average stop rates for a young
Hispanic male is around four times as
much as as young as a young white male
and the average stop rate of a young
black male is around eight to nine times
as much as a young white male and to
recap as we heard from Siobhan there are
the number of stops of young black men
exceed the number of young black men
that live in New York City and the
number of stops of just young males in
certain neighborhoods exceed the number
of young males insert and by several
times thank you
I think sure so as you can as you guys
can see there are some negative effect
of stop and frisk in our community
especially community of colors so the
question is how can we make the system
more effective without sacrificing the
stop and face the benefit of stop and
frisk in order to do that we create - or
model for us tone is full status to your
model then the other is here stick model
so I'm going to talk about the full
statistical model so this model will
help us to answer question how can you
make better stuff so first question is
what do you mean by better stop so
better stop means stop the criminal not
the innocent people but there's this two
question that we have Chancellor here
first who is a criminal in a real wall
is someone get arrested doesn't mean
that individual is a criminal until
they've been proven guilty in a court in
our case we use arrest as a proxy so if
someone get arrested we assume that
individual is a criminal much more
harder question to answer is how you
know ahead of time that individual we
get arrested or not so ni PD is using
some sort of checklist as their
guideline to stop people so if you
remember from Siobhan that hit rate was
around 6% which is better than if they
will just stop people randomly here is
the picture of stop and frisk from that
NYPD use after they stopped someone so
there are around 20 reason here so if
you pay attention to this reason
suspicious object re-perform victims
carrying object you know openview used
in commission of crime these are really
subtle points and did it really make
sense if they stopped people for this
reason it really makes sense but on the
other hand their reason like furtive
movement which is totally unclear I mean
what do you mean by furtive movement and
it is very easy for an officer to misuse
that so we're gonna build a full
statistical model that will help us to
see what reasons are more predictive to
arrest
so in Pacific we're going to build a
logistic regression model that will help
us to predict who is going to be
arrested or not here is the procedure
that we followed first we trained our
data in 2011 data so you consider all
those stuff from 2011 and we try to
predict which are to be who is going to
be arrested not given that that
individual stopped based on all this 20
reasons that you guys saw in the forum
so we are only considering the reasons
that are legal for
officer to stop someone then we were
testing our data based on 2012 data so
we are not using Sameer data so you're
not cheating so we are try to predict
what is the possibility of someone
getting errors based on immediate
information that a police officer have
right before this stop someone then we
just take the individual we have higher
likelihood of getting arrest and rank
them based from hash to s so in order to
get the best stop because we want to
stop this person first then we just have
to decide if a people exceed certain
probability we're gonna stop those
people so that trash will have to decide
it by City or NYPD itself so if these
decided load threshold they will get
more rest
more stop but they'll be more social
cost if they choose high threshold
they'll get less stop lesser arrest but
people will be happy because there will
be less stop so that's something that
NYPD our city have to decide here is a
graph of our models so as you can see
the x-axis is stop frame from highest to
lowest in percentage based on our model
and the y axis you can see percent of RS
out of total arrests so this all stopper
are conducted through a stop and frisk
in 2012 and this all our risk done
through stop and fit in 2012 so if you
just can see if you just see 25 percent
that means these two eighty five percent
are the best most stops they have the
higher probability of getting errors
based on our model just to give you an
example if you just choose point O three
as our threshold that correspond to 25
percent stop and that 25% of stop give
us 56 percent of arrests out of total
arrests so this is pretty good because
we just have to stop 25 percent of
people and getting quote-unquote 56
percent of the criminals and to compare
that if you just select random stop out
of the current stop that r ennop it is
using we would have get only 25 percent
of arrests out of 25 percent of stop so
compared to this random selection we our
model is doing far better job
hello so I in this part of the talk will
focus on the determining the simple
rules that I will refer to to as
heuristic model that will help us to
improve the strap decisions made by the
police officers so first let's look
again at the logistic regression model
that up-sell was talking about before
and we see there are 20 reasons that
determine the likelihood of a person to
get arrested when its top is being made
so to make a decision to calculate the
probability we need to add all of these
numbers up but it's not as easy as it
sounds because to calculate the sum in
one's head is going to be hard so the
solution to this problem might be a
phone application that will do the
computation for us but then the question
is how do we interpret the numbers that
we see on the screen so that's why we
need to come up with simple rules that
will be easy to implement and use in the
future so to do that first we will
eliminate the coefficient that
correspond to the reasons that are
referred to other because they don't
make sense
because police officers can use that
reason for anything then for every
positive coefficient that we've seen in
the previous slide we will set the value
of one and two the negative coefficients
we will set the values of zeros so since
the only these are our our values ones
and zeros this model can be easily
implemented as the checklist so here's
our checklist and we see there are nine
reasons that police officers might use
as as a guideline for the
decision-making so for example let's say
police officer observed observes a
suspect then officer checks as many
reasons as he or she thinks are
applicable to a particular situation and
then then they calculate a score from
zero to nine which is extremely simple
and then they make a decision sounds
good in theory but now let's actually
see how this works on practice so to do
that we need to evaluate our heuristics
heuristic model first we will look again
at the full statistical model the one
that absol was talking about before and
the curve on the top represents the full
physical model and the 45-degree line
tells us the percentage of the arrests
that we make if we select stops randomly
and to compare how our stuff heuristics
perform let's overlay this graph with a
heuristic with a heuristics model so the
numbers that you see on the screen or
are the heuristic model and for example
you see that for two reasons checked
check two reasons from that checklist
that we've seen before we know that
we're gonna make 27 percent of the stops
resulting in 49 percent forty-nine
percent of the arrests so what does the
other two curves tells us the fall
statistic
model tells us that for the same 27% of
the stops we get around 50 58 percent of
their s while if we make if we choose if
we randomly choose the stops we will
make 24 27 percent of the stops we get
20 percent 27 percent of the arrests so
what conclusion do make based on this
graph we know that our heuristic model
performs much better than if we select
substratum Li and at the same time it
performs slightly worse than the full
statistical model but considering the
fact how easy and fast it was to
calculate to get these results we can
tell that the heuristic model is the
optimal solution to do this problem
so in conclusion in this talk we focused
on the first we focused on the social
cost that the stop and frisk policy
brings to the society
first our there are a lot of people who
are being stopped for no reason and
there are burdens on individual on the
specific demographic groups of such as
young black males and in the second part
of the talk we try to improve our sub
decisions meet by police officers using
full statistical model and the heuristic
model so this concludes our presentation
and if you have any questions let us
know thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
