you
next up we are going to have a project
talking about selective reality and an
approach to augmenting reality with tone
and that is that coping Hagan Institute
of interaction design Denmark thank you
hi I'm Simon and I'm Claudia and
together with Pola Ana Syria and Julian
were representing CID the Copenhagen
Institute of interaction design and we
are talking about selective reality so
this is an image that might be familiar
to a lot of you this is the kind of
thing that you see very often when you
look at design futures forecasting
especially in the world of a billion
sensors and augmented reality coming to
the mainstream this is the kind of a
vision that we see most of the time and
we found and especially there's quite a
few surveys about this that a majority
of Americans actually think of this kind
of future where so much information is
layered onto the real world as a
negative change so only 37% of people
think this could actually have potential
for the better and 53% think this kind
of thing as a change for the worse so
this is something we want to address and
since we're already bombarded with so
much information we really tried to look
into how we can make sense of all this
data so this is the problem in the world
of a billion sensors and there's so many
things already fighting for attention
that we're really losing the ability to
focus on things that matter to us
therefore we came up with selective
reality as an approach to augmented
reality that through selective sensory
filtering so that means we tried really
to look into the most visceral senses
the most of the immediate sensors that
we already possess as humans so those
are really you know the five senses that
everybody knows about there's a few more
out there that we have access to but the
important thing is that there is so much
sensory overload in the world today and
this is only getting worse with so many
sensors available to us and so much data
that we wanted to see whether it
couldn't be a better approach to dealing
with augmented reality in particular so
that means that instead of layering
information on the world as we are
seeing we would actually try to subtract
information to try to get a greater
sense of focus on the things that are
important so we started our
experimentation with something that's
kind of called a sound walk and if
you're not familiar with this this is a
really fun exercise where you partner up
and you blindfold your partner and then
you lead them around the streets in the
environment
in our case that was the Copenhagen
Harbor which is a really nice place to
do this because there's so many sounds
so many details in the environment that
you would never really pick up on unless
if you actually remove your sense of
vision and this was a really powerful
experiment for us and for a few people
that we tried this with because you
don't really realize how many things you
miss unless if you have some kind of
thing removing some of the other
distractions that are around you so this
was one of the main ways that we started
getting inspiration for this approach in
an experiment about visual filtering we
used paper prototype to understand how
this approach could could feel like so
we made little holes on these masks that
would allow the user just to perceive
and see only one person at a time so to
be focused on just that person and even
if it's really a crude and simple
experiment that was already showing how
our philosophy was going in the right
direction in the next experiment we
prepared a video sketch that would allow
you to perceive and feel like and
understand how it would feel like to
have a visual auditory device made for
selective filtering in our working
environment
in the next and last experiment we focus
on audio and here we let the the person
listen to the environmental sound in a
way that the sound comes live processed
so that the user could listen to the
environment and tune in to specific
sound and we found out that this was a
really powerful exercise and that's why
we decided to use our research to
prepare a concept of our product that is
called tone and tone is a device that
enables greater focus by selectively
balancing auditory stimuli and it comes
in a shape of two earphones that you can
plug in your ears and while you put them
in your ears they the shape of your ear
channel because it made of soft material
and tone response to gestures so when
you cap you when you cap your ear you
can enable sound isolation and this is
for example useful when you are in a
situation like in a crowded place and
you want to focus on a conversation with
a person in this in front of you you can
also enable noise reduction covering
your ear for example as we have seen
before into the working environment so
to reduce the level of noise around you
and moreover what tone can do is to
enable environmental signification
tapping on the other ear plaque and that
means that it can allow you to perceive
an invisible phenomena like for example
if you are allergic to air pollen you
could just tapping on on tone here what
is the amount of pollen in year and now
we also created a short video to
illustrate you how I feel
he's a Swedish pianist and it's kind of
a dinner conser
so you can see there's some really
fundamental applications here to the
human condition like the Wi-Fi and of
course it's important to note that we
realized this is a near-future product
but it's really fascinating to think
about that a lot of the technologies and
the research that are required for this
kind of thing to be a reality are
already emerging today such as in the
field of psycho acoustics and there's
some really amazing technology and
hearing aids already available today
that would really lead us in this kind
of direction so I think what's important
is that tone takes the concepts kind of
the philosophical approach of selective
reality and takes it a bit further and
you've noticed it's a it's adding a few
things but every time we add anything
like a sense for weifare Paul and we're
also simultaneously taking something
away so for example we're lowering the
ambient noise to compensate because if
you just keep adding information and
layers of data you really risk dilution
and having a sensory overload so we
believe it's very important and that
there's so much potential of in this
world of a billion sensors for all this
data to enrich us and to help our lives
and our relationships and our work but
the problem is if we don't process this
data properly if you don't find a good
way to deal with it then we'll be
flooded with such an ocean of data that
we will probably not have a great
benefit from from this great
technological revolution so that said we
believe it's our responsibilities as
designers and researchers to make sure
that this world of a billion sensors is
not just another distraction and this
augmented reality which is coming to the
mainstream today can actually be
something that enables greater focus on
things that matter to us and the people
that we love and the work that matters
thank you thank you
like the ones also does that um so first
I audios sort of the next frontier in a
census it's really neglected in inaction
design and and it's too bad so I really
like that you've focused there and I'd
like a lot of I liked how you presented
things and the there's an interesting
thing here that that I it's a question
that has to do with this notion about
changing focus because you you'd let you
folk you have these gestures and you can
focus in on this or that and you showed
it very nicely it's like changing depth
of field in photography where you you
you you open up the aperture see you can
really just get a clear you did that
visually with the first video or you had
the audio and you've blurred out the
people at the same time you blurt out
the sound
the question is rapidly changing focus
is fundamental to how we interact with
the environment and and I want you to
talk a little bit about the gestures
that you would use does it scale because
for a few things
losing's gestures are easy once you get
above seven that becomes recom Plex I'm
curious if you've got thought about that
you don't have to solve that I'm just
curious really when you're going through
this how what conversations were like
around that space I think that's a great
point and we definitely envision this
product not to be on all the time but
really people want to hear that
environment most of the time and there's
only specific situations when you really
want to focus on particular things like
if you're working or if you know now's
noisy environment and you want to have a
conversation so I think we we don't
envision this being used in kind of a
rapid switching focus kind of scenario
more and much more in a very specific
situation where you might make an
exception and actually block things out
because of course we don't want to
reduce the our experience in the real
world
only in those particular situations when
there's sensory overload cloudy and
Simon I want to congratulate you I'm
gonna ask you to close your eyes
please close your eyes take that in
there you got that mm-hmm
you got it okay you guys did a
phenomenal job take a moment of it thank
you thank you yeah this is very nice
presentation I agree particularly with a
lot of Bill's points that I think
there's some really interesting things
are going at and you highlighted
something that has been bothering me for
a little while so this is less of a
question than an observation but we tend
to be very good in design thinking
around this around the first-order
gestures and actions of triggering
things how to trigger the action we tend
not to spend as much time around the
second ordered actions the things that
allow us to choose which filters were
going to activate and what sequence
we're going to do them in and that's a
problem that is as big as the problem of
managing my email filter boxes right I
can spend my whole day just reorganizing
the filters without actually answering
an email we could spend a whole day
figuring out the right sequence of
gestures to apply the right filter when
I put the hand up without actually
affecting what we're doing and I think
what you what your presentation really
highlighted for me is that as designers
we have to think through that whole
sequence of actions from what is my
intention right to making that intention
real and it's a bigger problem than it
seems and that we tend to often leave
the problem on the engineers working on
the sensors because we assume well the
sensors will just know what's the right
gesture and when we leave that problem
in engineering that's a huge set of
assumptions we're leaving on the table
and they're really needy and they're
really fun to dive into so I'd encourage
you to dive into those with this because
I think you've got those first order
ones down love to see what you come up
with on the second order once
I believe we had professor le Rose with
that team here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
