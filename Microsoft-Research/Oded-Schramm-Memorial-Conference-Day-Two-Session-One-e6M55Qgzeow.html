have a few words from the director of
the msl Redmond lab Wickham eldar thank
you fall I'm actually surprised to see
all of you here uh this is a much bigger
event than I thought it would be but I'm
gladly surprised to see that this is the
case I remember when we had the said
event about Oh dad's passing it's I mean
we all felt that very much and very soon
after when we had an event here at MSR
then about celebrating his life and
you've all mentioned we should also have
an event to bring the community together
and from day one I felt that was a great
idea and we supported the idea very much
but we carefully kept our expectations
low so I'm very pleased to see all of
you here or that was a great member of
our community here unlike most of you I
didn't have the pleasure to interact
with him that much just a few
conversations here and there but since
you've all mentioned stories I'll share
one little bit one justjust will just
add a little bit to what you already
know much about him I was always
impressed of course like most of you who
know him L how smart he is how quickly
he would pick up any particular
conversation and add to it and a couple
of things that were interested
interesting in particular that show that
it's when we have these group reviews
here in Microsoft so every year the the
research groups have to present a little
bit formally what they've been doing and
all that and I'm there and so I i watch
the presentation and Jennifer at the
time was the manager of the group and
they were presenting very nice work and
am I grew no interest in Christian sorry
paid for in Christian
and now I mean you guys are now driving
the whole Lab which is wonderful it
shows that our investment in these areas
and related areas keeps growing and all
that had an influence on that for sure
but the interesting thing on that
particular presentation is that he was
actually not presenting in one of the
postdocs was presenting about their work
and I remember asking a couple of
questions about the work and for some
reason I think the person I'm not going
to mention the name and all that
misunderstood the question and it
thought it was a big criticism or
something and you could sense in the
person how uneasy he was feeling and oh
that kind of God had got the whole thing
god what I wanted to know about the
question and then very calmly interceded
and made some comments about that and
then I said oh okay that makes sense and
then he said a few words ah to the
person not really to me saying oh this
was great because you were able to show
this this and that and at the same time
insert my question so basically in one
statement he cleared my concerns he
cleared that person's concerned and
everything was back alive and everybody
was super happy then I saw well this is
great work and the person was like
finally you this is out of the way and
that's just one example of how he was
always on top even if he was there in
the little corner and you might even
think he was not paying attention on the
contrary it was completely on top and
rescue that person and I think that is
one aspect that shows how good I believe
he was and and and you've all mentioned
that to me many times in terms of his
connections to people collaboration and
that's just one more example of that
anyways I just wanted to share one
little story with you that's when I have
once again thanks to you of all
congratulations to putting this event
together thanks to all of you for coming
this is a great event and I hope you
have a very good second day right
so now it's my pleasure to announce the
talk by ohm a hundred from ubc limits on
limits of Ghana maps thank you and it's
a pleasure to be here very nice visit so
far so well let me just get right to it
so so this is a planar map and since
this is going to be an introductory talk
so even though there are some big
experts on this in the room I'll give
almost all the definitions so so
essentially it's just the planar graph
and it's embedded in the plane but we
don't really care about how it's
embedded so if you distort the plane
with a good with embedded graph we
consider it is the same planar map so we
only are interested in the convenor
topics of what is connected to what end
in the order in which things are
connected but not in the specific
embedding so okay so as so the funding
gap now we are interested in I to start
with in two different types of the
strangulation so Oh maps in the sphere
and then lend our maps in a disk but and
one more comment that the Sydney or so
so frequently we are interested in not
in maps just in the graphs but also in
routed maps so in a hooded map we just
have a marked edge which gesture is a
which we think of is devote this is
mostly for technical reasons of
eliminating symmetries but still it's a
convenient assumption so so this is an
example of a particular map here it's a
triangulation in the sense that all
faces are triangles but as you can
imagine there are many other variations
so so that regulation to all faiths or
Tigers squad regulations have a
four-sided faces you can consider k
regular phases where the graph is where
every vertex has degree KO you can see
there are several other restrictions you
could allow mixtures of those you can
have a connectivity constraints you
might want it to be three connected the
you can consider variations where things
are also colored and the colors have
some interactions but let's say getting
a bit power and the interesting thing is
they're stressed as a random walk say
and they're mild conditions we have to
the same universality class it's
believed that all of these structures
believe belong to the same universality
class meaning that if you take such a
random cluster such a random structure
you take it and you and you let take a
very loud one it looks more or less the
same at least in the large scale as if
you took any other distribution there's
one more way of thinking about this so
these are so these pictures are
shamelessly stolen from do plenty has
talked a couple of days ago and some of
the other pictures have also taken from
other talks so they might look familiar
to some of you so there's another way of
thinking about it which is in terms of a
random surface and this is part of the
reason people were interested in this so
what you see here is they you can think
of it easier as it is at regulation or
code regulation let's say think of it to
the triangulation folder for a moment
and you can see think of this is having
some triangles which are just glued
together so so this is so does the
analogy between the random walk which is
sort of as the drunkards walk so so
there's a story that these surfaces are
like the drunken quilt quiltmaker so he
has a lot of species so there are
triangles or squares and it just takes
one and glues it too well to the
previous one and who sews it and each
time he takes another piece and so did
eventually you get some surface but
instead of being flat and comfortable
you get something that looks like this
so so so these are some of the
interesting questions so that we have
about this so so we have this a random
structure and we want to know what what
does it look like you take you take one
with a million vertices what what does
it look like is it similar to the
euclidean lat is in some sense is it is
it hyperbolic so that's a one question
now then there are questions about the
scaling limits so you have this say so
you have this structure you can try to
rescale it's try to see if you get some
limiting object like Brownian motion
and then there are some interesting
questions about conformal probabilities
so you have a random surface if you
think of it not just as a graph but as I
mentioned this is triangle so squared
that are sewn together then you can
think of it as a surface and you can try
to say to ask questions about it
conformal properties so of course many
other questions that and I'm not going
to talk about all of this so this is a
simulation of a large strangulation and
done by Jewish FL so it doesn't look
plain out because it's embedded not in
the plane but it's embedded in three
dimensions so you can think of it as
sort of a surface and you can see in
various a phenomenon certainly doesn't
look very regular like a sphere you see
that you have this areas where you have
clumps of a lot of points clump together
so this is another picture again from
New plenty a stalker a office the same
style the same objects or not not
exactly the same but the same a
structure so you have a triangulation
and it's embedded in three dimensions as
a surface so ok so it's fairly clear
that it doesn't quite look nice and
smooth but house but exactly how I wrap
it is there is a more interesting
question so it's a two-dimensional
surface topologically it's a sphere so
already spirit very well so this is a
discrete one it's a final this is a
finite a thing so there's no way
problems Oh
good length not all so I thought as I
met haha it's not an isometric embedding
like what rich who hasn't drawn so
usually the way to do these things you
try to do to find some energy
minimization so you try to do we try to
keep the lengths a similar but but you
can so so that's say so that's the way
both of these pictures I believe will
generate it okay so so a very brief
overview of the history of the of this
topic so the several directions say from
which people came to this so so
physically people are thought of this
it's called two dimensional quantum
gravity in physics and again the idea as
in there is to take some average of
various quantities over surfaces instead
of over paths which is done in with
family integrals and particularly
interesting so a aspect is the Cape easy
formula so this is a relation between
critical exponents of clinical models in
Euclidean lattices in two dimensions and
the corresponding models on these random
graphs so arrested you can do
calculation you can think of self
avoiding work or easing model and the
two-dimensional lattice you can also
perform these models on these random
graphs you can compute the exponents and
the nice thing is that in these random
graphs in many cases the exponents are
much easier to compute and the KPC
relation and allows us to go for me from
the exponents in this quantum gravity
setting to the exponents in the lattice
so there are some works by Bertrand
ability and others relating that to use
to compute the exponents in Euclidean
lattices say along these lines so i
should say there are steps in this
approach that are not completely regress
saying so there's some progress but but
okay so let's say that's about the
physics
his work um no it's a very new slide
that and the duplin th Sheffield walk is
certainly a big piece of a of making
this thing say more we go west so as
some parts of a concerning the relation
said to the scaling limits are still
open and I'll say what about this later
okay so so let's say the physics
motivation mathematically so it's a very
natural object to take a random planar
graph there's a phone call of theorem a
which was a big big motivation for
studying them and touch as a program in
the 60s which he didn't push through to
prove the four color theorem but and but
part of it involved the numerator planar
map see developed some techniques for
full enumeration she came up with in
valleys formulas including this one for
the number of triangulation sauve of a
polygon with with the given number of
internal vertices so so why am why do we
want to talk about polygons so you're
not that here I just have an external
phase which is not a triangle so so this
is a triangulation but we have one
external phase which has a different
size and frequently these things they
turn out to be useful in fact in order
to even write down the recursions that
that he developed you need them so so
very roughly the idea is that if you
have some planar structure so you pick
an edge maybe the boot edge one next to
the voltage and you ask what happens if
you delete the voltage so there are two
possibilities one possibility is that
you have sort of a bridge and then you
get to two disconnected maps the other
possibility is that you delete this so
you have some facing which is no longer
part of it and you get a smaller map so
so this allows allows one to write to
the curtains for the number of such a
objects and and then the some
non-trivial techniques developed to
solve this so the precise formula is not
so important what's more important is
the asymptotics yes
yes yes you can use these occasions to
simulate essentially because you have if
you once you have the enumeration it's
possible to simulate okay so so the more
important thing is the asymptotics and
what you're not so the number of
triangulation say of the polygon wood
with bounty size m and n internal
vertices so you have some constant
depending on the boundary and you have
an exponential term in this case say 256
over 27 to the N and then you have n to
the minus five-halves and the
interesting thing is that so this
constant 856 over 27 is not so
interesting so this is the dependent on
the model will you to detect angulations
code regulations and so on and the
exponents of 5 half say is the universal
one so in every class of maps that that
were enumerated a you always get the
same a type of asymptotic say the same
exponent and this exponent is can be
seen from some of the arguments as a
bigger effect on the structure of these
objects then then the exponential term
ok so so this a is about enumeration and
and have two sets of maury cently there
were newer techniques of a developed for
for enumeration by jective techniques so
this was a pushed forward quite a lot by
Zeile sheffer and discos so so the idea
is that you have a bijection between the
set of a planar maps of a given class
sacred regulation so the nicest a
constructions in the case of code
regulations of the duels which are for
regular maps so those also have the
simplest formula so you have a bijection
between those and the three a plane tree
so that's it we will they were the
children of the future tech so ordered
and there is also some additional
structure and very roughly you can think
of this additional structure is telling
you how to take these three and glue
together different parts of the tree
to get a surface so so I'm not going to
say much about this except that this is
a this by jackson say have turn out to
be extremely useful okay so i was
talking about i'm going to talk about
limit of planar map so there are two
types of limits that we can consider so
one is the scaling limit and one is a
discrete limit so in the discrete limit
you try to ask what they what is the
planar map look like locally so you take
this a random a planar graph this random
am you take a typical vertex and you ask
what does its environment what is its
neighborhood look like so you have some
distribution on the neighborhoods and in
this sense say you can try to take a
limit and you get an infinity just an
infinite planar map so the random walk
analogy is not so interesting in this
case it just says that you can take a
random walk of n steps and you can take
a limit and you get a random walk that
never stops the scaling limit is more
analogous to the scaling limit of London
box to Brownian motion so you have this
a random structure you can think of it
as a metric space with a graph metric so
you can think of the of the surface with
a with the glue the triangles and you
can justly scale this so you have some
random metric space you can try to
rescale it and get some some random way
but but Raphael a metric space so I'll
say a few words a few quick words about
the scaling limits and then I'll talk
about the discrete limit so so as one of
the first results about scaling limit is
this one the diameter scaled by N to the
one quarter and not enter the one half a
is 41 walks a converges to some
distribution in fact it's known what the
distribution is and this guys did much
more than than just the diameter much
more recently the walks by a legal and
gun pool on so they show that I the
descaling limit actually exists and
again it was known that in certain other
senses the scaling limit exists before
that but but in the stronger sense of
random 8
spaces in the global house of topology
this is was done by legal so if you take
this a.m n which is this a random map of
size n and you take d which is the graph
distance now you just rescale the
distance by n to the 1 quarter then this
converges sympathetically to do some
rando metric space so it's known that
the space is topologically a sphere
although it has house of dimension 4 and
and the conjecture is that a that this
limit is essentially the sphere with a
random metric well the metric is related
to the to the smooth metric by by a
factor of e to their constant times the
Gaussian free field yes what was there
yeah it may be four sub sequences sorry
yes this game I believe it's half in
this case squirrel to page 38 of a say
he made some so it's a concept a
universal constants yes and I would say
that day yeah so I should say that this
a conjecture is a one of the big missing
pieces in making legalize this approach
of computing critical exponents say
using quantum gravity so as so far we
don't so so we know that the Kapus
relation holds there within this random
a good metric space with in the metric
space with this exponent e to the J but
but relating this to the limit of the
discrete processes is still open yes so
this is a map this is the picture of
this e to the g and um and I just like
to point out that this also looks like a
planar map and I may say some more words
about this at the end if this time but
now I'd like to to move over to discrete
limits so so these were some of the
things that are happening with this
taking the scaling limits of these
objects so how do we take the discrete
limits and again i apologize to anyone
they tell this 50 times already this
definition but but they're so so we
consider a again eh so we voted planar
graph so previously the boot was an edge
now it's a vertex this is not
particularly important if it can also be
vertex so we consider just this planar
this graph and in this case it doesn't
have to be planar we just need a route
though which is a marked vertex and we
have this a class distal booted graphs
and there's a topology on those graphs
well two graphs are close to each other
if the if large balls around a tent
around the root of isomorphic so so we
take the ball of radius a around a the
OE genie in g1 and the ball around a
around the origin in g2 and we want them
to be as a and if if this holds
for LA
Alvin then the gloves are closed so it's
easily met risible and those of you in
the front rows can see an example here
where where we have these two graphs so
the up to radius 1 they agreed but but
once you go to Reggie's to they do not
agree so so they are not very close okay
so this is a so this is the topology on
a on gloves and a couple of quick
examples of the limit so you take you
can take a circle of length and so when
n tends to infinity this converges to an
infinite line so if you take any
neighborhood of the any heat fixed size
neighborhood of the wood then it looks
like a straight line once n is large
enough you can take a n by n square if
you put the boot at the cornell then
this converges to a quarter plan a
quarter of the of the euclidean lavish
if you put the boot away from the from
the boundary then it converges to the
infinity to the regular to the complete
euclidean lattice one last example if
you take a binary tree and you put a
good day at what is usually called the
root of the binary tree you take the
boot up to depth and then these
converges to then this converges to the
infinite binary tree an exercise for you
is what happens if you put the wood at
the leaves but and I'll just say that
you get a different way infinity three
so so this is the topology on a graft
once we have the topology of graphs we
can talk about random graphs so if we
have a any distribution on a on a wooded
graph way then we can any set to tick
safe sequence of distributions we can
try to consider a week limit and ok so
this a holds they also without a
restriction on day on the degree on the
boundary but there's an easy fact that
if you look at the class of graphs where
you have a uniform bound on the degrees
then this is a compact setting this
topology which makes a various arguments
a much simpler
yeah okay so so this is a so this is the
idea of this limit and essentially the
way to think of it so you have this
graph and you ask what is the what is
the neighborhood of a of the would look
like you have some distribution on the
neighborhoods and and you can look at
this for any finite diameter any finite
radius for the neighborhood and then you
can take a limit and and you get some
limiting distribution on neighborhoods
for any given radius and now in many
cases say we want to take limits of also
of graphs which don't have a boot and in
this case we just take the boot
uniformly at random so then in this case
where when we talk about limits of
graphs with no marked root then then it
just means that we are interested in the
distribution of the neighborhoods of
typical vertices okay so so one theorem
that that I'm going to prove is
following so so you take GN which is the
random a planar graph undoing plano
triangulation specifically and with the
given size so so that's the
triangulation of the sphere with n
vertices so this is a random booted
graph and the theorem just says that the
limit exists and in fact the lay it also
should say that the limit gives you some
infinite plane or triangulation so so it
gives you some interesting even planet
regulation and there are two parts in
the proof of this so so one part the
third part is the easy one to show that
the probability of getting any
particular environment converges so
suppose this is the ball of radius R so
you have the wood here and you want so
you have some particularly ball and you
want to say what's the probability of
seeing this particular ball what's the
probability that that we have this
particular environment for the origin so
we have evolved a new site has some
boundary of size M and we want to say
how many ways there are to complete this
28 regulation of the entire sphere with
n vertices so let's say that we have K
vertices overall in this ball so it's
just given
the number of triangulation so once you
remove this the spot you're left with
just a polygon the rest of the sphere is
just a polygon and you have external
bound phase of size M so you now think
of this as the external phase and the
remainder has k n minus K vertices so
you feel n minus K and M so this is the
number of ways of completing this
tutorial ation of the sphere and we need
to divide this by by the total number to
get to get the probability and if you
look at the asymptotics I'm sorry that
there's not really you have an external
phase of size 34 they pull the total
number when did any case you if you look
at that simpatico Phi you can see that
the exponential term a cancels out your
left with something that depends only on
K and M and in particular the limit
exists so this is a so this shows that
the limit exists it doesn't show that it
gives us a probability measure and so we
need some sort of tightness for that and
here there's a very nice argument and it
might remind you of an argument from
Moody's talk about considering the
considering a random walk on the graph
and observing the environment seen from
the random walk and we have the same
effect here so if you take a random walk
on the graph and so if you take it on
the walk on the on the graph fair so you
started the boot and you move in now you
consider the map again rebooted at this
point then you get then didn't this is
stationary so at any given time you get
the same distribution ok so now let's
look at the maximal degree within a ball
of radius R we want to show that this is
tight and this will and this will give
us the tightness that we need type so it
just means that the tail decays 20
uniformly in the size of the of the
whole layer triangulation so so we have
it a sequence of distributions one for
each n and we wanted the probability
that ml is greater than T tends to 0 as
T tends to infinity so this they hold
foreign distribution but we want this to
go to be uniform in n
so okay so we want to show that the
maximal degree in in a in any finite
radius is tight so for the griz evolve
just for the degree of the root this is
known and you can and it's fairly easy
you can compute the distribution of the
degree from this sort of argument okay
now we proceed by induction so if they
so suppose it for radius R minus 1 it is
tight and now we just observe that the
ball of radius R you can think of it as
a union of balls around each of the
vertices say the tornado they tell the
neighbors of the hood so if in each and
in each of one of those so okay so if we
take one random step so we replace the
woodway random neighbor and we look at
their involve radius R minus one of this
new neighbor of this new would then this
has the same distribution as we started
with so this is the stationarity and
this means that the maximal degree in
each of those bolts is tight but we also
have a quite a small number of these
balls so the number of this ball say is
not bounded but it is also tight so this
means that mr is the maximum of a tight
number of not independent but it's a
tight number of a of copies of em r
minus 1 and from this it's easy to see
that it is tight so let's say okay so we
have we finished one proof let's say
that's good yeah hi you know so okay so
one more statement it to show you how
this thing say work so so this limiting
result is one ended and and i'll skip
the proof but but but one last results
so the size of the ball of radius R goes
like out to the fold this is closely
related to the today I into the
one-quarter a diameter size scaling and
m and related to the health of dimension
fall of the limit so the number of
vertices within distance R goes like out
to the fall even though it is plain
island in flat
so one particularly interesting question
about this and it's a question that
incomplete generalities still open is
whether it's the current all transients
so you have a random graph that's one of
the first questions you ask is it
recurrent all transients except when
it's obvious in this case it's not
obvious so so so there's the following
theorem may do to bender minions are
motivated by exactly this a this
question which is which is if also you
take some graphs AGN so we take any
finite any sequence of finite planar
graphs and there's a condition that the
degrees are bounded by M and that's the
reason they that's the reason for its
not resolved in complete morality and
now you take a uniform a hoot uniformly
at random so you get the distribution on
random graphs you take care its limit
then the theorem is that the limit is so
its limit is a random is a random graph
in the theorem it's almost truly
recurrent so if you take a three regular
mail portfolio guilherme pay so any of n
a large number of classes of plano maps
then this theorem applies so you take so
it doesn't matter if the gns are random
so you tay so as long as they satisfy
the condition so so as long as you have
bounded degrees you can get the limit is
recurrent okay so you might say the
three regular graph is the dual of a
triangulation and if a graph is
recurrent the planar graphs and the
plano duel is also likely to be
recurrent but but there are counted
examples and and again the conjecture is
that that is the Collins holds a for any
class of plano maps that you would care
to take so so I'll just finish with
there with a very brief overview of the
of a of what how this is proved and that
is the idea instago to combine this with
a sum of a dead cell you walk
local packings which we heard about
yesterday so you take a circle back you
have a finite graph so let's assume for
a minute it a triangulation and this is
not really a problem then you can
consider its circle packing and you can
consider the limit of the circle
packings so so it's possible to take
this limit and in the limit you get a
random circle packing in the plane which
has the same way combinatorial topology
it's a circle packing corresponding to
the limiting of to the limit of the
graphs GN so you might need subsequences
here but that's not a problem and then
you have to step so one step is to show
that that the limiting packing has at
most one accumulation point so it's so
it's locally finite and so again and
then a and then the second step is to
use a result of range from saying that
if you have that if you have a locally
finite triangulation with bounded
degrees the locally find its circle back
with bundle degrees then it corresponds
to le current graph so so formally to
say it uses the notion of X lima length
and and I think amount of time so I will
not describe this but yes i'll stop ya
thang
how many only a couple of things and
physically over 40 I find all the try
and say explicitly so these show is to
consider a phrase like mend them into
the planar graph that's a somewhat vague
phrase what exactly does the name the
sort of what I find it helpful to say is
that there at least three different
things you can mean by that a couple of
it you haven't mentioned here that is
you can start off by taking some great
particular bottle of your uniform on all
the planar graphs of size and or some
particular type and then take local
league limits so that gives you these
rate particular nice special models
their special models like valium ocean
or edits rainy or SLE in a special model
the second thing is the dirt on veni
vidi the chair result at the end you can
take some arbitrary finite planar graphs
the tech load will be weak limits of
those what you get that is the whole
casa processes which are exactly the
graph theory analog of stationary
processes and it's on a bizarre to me
that your benjamini sham hasn't been
pursued much further oh it's kind of as
if Burke approved the ergodic theorem
and then everyone went away and paid no
attention to it you have this sort of a
fascinating class for stationary
processes you've got one here of about
them but really there are 100 theorems
about these things start being
interacting particle focuses on these
graphs and set them on the lattice
example and UCLA so that's all a large
class of things again bring back my
original saying what do you mean by the
phrase random into the planar graph
precaution can do something entirely
different for probabilistic and just
take a pass on quite close at four
points on the plane and then think of
some cool drawing edges in that gives
you something different different still
some you know that all these lines of
work and a two of those three ideas oded
was far away in all the way and somehow
people the projector kind of so you
clearly let you know there's this vague
idea pretty good covers some lots of
mathematically different
things ok hospital you also have a
question and isn't that right
we went on one general question you
might or might not want to answer so
many people want it to be students about
their but as far as i know you were the
only one who succeed over please have
sex with that you're also a student so
he died so hey what was the secret how
did you have a connections have all
right how did you like a dark yep yes an
intern yeah well i was already a student
of that at the time so that's why I came
here so yeah it started in there the
Sinai Peninsula I believe I'm I think
this ties nothing so okay maybe in the
reminiscence h and you will choose to
share some work anymore
so it's my pleasure to announce now to
talk by Michael Friedman who is going to
speak about random triangulations as
dynamical variables in quantum
mechanical models on Thank You Bertrand
I realized I was trying to get Bertrand
to give me the last bit of information I
needed to give this talk with the mic
open in the back room but I got it
covered so the the general setting for
what I'll be talking about is
chern-simons theory and I realized that
this is the first approximation a room
for full of probabilistic sperience with
chern-simons theory may be varied now
many of you brushed up against physics
may have learned in that way and some of
you were educated in physics but some of
you may not have seen it before so I
want to just put it in in context uh
it's really sort of a child of what's
called churned a theory from the vial
which is the method of describing
twisting of bundles or characteristic
classes in terms of curvature the
curvature tensor is a to form with
coefficients in daily algebra and the
characteristic classes are polynomials
in this to form so they're even degree
polynomials and they give even degree
differential forms and the turn Simon's
theory is sort of a boundary variation
on the theory of characteristic classes
where an integration is performed to
reduce the dimension so you sort of
subtract one by antiderivative to get
the turn silence forms and you know if
you want a typical formula you'll see
something like a DA plus if it's non
abelian there may be it
the term like this triple wedge of a and
you can think of this if you have a
physics background as a as a connection
in a gauge bundle it might be
electromagnetic gauge bundle you want or
it might be a you to gauge bundle or
whatever now turn and Simon's actually
had rather modest ambitions when they
wrote this down they were trying to
solve some very classical problem about
conformal embeddings this was around
nineteen seventy his background is sort
of 1940 through 1950s but it turned out
that they stumbled on probably the most
well sited action in the world after
kinetic energy so you know it's amazing
the payoff to an abstract mathematical
investigation so 15 years after they
wrote down the chern-simons formula to
get a number associated with a
particular connection physicists were
integrating over all connections doing
one of these generalized fine and path
integrals they were looking at things if
this is called the chern-simons action
of a and physicists by 1985 we're
looking at things like the integral over
all connections of e to the minus 2 pi I
some level K times the chern-simons
action of the connection and thinking of
this as a perturbed Gaussian integral
you can already see that there's this is
sort of a quadratic form an a because
there are two ways here with a term
which is considered perturbatively now
why is this such a great thing to have
written down well there are two things
about it one is it's all written in
terms of forms the metric doesn't enter
in so that means there's no metric in
the formula there's no dij written
anywhere so this means it's possibly
going to give a topological action
when written up here so it's going to
give something that might be very
abstract and deep and not depend on this
geometric structure of space but just on
its topology that's the first hint that
something great has been written here
the second hint is that there's one
derivative here okay and that's a shock
because in physics you're used to things
in the action which are like one-half MV
squared and this V of course is velocity
that's a derivative when you square it
you see two derivatives in the formula
so you have two derivatives now y is 1
so much better than two in condensed
matter physics some of the most
interesting stuff happens when you take
the noise away at low temperatures and
if you have a translation invariant
system it's always better to think of it
in momentum space than position space
because those are symmetries which
diagonalize the hamiltonian so you
always think a k vector at a time and
when you're working when you want to see
the details underneath all the thermal
noise and you go down to very low
temperatures that means you're looking
at very small K vectors very small
momentum and differentiation as everyone
knows from free analysis and case-based
differentiation goes over to
multiplication so one derivative if you
can see this here means K 1 copy of K
and two derivatives mean k squared + k
will be much smaller sorry K squared
will be much smaller than K for at low
temperatures low energy limit so if the
system for some reason has a topological
term however week it should come to the
fore at few millikelvin
now what I'm primarily interested in is
topological states of matter sometimes
called them topological phases and if
you want a very quick definition it's a
state of matter in quantum mechanics or
a ground state which is degenerate
so there the ground state is in
one-dimensional but many dimensional and
usually this happens for a boring reason
like in a magnetic system there might be
a symmetry ferromagnet the spins my
point in different directions and that
causes a degeneracy of the ground state
but that degeneracy is easily lifted by
adding a small perturbation but what
characterizes a topological phase it's a
ground state that's stable the local
perturbation you can't lift it so it's a
ground state that does not have to do a
symmetry and instead is stable
to perturbations
now you know so I don't want to get into
this but we want to build a quantum
computer here Microsoft and this is how
I expect we're going to do it by
manipulating topological states of
matter and chern-simons theory turns out
to be the main highway to topological
phases our understanding of them and
there's sort of a weaker path that it I
want to outline today the main highway
is the field theory approach which is
precisely integrating this action this
turn Simon's action and where you land
you land at particular examples of
topological phases you land in these
so-called Tyrell phases which have like
a handedness coming from a magnetic
field or like right-handed phases and in
particular you land in the physical
world called fractional quantum Hall
effect so don't worry what this is if
you don't know but it's just some very
interesting two dimensional low
temperature system and many different
league groups associated to different
gauge bundles and different levels k are
believed to be seen or at least glimpsed
in fractional quantum Hall systems and
the degeneracy of the ground state is
sort of the computational blackboard or
computational space of the computer that
we want to build there but there's
another way of looking at your
assignments theory which is more
algebraic and starts with the
fundamental concept being the
representations of the symmetries the
symmetry algebra chern-simons theory and
if you take a representation point a
theoretic approach then the primary
object of interest are the particle
types the point like excitations of the
theory I'll just call them particles
which are usually written like a and B
and the first thing you want to know
when you discuss a theory of particles
is what they might fuse into which in
representation language is which copies
of a occur in eight if see occurring a
tensor be so you have these fusion
conditions and then the next most
important structure when you start
thinking of the algebraic side is the
so-called 6j symbol which tells you how
you can reorganize fusion diagrams it
tells you equivalences between processes
so the 6j symbol says that if you see a
fusion pattern like this with think of
it reading from left to right so 8 a and
C come in and B and D come out and they
maybe have an intermediate particle I
then a 6j symbol is a tensor which
reacts presses this as the summation
over a be I CDJ of diagrams that re
couple in the other way
so these coefficients can be calculated
from the operator product expansions
associated with the cft associated with
chern-simons theory and should be able
to kind of close this diagram and you
should be able to make other topological
phases or models for them by thinking on
the quantum algebra side rather than the
blindman integral side there'll be small
differences we expect to get a chiral
theories here so if we're looking for
physical models we probably don't have a
magnetic field present what would the
physical model we would try to hit well
that's right now big question mark we're
sort of at the stage of working on the
math theory side we don't really have
very strong candidates of what the
actual lab system would be but we're
trying to lay a little bit of foundation
now you might say this looks like field
theory and this looks like a lattice
model but I want to make the point that
that lower path is not quite a lattice
model
because if you notice the not only did
the letters change a little bit which
are sort of the states on the lattice
edges of the bonds but actually the
diagram change the lattice change shape
you know the left diagram in the right
diagram are like a little piece of bit
of different lattices so if you want to
build a hilbert space the natural cats
or basis vectors for the hilbert space
will be a pair the lattice i'm calling
it a triangulation and it's labeling of
it so triangulation in a state so the
triangulation I don't know it's sort of
should be implicitly visible in these
pictures as the dual structure I sort of
drew the dual thing but in red I could
also draw the triangulation and you see
if you're used to these pictures that
I've done kind of a famous thing to the
triangulation on the left to turn in one
on the right I did this placket flip
where I took this vertical bond and i
turned it horizontal so that means we
don't have a really a fixed lattice
which is traditional and condensed
matter physics that's what most of the
literature is but we have a fluctuating
lattice we wanted to work in a Hilbert
space that contains both of sort of
quantum gravity and labeling so in it
relates to the previous talk and what
the Hamiltonian will look like just
whimsically call it quantum gravity
Hamiltonian is will have some terms
which are the topological enforcers that
will enforce the fusion rules that I
explained a and B fuse to see and will
enforce the 6j symbols
we'll have a term which allows defects
so I'll call that Delta capital D well
it actually penalizes defects by an
amount Delta and perhaps some other
terms in perturbation which will come to
later so the point is if we had a fixed
lattice structure like a honeycomb I
know mathematicians don't call this the
lattice that mean it it's I mean it's
it's not it's two lattices physicists do
okay so yep I interested in having a lot
of quasiparticle sense boo why I talked
about lettuce bitches my head drop their
small tea
oh no I'm thinking of know the the
underlying topological fluid will be
made of this sort of string network of
particle lines but they're not the
quasiparticles of the system so there
are two levels and you're confusing the
two and I understand why so the the
mathematical input to create a
topological phase is the fusion algebra
for the representations of some quantum
group now on the one hand you could
think of those letters a B and C as the
excitations of some system and you're
asking me about those but I'm not using
them as excitations I'm trying to build
the ground state if it's called the
quantum double by inputting the fusion
relations from the original algebra so
you could look at a picture like this
and think that it represents a 1 1 plus
1 dimensional physics of some particles
moving from left to right but that's a
way of thinking and it's a good way of
thinking but it's not literally what I'm
describing I'm describing 2 plus 1
dimensional physics and the two
dimensional ground state will be encoded
by some large lattice or fluctuating
lattice of bonds encoded by a label
decorated by particle types from some
representation theory I don't know if
that helped but I am thinking of a large
lattice and I'm thinking in particular
the lattice might just be the honeycomb
but it'll have to for this type of model
to function they'll have to be a
provision that allows defects to be
formed and removed it will have to be
possible to flip bonds to like heat up
the cunning honeycomb and let it
fluctuate in order for the six j symbols
to function how am i doing for time
so now where does Oded enter I realized
this lattice would be fluctuating and I
thought that might be a problem so I
emailed her dead and told them that I
had heard that there might be some slow
or moderate relaxation times associated
to the space of triangulations so
specifically what I asked him about what
suppose you take the 2-sphere and you
take triangulations on it and just to
make it concrete you fix the number of
triangles as N and you think of this as
the vertices as a graph of the graph and
the edges of the graph you think of
these flip moves that I highlighted
before that like het flip and now this
is a graph and you look at its incidence
matrix may be minus the incidence matrix
and what I wanted to know is the
spectral gap of this matrix and so I I'd
call this lambda this gap it's related
to the lambda of yesterday by very
simple formula well it turns out that
this is algebraic an den it's probably
something like n to the minus 1 I with
my normalization where I just take this
as the incidence matrix I'm not taking
the probable astore Malaysian yet but
Oded said we could learn a lot about
what was going on if we just
concentrated on the outer planar case
because everything there was given by
Catalan numbers and we could work
everything out we'd understand and then
we at least know sort of roughly what we
were talking about so over email it oded
gave me this lovely lecturing
combinatorics so we replace this with
the outer case
where we look at a fixed polygon and we
consider only triangulations where we
add no new vertices inside and as you
all know that these are counted by 12
514 and so on these are the Catalan
numbers cat n which is I'm sure everyone
in the audience can correct me if I make
a mistake here it's roughly equal to an
exponential which again is not the
important part and then a polynomial
piece which is n to the minus
three-halves so
so since I was asking a spectral
question and you know dead thinks very
geometrically he said we should think
about this in terms of the chigger point
of view we should look for like where's
a narrow place to cut the space of all
triangulations outer planar
triangulations you know we want to think
of this space as roughly looking like we
want to sort of know if it's long and
thin and see if we can find a way to cut
it into two pieces to see how it would
vibrate and figure out what that lambda
is so that's the arc you have to have
some inspiration to figure out how to
cut these infinite dimensional graphs
you know and I he told me to cut it into
the thick part and the thin part and had
some what that was and he said well so
he said every outer planar triangulation
so i won't do all the vertices around
here has what's called a central
triangle and it's unique well there's a
detail to say there's an odd number of
vertices on the boundary than its unique
so i don't know if this is a standard
notion but what the central triangle is
it's the one triangle in the picture
where the fraction of vertices on the
three sides is all less than fifty
percent so you have n 1 n 2 n 3 vertices
here and each of these ni is less than
or equal to n over 2 ok and it's quite
clear that there can't be more than one
of these because if you have one and you
go to the side then one of these edges
from something on the side will involve
the summit two of the previous terms and
will be much too big so uniqueness is
easy well classic triangulation so you
can outer planar that means there's only
the vertices on the edge of the polygon
you don't have a tree Scotia's it's
equivalent to a duel there's a duel tree
structure and those are counted by
Catalan numbers so there's but then her
dad said a lovely thing which is very
very much what he would say it he said
well now of course you know why there is
a central triangle
it's the fixed point theorem in the disc
so the point is you imagine each of
these triangles to be endowed with a
sort of a vector field where it flows in
on the long side and flows out on the
short sides and if there was no central
triangle you'd retract the disk to the
circle so that's how you show there's a
central triangle now the definition of
thick and thin is you just take the
smallest ends call it n 3 the you know
say n 1 is greater than or equal to n 2
is greater than equal to M 3 and you
just say n 3 is less than or equal is
greater than or equal to n over 10 or n
3 is less than n over 10 10 is more or
less flexible here and this is called
thick this is called thin
and it basically cuts the graph the
hypergraph or will the high dimensional
graph of outer planar triangulations
into two classes and now you can just
kind of count away to your heart's
content you only need Sterling's formula
and this approximation to the Catalan
number and you can figure out that
roughly you have order one thick ones
order one thin ones you can figure out
how many are near the boundary and you
can figure out exactly what the cheater
constant is and the conclusion is that
you get an upper bound you get n to the
minus one half is greater than or equal
to this cheater isoparametric constant k
which of course then gives a bound on
this lambda I was asking and this
translates immediately to the mixing
time being greater than or equal to n to
the three halves it's sort of the
reciprocal of this exponent but you get
an extra one there because protecting
mixing time you should go to the
probable astore malai zation of the
incidence matrix by the way there's an
important difference there if you do
some physics as well as probability you
should be aware of in probability it's
very natural that if you have D guys
you're going to then the probability is
like 1 over d you'll move to any one of
them but if you're thinking physics and
you have D interactions with other
people just because you're interacting
with a lot of people doesn't that weaken
those interactions there's no reason to
divide them by anything you know you
have a lot of this house and stabbing
you with knives all hit you at the same
strength no actually from confirm
computer simulations I think this is
typical physicist yeah I'm not the math
world right so probability of looking at
the shoes of one of your neighbors get
some
so some by the way so all these new
Maris's who I don't think I mentioned
them at the beginning I wrote them on
the board so this this is what I'm
discussing is all joint work with for
numerical physicists who've been trying
to see if anything I'm saying makes
sense Matthias Troyer Simon traps
Charlotte gills and Sergey Astakhov and
they've they've done numerics on all
these topological issues that are I'm
now getting to uh it I think they're
they're still out I won't speak for them
so by the way I think even in the outer
planar case this beautiful idea of
hodad's maybe didn't hit the i'm not
sure if it actually hit the best cut
found some cut because the simulation
seems to give a slightly slower mixing
uh I'm now why was I worried about the
this probabilistic sounding thing of
mixing time if you want to construct it
a topological phase you really need a
gap a gap above the ground state to
protect the information and I was
worried that any model that had a
quantum gravity aspect to it would be
gapless and the gap lessness would
damage the robustness of the topological
information and in fact these models are
slightly gapless that's this isn't this
isn't a very well I mean that you could
have a much worse situation you could
have the gap decaying exponentially in
some parameter I mean it's a low it's a
low polynomial I mean it's not it
doesn't meet in n get ya me right I mean
it's it's not good it's not it's still
not good it's not good di dis gapless it
just it just it just different
communities don't call those powers
councils but I I think of them as
gapless yes and you were originally
thinking about general
you would expect out of those days to do
the same 00 dead was just sort of
warming us up with this yeah that was
his guess but there that they had the
same exponent and the numerix actually
we did on the not the we did them on
both and they were the same okay so the
last thing the last part of this talk is
to try to explain why yup so one of them
one thing we did the cheek or bound
doesn't know doesn't give you a sharp
yeah I know there's a square that could
come in yeah yeah I know either I know
he's confronted so yeah I think I guess
I might have distracted or dead if you
have to find them because that was the
case in about and back to David Aldous
post yeah we did it didn't I was all but
this has been known for 15 years exactly
this sense but who serves argument I
have to get to it this far and right
into the blue first part of this the end
cuz we have gladiators interesting
simulations suggest and squid because
it's still open Oh about it still open
toxic bean on my list 1100 quick okay
yeah i actually i didn't know i did find
out about your work and I should have
mentioned it oh no but you know my usual
practice I was just ask for dead first
for you know wasting time typing
anything to Google or Wikipedia
for being okay so the question is what
can be done about this gap lessness can
you make a topologically protected model
law flattest and basically there are two
answers two ways to proceed that both
work and one is called I think of as the
timid approach and one is the bold
approach so the timid approach in the
Hamiltonian that I wrote down is just to
make defects very rare by setting Delta
toward infinity make Delta very large
constants really penalized defects then
basically you're only working on the
honeycomb with tiny quantum fluctuations
around it so that it would cost a lot of
energy to change the honeycomb and you
only get virtual processes that drag you
out of the honeycomb into other lattices
now when you do this you actually can
prove that you get all the topological
phases you expect that is assuming you
trust the perturbation theory which I
think can be made rigorous in this case
but you get a spectacle gap for the
topological phase on the order of one
quarter raised to the 55th power times
the bear energies of the terms
now this is a very small gap and
probably not useful for building a
computer now why is the gaps of small
it's because in this picture the phantom
fluctuations around the hexagon tiling
that are important are the ones that
would eventually do something
topological rotate this plaque head be
all the way around a and you can ask how
many how many f moves how many 6j moves
are required to do that now the first
one would be just to rotate this spoke
to their this spoke to there would be a
second one that spoke to their now we've
done three you do three more and you've
moved to a you do total of nine and
you've just moved be to be Prime and
then you have to do that six times to
get it back to where it is so you get a
nine times six equals 54 so you get 54 f
moves and you have to then there's a
creation and annihilation steps it turns
into 56 and then you get a 55 in the
denominator so this is only intended for
those who are familiar with perturbation
Theory know about energy denominators
and so on but so this is so timidity
gets its usual reward ok that the bolder
approach is to set Delta all the way to
zero and sort of face the quantum
gravity head-on so now you're not in the
crystalline phase where you're working
around a and now what happens is the in
this phase you made the cost of a defect
so expensive that the kinetic energy
benefits associated with proliferated
defects were balanced in the deflects
were confined or didn't even happen here
kinetic energy takes over and the whole
thing becomes just a sea of defects and
you're in a quantum liquid and in fact
they measure should be basically some
one of the measures with discussed in
the last talk you're sort of randomly
sampling a random triangulation and you
will
have to then think about these gapless
gravity waves which we call them so the
result is a very novel phase which
succeeds in protecting some topological
information but on the other hand has
gapless gravity waves
so normally you'd expect this to be very
risky but the the point is there's a gap
to topological excitations even though
that there are another class of
excitations which have low energy so
they seem dislike sure a pass in the
night I mean it's not physically
implausible I mean for instance you
could have the disjoint union of two
systems one is topological and you know
one is just a vibrating string in one's
gapless and the other isn't so it's
something akin to that that's happening
here thank
if a rather ill informed questions why
flight decompose the structure of that
cupboard space that way white white
white defects why not it brings more of
the topology of the first term I guess
is another way of saying well the point
is that the topology of the first term
involves you know these two ingredients
the 6j symbol and the fusion rules right
and the 6j symbol can't operate unless
there's a defect that's the point you
know if you start with imagine this gets
completed I won't draw it all out but
imagine you start with this picture and
you draw the honeycomb and then you
insist that this happens yeah what that
does is it turns this into a seven gun
and this into a seven gun and turns this
into a five gone in this into a five
gone and the rest are all 6's out here
so this is what I'm calling a defect
understand well so the point is the way
of inputting the topology was by the
form of the 6j symbol the sixth dry
symbol has no scope for action unless
there's some defect at least virtually
yeah I guess I'm questioning whether the
neighborhood is all six karts the way to
say oh will be well but is there is
there some topological framework in
which the the 6j rule can apply but it's
not it's not a defect in a sea of
hexagons it's rather just a sea of that
stuff that where the other things all
happen my great but it's yep ya know
what that but it's more regular it's not
noisy your chaotic it's actually more
topological well you see this is
actually goes right to the heart of
quantum gravity studies and when I was
trying to learn over the open mic just
before the talk is you know people of
people have hoped in order to describe
ultimately the physical universe by
probability measures on triangulations
and what they were hoping for is to get
something that wasn't boring wasn't just
a fixed crystal with may be
exponentially small fluctuations around
it that would allow there to be galaxies
and whatever you know some variation on
the background
so it should be slumped somewhat
flexible but it shouldn't have House
Dorf dimension you know twice what's
expected it should be approximately flat
space in this case to space or for space
for real physics but they sort of
searched in vain for 20 years trying to
find a reasonable homogeneous
Hamiltonian that would give a face that
was halfway in between a crystal and a
wild sea of everything so that's sort of
the big failure of quantum gravity now
there's something called causal
dynamical triangulation which has been
big on the quantum gravity seen in the
last ten years where they break the
symmetry they they break symmetry they
have a three directions picked out at
space in one direction as time and they
give weight to the edges of the
sympathies differently depending on
whether they're space like your time
like and with that structure they
actually can succeed in enforcing
flatness in the correct dimension
problem with adapting that the condensed
matter is that causal structure which
would is so useful in in fort allowing
fluctuation but enforcing global
flatness doesn't allow braiding you
can't braid excitations around each
other when you enforce this causality so
we looked at it and enjoyed it but we
didn't try to incorporate it since we're
you know at work on a serious project I
think we have to finish it this phone
note it
