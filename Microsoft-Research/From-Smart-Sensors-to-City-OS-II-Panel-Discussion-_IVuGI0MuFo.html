talk about personalized services in the
end so computers what kind of services
Jeremy
in that regard safety isolation you
talked about personalized services
ridiculous what kind of services that
might be it's not the civil defense I
guess not the evacuation is there
something beyond advertising that can be
regarded as personal answers
Tingari capability support for the NDF
Toure Murry some sort of the
recommendation of the restaurant or any
way to risk sports that could be a kind
of person one surface or so later in the
very industrial opposite way and
evacuation for example in our case is
not in education
everyone uses car or evacuation the Lord
will be home free stock actually had
some problems actually and maybe people
were killed by nami just just need the
drive down
on the road years ago spell area so
probably leave a moment its
implementation magnitude is easy at all
but we may was the government made
and the families who have n wa NT yet
have a kind of reality using the cars so
anyway some sort of the coordination
event that causes kind of condition
love really have to assign tasks
could be
so
I have a question to the speaker you
talk about the city of working distance
but again normal operating system in the
city of redding sister may be different
in the sense that the city of release
mr. Cooney integrated in the city
infrastructure between it can shoot
survived 15 years 100 years in that
society was given through the normal
operating system software beautiful any
you thought about how York City
operating system cancer private or next
50 years 100 years
very good question we so far have been
working on requirements analysis and
primary on the functional requirement
analysis what you talk about is a trick
them functional group analysis
reliability and reliability the terms of
the time of survival this is definitely
something that are interesting to log
into but I think that this also depends
on the integration example if we look at
the current infrastructure of cities the
first thing that these and city leaders
facing all these challenges of the hell
is not yet only the survival of 50 years
rather it's simply the ingred inability
of data how to gather here across
different agencies this is a challenger
from this perspective New York City has
done a wonderful job michael bloomberg
belief has very mean phosphoric
installed a system for the data sharing
and they have a office called mayor's
office of data analytics they have done
a wonderful job and the other cities are
moving towards that rushing but it's not
charity
so
so any yeah actually I have a question
about I think he's a general question
about meri CICS of especially proposin
idea people meeting I guess that's very
interesting I guess the privacy concern
was actually quite common any regions
like Hong Kong and China so I guess
again want to get some feedback or
comments on how that could be so if a
big data as they always come with such
cases would be so very common Thomas
okay so actually for the trajectory a
declaratory ruling IDs and you know the
more order whatever you think about this
unit is to identify the people but
promise not even that way because to
figure out that who is he because he
only your daily routines from your own
to the office and by a strong so it most
now this kind of trajectories can be a
unique identifier that are you so she
needs are very good question so how come
it hide the privacy when they still
using the city sensors to do whatever
the city planning or no and to some
service I think people are already
starting about
privacy and accusing the different
paintings of K anomalies and giving the
trajectories nothing not just pop it's
Chico trajectory of how their groove on
trajectories publishes 11 getting
individual trajectories and brewery
trajectory by hiding some noise or group
the trajectory with other trajectories
so you cannot know which why is really
the nvidia trajectories of costs dollars
you know social networks are any things
that have tried to preserve people
privacy but this is really chicken and
higher arms like once you preserve
privacy and you may lose real accuracy
of the data and then maybe the dressage
you get a service record is another
great lesson this is very very good
questions and the steering the
researcher means people are trying to
find the solution police but so far I
mean they're no perfect as my claim
after the privacy very very seriously
issues that make you say Barry
big data
actually the sum of the governmental
agencies may provide as some sort of the
regulations that just a polymerization
whatever and actually you can also have
such kind of basic raw and but still
sometimes we have some sort of see what
we called accident for example recently
one of the railway companies make some
sort of announcement that they will sell
the data greg did you see i see they get
for business that is completely
anonymous company and also the very
highly aggregated but nevertheless many
people criticized such kind of that see
sales oh they are data actually is truly
anonymization nationally no logical
weeks or ties between the data and also
the individual but still the people have
some solo pieces that said those data
belong to our tree
and anyway they think that it is natural
for them to have a kind of control all
that data so it's progressing a lot of
that sexual harassment if you say
anything insulting and if we radiate
view unhappy it become suddenly I'm
sexual husband so it's some sort of
private husband any little is just one
aspect so basically even though the
government try to provide some kind of
regulations or rules if the people feel
unhappy then companies can't use such
kind of data because customers will run
away from such a high-tech companies so
in that sense the basic part any basis
would be trust between people and also
these providers and also some sort of
agreement at this moment weekly angry
but when we look at carefully into some
kind of sentence is following that I
agree there are so many centers in and
sometimes they say that I made I'm a
transferred in timing provides this data
or some specific purpose to the seller
parties and it doesn t what we are
working is a kind of trust total
probably we need a kind of social
mechanism of establishing an antitrust
but i DNT season Idol but i declined it
as an enterprise so I grabbed a risky
that's necessary to enforce everyone to
have some sort of agreement
the people who are released to such kind
of trust mechanism will sell meat or any
will provide the data under such
contract
Robert that could be start point
otherwise surgery discussion with the
government or the data muster the
aggregation accuracy should be in this
location errors must be added something
like one kilometer or two
I think privacy is definitely important
issues into now if we look at the
problems that can come from decadence is
rather takes roughly speaking our tools
and segments why is the price segment
the other wine talk excitement for small
cities in the prior segment you have for
examples like what you have seen
discussions the location-based services
encouraging to services in San these
services can be provided by private
companies and in this case definitely
you have branch additional very typical
issues that you have been seeing from
all these location-based services then
you have the public sector in the public
sector is typically the educational
services propylene or sponsored or
German by the government and in that
case the regulation is master and the
government is involved so in fantasy
also definitely still
some people but is probably less often
the issue than in the private sector for
instance if we look at the information
that's available in the so-called open
government initiative you can find a lot
in which a presence is a security I
think about the income of people making
available about the age of the Internet
is groups etc all this information is
available perfectly and you can get more
about this kind of information not one
more so these other government minions
they are all open a horse so that you
can ask the country of Japan see that
typically all this information is
enormous but still if we look at DQ you
can still the hack some liberals
princesa if the neighborhood is baseball
you people left on this kind of the
public information you can still have
some difference but overall oh thank you
for all the comments of interrogations
any more questions from the audience
yeah they actually I laughed and I
occasionally ice can see actually a lot
of data of the garment so I'm sick I'm
time interesting how you can engage more
with the government to get Molly okay
their interest because you have talking
about and there's no security like
emergency like first grade flood so I
think for damage we have a lot of
interesting this how we can engage more
with government I don't know if you have
some comment about it actually for the
trajector Taylor and we got from the
shanghai for science alone n da
employment and you know like that's kind
of embarrassed but cuz of paper package
uses data people cheesiness Haley
Verna's work I use the data we sign NDA
so no rice say the day we gone from the
government and also because I'm data
from the china telecom and mocha mobile
calling from hollington and how to sign
some agreement another than sign
agreement the other things we do is that
we should instead be
would add remove names you can see that
hospira a key on the 90s were French and
the data you do not have any privacy
issues here and cannot find a voice
calling home and they are just cleaned
and research just for that 10-year usage
if you don't give your data but it is
really hard because the they have their
own idea probably won't keep the data by
himself they can do whatever they want
to use this oh yes good question is how
come in austin commonly trusted
University researcher to researchers use
their data from pure research have have
experience is not good and people to
answer these questions actually I have
an experience working at doesn't mean
history and so it says I have a probable
I know betta about the how to make a
kind of negotiations pick up today
all team members but the name address of
course the negotiation with the
government agencies rather difficult
because they have both regulations and
rules but at the same time we found all
I found that the recently involved and
some of the variable or even the many of
the variable information comes from
employment sectors and the video but it
companies immature they have a very good
data but the usually the aspect that is
covered by the data is a really limited
for example when we look at it's a
traffic jam information the devious
little taxis were usable but when turn
on both ends easily with limited
actually the different caffeine
companies must get together to have a
much greater information about the
services but usually they do not have so
much heart of a lion so I guess they
don't make so much peoples
so in such kind of cases the
universities can be a kind of quality to
collect the data and if they provide
available to us we were the Civic
analysis can be done more variable
informational services and within such
kinds of circles for the Coordination we
could invite governmental sector because
they also wanted a hacksaw with
information in return for the poetry
request them to provide I mean such kind
o let's say that
exchange data with the data also
creation of values justify and insert
the limit aggregating words in
correcting fragmented eso's could be
kind of viewers inviting the data
contribution from the government and all
sectors
my experience in working with the
government for arriving countries there
are data but the data really spread out
in different forms from send some data
adjust the paper form some data sporting
some personal computer some data is
stored in sumter also heated databases
so having all this information together
aggregated in such a hater not easy it's
not easy for government so let alone
being here with others so this is Evelyn
issue but they don't count too much on
such governments in because in a study
perspective you don't get too much very
Ozzie's even if they are willing to
charity and as my colleague said is
actually not easy for them to hear
then in developing countries is a little
bit different in arriving country's
government to have data but in most
cases and by the knowledge such data are
traffic arteries to their partners with
partners from your party circles so if
you want to get it what happened he can
publish the other one is to work with
the source which is ok thank you for all
the screen sharing so I think isn't
happening we should just stop here so
thank you again for all the speaker at
least no I think we should have some
shadows going to Microsoft</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
