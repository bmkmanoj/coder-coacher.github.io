contributions in fostering top talents
of computer science around Asia the
Microsoft Research Asia fellowship
program aims to empower and encourage
junior PhD students to realize their
full potential in computer science
related fields we are targeting the best
of the best hi I'm Jim Galvis ngayon
technological university it is my great
honor to receive this prestigious
battlefield for Microsoft Research Asia
I'm very thankful for the opportunity to
visit msre and attend the computing in
21st century conference high among Susan
franchi John mercy my research is using
randomized approximation to make mature
learning more efficient and scalable
I'm so excited to be here to be a board
of my msi fellowship and to be here
matters leaders of micro cell research
and the Turing winner and also so many
