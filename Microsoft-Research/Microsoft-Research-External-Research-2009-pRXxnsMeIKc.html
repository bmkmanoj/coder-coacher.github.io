China UK and india and in over 30
collaborative research institutes
worldwide Microsoft Research is
partnering in hundreds of projects each
year to advance human potential and the
well be parkland we are empowering
researchers and scientists everywhere
with the advanced technologies tools and
services they need to support every
stage of the research process I feel
that Microsoft Research is growing into
a role that very few research labs in
the world today are in namely they are
billing and interested in investing
things that may only bring some
returning on a 10 to 20-year time scale
to me it's really exciting to work with
great scientists solving some of the
problems that really are are going to be
challenging humanity everywhere and
actually we can bring technologies and
researchers that can really make a
difference to some of these problems
that to me is really the most satisfying
thing about my job
I'll use computer science to solve
problems in biology we look at proteins
and we try to find out how the involved
in disease and what is their role
research helps us improve our lives
improve the lives of the people and I
think without research we just get stuck
with them progress
at the moment we can't put chemistry on
the web in the same way as we can put
words on the weather so what we're doing
is we're creating a really intelligent
tool that understands chemistry but does
it in the environment that people
understand such as word we're trying to
really raise the bar in terms of the
educational system because we're
transitioning into a new phase where
things are based on creativity and
innovation we're using acoustics to
understand the health of the environment
so the way that we're doing that is by
recording the sounds of nature and then
analyzing those to understand all the
different species all the different
animals and things that are present by
doing that we get a handle on
biodiversity and hence the health of the
environment the type of work we do it
involves measuring and modeling how the
biosphere brings we're interested in
understanding how plants take up carbon
dioxide how they release of water vapor
how the soils interact with them and how
these plants will respond to climate
conditions
having the connections through Microsoft
and do this is great in the project
we're collaborating our collaborators
are in Australia and the UK into the
United States but the work we do really
is to produce stuff that really is
useful by the global Scarlett community
and that's one of the driving
motivations of why we do what we do the
people here have the freedom to pursue
research interactions that have not
immediately title necessarily tied with
products is extremely important it's
really the top research lab today in
computer science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
