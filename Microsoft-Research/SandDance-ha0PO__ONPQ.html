visualization how do we make sense of
all the massive amounts of data around
us we use principles of information
visualization to make it easy to
understand the data and see the patterns
within the data so let's take a look at
this data set here these are actually
50,000 counties but there's information
there's their structure in this data so
if we actually map it onto a map we can
actually see that structure showing up
and when we actually shift to a
histogram the motion really helps you
understand the data and if we switch
back to the map where they go back to so
we're going to actually look at some
results from the recent election so here
what I'm going to do is map onto each
County how they voted and you can see
actually the blue counties and red
counties and looks pretty extreme but
actually it's much more nuanced than
this so if we look at a different 2
palette here you can see that ah yes
it's blue and red but it's not quite so
extreme on either case and in fact we
can even break this apart and actually
look at nine different graphs here are
the most extreme on one side the most
extreme on the other side so if we
actually select a point over here and we
get some information about it we can see
that that was Texas so that's a look at
elections but there a lot of other
things that we can look at besides
elections so we can look at the per
capita income so here's the per capita
income and you see a big swath of red
across the country if we actually kind
of looked at that in a histogram here
I'm you can see that there are very few
counties that have a high per capita
income lots that have a much lower area
so we're interacting with this in a very
natural way but there's other ways for
us to interact with this data so what
I'm going to do right now is I'm going
to connect up to the Kinect system so i
can use voice to interact with this data
so for instance if i want to search for
certain counties I can use the zip code
so i can use search 9 and that's all the
counties that start with 98 and so
that's just the counties that start with
98 focus and we just focused in on that
set of data so it's a nice way of
limiting it and therefore I didn't have
to do all sorts of random motions or
touches I could just use my voice in a
natural way to do that reset
finally one of the nice aspects of this
project is that there's very natural
collaboration between different devices
it's built in a browser so anybody can
connect to the same data set and
download it and I have I tablet right
over here and it's showing the same data
set and if I make a selection on the
tablet that selection is then reflected
back on here likewise if I make a change
over here so reflect over there even if
I'm in a different view I can make a
selection over here and see how it's
reflected back and that's very important
to see how these selections so are
reflected in the different data that was
a quick look at projects and dance a
research project looking at natural ways
of interacting with large amounts of
data using information visualization
