you
okay so it's a pleasure to introduce
Mikeal Ruby a today Mikkel comes to us
from Marseille in France he's had a long
trip prior to his postdoc position at
the University of Marseille he obtained
a PhD at the University of Avignon while
he was there he developed a super
elegant way of doing Diaries ation that
basically reduces the problem 201
integer linear programming and today
he's going to tell us about that and
then some extensions that use embeddings
to do diverse ation thank you thank you
prefer a woman wha thanks for the
invitation and very happy to be here so
today we speak about speaker dilation
and I we speak about optimal astoria
using gente del dinero me and after we
speak about speaker on babies so the
outline outline of my presentation so
first I will speak about me so about my
project and my background and laughter
we speak about speaker deionization I
will just repeat this but what is bigger
dilation and I just described speak
organization I fly on broadcast news not
in meetings so it's some different so
are doing all my conversation I just
presumed speak of the ization i play on
broadcast news and laughter I we speak
about speaker cluster india so i will
present the method ELP clustering LP
clustering was very appreciated by the
community in fact when I sent the paper
in the confirm so logically I can
Patroclus and Jana Mesa so noshing
proposed to come to the image in order
to present this method and Patrick I
want to reproduce on my reasons so and
after during the converse of the
conference many people asked me to send
the
to really the god about here by
clustering and after I we speak about
speaker modern India and how to excite
relevant information on speech segments
are using deep neural network and i will
present you this method that i called
speak on buildings so what about me so
my name is Michael I'm 33 years old I
come from France France is near England
German as rain so I'm very appreciated
because our mangas is not perfect it's
not perfect is very bad so if you don't
understand please stop me and ask me to
repeat or you can stop me doing the
converging the conversation towards me
every question so I start I obtained my
PhD in 2011 in avenue and i work on
video summarization automatic video
civilization then i move two years old
in computer all sorts of lumo I work on
automatic speech recognition and figured
ization and after i move at Marseilles
in computer cells of Marseilles and I
work on X Y Crowell event information
using using deep neural network oh sorry
I just forget to say this is I've no no
noise location here and nothing is
located here so I just present through
projects are true interesting projects I
can be interested Microsoft so the first
one is a repair projector so this
project consisting identify the person
in TV show so we can identify the person
on the video but also on geo geo and
here by example if you want to identify
these guides this guy is John Lackey oh
we can use face AG or psychology but you
you can also use all the other
information by example this information
the name of the guys writing is here or
the name of the guys was spoken the last
segment and you can
propagate all the information in the
video so during this project i work on
automatic speech recognition on
triggered ization and unspeakable
identification but i was working in the
propagation of all the information
around all the modalities so the second
project is a bird projector so the goal
of this project was in the national
media team winning word conversation so
the melody was to go beyond the central
the simple pipeline automatic speech
recognition and machine translation so
one of the goal of this project ways to
detect 0 and 2 so the machine most to
detect the arrow and to ask the user to
leap into symptoms by example if the
user say I like your bread and the
system doesn't know the world barret the
system say you like what the user say
your ad so this is the emerge the first
sentence and the second sentence and try
to create the descendants I like you're
at and translate gen photoshop so I
worked in a lot of fields but one of my
goal was to excite relevant information
from Duke monza so I work in speech
emerged natural language processing
machine learning and information or chi
work the numbers that you see here is
the number of fabrication in each of
pizza and now I quite work in extracting
videos using neural network so lets us
what about speaker dilation
so the girls figured ization is true on
swear to the question will speak and
when so given the new audio stream and
the broadcast news we can solve this
problem in three steps are the first
steps is to detect the speech and
non-speech segments and after we can we
take on new speech segments and we do a
segmentation in order that each segment
contains what with the voice of only one
speaker and after that we don't
clustering so we try to say like rice
imports the speaker and the speaker at
the same speaker so in my presentation I
just focusing the last steps speak up
speak up kristinia and I propose a new
method about optimal crystalline so in
speaker christine there is true kind of
approach so the first approach is a
yashica press drink like Bach teleported
on that consist are true at each
iteration to increase or decrease the
number of Christa the second kind of
method is partitioning clustering like
came in saw me she mean shift and
consist to refine as a partitioning
during each iteration so concerning the
bottom of our go Ava so the button of
our GUI is an iterative algorithm LG
tumors similar cluster but there is some
limits about this kind of approach first
it's a greedy algorithm by greedy I want
to say that at each iteration selects
the best solution but we are not sure
that the best solution is the best
tradition at the end of the process and
the second problem is that that never
that sir but another Greek never
consider the decision I just want to say
that if an arrow is is done this arrow
is propagated around all the processor
so the single our GUI is the
partitioning
plus the Ranger by example to come
inside go Edna and the come inside would
try to minimize an objective function by
example distance and high class huh but
there is some problem the first is that
the number of crystal is fixed and in
the case of speaker dilation it's a
problem because in spicata ization we
don't know the number of speaker and we
don't know who's speaking in the yard
Enzo audio stream so so we so there's a
problem air and the second problem is
that about initialization of the cluster
so if we badly in the series the cluster
at the beginning we can fall in a local
optimal solution and not with the global
optimal solution so we must to so I like
AIG about partisan in class doing
because there is an objective function
but we must be taken as a true program
that the first one is the prevalence of
number of caster and for Tiger the
second problem is the programmers in
Sadie's initialization of the crystal
center so in order to tackle the second
program I propose to use the integral in
our program Inga so integral in our
programming is a mathematical models
that can so given an objective function
in some contents we can obtain the
optimal solution of this program so I'll
do that work so we give a lovely click
function so if you want to optimize
minimize or maximize the objective
function is a linear function with some
integer variable some vineri variable
and we give some constraints la like an
inner function I thought that we can use
like not going branch and bound
algorithm oh the side going we'll remove
all the food less come to that during
the research of the best sir
so one of the goal of the program is to
express the clustering problem as an ELP
poor man so we in order to do that we
assume that the center of a cluster is
necessary a point of a program so how to
express our in the binary variable this
a problem so I want to say that this
segment as in the same cluster and this
segment are in the same cursor so first
we enumerate all the points 1 2 3 4 5 to
10 and after we say that the segment for
is the center of our Brewer cluster and
that the segment 90 is the center of the
red crystal and we assume that all the
points that beyond this treasure be
known this dresser so in order to to
explain this in binary viable we create
a mattress this kind of metrics so the
road is assess is this to be part of the
problem or you can take the center
separately for example by just
considering each Center and computing
the mean average disk install the other
know he's become shoots no no so you
couldn't do that oh ok I have to
discover what this out maybe last
question you know two or three sides so
i will explain about the distance to the
next slide and yeah i just want to
explain how to express his program in
binary variable that song and after I we
speak about distance so we want to feel
this matrix this matrix R so this is the
second altar and yes this is a cluster
there is as many segments as
as Krista because we can say that the
reason that each segment are a dresser
ok so if I want to say that this segment
be known to the press to the closer I
just were put one here so this segment
for every known to sequencer from and
the same for 9 this segment 9 belong to
the address down nine and if I want to
say that this segment be known to this
dresser I just feel one here and one
here for this segment and after I put
zero to the old matrix oh ok so so we
are we express in terms of binary
variable the clustering so now i will
present the NP clustering model so but i
will begin by the end i will present the
constraints and after i will present the
objective function so in this constraint
I just say that a segment can be known
to only one cluster I just say that if
we take the son of that the Sun must be
again what because one segment can be
belonged one cluster after I just say
that if a a segment fiber belong to the
cluster for so as the segment for most
belong to the cluster for my example I
say that if I put a 1 here I saw its
obligatory to improve a one year and the
last an important concern is to say that
as the distance between this segment and
this segment
must be below threshold assume it's very
important because if the value is very I
so we can say there is only one cluster
if the value is very small we can say
that every segment are the same cluster
so we can to try to to search the best
the best value and after the objective
function try to minimize the number of
crestor and try to minimize the
dispersal and hotness representations of
feature space d is the distance yeah so
W ok so W is I backdrop I don't speak
about that but you can you can you can
use what you want I vectors pick on
buildings by example you can use what
you want so it's most important is the
distance between two segments and a exa
is a binary way up to the table haha ok
is in cluster and Kanan center or point
just because so this is the segment and
this is the cluster is your question
first so the segment in the cluster
that's if that's the one that this has
to be smaller yeah it's not it's likely
the metric something yeah so in your
example went to be xk n minus x n n is
less than zero because you gave the
example of row six column for so k is
six doors the column in and then you
said that deuce is that grow for column
for ya so that would be zero sense right
yeah I sure they K X and not X so X is
our story for you question is is your
 top so this is a cluster and this
is the second time Oh
I say if so segment is the first off we
are we saw but I thought matrix and
business yeah it's you visit but yeah so
and I told me just to minimize the
number of pesto hands and scuffs on
tight ass of each Messer yeah what
properties you have to assume for your
distance measure does it have to be a
true distance measure obey the triangle
inequality that kind of thing for the
deep so this one is oh yeah as in fact
so ah ok Jenny before I picked up well
I'm asking can you substitute other
distance measures in there today these
are part of the derivation that it has
to be a distance measure or can it be a
pseudo distance measure I don't want no
song i love little new question it's my
english ok so you can have things you
can have functions that behave somewhat
like a distance measure but don't behave
don't obey the triangle inequality
property ah yeah yeah no no zoo KJ I
think the PID I don't you say if you are
so there is three segments ABC and if
you calculate the distance between a IP
and DC it's unfair to AC is that in such
a question or not okay no noise no
provides us because I see that the page
I not for this inequality well my
apologies what is required for this
aeration to work for the system to work
for d lot of the research in a million
years old what what's a distance midgel
you want so I use a soak a DI but type
so I'll use also distance metric like Oh
seen my lupus
I'm different azam matrix' okay thank
you you put it whatever few secret vault
all right people whatever previously
yeah yeah like you can you tell you so
what what for just toss me John you want
the third constraint and kind of
redundant to the minimization criteria
so the third constraint yeah that's
going to determine sort of how many
clusters you have because if you set the
so if you to say that it's official is
very I if you set these small is one so
there is a number of these like handle
one left is one more twist up no way so
now I'm confused d mate that the third
one might not be satisfiable right so I
just and that's a fun those disciplines
of truce egg month all right so if I
make a neat so it's hard when he is
strong yeah yeah and as I make these
smaller yet again this may force more
clusters but isn't that redundant to
what's going on in the minimization
there so where if you put a very yeah if
you put a very high weight on that
second term in the minimization with
effectively do the same thing as a third
concern like why do you need that hard
constraint you can I mean can you remove
the first ones and removal dreams
impression of the program you can remove
are your allies oh yeah you can do that
and in fact how are you when we use the
speed organization impartial so I'm for
sure a micro sure I just want to say
that I we go speaker generation
the singer shop but a new Egyptian and
we try to detect the regulans speaker
okay and when we do that we lose this
constraint and we modify the program in
order to speed up the process with the
ball country the vested your physical
yeah yeah so it's just constraint only
Emmy Awards also aimed at improving
accuracy Ulysses the same oh so that
they're so I need to make things faster
we can in just rooms up with Jacques
receipts the same ok so that's where our
it's just the speed up just prune ok ok
so care products so sorry I don't answer
why a person with insane I seen as a
final number of clusters where we can
come in if I that dared how you choose
right we constrain the Salerno goes like
this number of best buy is confirmed by
this treasure right so if you choose
different threshold then the number of
clusters you guys were different right
if I've shown to venue if you change the
value of yes number of course once it's
the front you work out different yeah
you know and then therefore if you
remove a constraint entirely the number
of clusters will be different yeah and
therefore the accuracy will be the total
picture you're saying the constraint is
not really needed to get best possible
accuracy it's just needed to make things
faster this poster is only two artists
if we remove this concern is only to
speed up the process on but but we need
to remove on the a viable in zones yeah
Tim Odessa okay feisty as I we cannot
move this concert without
oh it's very over okay how are we more
my supper I just moved what so is supaya
about stress shoulder moo moo moo are
seized by a bird in this program right
and we are saying that he's the same
address but but we remove what was so
the resolution is more fast it's faster
oh but you change you change the sums is
something no longer over everything yeah
yeah we can change the big attraction
and change oh this one's about it yeah
okay so lots of variations also nice
very much so we use are all we are
enjoys a well worked at use its French
both pledged news so the innovation that
asset is repair 2013 it's classical we
use a new vm of 120 a brochure sigh
vector I've dimension 200 and we use
nationalization crispy idea screen so
the matrix is j ization arrow right is
in fact a combination of three arrows
miss for salam in speech arrow and i use
the new spicata ization toolkit for the
lp i use the gel cap to get so first we
compile as the bottle of our growing
with costs like new glossy oh so sorry i
just want to motion that this is the
name of the show in the Calusa and this
is over virtualization alright so we
compare a button up with cause like you
bless you with I vector so we obtain
again and after we convert but enough
I'll put another good idea clustering
and we obtain a new gang weaves yet edgy
that's super quick question what you see
that I vector
Rachel decent-looking two houses right
so is that because that you even your
test the compusa or as longer segment so
you get together me like why back this
kool Kris fear us some conversation the
intersegmental too short ok so in
broadcast news the same month the
amelioration of the segment around are
one between one and two seconds oh yeah
it's really chasing your iPad present in
two seconds worth your speech yeah it's
vishal create your chin will change its
on the eye doctor is computed there's a
separate I vector for each side yeah
yeah yeah yeah so thank you a little
quite understand what's the meaning of
HH Syria and she see oh right so yeah I
monochrome cluster glamour it's a good
enough okay but yeah as a popular
clustering algorithms there right yes
it's a classical approach in forward
buttons if I sign no there are many
other clustering algorithms yeah yeah
for what excuse me ours or Jessica
atrocious to use of automatic movement
and the Sierra for both testicles so was
it cheating quite here upon sorry that
you had a secret you in here it's easy
stuff 103 the paranoid so I social
rights tarnishing it does i forget this
thank you I should find out so I own
every include these beach naish actors
yeah yeah it's includes a special pho
but in fact is this kind of gyration we
just uh in fact the segmentation is the
same because we judge change as a
speaker clustering which I change the
metal speaker clustering so so yes so
agitation arrow right combines the three
myth 3 matrix but in fact we just are
comprar
when one matrix expectation is a person
like me we compile an impulsive so sweet
i r+ drink right is that but yeah I just
indicates agitation they're all rights
okay so not much is to achieve this to
apply to be on you where you do need to
adjust the theater in the constraint
dressed sorry you you have a conjoined
with the day at all right it's a short
hood be honest Joyce good distance is
Josh hood yes sorry I listen the third
constraint that we talked about yeah I
need to adjust the Delta now this reason
yeah so I mentioned but we are we have
them up on top user and we optimize our
research and development purpose also
threshold are optimizing the development
office and we are plies and we take this
treasured and we apply said that on the
test coffers it is it true question yes
yes yeah so yeah I forget to I have a
curve and I forget to present a crop but
yes I implore and we are we educate the
gyration arrow right in function of
suppression ok so if you adjust the
number of clusters in the other ports so
I hurried not so phones poses for
the energy in fact if I try to search
the optimal treshold oh it's exactly the
same that the development office no I'm
not know if I ocean HJC I vector yeah I
don't know for that again till your ass
I try to research the best solution
in the desk office but I just
developments yeah tomato northridge aha
very nice on the development yeah but
your question was to optimize the
threshold of the best that's that no no
oh you get because you have this free
per meter the first of the parameter
will affect your final is out and so in
the other approach you can also adjust
for example is a maximum distance
between two clusters and since I'll that
you can also control the number of
crossbows you can generate so that will
also affect the result in a breeze lines
yeah so I'm andheri west you to the
similar say hello no idea how my sore my
results on the bubble puppy's other so
so it's a fair comparison so and that's
nice oriental descending upon focus ah
he you you need an additional
segmentation right so yeah you need to
generate the segments that you submit to
the clustering how did you generate
those and where they the same for you
for all your different methods because
the same location wise done by the news
because the ionization so so so is it
some kind of so it's just a speaker
change detector right uh yeah so you
basically look for speaker changes and
then any you know whatever comes between
two changes is one of the second that
you that you'll feed to your yes I give
that some sweet are clustering and it
was the same for all of them yeah yeah
okay so you didn't do this method like
in the Exede ionization system where you
where you generate clusters and then you
use those justice to reset meant the
data iteratively right so you you have
it you have some segmentation at some
stage and your algorithm and you
generate an hmm with cluster bottles and
use the
use the term e to segment to resend the
data that you redo the clustering and so
forth so you intuitively ring segment
Andrey cluster you didn't do anything
like that I'll just you you found the
speaker boundaries once and then you
simply do the clustering based on that
yeah I know that you teach you do that
right now so for broadcast is that
that's that's enough I mean that's
sufficient you don't have yeah we don't
think it comes out in both sqz okay but
skills are getting so you have a new
results okay so yeah finish the
treasures are optimized on the
development conference so I will speak
about a speaker on meeting some so one
of the limits are does anybody are you
using it now was it adopted yeah marche
or at avignon isola suniye was the
broken energy you know who's using it
now people to ring them huh so there is
so guys I p.m. oh so soon you use that
Alonso it's a and I know that najim use
that and patrick also use it the pathway
ask you questions and go back to the
last stop yeah so the first fashion then
based on your initial speaker change
action yeah what is best damaging every
get so if face on speaker you just be
the change yeah what is the best parent
what is the best achievable yeah okay Oh
era I'm like a oracle to tell you the
yeah yeah in fostering say each step so
I'm a neuro I don't know I do so are as
a tester what one time but I never
reduce or there's a test on this Corp
yourself so I i knows
uh if we obtain the best clustering with
this segmentation on scopus I see it's
wrong ten persons of the ization annoyed
but this temple some because there is
some programmers of speech overlapping
yeah and this kind of confuse that the
system does not take into account so
there is some program so it is it true
question yes second question is HP so
how how fast longtime career can to
encourage 30 I'm he is very fast ah I
small fast and yeah chicken are good of
like bottom up by example for bottom up
and I'm Victor you must match you must
work it relates the I vector and next
are so we find P you just calculate one
time or the a vector and you do the
crystalline what package you use to
solve linear program General James so
reason likes of little kids and it's
very fast an uh we we do some testing
for sure around 150 hours of shock and
it takes around 10 minutes I'm not sure
about the the time but it's wrong 10
minutes to solve this kind of program is
very fast because just just because we
remove any closer we will remove this
constraint we remove this binary
variable and after we are we do not
solve this problem like that we try to
surprise the program in an su problem
sub problem son I don't explain that but
so we can I can explain let
if you want to it's the scaling with the
number of clusters so if you have if you
double the number of clusters of the
initial segment so if you don't double
the audience segments how does the right
time of the clustering I love more
because it's very very fast I mean
theoretically speaking is a quadratic or
linear non light sensor and media as a
lot for the Cheetahs yeah okay because
the number of variables is for traffic
right yes but uh as you use geometries
you can remove lots of binary variable
yeah I'm okay I'm okay to say that as
this matrix if you are increasing number
of speakers lamorris making the segment
is a great idea but as you use a
discriminant distance you can remove a
lot of binary variable and just focus on
the banner important binary by over so I
say is lot better cheek is more than
linear so I just want to speak about
speaker clustering so one of the program
about hi Victor so I vector P IJ of 10
very good reason to NIST evaluation
campaign but we know that ah I went so I
broadcast news again no I speak in
January on speaker verification and just
it's just a lot of you gesture okay but
we observe that unshot signals the
performance they cross rapidly so there
is a lot of road as I try to tackle this
kind of program to taking who comes in
various curry to our to nominator I
vector about the rate of the segment and
me I propose to because the I vectors
are expert on the futon viability space
me I want to extract the features on the
speakers and speaker space so Jerry in
the speaker space so in order to do that
I propose to learn to try to fight this
feature presentation with a deep neural
network so i take a deep neural network
so the task of the deep neural network
is the speaker identification Alaska so
in the input this is as the first order
born wash that statistics so we take a
signal we take a new p.m. we calculate
the one wedge statistic and after we are
normalized by the moon and the
covariance about the ubm so we give that
in the input of the chief neural network
so the output is the speaker
identification by example if the segment
is respect id3 we are we say 001 the
reserves also exit rock star and after
we I propose in fact true to use one of
the idle mayor like a neuro presentation
so by example if i say this i dinnae
eyes are droopy eyes entation so I
compact the number of neurons and I take
this i dinnae earth like a new
representation and i conceive that the
speaker meetings so just to in order to
so this is the speaker meeting sir so
for the presentation normally speak of
meetings our vector but was the
presentation so I'm as to compact the
vector and we see that the Assad
patterns I in common with different
association I'm and test the core user
and we see that I used some pattern a
similar between the training desk office
just for information so one of my goal
is to replace a high vector by speak on
by linger
hi Victor ing a pipeline so one of the
programs that are the speaker on
buildings is reached without any goshen
premier absorption and those yeah there
is a problem because the PID I assume
that also that I must be Gaussian so we
observe that so every color rupees on
the speakers so I take four speakers and
every signals I've really find surface
of the segments and he observed that
there is a Roger distribution of the
data so it's clear that this course in
scoring also questioned scores question
scoring sorry our focus only on the
jagtial proximity so the question lesbea
adapt to this kind of tasker but i try
techniques of these techniques is was
using speaker verification is a
lightweight Nick normalization in fact I
assisting heat consists to artificial
question is the data in order to remove
the meaner and to multiply by the
whitening of the matrix' so for the
experiments so I use the same background
thing that I said like the previous
experiments but I use another data set
is it up 2012 I use the same ubm the
vector of dimension one no its mistakes
is to Android but speak on meetings of
the motion and rather I write back to
her I like my to me with two iterations
become the innings we with one
interracial for the speaker theorization
we use the same to cater for the DNN
which you use the cattitude heater the
activation function are ready and we use
a 3-iron layer so so first I just want
to compare so
I think that is the same yeah I indicate
different show and this is over over all
of the test data set so are in the first
experiment I just comprar I vector idea
we speak of a discussion and we observe
that there is a game and after I just
try to normalize the speaker meeting
with light whitening normalization and I
use this speaker meetings normalized
with care da so I is like the same
result so if i use speaker meetings with
no normalization and plga we obtain
worse results so if we are used become
meetings with one likely iteration we
obtain a new game and with Twitter
interaction doesn't fall that's why it's
different from the previous life no
because the last night i use the
and in this slide i use a kg n matrix so
it's closet patio doesn't work because
there is no version as negotiable
assumption hi vectors yeah yeah i bet i
saw a white normalization Oh already
yeah yeah I thought is our nominees so
for the confusion perspective so for the
air p clustering so one of the
conclusion is that yet because doing
explore more trusting solutions that
greedy our boat MF a droid so when I was
in in verse 13 uma so the systems of
that develop with NP as participate to
the it up 2012 and the warpath 2012
enter
certain evaluation contain and we obtain
the best result in single and partial
and one of my perspective with the enp
clustering is to make a joint model or
with speaker clustering and speaker
identification by john from dare i say
when by example if you are just doing it
so you make a only notification in order
to know the name of the geyser you can
do that in a jointly at the same time
and maybe we can do that with the yet p
clustering so for the speaker meeting so
so fix you like I extract on speaker
space and I don't present the works but
we will try to to test with automatic
speech recognition by example when we
try the acoustic model so we return 0
Sigma days and we also add so I vector
and so we remove the I vector and we use
the speaker meetings and she walks
letters and the I vector and we try to
use pecan meetings in the speaker
identification bus and walk more than
speaker in more than I vector and it
works also the word with specialization
ask one of my perspective investigates
the use of different are input input
features so we can by example our users
input of general I vector by general I
vector I just say that i use the
posterior probabilities of the gel give
a given by the genin and use this input
vector in the journal and another
perspective is true to create a journal
or to automatically learn the input
vector and one approach is to use this
combination an honor for our next
classification
thank you so we have time for questions
yeah so in the io e okay so see how it's
a few hyper parameters that sir I think
we'll I assume will kind of impaired Lee
said how many clutch you know what will
favor some number of clusters I guess
the question is is there a way in the
framework to incorporate prior knowledge
this way for presented without having to
reach an all black grouper amazon
deficit so free so for example but let's
say you have some collection of data
where you know that typical number of
speakers is clusters you should have is
between five and 15 there's another data
set words between one and five but you
don't want to have each time you don't
have to go over each retune all up you
don't have a free time you have a case
like that you don't have to have a
deficit and hyper to novel forever
something yeah so is there of you know
if you have a generative model approach
like clustering unit may be there a way
to put a prior kind of in is there
something like that so I'm not sure
which one does the new questions so you
are some that i sent me for a 1250
speaker and also that I said to 10 to 15
speakers and you want to adapt your
systems so it's possible that to get the
best performance on one set you have one
set of hyper parameters yeah then in a
different date a different set of hacker
crime but you don't you don't have to do
that every time is there a way to you
know those opportunities number of
crystal you can add that in the quantum
is a constant of the program you can say
okay for this kind of program so is
between 125 or cluster and so you can
add this kind of course went in calg but
from me ah so treasured that you learn
for me this special is a in fact
represent our as the distance of an
average of a speaker so so so I say so
for me its optimal true to what kind of
copies you you you want any nerves
should be independent yeah yeah faster
costs overall cluster shine yeah uh I
mean of office of the speaker in fact so
do you observe that your tests you have
maybe you have ten different roles right
did you want to optimize that for every
show yeah yeah in fact are in on the
show as this kind of show is very
different because it's a show of pop
star and it's explain why we obtained
very bad reasons and in fact I try to to
optimize my threshold on odysseyk office
without this and the opposite but in
fact the treasure is uh what but he can
use the same so I take all the curfews
and I apply the same threshold on all
the compass so it's all right so so it's
not a fresh so why is that one so much
worse I vectors are not no no its people
it's a segmentation because there's a
lot of music so the format is five
minutes a lot of music and the eyes is
very uh uh it's not usually like peoples
there's a lot of back and forth between
yeah yeah short short turns yeah let's
go back to the question
this work like meetings yeah now you
have a lot shorter turns and don't have
as you know segments that I'll have to
estimate stable by vectors
culture and you know I'm gonna make a
lot i removed is a test in my computer
so i can show users or better yet so
it's very short a lot of music so in
fact 0r are given by zero segmentation
segmentation is very bad because it's a
segmentation you say that those are a
segment but with lot of speakers and
sometimes there is a segment and also
which we have some program gives a
speech and non-speech is to say okay
there is a non speech but the speaker
speak and so on a different topic this
is a very general way of doing fostering
the iop it inside then had and I such as
the vesica lavash have so had one else
have people then clustering with ILP but
then so is this the first application of
ILP the clustering yeah I have has it
been used like the cluster documents
previously are used no noise I thought
seems that we use in documents so yeah I
tried this kind of approach and I never
been using other pins it's never been
used in other feel so yes it is son
means periodization ok so that's real
innovation and when have you seen it
sense apply to other areas or do you
think of with the Apple other areas I
mean it seems like anything that you
going currently say use k-means
clustering we could use this no I
thought canoes might be much better than
this one in many cases
so when I saw explain the repair and
when I do us the propagation of the
identity I use the IP in order to
provide to propagate ecology identity
and it's based on my EMP clustering so
we can induce and we can not play
applying another task like I don't know
yeah yeah Marceline's possible not it
okay be essentially vacation it is an 80
choirs distance to distance let your
body by eight just a JC is essentially
he means know what parts of rhythmic
pulse emerging stuff no it's a it's a
highlight closely it's a pretty such
different companies because you burn
because you don't know the number first
well you just merge you don't need
terrain but it's always good to only
well that's who's the end because I mean
you look mouch see today you have to
stop Mason problem right so that's right
you have a separate criterion for you
for knowing when to stop Custer what is
what is the corresponding letter a
letter in your sister right so if the
property the general problem in a
hierarchical clustering is knowing when
to stop clustering yeah but when do you
know you have the right number of
clusters which of course is somehow
related to the number of two speakers in
the case of finalization so in your in
your system it would I p what is the
corresponding parameter what how do you
control how aggressively you want to
cluster things together basis is special
this is the Delta yeah you have the doma
thing I think is there also the goal or
DW you're right there's the present we
approach that we have forever yes I
don't control del sol de ampudia I was
talking about before okay they've also i
think you could get rid of the third
you just use our I'd say that's enough
usual adult has to rule out to eliminate
two variables video access yeah
eliminate are you just you you have to
step up alright but should you even if
you can eliminate sconce part where you
can you are in let all the O'Banion are
you valuable and you and you make
Price's data so you you you you must to
212 Eva by later and you can't watch the
last episode whistles and you have a
separate you had a separate data set to
those yeah yeah the development set to
change this in palmetto and I thought
prices on the test as you have you tried
to be optimized it so how far from the
optimal value where you when you have to
do YouTube those parameters that this
fine fellow so for for the true copious
road on it happen in five years yeah if
I found myself on the test and that
focus RS akiza same really okay but uh
maybe is our focus to differ phone so
you're going to like I'll just like take
English broadcast news or something and
see it the same primers before yeah so
this is this criterion is that minimize
right what your name eyes is a very
generic criteria I think it's very
similar to all the other plastering
reproaches right that's just number of
clusters plus some distance thingy so
your method is not about the criterion
but it's about finding the correct
solution or it's an optimization problem
in solving or is it the criterion
tribute to the great result good
question for me it's optimized up oh I'm
on false messages that can spread I only
just to uh to to say that to post went
to say that
segment to like to try to move the
speaker mother to say that's okay
autosys because it is the same my
question is the same criterion the first
formula you could also optimize that
with k-means for example right I think
yeah yeah yeah only we can do that but
there's a problem of initialization of
law also came in some and this is a
problem and I test that come in sir and
I run several times so the game is
having our changes from Desert Sun but
with the NP we have Genesis each time
the same reasons we actually did that
experiment we actually yeah and also I
try two different objective function I
try to minimize minimize and fitness
fashion and to maximize the dispersion
i'm applying the objective functions
that try to maximize the number speaker
and to minimize dispersal and cyclists
but the best results are obtained gives
this kind of approach so you can also i
think the finest ain't criterion for HH
Iraqi that's true yeah we can but the
problem is with another boy it so if we
think about decision one time right this
is for so what you're saying
your solution really is search algorithm
that's what you are solving you have the
best way of solving the same equation
same criteria oh so can you say a little
more about this from when you do about
how anything a picket about the cross
show yeah I religion is I've done just
treating to shows with one big meat
broadcaster one than the other yeah yeah
so it's not just
side so in Sea Girt show you trade the
problem like that like I explained my
previous slide and in poor sure you take
this is to show a so should be and are
in fact you want you to detect the
rickroll speaker by example if you treat
a short and B are separately you can say
that you cannot detect that this speaker
and this figure out the same up but you
by example can detect that this figure
and this because the same level but how
not the same speaker or I guess it just
means late it's ray almost instant if I
same identity with same label I said
with the anchors which is the same labor
again the devil speaker 1 yeah yeah so
you say that but so in croushore glass
and you steps or four steps it's a true
story but AG robot crew story on RT show
so you treat the shows a party and after
you have four steps robot plus 3 the
threads are also all the data and now
you can detect the rec rooms Vikram and
say that this beaker and this become not
the same we tried to do that but you're
not really examining the identity
decisions you made with it so sorry so
when you do the cross show clustering
yeah with ILP that you reconsider
identities within the same show so um we
try the experiment so we try to fix the
so crest from crystal India and we try
to reorganize so and in fact a true not
to fix but to organize works better
because I think that in the first
Christine we are miss some
so by the way the explanation why you
have this video distribution I don't
understand sorry video disability so I'm
not very different very oldest the raid
the radial distribution of the I vector
I know I don't know why intuition for it
issues a picture yeah so this is a
resolution of speaker ladies so I seem a
little before geoff hinton gave it up
here this is not some he's me some years
ago and said it was like showing word
embeddings or documenting their names
and he made a big deal about all of
innocence it's radio okay so why why I
don't know I don't know why his range of
distribution but we ourselves us so in
fact first our experiments was to know
if speak on meetings what was Goshen or
not and at the end we observe that this
is right your distribution but we don't
know why is this is this is a this is
what the dispersion of speaker meeting
so does it help it's just cystic the
first three dimensions yeah yeah yeah so
we take a four-speaker randomly for
speaker or the segment and we use a PCA
to our to project into demotion just to
incorporate some kind of life
normalization directly types of
functional for train is the objective
function of the positive neural network
yeah yeah maybe also that the length is
has to do with the length of the segment
and how far you are from the century
that is related to tonight I but my name
became hot Sun organization betweens i
dinnae oh I know because the input is
the end for this length very right so we
didn't put to your network it's a it's
the Bajau statistics this actually is
the old I back to statistics days I'd
like to use the same yeah ok so now
because it basically is YZ converge to
the same point you have a point but no
she was there's going to be some
physical correlates to the distance from
this origin point since your uh i 0 i
know uh uh yeah yeah i am as to NZ cases
to value of nations okay let's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
