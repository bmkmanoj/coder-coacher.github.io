machine learning and addresses a famous
problem in machine learning called the
problem of representation you see many
of these problems become relatively easy
for example let's say computer vision if
you just had the right representation
one pixel in an image tells you very
very very little about what's in an
image if I just took one pixel of a
picture of your face and be very
difficult to tell what that was but if
you transform the data and transform it
enough times then you can get a very
high level representation for example it
might be this is a face this is a face
of someone with brown hair or with blue
eyes and then I could recognize who that
was given the high level features now
previously before deep learning people
would hand design or hand engineer the
mapping from raw inputs like pixels to
features they could use and then those
features would be fed to a standard
machine learning algorithm the recent
success of deep learning shows that you
don't have to hand engineer then in fact
computers are actually better at
engineering those features then people
are so what you do is you take very
large data sets and you learn how to
transform the raw data like pixels into
high-level representations another nice
thing about that is that with the reason
why it's called deep learning is that it
does it through successive layers of
transformation so it goes for a
low-level repetition like pixels to
edges to textures and whatnot and that
sort of emulates the way the brain is
architected that your brain itself like
in your visual system is is structured
in layers and and as far as
neurophysiologist know that each layer
is computing a more complex function
given the per input from previous layer
deep learning does the same thing that's
why it's called deep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
