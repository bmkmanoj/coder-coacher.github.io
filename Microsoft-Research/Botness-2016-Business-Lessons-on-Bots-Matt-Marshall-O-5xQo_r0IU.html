so so Brady asked to for me to come up
and give a few remarks and of somebody
who is not a developer but whose founder
of a site who's covering this space and
has seen several cycles of if you will
of Technology and maybe look at the
business side right so at a time when
we're all focused on these really
important developer questions and you
guys are really on to something here I
think it's it's caught it's it's it's
worthy to look at the some of the
business lessons that we've learned let
me see if I can attach this I actually
drew up a deck on the fly don't have a
structured talk here but wanted to start
with the lessons from smarter child so
Robert Hoffner who you just saw yeah
actually didn't know about botanist and
we were talking up I invited him to an
event that we're having on July twelfth
and thirteenth and I said I was going
down to botanist are you coming and see
if I can get this here
yeah so so he said he come on down but
one of the things that you you heard
from him was that he had 30 million
active users that's the most popular
bought in history and he said until Siri
came along and even that wasn't he was
arguing he's very opinionated wasn't
popularity it was forced on you by
having Siri in in in the phone right so
I think a lot of you would agree maybe
some of you would disagree but that's
that's his opinion but um again to stick
to the business lessons he's going to be
writing his views about what happened to
smarter child for the first time in
VentureBeat hopefully to publish that
tomorrow and drawing out the lessons of
that first successful bot what worked
and what did and then what happened to
the business and so remember there's
these two storylines on the business
it's very interesting it took Twitter
and this is an example in his piece I
don't I wanted to rob the whole piece of
it is if it's a launch tomorrow on
VentureBeat but I want you to read it
but as he was I was kind of helping him
through this process he realized that
you know Twitter took ten years of
funding right from private equity really
to get it on its own two feet you know
how long that took right some of you
weren't developing yet for sure right I
think in two thousand and four or five
when it first launched and I was around
sadly right so I'm 49 I think I'm like
some of the other gray haired guys I've
seen Barney amateur if you have gray
hair but you've been through a cycle or
two and a lot of other folks who've been
through that first iPhone and in face
book launch you know how long it took
for for a poster child to come along i
was there i was doing events to around
mobile and i was looking for the poster
child it was poet was Pandora right ake
a company that you pre-existed the
launch and all of a sudden want you know
latched on to the dye OS revolution and
an Android I remember one of the
developers there were saying we need to
Android like a hole in her head right at
the time he didn't realize how
successful it was going to be but they
launched on on android on droid later
obviously so you need cash is what
you're going to read from Robert Horner
and he didn't have the funding from a
venture venture backer that could see
him through or have the vision to
support him right so a lot of investors
some smart investors here could probably
get a smarter talk then I could on the
business side but investors are two
different kinds right party I mean so so
there's the there's the investors who
are going to be taking the long term and
Twitter had a long term backer right
smart sand hill road folks are going to
take a long term and vacuum whereas
unsophisticated ones are going to run
for the exits when as Robert said the
the bad times are coming i forget his
expression but the dark days are kind of
what was it winter is coming right you
hear that all the time so I am trying to
try and keep this 25 minutes man i'm
probably already through three so real
quick just some observations for you
guys because i'm not tech not the tech
guy but just on the business side some
of the things I'm seeing so so slide to
some new ways right so AI this is what
I'm seeing as a guy who's just looking
at the trends and talking to folks in
the field trying to actually solicit the
best ideas to bring to mobilebeat on
twelfth and thirteenth of July I'm
trying to being the breast best
representation of startups brands and
what they're doing on bots I'm trying to
find the people who are doing things
meaningful and we as the audience
members can learn something from so
there's a I that's coming together had a
conversation with Ben Medlock who's a
Cambridge trained a natural language
processing expert who's saying only now
this is the guy who founded swiftkey and
sold at Microsoft only now are these NLP
things coming together in a big way to
actually so that we're on the cusp of a
breakthrough see Peter noddings how we
actually had conversations yes sir peter
schol mirage who was that linkedin and
who's actually agreeing with me on this
and said you have the UM you have this
wave right of AI coming together and
then you have the chat apps way we have
two to three billion people i don't know
what the official number is but we can
count what you know we chat and what's
up and you can it's 2 to 3 billion all
of a sudden in chat format and then you
have the conversational UI which is what
facebook and others all these platforms
and Apple did yesterday are introducing
so the business is going to interact
with them and opening it up telegram
starting it last year and you've had
every single player coming on whether
it's text or voice Apple Microsoft kick
all those guys opening up since
something big
happening there so those three Chen's
coming together and as Peter was saying
what we're kind of very early and you
see you see people trying to figure out
how to differentiate themselves and
they're grasping onto NLP and say we're
going to do this really well but really
it's early and they haven't figure it
out so I think that's where we all are
today so devs are usually first so this
is the first crowd where I've notices I
you know in my years of trying to
dissect the the audience for VentureBeat
you've got the product folks who are a
little later right from big companies of
putting these products together in a
more sophisticated way then developers
who are creating that kind of prototype
and then you've got the marketers who
come along right after and so we are
very early and you only seeing now you
know those all those companies that
supposedly launched on Facebook's
platform right Shopify right the first
commerce company did anyone will
actually see anything launched from
Shopify well no because they're taking
time to actually get their act together
all those brands that do commerce
companies that are under a Shopify his
umbrella or taking their time talk to
the Shopify guys and said they only just
gotten started you'll 1 800 flowers the
textbook that the Zuckerberg
demonstrated that was put together at
the last minute right and I you know
hope we're going to hear more from 100
flowers about what they're doing I'm
expedia supposedly launched right but no
they only just like we wrote about it
last week only figure out how to get
that bought out a couple months later so
we are very early early advantage it
will be over very very soon we've heard
that referred to and I caution you guys
this is going to be over it you know
it's quickly it you know is probably you
know cut a couple of months on six
months is kind of the time frame before
all the big brands are going to be
involved right you're seeing them launch
we have a few big brands launching out
at mobilebeat this event in July 1213
there bought strategies and again you
see in previous generations Zynga I was
kind of the first on facebook I
mentioned in Pandora but very few posted
children until much much later where you
see the kind of the phone specific apps
that the take off a michael from from
from many chats had some good points
about the conversion rates that's all
true really good conversion rates now in
traction now to be to be there for the
getting it's a great time to get started
but then that leads to notification
I mean hearing from brands already that
notifications like KLM's early
experiment hearing that klm was
overwhelmed with inbound from users who
are actually using that first ball right
so that all of a sudden people were
actually rejecting the stuff right and
you hear it from the chat fuel guys as
well right hundred twenty thousand chat
BOTS produced by 20,000 developers and
the biggest thing the biggest problem is
just people deleting and shutting those
things off right because it's just too
much noise as when we heard that concern
from slack CEO today so then microbots
are the most impressive things I've seen
and when I'm going to I'm seeing that
for from mobilebeat as well something
Chris Chris has pointed out earlier but
just this idea of really focused bots
right try and stay away from the the
meta BOTS and we're seeing that as well
you saw that over the course of a couple
days right the most compelling
presentations you've seen I mean so Kip
ester I mean even asked her right it's a
it's kind of meta right because it is
presenting all aspects of Chris right
yeah many more aspects of chris messina
could you've gotten but did you notice
how it was organized who's organized
very focused on each one of those with
buttons I think that's just it resonates
with me somehow right again I could be
wrong but with the the the problem cases
I mean Siri in any complaints you hear
from from echo or the ones where hey you
know these are so wide-ranging that they
have problems going deep in that natural
language process instance right where
most companies i'm talking with
booking.com you're going to hear some
others where they're doing their own
vertical natural language processing for
that use case and that's that's the way
to go and so other things just a couple
more slides here and i'll be done lots
of mobilebeat things were seeing just
you know again i did this up on the fly
things I've noticed right travel is huge
I don't know why just picking that up
because almost every major travel
company is coming to mobile be to talk
about what they're doing and we're
seeing at least three possibly four or
five new travel focus whether it's
flights or hotels that are doing really
compelling things that I've seen and
will be launching at the event other
examples
machines own you know people talked
about games being really early on the
last generation right phones you're not
seeing a lot but you know again I'm not
talking about the thousands of telegram
and others there's a lot of activity
going on but from the major major game
companies they've kind of kind of not
seeing a whole lot so machines own did
something on transportation and running
a bot for New Zealand's transportation
and in the hope they want to take over
the whole public entities of New Zealand
over time in terms of serving them right
so whether it's traffic lights or
parking spaces setting them up with
sensors and then having people
communicate with them and running a bot
on top of that activity feed so you can
use artificial intelligence to make real
decisions so that you know if the Civic
Center is is is having a big event
downtown you could shut all the parking
spots spots within a certain radius and
doing some really interesting things so
we're gonna be hearing more about that
and I just put routing sansei I don't
have any of you heard of the sansei
bought an LA just thought it was really
interesting where again it's there's
this idea of routing through through
intelligence to people and I thought
that was a really interesting model
we've heard that multiple times coming
up or with the handoff to two people so
it's another interesting model will be
hearing about got a whole lot more
things we could say we got sequel coming
and it's whole idea of storytelling so
Google is going to be doing more of that
you've seen Luca do that you've seen a
lot of that today so looking forward to
more of that since another example
personality we just heard about we're
doing a bot at mobilebeat and we won't
have the personality I love the
presentation you just presented for Ted
and there's a whole ecosystem of Ba
sweating events right it was a whole
nother concept right a place in time
where people are connected that's going
to be another interesting use case so so
yeah with that it just it feels like
we're six months out for when when the
big brands are going to be hitting big
and then it's over in terms of early
days right because as big Browns will be
up and running and we really have to
find the white space in between those
it's my personal opinion and so if you
have something that's interesting let
you feel free to reach out to me and
Marshall VentureBeat for for Moby in
just a month if you have something
that's percolating you'd like to launch
or you'd like
talk about reach out to me this is a
great crowd and be my pleasure so an in
coverage too if you have anything
interested to cover ventureBeat would
like to cover it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
