so as mentioned I'm hopefully graduating
the semester and this is actually my
thesis talk I don't quite have a job
talk already yet but basically bill said
this should be sufficient so keep that
in mind structurally people should I
don't ask questions during it I would
think that's the way that the thesis
went so anything that we find so feel
free to pipe up at any point and of
course the title is reduce our networks
so first I have to mention all of my
collaborators which they're great many
shutting Hassan is probably the one of
the another graduation of Berkeley's
been working on this stuff and Kasia
folly this is really the team is the
three of us of course my advisors are
brewin tappan parikh a bunch of other
organizations and people all over the
world so I want me a little background
i'm gonna start using the clicker now
because that clicker a little bit of
background on on cellular telephony it's
probably the most impactful technology
since the light bulbs um with over six
billion subscribers in about 25 years
you take that and compare that to the
internet which is about 2 billion
subscribers and which started and really
the i would say the early 70s and
there's numerous studies which show
various development benefits we can
argue about these are not talking about
these but generally the idea cell phones
good people using people like them it's
a positive thing in the world but you'll
notice that six billion is not the
population of the earth by most
estimates are about 700 million people
who just don't have cellular access in
the world and the goal of our project is
essentially to bring telecommunications
to that remaining 700 million people and
so this invites the first question of
why don't they have cellular coverage
and there's really two answers the first
is just that basic economics right rural
areas are more expensive for them to
install equipment in they have to
install power left install roads you
have to install all this stuff that you
have to do in an urban area or you have
other solutions for in an urban area and
so at the same time they have less users
and so at some point those you know
twice the man curves cross and it's no
longer economically feasible for
carriers operating these areas and so
the carriers don't want to operate in
them sometimes they're forced through to
things like through
like universal service obligations but
in general it's just not economically
beneficial for them the second piece of
this is structural which is that the
only people allowed to bring coverage to
these areas are big nation scale
telecommunication firms so when that
profit motive doesn't work no one is
there no one's allowed to come and bring
coverage there anymore so you see a
bunch of spectrum which is ostensibly
owned like an Indonesia there's five
license holders actually think this
three license holders some of them are
sublicensees for the entire band across
the entire country so if you're in an
area where you want to set up a network
that spectrum is used and that's the
enforcement mechanism to keep it so that
only these major firms can do that so
how we can fix this the first thing
we're going to do is that we're going to
reduce the cost of installing rural
cellular equipment and this is both a
capital expenditure which is you know
just the hardware the tower power
generation and the ongoing cost of
operating a tower which is mostly fuel
and maintenance and the second piece is
we're going to enable these things we
call community cellular networks which
are basically locally operated
small-scale community networks this is
what we like to call bottom-up cellular
networks versus this top-down model with
nation scale firms coming in and
bringing communication to that community
the community itself actually brings
communication to itself I think way fast
you see yeah I mean it's a little
operator this week center for them too
yeah but I'm like the oven in yet did he
share sharing out for example maybe a
color that can be shared by in 15 we're
gonna get into that know the things like
yeah when you're a major firm you sort
of have these like stock ways of doing
things and you bring your tower and you
bring your generator someone else brings
their tower in their generator sometimes
people actually share full towers and
then the backup and all that stuff but
in general no you know there's just a
couple ways to do this and you do that
in that way you're not really able to
utilize things at least outside of
telecom and any meaningful way so I'm
going into reducing the cost of yes I
mentioned disorder oh that's a big
question we're gonna basically run
pirate network show right now and then
have a bunch of answers so we'll go into
that later the talk but you're that's
the big thing
like hanging over this project is
licensing and regulation schastye in
particular has we we just pushed a
wonderful paper on GSM like cognitive
base stations in gsm white space
basically make an argument this spectrum
is totally unused in these areas it's
available we just need a regulatory
framework to support it and so now we
propose a regulatory framework and the
technical system to resolve that problem
we'll see you know it regulations are
slow right now it's illegal but at the
same time in a rural area it there's
like five illegal radio stations in our
area like there's no regulation
effective there's no effective
regulation and where we work just
because you know the in we work in
Indonesia tell common foe is this is the
big FCC group there for them to come to
our community and find and shut down
this tower is an enormous amount of work
for almost no benefit and then the
community is upset at them they'll you
though they'll fight back all this stuff
there's just no real reason for them to
do that there were they're there to
protect the interests of the telecoms
and we're so far away from Telkom's
there's not really any concern so pirate
operation sounds really bad but it's
quite functional in most like hard rural
areas that I can do graduate work with
runs as similar I shouldn't say that I'm
regarded I've heard of other systems
that are being run in the exact same
area and we've actually scanned in
seating them so anyway so for the first
piece is reducing the cost of a siloed
appointment so you might think that a
cell phone tower or something like this
this is a big walking it with a big fat
generator in front of it and there's a
tower above it and it's you know a
building and it's got that's just a pet
role of some sort and then a big rack
mount or a big you know big iron
solution inside of it so this is what a
traditional cell phone tower was like
it's like five hundred thousand dollars
a big deal but Moore's law has finally
come to telecom and now we have things
like this so this is a range networks
5150 base station and full disclosure I
am a consultant for range networks they
pay me so this is just a small rackmount
you know about ten thousand dollars full
telco basically it's not even just the
cell phone tower it's a full telco like
you've got all the routing and all that
internal and then you can go down to
this thing and this is anas research be
100 so this thing you plug it in your
laptop you can do the same thing as that
this is seven hundred dollars so we've
gone from this
a big thing $5,000 being able to run
your own tower for significantly less um
that's a big toss but no I mean in one
of these are in one of these it's
actually most of the fences and
generators and all this stuff right now
because this stuff dislike core radio
amplifier stuff is pretty cheap right
now so you can put together a full base
station so for about two thousand
dollars right now this is amplifier
radio CPU no folk are really works yeah
whatever amplifier you want ours in so
we put our station together for about
ten thousand dollars it's got a 10 watt
unit in it 10 watt amplifier we could
put a 50 watt in if we wanted it's gsm
it just turns into how many channels
versus broadcast power we don't need
that many channels so yeah it's two
thousand dollar for that piece it's the
rest of the cost that really starts to
dominate specifically power well you'll
see so even in a modern base station you
still about fifteen thousand dollars for
power generation this is assuming best
case solar batteries all these like
really nice solutions it still dominates
the rest of the cost up to eighteen
thousand dollars total 15,000 power so
if we wanted to reduce the cost of a
cellar installation in a rural area it's
really about reducing the power off the
base station that is the critical piece
so how do we do that this is the inside
of our our 5150 we put it in a box so we
could tower mount it let's make it
reminded you'll see and here's all the
power consumption of all the pieces
inside of it so the CPU is just you know
10 watt small thing we get that down to
3 watts now with an arm board the radio
down here 10 watts can only do so much
about that the switch does almost
nothing duplex is passive power
amplifier boom 40 watts 235 wats
dominates the power consumption of the
entire unit so if we want to we see if I
would slide for this year so if we want
to reduce the power draw of the base
station we have to touch the power
amplifier you can't just do clever
software tricks there's only so much we
can do we have to be able to touch that
piece now what you'll see in most
networks is just duty cycling basically
you just turn the base station off for
some period of time that's your way to
say power at night for instance a pretty
common solution
especially here in Pakistan actually
hear about it a lot but we did some
field interviews and this really not a
sufficient solution for most people and
the reason is that emergencies are
really really important sometimes you
have to make a communication at a
certain time if the base station is
unavailable that's really really bad and
so we piloted a bunch of like
asynchronous communication systems and
everyone was like this works a little
bit but we really need to be able to
send a message right now sometimes and
that was really hard to do with a full
asynchronous system so we can't just do
naive duty cycling what we can do
instead is virtual covered which is
basically just a smarter form of duty
cycling so here's a cell phone tower my
wonderful diagrams and here's happy
users and here's coverage so a normal
coverage everyone has covered all the
time right you've everybody's got signal
it's going full blast all the time and
people can make calls whenever they want
little lightning both are people making
calls some of you see pieces of this
deck before I've used this walk through
multiple times but the network stays up
even when it's not being used you for
example at night and that's really bad
if you're trying to run this on things
like solar panels right because that's
where you're gonna have to put all the
battery backup and all of that so we're
just sitting here broadcasting at night
no one's communicating it's just wasted
this is exacerbated in rural areas right
you have even less people so you have a
lot more idle time at night and a lot
more wasted power but at the same time
these people want to communicate so in
virtual coverage what we do is we
actually just turn the power amplifier
off when the base station is not in use
this is an idle mode we basically added
the GSM protocol so the base stations
idle no one has any signal if they want
to make a call for an emergency or some
other purpose what they do is they send
a little burst to the tower which is
still listening because you don't need
the amplifier to listen you the
amplifier to broadcast so the base
station sits there running and just
listening with the power amplifier off
it comes to the base station the base
station here is it oh sorry I have to
say how it sends it so we've modified a
phone this is Ozma com BB the
open-source handset so we've modified
the actual phones that basically you can
just dial and it will send the message
connect immediately and connect the call
or there's Rebecca offer for legacy
systems we also have this thing called
the wake up radio which is just a button
that just
broadcast it's a trivial piece of
hardware but you can just walk out
presses button and then second will come
back and you'll have network
connectivity for some period of time and
now you can make your calls while the
network is up and people look a little
more puzzle now than before so the
question that i have is first up how do
you decide how long it's a um so the
second portion is really easy whether
you have signals or not signal on your
phone or not right bars yeah done now if
you have the modified baseband you could
be a little smarter and be like I know
that I'm in the range of one of these
towers so I'll give like a signal to the
user saying they have coverage but it's
this virtual covered rather than the
real coverage and all it is to them it's
just latency on the call but then if the
base station was actually down it
wouldn't know any different uh the first
question the first question already more
okay it depends right so you'll see in
our installation in Papua what we did is
we just like duct tape from to a couple
trees and throughout the community
people block a little bit in hit the
button if you're in a somewhat wealthy
area that's obviously I'm incredibly
cheap piece of hardware all it does is
you press a button and a broadcast at a
certain frequency it just needs to
broadcast noise at this point we don't
even have a protocol for what's being
sent in which case we think we can do
something for five dollars yeah you
could tell them you could give them app
to individuals we've talked about using
this for sort of really wide sparse
areas like national parks if people
really need emergency service they can
walk in and you just take one as they
come into the park and leave one as I go
out things like that so there's multiple
solutions it really depends on the
context but the technology is what's
either one obviously
so are too difficult in the fact that
father Andrew in the given determine
exactly what you worried about exactly
exactly yeah we haven't seen any yet
it's a good question and something where
because now you'll see in the future
work what we're trying to do is
basically do this so the GSM is a tdma
protocol which means that we can
actually turn off the power amplifier
per slot and get a lot of these benefits
without having the phone see no bars but
then you've got an amplifier that's
going you know just on and off
constantly it's going to explode and
we're not really good power amplifier
designers in our group and so we're
still looking at that but yeah you'll
see some of those problems is 30 yeah
you're going after places lack not only
cellular networks but they also like
land mines yes usually on grid um no
they usually off great dude they're
usually like I don't know how to
generalize too much we think this would
run just fine in areas with land lines
this is in our community in Papua
there's a couple SAT phones installed in
which you could argue or similar use a
landline Network to figure though oh
yeah or any other yeah I mean it's
really just a software sitting there
right and so as long as you can send it
a message it wakes up and it goes so
that's a great idea so again the base
station again whenever goes idle goes
back to sleep oh the first question is
about the amount of time that's what it
was that's just a heuristic yo we we we
yeah we just dial it up down the down
that lit up figured out when and then so
it takes about you should see the paper
and SDI we have statistics we took a
bunch of phones and measured how long
they take to attach to the base station
it's about 20 seconds so this adds about
20 seconds of latency you press the
button 20 seconds you'll see signal and
you'll be able to make your
communication that's an average the
worst case is about a minute so
basically we have to be up for more than
a minute for example in our network we
chose five minutes because that's a time
out of to SMS deliveries things like
that show up
so once we get to virtual coverage this
basically lets us cut the power budget
in about half so now we're getting a
base station to around ten thousand
dollars which is really a price point
that that without we're shooting for I
don't know why I think I maybe I should
have kept a slide in which explain why i
got the half but trust me you'll see
some data later so that was the power P
so now we got in Cheaper base stations
we got cheaper base stations base
station stalls that's only half the
problem the other problem is really
making it so that smaller organizations
can run these things so that communities
can run these things are individuals or
even NGOs so let's first define
community cellular networks community
cellular networks are owned and operated
locally the argument for this is that
local actors are more efficient in rural
areas than non local actors and this is
an economic efficiency my own version of
this being from Alaska is redneck
engineering this is where you can sort
of solve a problem with local tools and
skills well if you are from telkomsel or
a big carrier you go back to Jakarta and
get equipment and come back and
everything gets significantly more
expensive you're able also use local
infrastructure which is what you were
mentioning this is for instance
partnering with a person who has a
generator or solar panel or partnering
with other organizations in your
community that's harder to do if you're
a big big big actor basically the costs
of negotiating are going to start to
dominate if you're doing a whole bunch
of these and lastly locals just sort of
care about their businesses they care
about equipment they care about the
things that they've invested in and so
if we can get more investment from local
people the stuff is just going to
survive longer can we do shell networks
are small scale this is really just
trying to enforce that that property of
external actors being inefficient in
local actors being efficient so kind of
expects community salad networks to stay
under 10 nodes after that you're
starting to run a full-on telco and then
you'll have different problems but you
can do it with the tech though and
lastly commuter silent network support
local goals I when you are coming in
from a multinational telecommunications
firms perspective they're largely profit
motive driven they have sort of
simplistic goals of revenue in this but
if you're part of the community you
might have different sets of goals but
favorite example of this is for instance
if you're running a health NGO you might
just want to put up a cell phone
work so that your people can communicate
with each other profit doesn't
necessarily need to be the driving force
and then maybe you could provide that to
the community to generate profit off of
that maybe you don't because you want to
have good service there's a couple
examples of these the rhizomatic network
in Mexico is a good friend of ours Peter
bloom so Peter is running a full on
cooperative cellphone network using very
similar technology dollars and that
community decided that they're not going
to charge for local calls at all because
it's a community network so these are
decisions you can make as a community
that are really hard to make as a bigger
firm and hopefully it's not question
yeah it has to it has to how does that
work it's an it's like a gnarly Wild
West business and you'll see some
ugliness here our network and Papa will
use the Swedish phone numbers right now
for this reason I so everyone in this
little tiny community in bhabua has
Swedish phone numbers and there's been
some sort of friction because of that
but not a lot so you just have to sort
of hustle at that point and hopefully we
as technologists make that job easier
for them um it would be the network
actually doesn't support I'm calling
right now only SMS and the calling is
because our vsat is completely congested
it's just full of Facebook and so we
just like the calls are just terrible
and so we have to double the capacity
the vsat that's a little too expensive
so the operators and we don't make
decisions on our network our operator
makes decisions the operator doesn't
want to do that like he says I'm gonna
have to double the cost of the vsat I
don't think I'm gonna get that much
revenue back we're not going to do it so
now it's SMS only but yeah if if they
were making calls outbound Dave would be
from Sweden and it would be long
distance right now all the SMS is long
distance which is like a big negative
bias and a lot of our results as we go
forward this case shipping money to
Jakarta we are also cases where the
tempo a little infer a loss to install
the base station in rural area
potentially
urban you know they want to call their
rights I mean we can sometimes you're
the benefit of a subsidy from yeah that
means that there's like strict subsidies
right there's a USO as a strict subsidy
if we take money from the urban areas
and put it in the rural areas yeah I
mean these are all business decisions
that the telcos make at the same time
there's 700 million people without
coverage so those those those functions
only go so far i guess x foods actually
came for that so like it might be people
elsewhere that are paying to call in
mmhmm yeah the people there that are
paying to call out yeah and so i guess
if you lose the connection to the
outside world you also lose the revenue
starts people who are trying to comment
in a way they're paying for your local
memory yeah I I agree so if you're
running one of these community cellular
networks what sort of choices can you
make about your network is the next
question first we get to licensing which
is the the big elephant in the room with
most of this which is that you know you
could run a full legal ice license the
rhizomatic network has a special
temporary license from the Mexican
government to run their network in
indigenous communities they're forbidden
from making a profit so off you when you
come in with a legal license as a small
operator it's really hard it's just you
these licenses are millions of dollars
if not billions in some countries and
you don't have that you you have ten
thousand dollars so you can also operate
without a license which is surprisingly
functional in rural areas as I was
mentioning it's just you go out there
nobody's monitoring anything it's fine
we've got a whole all the spectrum is
available to you you're not going to
step on anybody our network well going a
little bit later we're running is a grey
network this is sort acid approval from
the regulators we went and talked to the
regulators that are like you know just
stop telling us anything and it'll be
fine you can also decide if your network
is open or closed an open network is
basically available to anyone you buy a
sim card Yugi on the network you go
closed network is something you see
mostly in places like oil rigs these are
networks where you have to come in and
do something special to get access the
rhizomatic networks closed doors is open
you get to choose naming and numbering
it's at this point when we're talking
about this box it's a full telco to
reiterate and so you can make all
decisions about the network you decide
you can just have local only numbers the
rhizomatic network has local numbers we
have global numbers we pick those
Swedish ones you can use the cheapest
ones would be fine very simple they're
still not that cheap but you could share
numbers and you can actually have
dynamic numbers inside the system
because you get to do your own routing
so one example of this would be we had
we plan to implement this but it never
actually happened but it was you would
call a number and you get a certain like
a list of nurses in the village and so
we dial the first one if they didn't
answer it goes the second of dental
answer goes the third one and then that
sort of randomly selects so this would
be an example of dynamism versus a sort
of statement more static numbering
system you of course you to set your
prices this is actually an interesting
variable when we haven't played enough
with but you know what we see right now
and most telcos is sort of a flat
pricing scheme across the country that's
just because they want roaming they want
all this stuff but in the earlier world
you used to have to pay when you would
leave your country or state you still
have to pay when you leave your country
you can build a prepaid system or
postpaid system most of the time you're
going to see prepaid systems those are
what you see in most rural areas and
then lastly you can just it's a full PBX
you can build whatever service you want
there's like a whole research agenda on
various PBX see things about low you
know just stuff you can build and put
poly so if you can build and put on a
PBX and put in the network now you can
do it and you can set the prices for it
and you can attach other services to it
you can give people credit you can do
all this stuff so there's a huge design
space of stuff you can do as a community
seller network so the stuff that we
built is this thing called the village
base station it's just a set of scripts
for free switchy eight and open BTS to
support this stuff so eventually you'll
be able to in the dialplan in free
switch query for the user's location
whether they're online or not or given
data access or whatever so this is all
these sort of hooks to make it easier to
write those complicated services so
that's community sailor networks that's
that thing we built that's that idea so
we deployed both community cellular
networks and virtual coverage in Papua
Indonesia starting december of last year
Papua is a very very interesting place
it's incredibly sparse it's about nine
people per square square kilometer and
almost all of them
located in the capital in Jaipur so if
you go into other places it's just empty
there's no internet no fiber to the
entire island everything on the island
is V set so even the major telcos use
vsat and their service is horrible it
was like yelling through a tunnel trying
to call someone in like next to me in
hua mana just the capital the highlands
so we work in the Bay Liam Valley the
woman is the capital here they have cell
phone covers actually have two providers
on two different towers but you go about
44 miles outside town and it just drops
it's just gone and then there's no
signal for a very long time so the big
cities will have it woman as I think
over a hundred thousand people but even
a little bit outside of that you'll do
that these are like some weird tourist
map because I couldn't find anything
else for a woman ax the community we
deployed our intervention in is it's
called Baeza this is an anonymized name
on account of running a pirate network
it's about 1,500 people it's a sort of
local regency it is a big hub of the
missionary network from a long time ago
and so it still got a lot of sort of
cachet in the local communities but it
doesn't have any phone service the road
is quite terrible and goes out all the
time there's no grid power there's no
community wide network available about
15 other people as I said but you do see
phones and this is always I mean all of
you will probably know this but even in
areas without coverage juicy phones this
is a 10 watt solar panel attached to a
hut and here's the inside of it they
were karaoke machine and a bunch of
phone chargers and you still have these
phones primarily for medias purposes you
know there's nothing else to do but
listen to music maybe watch TV if you
can get a nicer phone and so the phones
are there we actually ran our base
station for a while just listening and
we had over 2,000 request to join the
network so we saw two thousand phones in
our time there which is more than the
population so even in these rural areas
the phones are there that work you need
a sim card info yeah so
so we are network was up so they
basically send us a message requesting
access and we reject them because they
don't have a spare sim card love it yeah
it was no yeah why do they have anything
well it never took out so maybe they go
to one wire originally yes yeah well I
don't know if it was necessarily for
that purpose but it definitely is used
in part for that purpose so they many
people go to wolman on which is four
hours drive and communicate and so
that's mostly what we saw was talk
himself which is the big carrier there
who has good coverage and waman ah so we
get supporting talk on seller number one
priority for the reason but yeah that's
as many phones it has have sim cards
your phone actually will try to camp
without a sim card but it will camp an
emergency mode it's a little complicated
I mean I recovered that there might even
been yeah absolutely they could have
been even more phones media only phones
I'd be surprised as sim cards are really
cheap and people do go to Bob and I you
just can't get that much done in days on
its own to make sure I don't say the
right name when I'm being recorded so
days a hat is like a full feature to me
I don't want to do like this you know oh
it's the middle of nowhere thing it's
got an airport a military base hospital
police station three sort of very large
papa winches so pop was Christian the
rest of Indonesia's Muslim and so the
churches are sort of a complicated
political landscape the military basis
for the Indonesian military because
there's a free popular movement and
their present but the big thing is it's
like a it's a full full community in the
military yes yeah it's not a huge base
probably maybe a hundred people um
they're just you know the only ones with
guns and they they play that cool game
where you like kick the ball over the
net like it's soccer anyway I don't know
what it's called it's awesome I was
watching no i didn't i didn't want to
try scary so we work with a local
missionary school this is run by
community organizer it's a white
American dude was actually lived in
Southeast Asia for his entire life doing
missionary work he's a child of
missionaries he like this is this is his
life so he's been in the community for I
believe seven years in that particular
community daisa and in Papua for i want
to say 15 so he's been there a long time
and his school already has power and
network so they've got a multicolored
wat hydro install um
is for powering laptops and things
they're trying to do like a really nice
education so they get funding from you
know us people providing missionary
money and they build out this thing as
well as a vsat and this is primarily
used for facebook to keep the teachers
in contact with their family so they
bring teachers from other communities in
Papua and those teachers will leave if
they can't talk to their family family
super important so they give them
Facebook a lot of communication happens
over Facebook but it's only a 512
kilobit link and that's a ten to one
contention ratio so in the middle of the
day it's about a 51 kill a bit link so
with that with Facebook we can make any
calls so you can see the satellite dish
here and these are two tech workers at a
the operator which is a romaine accom so
we actually installed the base station
into this weather proof box you can see
me here doing that these are two
teachers and the tech guy I want to say
how incredibly important is the debug
proof this is all cockroach feces which
are apparently conductive they've lost
so much equipment to cockroaches so the
inside of the box is pristine outside of
the box is ruined but our mat we pull
mounted it and put it up this tree so
this is some of that redneck engineering
i was speaking of even saw like power in
this community it's no doubt $50,000 and
getting it there is mind-blowing on its
own the road is horrible but with this
solution we just sort of rope it to a
tree and rope it to a pole and and the
and the problem is solved so this is
obviously much much cheaper than a real
tower there's two teachers on the top
and again Rudy the tech guy on the
bottom we also installed a virtual
coverage wake up radios we installed
them in a couple community or local
kiosks which is like a store basically
throw out the community or three of them
installed we just sort of take them in
place because we were we didn't think to
put those little things so you could zip
tie on our industrial design we don't
really know doing there so you walk up
and presses bind you get signal and it
goes down between 11 and six at night
which is when the hydros down because
the the reservoir needs to be refilled
so during that time period is battery
backup you walk up you hit the button to
get coverage the idea was installing
these policed areas so maybe people
wouldn't steal them we think one was
stolen
in the length of our deployment which is
bad but they said we were a little bit
smarter about industrial design to be a
lot harder to steal them so the network
itself as I said is a great network we
had this handshake agreement with the
operators we we built it as an open
network so what you do if you want to
connect as you come and buy one of these
to your SIM cards and that'll leave you
access to the network discredited yeah
so the the credit seller who's this one
of the teachers knows a special short
code which lets you provision your front
your SIM card with a new phone number so
you put it in you send an SMS to a
certain number and you get a phone
number we have these swedish phone
numbers i mentioned earlier and then we
have static numbers but there are a
little bit of funny business there which
is the doctor police and the local
operator all have short codes in the
network this is actually almost entirely
useless but mostly done to get these
peoples by in we the doctor just we gave
them basically a sim card which he let
you communicate locally only for free
and the doctors abuses it but everybody
loves the doctor because he's a really
good doctor and he could be in a much
better place than daisa so everybody's
happy with that the operator shows all
of the prices of communications and they
charged nine cents for an outbound SMS
in two cents for local SMS and two cents
for local call and there's no outbound
calls and all the local services are
free payment was done through as credit
system that schastye built so this is
that teacher I forget what his
anonymized name is so I'm not going to
say his name people come to him and they
would buy credits so originally we built
the system so that there was a different
teacher who was going to do this job
because this guy is actually fairly busy
he's like a really good teacher so he
didn't want to be harassed all day or
people coming by and credits for him so
we handed it off to this other person
who was the husband of a teacher they
just had a kid so he was going to sit at
the house watch the kid and this was
going to be a supplementary income the
church decided that they didn't want
this commercial thing happening on their
property which is really weird because
the school was already selling chicken
they're the only place with a fridge so
they were selling chicken to the
community so we had to build a
difference
them so what it is right now is that
this guy actually sells credits to
people in the community and they resell
to the community so he sells the credit
to kiosk store owners and the chaos
store owners go on from there so we sort
of both an actual completely functional
credit transfer system and credits sort
of buying system and all that happened
without like without our participation
virtual coverage yeah have this global
connection how the users think about
emergencies do you want to receive so I
guess I you know I skipped that part
incoming it works just fine right like
it's an incoming message we just wait
the base station up so in so I know if I
want to go back all the way my slides
right so the base stations asleep no
one's guys signal an SMS comes in for a
user right so we wait the base station
up and just hold on to it until they
come back on the network and then handle
the message over ethnic oh no you just
have to wait a little bit basically we
would put them on hold and then wait 30
seconds for the phone to come up and
connect them so either one would work in
our network is trivial because it's SMS
and this is why we set the timeout to
two times the SMS timeout because we
wanted to wait and make sure that they
got the message when it came into coming
but it actually works just fine so
emergencies incoming or even better than
emergencies outgoing because you don't
even have to get up and hit a button and
want to test the slides I miss that
piece my bad so we both abunch of
services on the network as well credit
transfer I told you about SMS broadcast
is basically just sends SMS to everyone
in the network we mostly use this for
announcements group SMS is like an SMS
mailing list the chatty built real quick
this is primarily used in the community
for by the teachers for organizing
events it's like hey we're to play
soccer that happen multiple times
there's a local shortcodes I told you
about we built this thing called daisa
Idol which didn't really work there's a
singing competition because again and
everything's free for us so we're just
going to play around a little bit you
would call in and sing a song and then
in a week later you call in to the same
number and you get sent to a random song
you haven't heard before and then you
get to rate it whoever at the end wins
get some free credits in network we've
rented a couple times it was actually
like I fail you a lot of weird social
stuff going on and I'm not in the
community be able to figure out what's
going on because no one's saying
everyone's hang in bahasa indonesia
which is the sort of national language
and no one's saying in the local
language despite their main multiple
local people singing this far
we could tell so I think they have an
interesting view of the network there's
a lot of tension in between those two
communities the sort of austronesian
Indonesian people's which are sort of
more asian looking in the pop ones who
are more Aboriginal looking like
Aboriginal Australians so they have
different languages and there was it was
just weird that we got this entirely one
set of languages from this and so when I
go back that's one of the first things I
want to go look at try to figure what's
going on delivery receipts were
interesting so there was this politician
so that you it's an SMS only network
right so you send SMS and you don't hear
anything back you don't know why some
people thought it was us we're like
we're going to make sure it's not us so
we implemented deliver your seats just
tell you when that person has received a
message I'm the big driver on this was
this politician who was trying to use it
all the time because right now Daisy is
being merged into a nearby district and
they're not sure which district and his
two political parties sort of fighting
over it he's in the middle trying to
play a game and so this service has been
he's one of the top users of the service
and he really really wanted to know his
messages got there so he asked for this
we implemented that find a friend we
cancelled find a friend was the tap and
I have tried to implement chatroulette
on various services multiple times
because we just think it's awesome so
find a friend was basically chatroulette
in our network so this was you would
call someone would connect you to
someone you've never talked to before
and if you talk to them for sure no time
you'll get credits in the network the
idea was there's like five communities
roughly inside of inside of data there's
the three churches there's the military
and there's the police and so we wanted
to sort of break down some of the
barriers so we started piloting this
thing and someone was like well what
happens if you get connected to
someone's wife said well well that's not
good like that's actually going to maybe
make things worse and so we just sort of
killed it for a little bit I think
there's an answer we've implemented a
version of it that does like you have to
when you call in that did it puts you on
the list of people who can call but it's
at the end of the day it's got to be
rand America if we can just do gender
splitting if that's any better yeah it's
just
to work on this in China as well we can
talk about it later oh yeah that's do I
really wanted to do it though but yeah
it was clear that it was a not even half
baked so these are all the services he
put up in the network the network went
live on febuary 11 to the Swedish phone
numbers we later turned on polk island
delivery receipts I think it was within
the month so here's an analysis of the
network's usage it yeah there's a
there's a there's a profit motive so
we'll get to that a little bit the
operator which for some reason isn't in
this deck is this guy he's another
missionary dude he runs a wireless
internet service provider in lamina so
he runs this thing called woman to come
and what they do so you mean he runs it
as a for-profit operation he ran this is
for proper operation as well so we
deciding where technologist we don't
want to come in and set policy say hey
charge whatever you want you tell us
will implement it and so even he just
set those prices he set those based on
what his normal measures were for
setting prices which is like the mounted
costs times for roughly yeah we give him
the equipment so just affects closer
yeah I mean basically the idea for him I
mean this is a he's a pretty wealthy
dude he made a bunch of money in the
States before becoming born again and
moving overseas so this is he just
believes that you have to generate a
profit or something to be sustainable a
bunch of the profit goes to the school
for instance i get pays entirely for the
satellite link now and so these broader
sustainability things so it's more of a
philosophical thing than anything else
like for instance we're charging two
tents for local SMS local SMS is free
for us he doesn't go to anyone else's
network could cost us nothing he just
know he wants to charge money for things
because he thinks otherwise they're
abused and that is a perspective and
we're happy to support any one's
perspective on these networks I guess
I'd with the rise American network they
don't charge for anything for local
anything and their network is horribly
congested and they're trying to figure
how to solve that so they're trying to
solve it without market forces we're
just super interesting but hard so
that's it was mostly philosophical
so analyzing the vertical coverage usage
here's the numbers of unique wake up
events that happened in a four-month
trial roughly so we saw about I think it
was 60 something wake up radio button
presses and we say unique means if you
just hold it down it's only counts as
one if you hit it multiple times it only
counts as one these are like separate
events that have some time between them
in different way cups so it's not super
common for people to come and press the
button but it's not super uncommon
either it's maybe one every other day by
this on average while the number of
incoming SMS is actually quite high and
incoming SMS will also cause the base
station to come on and if you
continually communicate the base station
will stay on every time there's a
message it wakes up it stays woken up
and reset the timer so as long as
there's constant communication it'll go
these are coming from outside these are
coming from inside yeah different way
cups and there's a bit of a time zone
thing papa was two hours ahead of
Jakarta which is where a lot of people
are so things go dark in days that's
significant before they go dark in
Jakarta despite the fact that also
Jakarta you know is a full bustling city
and this is not so this is sort of
expected but the core point here is that
there actually is is usage and if we
won't here's the wrong slide here's the
usage over time at night you can see
what I was saying with just a lot of
usage early in the night and it drops
off as the other people in the other
parts of Indonesia also go to sleep but
key point is consistent usage there's
always usage at any hour so really that
is hitting an emergency or not
necessarily emergency but there's
clearly desire for communication to
these periods here's the number of
messages sent in the network at those
times so there was about 755 inbound SMS
and about 390 outbound SMS during the
night time periods this is different
than with the daytime percentages you
can see they're almost equal these are
significantly unequal and it just it
mean it's harder for someone to send an
outbound SMS because I have to walk
somewhere and hit a button versus the
inbound one were just arrives but in
total we saw 400 or 1400 roughly 1500
communications throughout the night so
this is a non-trivial amount of
communications that basically virtual
coverage enables otherwise we would have
to do hard duty cycling
so it really works for what we're trying
to do here's the cdf of how often the
base station could be asleep basically
what you see is the ideal is assuming
that we just try to handle every
communication happens in the network the
red line is the actual amount of power
saving network you see sometimes we were
actually on for over six hours at a
night this was some people taping or
holding the button down the whole night
which was a horrible design decision on
our part because if you did that it
worked it should have just gone off once
but if you held it down would go off
constantly so you know batteries are
going to burn out real quick all this
sort of stuff they eventually figured
out that it didn't do anything but my
intuition is that people didn't
recognize that the incoming messages
basically would come in even if they
didn't have signal and so if they were
waiting for a message they would just
hold down the button and wait for the
message and sometimes the message the
message never came so this happened like
two or three nights but it was sort of a
dominant thing on occasion in conclusion
it was plenty of usage at night it was
off for eighty-seven percent of the
night and it reduced the total power by
about fifty six percent so that's where
we get that earlier price savings about
cutting the budget about half so we also
do sustainability analysis of this
network and here's the number of users
in the network over time this is
somewhat of an old graph this is we ran
out of phone numbers for a little bit
and so there's a dead period but steep
growth and then trailing off up to think
this at this point and it was 187 users
here's a more recent graph over time and
we started separate active in total
users so over 220 users or total SIM
cards sold active users or how many
people are actually using it each month
there's a big Lowell in the summer as
people went to other places probably
back to family since we're so closely
connected with the missionary school
there's a lot of teachers usage and
things like that but it again picks up
and its continued to do so so we're
seeing roughly 160 active users per
month in the network here's the service
usage of all the services in the network
and not all of them but the most
important ones and obviously the
important back here is that first up
into the right which is great
and outbound SMS and inbound SMS
dominate which is what is expected
although i mean i've seen some people
arguing that local communications are
always going to be important all this
really when you're in one of these
communities you can go knock on
someone's door you can't do that for
someone in wanton so this is an
important use case it's about two-thirds
of the communication is outbound
one-third is local here's a more recent
version of that graph as well and see
where up over 12,000 outbound SMS per
month so we're starting to get a lot of
usage and even the local SMS is nearing
half that our bond SMS was nine cents an
SMS and local SMS is two cents yeah yeah
i think what i mean the expensive ones
already dominating right like the
expensive one is the one that's being
used it might even dominate more yeah i
would expect it would in fact but if we
really really made local SMS cheap it
will probably get closer calls are sort
of a medium thing that we're not really
sure about this my guess is honestly the
base station doesn't handle the calls
very well for a variety of technical
reasons mostly that things crash SMS is
really good about things crashing
because the trash isn't it just sends
the SMS again later well open BTS
crashes we're using like an old version
because i had to hack some special stuff
into it we haven't done a big code merch
in a while so when i was there calls a
little shaky and we've seen days where
there's just no calls which means that
there's a fault in base station so we
don't know what that would pick up if we
fix that or not it's certainly a thing
but the SMS is is dominating indonesia
SMS is generally dominant it's latin
script so it's really easy to do there
so we in the sustainability analysis we
have we're going to build two different
models of what a network like this would
look like one of them it uses shared
infrastructure but you think is really
really important to understand when
you're running one of these networks
that informal structures around you and
the ability to use things of your
friends is a key thing to make this
network cheaper and so under one
analysis will assume that we use shared
infrastructure to share the v set and
power that we already have there in that
case the total capital expenditure of
this network is only nine thousand
dollars now if you actually have to buy
everything which is a worst-case
analysis what happens
it's about fifteen thousand dollars to
install our equipment in that in that
tree so with these two models assume in
the five year alone at 12.4 percent is
the Indonesian world bank rate we should
move this leg this is the revenue now
imma skip that we see this is the
monthly profit in the network so in the
shared in on tread models and even at no
growth you see three hundred sixty eight
dollars in profit for the operator 66 in
the shared model this isn't no growth
and this is the analysis of someone old
so even moderate growth we can get up to
near 500 and the actual number is 500
right now based on actual growth of the
network so this is paying off the entire
base station in five years and getting a
whole new one so this is the thing is
great this is much stronger than I've
seen of a lot of similar
telecommunications infrastructure
projects like this is with all of our
negative biases were buying Swedish
phone numbers which are really expensive
compared to buying wholesale like we're
buying them at market racers by fifty
cents a month for a number if you were a
big telco they're literally free as well
as our communications cost us about one
cent per SMS if your telco there again
almost free so a lot of these costs
would even a lot of these biases are
there I get this the infrastructure is
with shared right this is the power and
network primarily sure we shared with
the school exactly so the the non droid
models where we just don't share anymore
we just buy all for ourselves and set it
up and so there's actually insulation on
the mountain top right now that's
non-shared there's nothing else going on
but in in days I check my time know my
time is not in this budget we do a
budget for maintenance from the wisp but
no manufacturing and coding is not I
mean not Manufacturing's and their
coding is on in there but at the same
time this is you know all open source
stuff right now they can just run with
it worst case and it's a linux macho
sits in a tree they don't really have to
do too much to it so yeah I've
definitely given my labor away for free
welcome to graduate school so here's the
profit for the credit resellers
themselves the primary reseller is that
guy I was telling you who sells to the
people in the community who then resell
so he's got a very small mark up because
in bulk he moved about four thousand
dollars worth of credit and made about
37 or thirty-six dollars per month on
about 10 sales so he's making a
reasonable side business the first and
secondary sellers these have moved
around so what we now have a third I
think the first fell out we have a third
and there's moving up to a fourth these
are all Indonesians instead of
indigenous people primarily because
those are the people who have capital in
the community and the fourth one is
going to be an indigenous person and
more interesting to see how that goes
but this guy actually you can see
undercuts secondary one has a lower
margin but was able to make
significantly more profit because of
that so he that was about 290
transactions every month and makes $85
which is he's running a store so it's
it's again a side business because it's
not that big of a community but it's a
reasonable revenue for the community
members and sort of the wider people
involved in network so in conclusion the
network is financially sustainable
sustainable it's actually like pretty
strongly profit well five hundred
dollars a month is a lot for one of
these base stations as I mentioned this
is a worst-case analysis for financing
everything in the real world you might
expect subsidies for these some of these
things especially with us I was going
out there already they give all these
subsidies the major telcos to not come
to these communities and so if you put
any of that to these this equipment this
stuff would be it even better and we're
paying really high interconnect costs so
in my view this model works this is
profitable operation for both the
operator and the community system is
been running in this tree for eight
month to that any significant problems
we have a power switch that we gave them
which was super important because
basically the network would go bad they
were blowing the base station for a
little while and so we let them just do
some a/b testing to turn off the base
station Facebook still doesn't work okay
in the space station becca but if
there's any problem that you know that
that major credit seller will just come
in turn it off turn it back on it boots
up it runs networks available again a
lot of solutions like that we also did a
bunch of user interviews with the people
in the community and unsurprisingly the
primary use of the network was to
communicate Pete with people outside of
days abut not that far outside there's a
family and friends mostly tawana
right now it's a four-hour drive you
cost twenty dollars to take a taxi which
is a pickup truck that you can write in
the back and and so this just saves you
money straight up to get to twenty
dollars it takes a little while on our
network at nine cents an SMS also
there's a lot of people who have family
primarily like kids who go to university
outside of Asia and so they're not able
to communicate with them normally but
the network let them do that and that
was a big use case the number one
problem cited was from a couple of the
sort of older members of the community
who are worried about the youth using
the texting in sort of bad ways it was
yeah it was interesting discussion to
have so there's a lot of like churn
going on inside the community the
highlands were all sense i'll be
discovered in like the late 1940s like
it's not really been sort of globally in
i don't know in meshed in any meaningful
way so this is just a lot of stuff is
changing and a lot of these social norms
are changing and there's a lot of worry
about the kids having kids in HIV and a
lot of the other concern so people just
it's on their mind and then his network
comes in and suddenly they're not able
to monitor the children's communications
in the same way that they could before
there is this indonesian girl who was
actually our first customer she's
probably 16 and her dad came by the SIM
card I'll she does his techs with her
friends and it's like she's the local
user she's a dominant ulocal user so
it's not wrong but at the same time
everyone is under the understanding that
this is sort of telecom it's not about
our network it's about something broader
than that so people don't really blame
us but it was effing Utley a problem
that they viewed we asked a lot of
questions about ownership of the network
because we thought this was a really
interesting model to just drop into a
community how people would understand it
and we gotta just diverse range of
answers there was a comment that I was
the owner of the network which is I
think fairly reasonable mr. Regis is the
guy who runs the school he was credited
as one of the people who made the
network and there's actually someone you
thought it was a full community network
like because it's in the community
there's all these participants it's a
community network so there's just a
diverse range of answers people were
pretty confused obviously
so I think I'm done we save power we're
able to set reduce the installation
customer these base stations we're able
to serve the community with over 200,000
communications at this point in our
eight month trial and we do all of this
in a sustainable way with five hundred
dollars a month in profit for local
operator and a lot of buy-in from the
community so we really think this is a
good way to start to bring
telecommunications these rural areas
this bottom-up telecommunication is is
financially sustainable and you know it
works out so what are we doing now we're
trying to build a shared platform for
these systems that anyone could build
one of their own there's this new power
amplifier design i mentioned earlier
cautious working on this this TDM a
version of it where we don't have to use
the buttons anymore we just got to find
a really good power amplifier design and
then we're starting to add more services
my favorite which is data because we now
have data support in open BTS as of a
couple months ago so we could just turn
that on in our network and I have no
idea what would happen obviously people
would use Facebook but it's not that
many smartphones but those users
probably those are usually the wealthier
users they probably pay for it I think
the operator be open to it especially
because that is also free for them is
this just connecting to the internet
with already paying for so that one's a
big one right we're looking at in the
future we have another deployment in
Papua that just went up it's on a
mountaintop we're waiting for the new
antenna to come on but this is supposed
to a couple of three different
communities I'm just gonna be the first
test case of sometimes the
communications going across communities
in that use case showing up we're going
to expand it with data service as I
mentioned and then we're really
interested in this credit transfer
system because as of a couple of months
ago people started transferring credit
to each other instead of just selling
credit and so we don't know what's going
on they're not necessarily in Mount
divisible by prices in the network so
it's certainly not a direct correlation
to message sending what we don't know if
there's commerce going on or if we
actually created a new currency you know
sort of on accident and one thing we
could really really do really really
easily do is just come in and like give
money to the credit sellers and have
them cash out and what happens when we
have cash out you know what then we're a
bank
yeah well talk about kind of regulatory
issues yeah yeah well you know more in
for what is it in for a penny in for a
pound i believe is the of flesh it's
bear it's just sitting there we can just
do that i'll wait for the day when it
happens on its own and i think it will
at some point but it hasn't happened yet
but it's interesting and i'm excited to
work out with the right of matica
network with Everly working on his
remittances being able to buy credits
from abroad bring them into the network
and it's also super interesting so I
think there's just a bunch of currency
stuff underlying all the space station
stuff and lastly we come to a policy
which is this gsm white space thing that
shoddy and i put together so we've
actually built it and we're hoping to
pilot in the philippines whenever things
calm down there this is basically a base
station that just scans the nearby bands
through the phones actually they were
very clever technical solution and
figures out what channels are available
so that way it should be able to run at
least in a safe way even if still in the
legal way but we have a reasonable
amount of help for being able to get
this licensed correctly in the
philippines we're planning on the
playing in the US as well we can get a
special temporary license here so that's
all thank you all very much you know
times i guess i'm straight it boom okay
yeah cuz the 30 minutes thing man it's
just okay go ahead are you talking to me
I'm readers yeah so this is the biggest
argument in Eric and I his Eric Brewer
my advisor he really wants us to partner
closely with telcos and i don't like
them sort of in a broader sense but at
the same time every time i meet with one
of the telco CEOs or like it's a really
nice dude invariably like we've met I
don't I shouldn't say names but they're
like I'd always really nice boots and so
I'm getting a little bit more one over
to that perspective it's just I feel
like at the end of the day they're going
to come in and they're going to take too
much and it's going to limit the the
sort of adoption
their reaction is that though there's a
number of reactions one is that this is
illegal and like yeah and that's what
we're trying to fix and then there's um
alright what's the business plan how can
we what is our role in this is the CSR
is like they're just trying to find the
business angle on all of this when this
is really more to me about empowering
local communities to solve their own
problems and you know if you are a telco
in the US for instance you have to
provide certain interconnect options
it's in the regulatory framework you
have to be able to do that and then
these things could work we have small
telcos in the US whatever sees you don't
have that in a lot of places so they
just they're in a position of power and
they're trying to figure out how if
anything this can be leveraged to make
their business better and that's not my
goal but sometimes those things can work
together so it's just it's a big debate
there's not anything clear and obviously
nothing's happened yet we think in the
Philippines are most likely to pilot
with a carrier with carrier support
Afghanistan is probably the the other
big option we've had which is just to go
out there and basically run these as a
franchise of the main telco and then
they provided connecting you go but you
know they're going to want to take the
cut and traditionally there's this this
is networking tunisia pacific telecom i
think it went under they were just doing
that model they would build similar
equipment put it up in a community and I
think I shouldn't say names there was a
telco in Indonesia who I was taking
thirty percent of the revenue straight
up and it wasn't profitable and it went
and so they know they have power they
know they have regulatory approval they
know they have a spectrum licence and
they know it's impossible for us to get
a spectrum licence and so they'll come
in and say thirty percent and then it's
not feasible anymore I can honestly if
they have thirty percent of revenue
would still be profitable but that's not
gonna work everywhere it's obviously a
bad thing for these networks and the
trip so their sustainability
power a life decision we've done some
analysis of it yes we've done like graph
theoretic analysis this is a pic way of
submitted right now very sort of yeah
yeah brother on privacy we are at least
as private as every other tellico on
earth which is maybe more so because it
would take a little bit of work for the
Indonesian government to come and ask us
we would give it to them if they asked
we could yeah it's it's like you look at
the night usage stuff in that paper we
we didn't really do any user interviews
of night usage because we were really
like we started to and we hadn't
anthropologist working with us in the
field and it's just like this is this is
like morally grey questions of you
asking because you don't really know
what's going on you don't know people
going to be honest and it's just fuzzy
so we just didn't do it and so we're in
one of those situations with a lot of
this data we try to take a high level
anonymize view basically the sort of
thing that you know telefonica would
hand a researcher we is not I that's the
level we want to work at at best
technically we could maybe do that I
wink but technically yeah high level
exactly it is a boon that none of us
speak Indonesian on the technical side
you know if you see anything biggest
usage is SMS yeah are there other ways
you can save our by optimizing for SMS I
mean this is this an assigned a question
but I mean you need less bandwidth I
mean you need to run the tower at the
same power the range is slightly higher
on SMS so we could essentially run it
slightly less power but the way power
amplifier design works is that there
it's not like linear it's like on or off
like you can run a 10 watt amplifier 5
watts and it's going to draw the same
amount of power there's only a 10 so
it's not really any games to play there
now if we do the fancier duty cycle of
your tdma SMS is milliseconds of that
slot being up in which case then that's
going to save a ton of power basically
we're going to be running it near you
zero utilization constantly if we're an
SMS only network well no data it depends
on what data you're sending obviously
but like a website will come in a burst
and be done it's probably closer but it
still gonna be way more than SMS see
more about message so like very very
popular thing a lot of places is using
data for message instead of that suppose
it depends on a lot of it you might be
able to depend on the protocols I use is
if they use UDP you get some benefits if
they're using kies be you know and maybe
we can play some games inside the base
station to make this better haven't we
thought about it yet but yeah it's
certainly it'll be better than voice
voice is the worst case it's owning a
whole channel constantly transmitting at
a very low data rate you don't get much
worse than that so this is uh what we
save capex to by not having diesel
generator besides I I got the opposite
yes we save up X by having been a vin
diesel generator I think we primarily
save on capex by reducing the battery
and solar panel installation costs and
not needing a tower and all these things
I think those are the costs that are the
biggest one being knocked down one night
in estrus via if it has to stay up the
whole night yeah on what is one night
its resources yeah we probably mean you
put some margins on these things and you
measure your usage and if you're getting
close to running out of power on some
nights maybe you put another battery in
the battery bank these are solvable
problems but yeah at the worst case
there's the generator cases where we
don't have power I agree yeah or we were
provisioning it what you should
provision it for his usage plus
something exactly double usage or
something like that which if we did it
wouldn't be very different from our
power measurements
yeah it's a good question actually it
feels high but I don't have any data on
it there's actually no census for this
community as far as I know and so
everything is very informal but it feels
hi that could be a factor i mean it's
100 in 160 active right so some people
are losing SIM cards we can assume maybe
200 people this starts to map pretty
closely to households I think though I
would be surprised if our if it's my
usage might be dominated by them but
subscribers is probably not dominated by
the school there certainly are like some
of the older missionary shouldn't send
missionaries some of the older church
members these are purple ones who were
very uncomfortable with SMS and wanted
voice service I don't know that was a
technical limitation or a literacy
limitation I felt uncomfortable asking
that
alright thanks up bang bang thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
