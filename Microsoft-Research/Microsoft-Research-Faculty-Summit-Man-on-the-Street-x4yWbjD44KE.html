of fields so it's really exciting to be
able to talk to people that are studying
completely different aspects of computer
science techniques of machine learning
geography user interface concepts are
embedded system design pen-based user
interfaces computer networking protocols
geographical information science
research and theoretical computer
science I'm part of a team that's called
the National Science Foundation ocean
observatories initiative and the idea
for our part of it is to deploy a
kilometre fiber optic cable on the
seafloor off the coast of Washington and
Oregon and British Columbia I personally
am very interested in the intersection
between computer science and economics
60 we are deploying sensor networks in
the Rockies right now one of the big
projects I'm working on right now is the
encryption sort of the study of
encryption here's what we see across our
campus great scientists are handling
their data the way they handled it two
years ago people's data is going to be
up 10x in the next two years and the
question is what are the tools you bring
to them to handle this and I love what I
do it works on a fundamental problem
about public key encryption that hasn't
been solved in the last few years I've
made some significant progress with
collaborators on these problems
microsoft research has two very good
groups that look at coordination and
distributed development I feel very
creative you know here all these people
you're not talking about the new
developments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
