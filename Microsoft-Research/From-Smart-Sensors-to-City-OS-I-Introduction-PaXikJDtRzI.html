so let's start this session I'm a fing
java microsoft research and it is my
pleasure to organize this session and
introduce the speakers and this is about
sensors and the large-scale operating
systems using analogy that our gsa a few
words about many of you have heard about
sensors or more recently in the last
decade or so about Internet of Things
IOT and by all these predictions that
you have seen you know I OT is coming or
many people say it's already here 50
billion sensors by 2020 that's one of
the predictions that in in one of a
reason industrial report many pundits
have been predicting that they're going
to be trillions of dollars in industry
that's going to be affected by these
sensors the ability to be able to
extract data and analytics and insights
from that so you know I'm going to you
just to use the first Minnesota give you
a lip set a little context for this so
number one is that the forces the
technological forces behind this is
really the very rapid advancement in
hardware the ability to make very small
devices and make it extremely low power
and make it a cheap and the second is
that the Durga standardization woman is
standardized the ways that these devices
talk to each other and it is a low-power
wireless links and some of them are
actually extremely adaptive and
long-lasting and but I think you know
the the real interesting bits that's
coming from this is really the data
coming from sensors so hence what I call
that the firm sensor to the inside and I
think the inside is really what the
people care about in terms of HTC sense
making about what is going on but also
taking appropriate actions so this is
about how do we collect data in a
that's scalable and how do we actually
transform the data into knowledge and
into insights then people who can make a
decision can act on information and the
challenges I see in many of those
systems that I personally have built and
many of my colleagues in the audience
have been building and developing and in
fact you heard that the keynotes earlier
in the morning is that it's very
difficult to build systems and
applications on top of those devices and
the today's practice is that every one
of us attributed also called the
stovepipe monolithic apps that goes from
the super nuts that devices the senses
all the way to the resource management
to the middleware to the data analysis
machine learning entity extraction
another way to the high level analysis
and the visualization that approach
actually works for many specific domains
but it'd be very difficult to scale out
to enable a very large ecosystem of
scientific communities and businesses
that people can actually write
applications be able to actually build
values on top of this data so that
knowledge amusing is really what we need
is actually a very clean interface
between the devices what I call the
resources these are sensing these are
control there are resources and then
separate that from the DoD application
the ecosystem now application meaning
that those different things that's going
to take value of the data and do
something about it whether it's actual
whether it's actually a sense making and
take an analogy that this is very
similar to how the mobile world take up
is that once you separate the devices
from the application then you can have
an independent ecosystem application to
evolve and other people you know every
citizen can start writing apps for all
the resources that the city exposed for
the airport to the public when does the
next bus going to come to my
neighborhood the GPS data is possibly
all available that city Karachi publish
the data about the health care the
transportation the energy use the power
grid lots of those stay
that many city start to publish with the
very nice goal of making available for
the citizens for the public to consume
and improve the ecosystem so that
knowledge i'm using is really this
operating system which is our criticism
is nothing but it's an API for the high
level application services to access the
resources in computer it's the compute
it's a memory it's a networking but in
IOT my sensor system the resources are
sensing control all these resources that
you can extract data from the physical
environment so this is just my five
minute so like a contact study in terms
of where the world is coming and what
are the great opportunities i think this
community that have been looking at the
sensors and IOT are facing so I'm really
happy that we have a key for
distinguished researcher and
academicians to come to join the session
and they are coming from Beijing and
Taipei and Singapore and Wuhan so what
I'm going to do is to introduce us each
one of them to give you a short
15-minute introduction to their research
and then at the end of that if we have
time I'd like to invite all of them at
the end of this towards an obsession to
have a dialogue and qma with each of you
so without further ado let me actually
first invite professor x from ching hai
university and professor x is an
associate professor in the center for
earth science Earth System science et
ESS alpha chi moi university and his
talk will be please come on stage and
his talk will be on global change one
the research cyber infrastructure for
Global Change studies professor x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
