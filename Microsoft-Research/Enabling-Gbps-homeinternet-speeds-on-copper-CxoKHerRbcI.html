it is my pleasure to introduce our cong
Sheshadri a PhD student from stanford
who's interviewing for a postdoc
position here at MSR she's akanksha
works in an interesting space on dsl and
and just fiber at the loaf is no layer
of the network stack she was an intern
with us last year and she's one she did
some work on dynamic spectrum axis that
work was very valuable to some of the
some of the responses to the FCC's NPRM
v file from Microsoft akanksha has also
won numerous awards she was a silver
medalist from iit delhi in the w/e
department that means she was the person
with the highest highest GPA she won
she's the first woman to win the balcony
Marconi young scorer award right that
was a see that's a prestigious award so
she's won some great awards and today
she'll tell us about some of the
exciting work she's been doing as part
of the thesis Thank You Remy for the
kind introduction it's always great to
come back here even though it's rainy
weather you know so I'm very excited to
talk about my research and tell you all
about how we can squeeze multi-hundred
megabits per second to gigabits per
second out of copper which is real
economic ille and this work is in
collaboration with my advisor John
cioffi at Stanford and my colleagues how
and Halima how has already graduated so
let me begin with a big picture overview
what we see in this picture is a home
network but instead of having a single
PC connected to internet what we see is
a numerous set of devices ranging from
yours surface Xbox phones laptops to
hear we have IPTV there are three trends
that are apparent in this space where is
apparent is that there's an explosion in
terms of the number of connected devices
in fact we expect by 2020 there will be
50 billion connected devices asked for
cisco projections which are rather
conservative but what that means is
that's five times the population of the
world so on an average you would have
roughly five to ten connected devices
per home
there's a lot of devices to support on
each home for only rises right this it's
it's far outside yeah these are mostly
cows rating sensors yes cause varying
sensors okay that's a nice analogy
what's more interesting in this space is
that these connected devices are not
connecting only by a cellular connection
as you just mentioned they are
increasingly offloading to them Wi-Fi or
the femtocell or the small cell inside
the home because the spectrum is shared
and you no longer can support all of it
on your cellular spectrum so
increasingly the topology or the
architecture we see is you have a Wi-Fi
modem or a femtocell modem or some kind
of small cell and then a wired
connection to get to this modem which
provides the internet access and then
totally there is an increasing demand
for streaming video and by streaming
video I mean there it's explosion in
terms of IPTV subscribers there's
youtube videos increasingly being washed
and a lot of video streaming or video
conferencing is happening in the space
so to summarize we do not have enough
spectrum in Wireless which is why I was
working with ranveer last summer and
it's shared medium so to support these
devices inside the home we want to be
able to get this wild connection somehow
at high speed and this is what my talk
is going to focus about how do we get
this wired connection which used to be
in the range of 1 to 10 megabits per
second to multi-hundred to gigabits per
second to support all these devices so
to give you a big picture overview of
what I mean by this wired connection
what are the options so this picture
actually shows you the number of
subscribers and how they're growing in
worldwide wireline broadband access
market you have three options you have
fiber and amuse you increasingly here
google fiber you have cable where cable
you usually hear comcast doing that and
then dsl you increasingly hear you
AT&amp;amp;T working in this space what I want
you to take away from this graph is that
so worldwide d assault is the largest
traction at sixty-seven percent off
theme a fraction total and more
interestingly so and the second largest
is cable and the reason it's this is
increasing is because in developing
countries the penetration is increasing
but very interestingly even when you are
increasing the fiber connections you are
not running it all the way to your home
in fact you are running all the way to
your curb or you're rebuilding and then
you're using the existing telephone
cable or the TV that's the cable
connections to provide access and why is
that the case economics drives it so
it's simply economical per subscriber to
do cable or DSL than to do fiber and the
joke there goes sorry good yes there is
copper everywhere already exactly you
running laying down five but all the way
to your watch costs expedition of money
while historically dsl was the telephone
line connections that were late hundred
years ago and then cable started out as
TV that was late again decades ago so
now that we know what our options are in
wireless wireline broadband access where
do we go from here what kind of speeds
can we support on that we're getting
expensive
so do with the difference in prices like
per meter between copper and fiber under
single egg for new deployments like
moving neighborhoods coming up mm-hmm
what what is like are we still gonna be
like lining up copper or they're putting
in fiber actually that's a great
question and the answer lies that metal
as a copper is a valuable meadows so
actually the price the glass might be
cheaper it's it's deploying fiber as in
building the network is where the value
of the cost goes up part per meter I
think copper and copper will be costlier
the fiber is roughly the same cost in
your deployments I would make me prefer
which is like in developing countries
really is cheap extracting copper and
replacing it with fiber actually the net
gain because you can extract the copper
ash and sell it enjoy your regime and
neighbors cheap to make that switch okay
no but what you are roughly getting at
is at the end of the day someone has to
pay and why would you pay for gigabits
per second if you're only going to use
100 megabits per second so that that's
where the value ends up being so the
topology that has been supported is run
fiber all the way up to same MSR
building and then run copper all the way
up to your homes because that's an
existing infrastructure and all of you
don't want to pay hundred dollars per
month to get 100 gigabits per second to
your office maybe okay Victor your bill
is going off
to watch things sorry about the Bears
already I mean there's countries we have
already the cupola in late yeah and I
believe that's the majority of the
400-acre you see there is a good point
this is the statistics you're providing
principal okay so let's actually do some
technical work here oh so so we were
talking about 10 megabits per second is
what an average customer gets today
maybe five with yours you can actually
go up to 40 50 megabits per second but
I'm talking 100 megabits per second or
gigabits per second why is that not
possible today and how can we get there
so what this picture is showing so this
is your home network where you will have
a modem this is a copper line which will
run all the way to our dsl access node
and this dsl access know it was deployed
by a service provider and this is
connected to the core network
increasingly this dsl axis node might be
at your curb or close to your home and a
fiber might be deployed between service
providers central office and the axis
node sorry wrong way what's interesting
here is that these copper lines are
shared in the same they share the same
cable or binders so what this picture is
showing is that this is the wire that's
laid inside the network and these wires
are shared inside that same cable why is
that interesting it's interesting
because it introduces noises and
interference that but bring down the
speed so there are two major problems
that hampered performance in dsl
networks one is intermittent noises and
these noises come from in home devices
so this is the noise injected at the
home and the other is from copper
impairments you often have bridge taps
or other kind of impairments which
already exists because these networks
were laid down much earlier and you
don't necessarily know what exists out
there and then this is radio
interference from AM radio or other
radio bands that exist in the same
spectrum which is really want to 0 to 1
mega hot sauce itself a 32 kilohertz 28
my god
and this is the problem that I was
talking about where multiple copper
lines share the same binder so this will
be a binder and when they share the same
mind or they'll cross talking to each
other and crosstalk is similar to your
interference in wireless and imagine two
antennas placed white next to each other
and then leaking signals into it each
other that that's the kind of
interference we are talking about so how
can we handle this interference can we
do something smart about it so
traditionally the service providers only
configured this network so they built
this modem they had this line they will
provide you the modem you connect to it
and you get the speed so if they had
designed the modem for worst-case
scenario but now we can actually manage
it in the cloud and that's what I'm
going to talk about and this is where my
work comes in and my advisors were
coming and i'm going to emphasize what
my contributions are in this space so
that's what i call the dynamic spectrum
management approach so dynamic spectrum
management is really a more broader term
than just managing the spectrum and i'm
going to start with an overview of what
i mean by lining spectrum management in
the first part of the talk then i'm
going to focus on a specific problem
that exists in next-generation dsl's
call vector DSL technology which is an
exciting space and upcoming space and
then i'm going to talk about certain
extension to cable access networks that
we are working on right now and then
other research projects I've worked on
so this is going to be how I'm going to
structure my talk so let's start with
dynamic spectrum management so this was
the network that you're already familiar
with we're going to use a spectrum
management center the spectrum
management center is simply some device
in the cloud which is collecting data
from the core network about what kind of
performance is happening here so imagine
you have a server somewhere which is
collecting all this data this is very
similar to software-defined networks for
those of you are familiar with those and
what is really happening is that on a
data plane you're collecting the channel
and noise conditions while something
called SNMP interface and the kind of
things you collect our channel or noise
values data rates retrain error
rates are the few examples and then what
you want to configure is you one is
somehow re profile these lines or
basically configure the line so that as
a service provider you can make more
dough venue and give better network
performance to your subscribers and the
kind of things you will change and I'm
going to talk about this in detail is
power codes margin speeds and then use
some kind of sophisticated signal
processing in the next generation
technology so the point that I want you
to take away here is that these are
really software-defined access networks
if I may use their terms so instead of
software-defined networks we are really
using access networks and then somehow
configuring them in software instead of
using the worst case design where the
model was pre configured for a
worst-case scenario and being able to
use all this data and change the
algorithms on the fly and make the
entire network and active is where this
gets really interesting so what can we
do in the control plane so let's go back
to the fundamentals just Shannon
capacity formulation where this is what
we can get out of our Channel this is
the capacity that we can get this is the
bandwidth and then the capacity is lower
with me proportional to the signal and
noise ratio so what we can change is one
we can change the coding so we can
change the power levels we can change
the receiver structures and how we
detect whether we detect symbol by
symbol or sequences that's the physical
layer aspect we can change the number of
dimensions and this is another
interesting space we can increase the
bandwidth over which we are receiving
the signal we can use more antennas so
if I start detecting multiple copper
lines at the same time instead of
detecting a single line i'm using
spatial dimensions just like using
multiple antennas and wireless space and
then this is the noise aspect and this
is whatever we can't cancel so in the
control plane where somehow trying to
configure these values change this by
using signal processing and this noise
i'm going to basically get rid of it
will when I can so in the single user
what I'm showing here is this channel
actually varies with frequency so
usually we are used to single carrier
systems where the channel is pretty flat
in this case the channel attenuates with
frequency so what this is showing the
bottom curve bottom black curve is
showing is noise / channel gain or if
you may think of it as inverse of a
channel gain the optimum thing to do if
you have a bandwidth of W here is to
water fill and just to remind you what
water filling means is that when your
channel is better one our channel is
worst you want to fill more energy and
when your channel is worst or one our
channel gain is better you want to fill
less energy and the best distribution of
how you should load energy or power in
the space is up to a single water level
so that's the water filling solution and
this was proposed much earlier the way
you can view this is that you basically
chopping up your entire spectrum into
small spectra into small chunks and on
each you are using optimal energy to get
the capacity and you're basically adding
them together so that's the same channel
capacity formulation time scales are you
thinking for acting the system here for
packing a few seconds minutes you're
going to change or the scale of hours we
are configuring the network this is not
wireless yeah understand this so said
this noise okay so let me let me clarify
your question so as as a network service
provider i am going to configure at the
level of hours as a modem i am going to
adapt at the level of minutes 30 seconds
is the training period for a dsl modem
so what ends up happening is that if i
see a very large noise then i do not
want to adapt to it if i do not allow to
it i will have to retrain and my retrain
I mean I break the connection and then I
restart the connection so I would be
basically doing it at that level I
basically do not want to retrain if I
can maintain the connection
because retraining means that if you're
watching your football match the
football match will freeze right there
the connection will break and then it
will restart okay so so to clarify your
question I'm going to let me get to the
point that i'm going to make out of the
slide so the reason I was talking about
these multicolored systems is that each
modem can use this multicolored
transmission or this adaptive bit
loading to adapt to the noise that it
sees here so that's the first aspect we
had multiple cross talking users what
gets interesting here is that for a
single user you were simply water
filling on noise / channel gain when you
add a second user your noise now depends
on the interference that you see from
the second user so as a result you need
to pop need to fill power on top of this
interference now what we have found in
this and this is the solution that we
proposed was something called as
multi-level water filling where
basically you end up decomposing the
entire spectrum into multiple bands
wherein each band we are doing water
filling and the users emphasize one band
over another based on whether that's
good or bad for the network so that
basically ends up happening and I'm
going to explain this in much more
detail this is just an overview so to
collect the two points that I made all
users
using a dark frequency bank or your
secretary that's a great question so
when you say multi courier with adaptive
bit loading I can choose how much power
to put on each tone or sub this each
chunk so i can say that i want to use
the entire band but i can put power
differently on each turn yes and that is
that is this this is the configuration
technique that it's using which is
called water filling so i want to
somehow tell the modem what kind of
water filling to use how much power to
use to configure this what this
technique and actually when I show this
water filling this is actually the
simplest thing that they can do and for
those of you familiar with the aerials
called Levin campello it's a greedy
scheme to do bit loading and it's
already implemented in Morden's today
retraining is that is training the
process of setting these power level
sources yes yes but you can change
powers on the fly you can change bits on
the fly using something called a spit
swapping so training is basically when
I'm doing the training sequence to
detect when the channel and the noise is
set up your vision will hear this yes
yes exactly so the reason I used OFDM
with adaptive bit loading is because in
wireless systems OFDM is equal bit
loading at least traditionally but here
on each I can choose the number of bits
and they can go all the way from 2 to 15
bits that's how its configured and these
systems button here so why is this let
me complete this slide and then you'll
have less ok go ahead the last caller
who is on the adaptive bit loading
when we see most or more of this in the
wireless why don't we see more with this
answer because the most gains that you
get it out of wireless are really in the
coding space so if you use to bits
versus six bits you're not get going to
get as much pain as you get out of
putting a strong code on multiple terms
so they can do this and there are some
gains but the because the failing
happens the variation happens at such
time scales that putting strong codes or
putting a lot of redundancy is where you
get most gains in wireless systems
that's not how it was a certain business
how you what you're feeling horizontal
okay no did so really when you talk
about of this is not really fading
systems when I talk about problems here
this is in home interference or radio
interference which crops up once in a
while so we talked about all these
probabilities but we are really trying
to not get the modem to retrain too
often on the subscriber to complain it's
4.25 to hurt
yes so we are talking about so in the in
the largest the vdsl which is goes all
the way up till 17 megahertz you can
have all the way up to 4096 sub couriers
and in a DSL one today you can have a
DSS one had 128 and adsl2 plus at 256
subcarriers so we really have very large
values of n here so I don't want to run
some complex optimization scheme which
I'll get to so this is a slide which I
really like so let me take a moment here
so this is the network where which you
already had and this was connected to
the core network I already introduced
you to the spectrum management center
which is collecting the data and it's
going to control it at level 1 I can
choose the codes so I can control I can
control each line on a line by line
basis so I have the data for a single
line and I can choose how to provision
the coding scheme on that line how to
provision the rates on this line so that
I can get rid of these copper
impairments this in Home interference
and this radio interference and how I am
going to do that in short will be
somehow use a coding scheme and a
provisioning scheme that will make the
line stable don't run it faster than it
can support and why is that a challenge
that's a challenge because when you did
not have noise statistics you had no
idea what the line was doing so you were
just shooting an arrow in the dark and
isn't happening how many homes are you
thinking of hungry devices millions and
then you own the smc yes so so so the
algorithms that you via the algorithms
that I am proposing are more generous
and generalized in terms of actual
implementation mine this is happening at
my advisors start up so they are
actually working with millions of lines
decisions across these lands yes
absolutely so what do you do across
these labs is there optimization to be
done across different eastlands or this
is just a slap level opportunity so
depends on how much information you can
share chemie do that later because a lot
get through the slide I'll do that at
the end of the slide I promise yes you
can do it you have to get permissions up
data you can share technically there's
bad you could actually optimizing across
this is the I let me get through
the slide and I'll get you know that's
great I like questions that's great um
so Sony sm level two is really the idea
of what I was explaining in that
multi-level water filling we are
basically configuring the energy on
multiple lines to get rid of this
crosstalk now can I get rid of this
crosstalk not really what i can do is i
can manage the crosstalk i can say that
i'm going to load less power in certain
bands and hence introduce less
interference into others and then
vectoring is where we actually cancel
the crosstalk and nice using signal
processing and there is another
technique called bonding which you'll
see in news which is basically creating
more bandwidth by putting multiple lines
together so what you need to remember
out of this slide is that now with these
three levels increasing three increasing
levels of complexity you can actually
get a lot more bandwidth out of these
systems and in the next slide I'm going
to show how much more but just to give
the takeaway points we are really
shooting for higher speeds improved
stability because stability means that
you will not call AT&amp;amp;T to say hey my dsl
line is not working longer loops if i'm
a service provider i want to provide the
same rate for a longer length of loops
and then reduced costs because i don't
want to invest or upgrade my networks if
i can choose to do that so here this is
a graph which summarizes roughly the
kind of rates you can get so let's look
at what this is showing this is the dsl
loop length from customer premise so
this is your home up to the deployment
boundary which can be up till a
access node which as other service
provider and these are the data rates so
notice they are going from 0 to 1 50
megabits per second I haven't plotted
the gigabits per second which are
possible with DSM level 3 plus bonding
so let's focus on how we get towards
this direction so any kind of deploying
fiber to the curb I'm going to basically
move on the curve here so i am going to
increase the data rates very simple
principle you are reducing the distance
you're bringing down attenuation this is
the space where we are working this is
when we are using the data so from now
no dsm which is the blue curve at 500
meters when i go to dsm level one or two
i started at forty megabytes per second
I've gone all the way up to 55 to 60
megabytes per second at 37.5 percent
Cain and with DSM level three we have
gone all the way up to 125 megabits per
second and that's really two hundred
percent gain so this is really the
interesting space which most telcos are
entering now now I can get you a
question you can answer cooler what is
the Phantom bounty
bonding I'm not going to talk basically
you club multiple dsl lines together and
use a passive optical network kind of
architecture he's learning together and
still basically said yes I can talk
about it let me get to this question
real remember
so that's a great question this is real
this is starting to get deployed sodium
level 1 so I mean these results are from
simulations but this is already getting
commercialized and vectoring is
something that has been demonstrated in
labs so that's there are all simulations
but I'm just telling you that what has
been commercialized and what's not in
commercialized so we're getting here we
are going to get here but this is the
stuff that we are in right now and mate
ring um they are starting to move and
I'm going to show you what the space
looks like your question my purse was
like just around like what so so you
talk about bunch of like interference
and impairments I was just wondering
when you do optimizations across these
labs what is the value of that Thanks
the key value that I want to get a
service provider let's say I am AT&amp;amp;T and
you are another service provider and we
are competing we want to get the maximum
value out of her networks so we want to
basically provision maximum number of
subscribers at whatever rates they're
paying for right how do you do that you
basically want to bring down the
interference that these guys are
creating to me and I want to creating to
them so that's that's where the key
value noise other than that if there are
impairments I want to some hotel these
users to not blast power because the
coupling between multiple lines happens
really at the power level if I'm going
to blast power on my line it's a
cocktail party problem from these fans
they
no so oh ok so that I confuse to your
question so in a single de la so at any
time the lines that will interfere or
the ones which are in the same cable
they can terminate at different d slumps
belonging to different service providers
because these lamb is owned by a service
provider it is the box that I carry I am
AT&amp;amp;T are just getting I think giving
outrageous notion like the optimizations
are happening earlier Islam level or
you're actually there some optimization
that's happening I do you take like in a
wild time trading at each lap do you
take other these lambs you to count
enough I can I can statistically I can
what I'm getting us that is if I want to
do that as a spectrum management center
IE permissions from both in commercial
deployment you right did you say that
was can go to different dslam yes and
that's why you do too so basically let
me have a nice enough information in
some sense right I have information that
is not very common because in u.s. you
don't have unbundling but in UK you have
unbundling so in a single cable I can
these lines to multiple service
providers and then each one can take
their box and say this is what I'm doing
with it and we can actually you'll see
some of it so yes every line can have
different pieces of information and
that's where the big fights happen in
standards where hey this is guys going
to blast its power why should I not be
allowed to blast
so any other questions at this point
because this was my overview of dsm and
i'm going to now emphasize one
particular problem now okay so I'm going
to huh I can also use a synonymous
ossining what is offended oh so what is
happening in a phantom bonding is you
basically take multiple lines and you're
delivering data to your users right ok
so you somehow want to use these two
lines together to deliver data in time
so you basically use a different
architecture level three is like in
fierce alignment yes yes yes yes yes yes
they I mean basically it will cancel out
exactly just so the morning is really
happening at higher there we're
basically you're putting packets
together from multiple Oh think so it's
like so I think that simplest way to
explain that is okay just imagine that I
have to Wi-Fi modems you and your
neighbor and they decide to cooperate
then i'm going to send packets to both
the Wi-Fi modems and then i can stream
the packets to you so they're basically
happening at packet level you need the
two boilers to communicate between them
yes you need some some source some way
to somehow yes so you need to basically
see there's a back channel exactly
exactly malice is starting to happen
yeah there are come their startups
looking at basically they're putting
packet by pocket information together
because there are a lot of open Wi-Fi so
they're trying to look at that again
what is not clear is how much value you
can get out of here in Rio systems where
wifis are not open yet so that's that's
that's a space which people are starting
to enter and the gains have been
demonstrated in simulations any other
questions at this point
okay so so at dsm level one basically my
work has been on developing a tiered
rate adaptation approach and showing
using noise statistics to improve
stability and what I in terms of impact
I really took it to UK Nick standards
that's the telecommunication body there
and it's now commercialized so I
actually participate in the
standardization process and talk to a
lot of companies in that space I did
some level to be proposed so there
existed optimization algorithms for
those of you familiar with the space we
came up with the practical approximation
called as multi-level water filling that
is robust to changes that happen in
noise levels so coming back to g2's
questions when noises change at levels
of seconds now actually you can bid swap
instead of imposing certain conditions
I'm really sorry very sick but he's
watching so here I let the
standardization and in us a test which
is American telecommunication standards
called coastline group and then you can
Nick group and then DSN level 3 for
practical deployments of vectoring we
proposed noble dsm algorithms and here
the theoretical bounds were also not
understood so that was also something we
were we have derived so this is where we
are going to spend the rest of the talk
barring the last part so this is the
exciting part next so what is the
difference between legacy systems and
vector dsl's so looking back this is a
cartoon of modem to be slam port 1 this
is the line curve and this is modem 22
port to what we were doing in earlier d
slams was that i was decoding the signal
i had a thing of user level so in an
information-theoretic sense this is
interference channel and the speeds i
was getting was between 1 to 25 megabits
per second of course depending on the
length of the line with vector dsl's
I'm really using a common receiver so
instead of decoding signal at each port
I now have some mechanism to decode
signals together so you're using
sophisticated signal processing and the
information here at exams this is really
looking like a multiple access channel
and you can start with speeds of multi
hundred megabytes per second and in
wireless domains this is really like
putting two antennas together and then
at the upstream direction you are
decoding both the signals together let
me talk about your only to the awkward
no this also for the downlink I'm going
to focus on upstream because that's
where I have most of my simulation
results but down like it also works and
there are very interesting results their
jobs right because you can you can do
precoding okay yes so you're not
decoding by your pre-cooling there are
certain limitations that but I we can
talk about it so this is a nice light
that i wanted to show as to why why is
vectoring exciting why are we excited
about it now so notice that the dates
here are all late 2012 so lot of tacos
at this point are starting to move
towards vectoring because they see that
out of legacy networks they can squeeze
a lot of speed now so a KND has
announced a floating billion investment
into project VIP which was in november
and and they're moving it in two
different cities and you here google
fiber all the time but he and he is
getting into the space big time and
trying to get the maximum out of their
networks jewish telecom which was in
Europe has committed to the fiber to the
curb and victory and they are
increasingly upgrading their lines
something like 25 million lines are
being upgraded and then Huawei which is
really the dslam manufacturer is also
spending a lot of energy into moving
towards vectoring so just to give you an
idea of just picked some news pieces to
say that at this point in time a lot of
companies are excited and putting a lot
of money into the space to actually see
how much they can get in real networks
okay so what are the problems they would
face when they go and actually deploy us
in real networks and this is where
things get really interesting so here
this was my deal on this
is mine earlier dslam here i was doing
single line a single user by user
decoding and here i have upgraded my
lines and I basically put a common
receiver to decode signals when I'm
deploying ah can i upgrade 50 to 200
lines in one go that never really
happens AT&amp;amp;T doesn't decide that I'm
going to upgrade 200 lines at 2am at
night that never happens so incremental
upgrade of subscribers just to make this
deployment possible it's important that
i should be able to incrementally
upgrade the number of lines that are
vector in unbundling you will often
share lines between legacy and the
snakes generation because different
service providers move to different
technologies at different points in time
and in UK you have these different
service providers which leased lines out
of the same binder and then the most
important point is that in terms of a
service provider I I will only upgrade
my lines if I have the economic
incentives so if I have a cable or a
binder which consists of multiple lines
the maximum gains I get or when the
lines are really short so those are the
lines which I'm going to upgrade so you
might be limited in signal processing or
economic incentive so when I basically
you need to get that when I go and
deploy vector dsl's they'll often exist
with the legacy dsl's I want to get
maximum value out of what I'm upgrading
at the same time keeping the customers
that i already have happy and why is
that a challenge so the data rate gains
can be very limited if I use the
existing state-of-the-art solutions
based on what I already know so we
understand interference channel we know
how to handle this we know how to handle
for example multiple access channel in
information theory and when I maximize
the data rates of these two systems
independently because I just upgraded my
DSLAM here but I have no way to know
what I should do to configure powers
here I'm going to have this cross
daughter is happening from these vector
systems into non vectored systems and
non vector systems interactive systems
and both of them can take away the gains
that I get out of my vectoring
technology the new technology that I
just upgraded i'm going to call this
mixed binary iterative what
filling and I'm we can go into details
later but the inclusion here is based on
the multi-level water filling solution
that I was already doing they are only
aware of the interference that they see
and these people have no idea what is
going in the rest of the network they're
just cancelling interference that
they're seeing so it's the interdomain
interference which becomes the challenge
can we come up with solutions which are
practical enough to take that into
account although it's not hungry it's
not their prey in fact one of the very
interesting papers that recently came
out are from telcos was that often you
only want to upgrade parts of your
system so you want to put a dslam in
another dslam with limited signal
processing so tiers of your system so
they basically want to do partial
vectoring is what I'm getting at so it
looks temporary because i'm talking
about incremental upgrade but often they
want to do partial vectoring because
these are business decisions which are
made by companies so if i have 50
million subscribers and fifty two
hundred lines i only vector what ten
lines if that's where the most value
lies because vectoring subscribers are
also supposed to pay more if I'm going
to get hundred megabytes per second I'm
going to pay more for it as opposed to
10 megabits per second so I'm only going
to upgrade what I have the economic
incentive for any other questions
so this is a flavor of what exists out
there today and why that's a problem and
I'm using a very simple example so here
we have two lines which are vectored and
one line which is non vectored these two
lines are using other 300 meters long
and this is 1200 meters long and this is
showing the crosstalk that is happening
between the two users what this thought
is going to show you is the data rate
that we are getting on these vectored
lines which are of the order of hundreds
of megabytes per second and the data
rate that we are getting on non vectored
lines which are of the order of six
megabits or 10 megabits per second so
what we observe here is that as we
upgrade this line to hundreds of
megabytes per second on the legacy line
we have lost the data rate it's one
third of what what existed out there
which I'm sure if your neighbor upgraded
you'll not be happy with and then so or
the other way to look at it is that to
meant if I wanted to upgrade my
technology and maintain 6 megabytes per
second here then I'm not really getting
any gains out of the new technology so
that that's not fun as a service
provider and the real problem here is
that you are not able to reduce the
crosstalk in the mixed binary scenarios
now that's an easy thing to say but we
don't even know the theoretical optum
the theoretically optimum solutions in
this space so sure oh yes why should we
believe yours why should we believe my
simulations because be review aren't we
hair builder no for an eye transplant
that's right so you
and so you're presenting to us alarm
results with a lot of submission the
name I'm actually very appreciative a
nice-looking I think that's great but
what is industry but I also throw in the
Santa scale maybe is not possible to
implement but how do you go about
convincing folks that invest in this
technology is what I've done is actually
you give us some background what's our
simulations you're doing and how what
happens are using so the tools are using
our actual channel data so often we take
the data from actual channels or the
morals of the channels and then we are
simulating based on the techniques that
we are seeing at the transmitter and
receiver signal processing side so in
that sense they're completely believable
but of course in real environments you
see a lot more impairments and to
counter that question I mean of course
no one will invest in this so I don't
want to say this on video by the point
is that this is actually being deployed
on the other side of the network yeah it
is being tried out so we are developing
a theoretical tools on on Stanford end
and then this is being tried out on the
other end bkt Channel 8 News it's
exhaustion then an important question
like
is a final obviously different
interference you seem surprised me okay
for the household climbs radio okay at
this point in my life yes so so the best
way to answer that question is the
reason why we have these three different
levels of dsm so the first level of dsm
is really handling this interference by
talking about what kind of things go up
and down the crosstalk is a persistent
problem so here you are trying to cancel
it so the timeline issue is really
handled to maintain stability yeah and
then the crosstalk issue is really to
get rid of their interference for the
cross of channels yes I mean in reality
yeah I'll stable that crosstalk channel
is so our opening Wireless interference
arrival yes crime in Beijing me you need
to measure this okay i guess my question
very simply how often do you turn on
your dsl modem or turn it off if it's
turned on and I mean basically if it's
staying on yeah it's a cross top matrix
relatively stable because I mean yes
okay Julie can have a license for them
for the wind blows I mean mean yes it's
not just on it's also how much when
you're using it with deliver traffic
drinks should shut that that's exactly
the question where that should be the
next level of dsm where they should
actually turn it off when it's not being
used as being looking well this is the
pain is the road works already okay now
okay yes I like wow that's a great
question that's where people always get
to you like yeah they should turn it off
I mean there is a low power mode but no
companies out there actually use it so
far they're trying to get there because
energy consumption is becoming important
so that that's that's really the next
dimension but right now we're talking
speeds and not energy does that's like
okay let's let's cross drive doesn't
ring all the things that I'm saying
these are adaptive receivers so they are
basically going to run with an adaptive
loop which is your LMS filter and
they're just going to adapt to that
matrix now if things change as a scale
of wireless the gains will start going
away but as long as they don't change at
that level you are still in good shape
now why should we believe it so I mean
there was a demo that the startup that
i'm talking about it actually showed
this is working stuff now so my job was
to take it to standards it's like
convince people that this is a viable
solution
the stuff that's in the standards is
favored stuff right yes it's that friend
yes that's great so ah and the key idea
we are using in all these basically not
to load more power than is necessary at
any given time so we are at 40 minutes
right now and I wanted to cover two
approaches one was the optimization
based framework where we are actually
developing a theoretical solutions and
then the heuristics based approach as to
why the practical approximations make
sense so I want to get some sense of
time as to 20 minutes ok ok so in the
optimization based framework I am just
going to give you a heuristic
perspective and not going to every
single detail but I think most of you
will get because I showed pictures
earlier so we already talked about this
is an adaptive bit loading system so
there is power on each tone then there
is a data rate associated with each
vectored user and there is a data rate
associated with each non vector user so
one of the simplest formulations of
modeling the problem is to come up with
a weighted sum rate maximization with
gin would be very familiar with but what
we are really doing is we are trading
off the rate that we can successfully
decode at non waked lines versus
vectored lines so there is a trade-off
as I increase the rate of the vectored
lines i am going to not be able to
decode more rate for non vectored line
so there's this boundary which is we
call achievable rate region which we can
get by using a very some rate
maximization formulation and how do we
move on different points in this
boundary we are going to put different
weight vector for the rates that go to
lon vay grid lines and the vectored
lines so this is the mathematical
formulation and let me parse this for
you what we are really doing is we are
maximizing the sum the weighted sum of
rates or vectored lines so this is the
rate of vectored lines and the weighted
sum of non vectored lines with respect
to two constraints and very simple
constraints one is
coming from total power on all tones so
my modem cannot transmit more than
certain amount of power and this is a
PSD mask constraint which is basically
saying that on every tone FCC limits how
much power i can put so what can i get
out of these so my optimization variable
here will be power now why am i
interested in this problem and what am I
really doing so what we understood was
this part of the problem was understood
alone this part of the problem was
understood alone putting the
optimization were these two together and
then coming up with tactical
approximation is really where things get
interesting so yes this formulation I
notice you're maximize the total
weighted basically value up there right
you can you get a little bothered with
you can do this we can talk about
regularly but are here what what means
yeah yeah I know violation I mean other
utility value of the great yes they're
not even be near exactly right i mean
why try different verses 10 megabits
exactly 10 times yeah you can talk about
regularly but I just chose to show the
simple formulation you can easily put a
function of rate up there but as you
know that when you put utility then
water filling is no longer the optimal
solution anymore right thinking we are
with utility probably make more sense no
one is happening is that all these
weights so when you put for example our
log utilities and even in our wireless
systems it ends up being this weighted
utility in the smaller time seconds
because you just change the weights but
that's all that is happening you
basically have one over R Bar right and
and here rates are not changing as much
so did I make sense okay yeah okay so we
are going to use some tools from convex
optimization theory to answer this
question to solve this problem so the
primal problem if you look at just this
problem and I'm i probably will not have
enough time to convince you that this is
not convex so we'll take that offline
i am going to solve the dual problem
because the problem is coupled on all
tones and what all i am doing is
simplifying the problem and then i am
going to use a tool called dual
decomposition and then solve problem on
each stone and come back and solve this
problem basically solve the optimized
the power constraint aspect and what I'm
going to what we use is a result from
optimization theory where when the
number of tones are large enough solving
the dual problem is a good enough
approximation for solving the primal
problem so here is the overview and will
not go through all the details but this
is the dual problem that we are solving
and then this is the total sub problem
so the vedas formulation works is that I
start here solve the problem on each
tone and then go back here and solve the
problem to satisfy the power constraints
so these lagrange multipliers get
configured there okay so let's see how
much we want to explain yes yes so what
what package are using to use the choice
of so great
what's the software package in use
oh I implemented by hand oh yeah I yea
my delight mr. Bolton because there is
an inner loop hear the tonal sub problem
too there's an inner loop you can use
the sub gradient or ellipsoid there's
only a single problem right there's an
inner voice okay so you have to be able
to solve the inner problem and then the
out a problem right if this was the only
problem that you were solving then that
was great so if this problem were
directly convex then that all sounds
great and i'm going to show you can come
up with the successive convex
approximation but just to check the
convergence properties i did not use
them you can I I just wanted to make
sure that things are converging and
everything else so I've implemented most
of the step by myself it's not that hard
so um the only two things that I'm going
to do in a few minutes is that I'm going
to convince you that the non vectored
users all they were doing was they had
this signal to interference noise ratios
right on which their data rate dependent
so your data rate on any chunk or sub
career depended only on the signal to
interference noise ratios for the
vectored users we are using some
interesting sophisticated signal
processing something called as i am a
messy or minimum mean square decision
feedback equalizer it is implementing
successive decoding from information
theory but what is really happening is
that if I am the first user to be
decoded I see all the noise and if I'm
the last user to be decoded I see the
least amount of noise because all the
others users crosstalk is no longer seen
in my case and that's how it translates
into my formulas that I used for data
rates so there is a notion of who gets
decoded first and who gets decoded lost
and I'm going to just skip this block
because the key intuition is just how
things are getting decoded so the signal
to interference noise ratio based our is
based on it directly proportional to
your old transmit power
we're in terms of the powers of other
users it really depends only on the
users which are not decoded yet and for
the non vectored users it depends on
this nice whitening matrix which shows
up in this nice whitening filter so two
things to note here one you're only
seeing indifference from users which are
not decoding it and then this noise
whitening filter is actually able to
correlate the noise from all the non
vectored users and get rid of it so that
makes things very interesting and so
coming back to your original problem
when I take these expressions and want
to solve for my power spectrum on each
tone I have two options one is either I
can go for an exhaustive search of
powers because I know the PSD mask
limits or I can go for a successive
convex approximation approach but both
of them by now looking at the problem
are very complex that they cannot be
implemented on a 50 to 200 lines binder
how many levels bits we are talking
about this yeah so because this is a
discrete knowing until the pounding
whatever you have it is it very discreet
discreet with learning now you can load
bits between 0 and 15 15 15 because
that's how they they were going for
binary yeah one each tone I can load
fifteen goods but at most modems will
not have loaded 15 on all terms because
power constrain would have already been
exceeded by then so um okay so what I'm
showing now is how much you can get out
of this theoretical optimum because
that's where the interesting space lives
so red curve was already what you are
familiar with in this simulation
scenario to users and the third non
vectored line these were two vectored
lines the x-axis were the data rate of
vectored users and the y-axis was the
data rate of non vectored users with the
black line what i am able to see you is
that if i choose 100 megabits per second
for
vectored users I am getting back my six
megabits per second for the non vectored
line that's almost one seventy percent
gain or other way to interpreter is that
I'm keeping my existing customer at what
it was alternatively if I chose to keep
it at six megabits per second I'm
actually getting the gain of the new
technology all the way through so this
is really great because now you can
actually get the gains of upgrading Lee
systems and I'm showing you these three
lines simple examples because I wanted
to explain the practical approximation
but we have tested this for 25 line or
50 line simulations also and why does
this work this is where things actually
we can get to practical approximations
so we're really using the channel
structure to our advantage here notice
that these are short lines and these are
long lines long lines means more
attenuation so the curlers actually
correspond to what are the colors here
we are showing channel magnitude versus
frequency all the way up to 30 megahertz
this is short lines channel game this is
long lines channel games so this is more
at higher frequencies this is the
interesting part this is the crosstalk
from short user to the long user notice
that it is greater than the direct
channel gain of the long user so only in
this space you can actually get any
useful transmission while for the
crosstalk channel from long to short
lines it's way below situation or is it
your channels the channels you can in
the real channels it will just be a
distribution over what I'm showing
so the crosstalk from short vector lines
can dominate be long non vectored lines
so there is value to actually doing the
spectrum optimization just by looking at
the channel structure now what is
happening and mixer edited willing which
was the state-of-the-art solution versus
mix OSP so this is the power spectrum at
the point where there was 100 megabits
per second on the vectored line the non
weighted line with the state of the art
was getting 2 megabits per second and
the law makes osb thats thought term
solution was getting six megabits per
second notice here you had three bands
the red and blue curves correspond to
the two erected lines and the black
curve corresponds to the non vectored
line when these two overlap you are
interfering with each other when you're
interfering with each other basically
the non-elected line is seeing a lot of
power from these weighted lines and it
just backs off and does not load power
in these frequencies on the other hand
in this window we see that the it's
almost gone to orthogonal transmissions
but it's not seeing power from these
vectored lines it's not seeing as much
interference so it is able to load power
so effectively you've just exploited the
channel structure and figured out which
bands to prefer versus which bands do
not prefer so that whole idea of
multi-level water filling starts to
emerge again and this is where we are
again going to use the concept of
multi-level water filling except that we
are going to generalize it to this mixed
binary scenarios and there is a
difference because i'm going to water
fill on equivalent channel games for my
short vectored line so these are not the
same channel games this 1 over snr is
now discover that whole box that i had
four successive decoding so i start with
this water filling distribution online
equivalent channel gains and then if I
am the short vectored user I would be
given some indication that this band is
preferred and this part is not preferred
and there is a way to do that with the
existing standard and then I move bits
out of mine non-preferred band to my
preferred band and I only stopped and I
hit the PSD mask so
you basically specify which bands are
preferred verses which are not preferred
so this is a variation of what's an
existing water filling solution and the
waving indicate whether we are using
multi-level water filling versus
single-level water filling is using
another parameter that exists in the
standard called target Marge universes
are Max Martin ok this work in something
for the circulated in China doing in
white spaces wishes he had the
situation's of networks which are of
different lengths ok there are that
you're trying to work so we know the
longer than network I think it's
sabotage by the shorter length yeah this
is the same near for oblem yes it's a
very serious problem and almost as big a
problem too they can break down this
whole space if not so because you did
you lose the advantage of a long-range
network if you're always being sabotaged
by the short short reached our only
excited know what this realm out there
but I think I'm happy to talk more but I
think the questions time variation at
which things happen would be yeah so the
questions in a little grassing there you
need to have much finer grained control
and so happy the dark algorithms and map
so quickly
okay Trish happy your dog further on
that and these kind of frequencies they
are actually determined using a search
algorithm a bisection search algorithm
at the SMC so let me first go through
the gains and then we'll go through the
implementation why this is simple and
practical to implement so we had seen
the black curve earlier and we had seen
the red curve earlier so the red curve
was the state-of-the-art solution and
the black curve was the theoretical
optimum for the same scenario to
vectored lines 300 meters and one non
vectored line 1200 meters the green and
the blue curves now or what we get out
of this practical approximation so the
green curve is obtained when we have
optimized our cutoff frequencies of ian
we have optimized which band to prefer
and a blue curve is when we have chosen
just a knife assumption for whatever
bands to prefer in both cases you see
that when I provision my vectored line
and hundred megabytes per second you're
getting as much as 161 percent game with
this new algorithm which is very simple
I know I 6 megabytes per second you are
basically actually getting some gain out
of upgrading to new technology now
implementation because that that's what
I was pitching earlier so the spectrum
management center has to somehow convey
these cutoff frequencies to be modem and
it has to tell them that this is a
multi-level water filling solution the
way it conveys the cutoff frequencies is
by using the PST mask and depressing is
slightly and different bands so this is
how we got through the standards bodies
but that's that's the only parameter
it's conveying to the modems then the
modems do their water filling and then
change the water filling distribution
just like I described but the fun thing
here is that they can adapt so if they
see higher noise in their higher
frequencies and they can water fill back
to the lower frequencies instead of
coming up with a centralized solution
which says okay this power spectra and
this is an actual problem in UK networks
they were like we want to impose this
power spectra on anything that's slower
than this length so like that's not a
robust solution okay so the two
important points here are that now you
have a very low complexity solution as
far as the modems go you don't have to
change anything there and sania
distributed the reason I say near
distributed is because you do have to
give some information to the modems
based on statistics you collect but not
a lot of information and the modems are
able to adapt now this slide was
basically meant to convey mathematically
some of the complexity so you had mixed
iterative water filling which was
suboptimal but very simple and let me
parse the parameters for one second ah
so n is the number of frequency tones
that can go all the way to 4096 k is the
number of lines and k1 is the number of
vectored lines this can be of the order
25 to 50 so the big term here is n log n
in terms of the number of frequencies so
makes it real world filling was very
simple mix osb which is theoretically
optimum is exponential in the number of
users and then linear in the number of
tones where we get most of the gains are
by changing this term to this but I
already explained the inclusion of why
this was really simple to implement and
we basically got it through steroids so
this is what a summary slide of what the
work that I have done and proposing
these energy or how do you control the
power levels in next generation dear
cells and I basically led the
standardization of this to the coast my
report which got published last year I
was actually uh so I and I the kind of
data rate gains we have gotten are in
the range of fifty to one sixty percent
okay so this was a research summary so
far of what we have done in the space of
dsl's and next-generation dsl's we are
exploring some of these ideas also
extend to coaxial cable networks and I
was hoping to spend five minutes on that
and that would be the end of my talk is
that good okay or if people want me to
stop here I'll just give a research
summary and we can do this in question
and answer session to your Co okay so
coach o cables esta
other medium that we talked about for
wireline access this is really a
waveguide so historically this was
deployed because Stevie networks were
deployed and it is heavenly deployed in
North America but if you look at
everywhere else the penetration of dsl's
is higher but what's interesting is that
you're basically going to send signal
between the center conductor and the
outer shield so this is really a
waveguide also the same where cable
networks are going now is that they have
these head and distributions and then
this draught cables going all the way up
to each home so you have the signal
starting here and then going all the way
here so this is your cable network NS
will be shared between multiple homes so
if you have a cable provider telling you
that I provide gigabits per second
speeds it will be shared with all your
neighbors and how many neighbors it can
just be shared with it can be all the
way up till 500 to 2,000 so what's
interesting in this space is that they
are increasingly moving towards
something called as hybrid fiber coaxial
system because they want to bring down
this 50 to 500 2,000 250 to 200 just
like dsl's they are basically trying to
move fiber closer to you so that the
coaxial cable is smaller length and the
rates are higher so they can get higher
data rates for a smaller number of users
and currently it's lying in the range of
38 megabits per second downstream and 27
megabits per second upstream this was
docsis one point X but they're going all
the way to 10 to 2 megabits 10 22
gigabits per second with docsis 3.1
which is something that you might have
read in news because that's an
up-and-coming standard for cable
networks now what is interesting here is
that they are doing they're moving in
two directions one they are going for
multi-core systems with better coding
and they're expanding the spectrum that
they can operate in so as TVs vacated
that analog space not only white spaces
became hot but cable networks are also
doing work to use this for dia so
existing plants for example they had
this 42 megahertz that they were using
now they are trying to decide between
mid split high split and tops but which
basically are different configurations
of spectrum but what is interesting is
that they right now are operating in the
Spade of 100 megabits to 300 megabits
per second and they basically want to
get here so which one they decide
depends on certain logistics of what
amplifiers to replace and what to do
where we are active here is but
basically this is a shared system in
time dimension what we are exploring is
whether you can get more out of doing
multi-user techniques can you
superimpose signals and do better and
that gets really interesting because now
you can share things between multiple
users and given that now it's becoming a
multi career system you can do this on
different bands and they have fairly
flat bands with attenuation changes for
different bands but it's not a lot of
variation and adjacent frequencies so
the key point to take away here is
that's an interesting space which is
moving towards gigabits per second but
more is probably possible by using
certain interesting techniques and we
are looking at how we can use the shared
medium better by using other dimensions
so this is an ongoing project and I
cannot stay more so this was my work in
a coaxial cable how it works and then I
have also done some work in multi-cell
wireless networks on similar ideas of
limited basically using these mixtures
of interference and multiple access
Channel and I can talk more about it
that have I had one project in home
power line communications for those who
are interested where I was using the
cyclo station already in power lines to
propose an abortionist ixia semi
protocol and I was a fun project to
learn all about power lines and csme at
the same time and this was the work I
did at Microsoft Research with
technology policy group and this was
basically to investigate how much
opportunity is there for unlicensed
secondary usage in 30 megahertz 26 video
expect I'm using the data from
microphone spectrum Observatory a
technology policy group and this
certainly tells me is gone into an NPR
to reply for an NPRM so
let's that impact and that's the summary
of the various research projects that
I've looked at that would be the end of
my talk a lot of work with vector psal
yes um I assume you also basically
basically try to work on while asleep
apparently yes yes yes yeah yes I have
papers and multi son violence how do you
compare these two secs wireless
appearance versus be ourselves Paul
what's what's similar what's different
can you can you kind of elaborate your
question and you are you trying to get
an idea of what the literature looks
like or what they say first like facing
in the two channels okay how to work out
the similarity and difference between
this two space the Chandler
characteristics I mean stability in
estimation of crosstalk matrix okay I
mean no I think so you're asking a very
interesting question and I think as you
probably know whenever you're comparing
wireless versus wireline wild line tends
to be more stationary channel compared
to wireless where things are changing at
much faster rate as a result whatever
channel estimation you are doing here
things are not accurate i'm not going to
say they're a great but here by the time
you get any information you're not going
to be able to use it right
work how can be why that's like yes no a
wild side I've seen me I'm a true I see
measurements on dsl's not on virus
nonviolent respect I've only seen
channel model tomorrow's apotheosis is
basically internal practically he is
right yeah channel carry so they're
practical implementations for multi-cell
work are happening at algorithm using I
talked to those folks but I haven't seen
the measurements myself yeah I'm not an
expert in that area I just was taking
all my work and seeing if it applies and
what kind of gains are possible in
simulations but this basically until the
last word we talked about basically of
energy basically allocation mm-hmm it
possible basically two basic projectors
0 vector come to those are licensed I
was thinking about that so you're
thinking in terms of interference
alignment one of the key requirements of
interference alignment is that the
number of dimensions has to be large
you're right in this case we are
transmitting on all the dimensions that
we are actually using so we have three
dimensions they're using all three if I
had one extra wire which which is
possible because if you so this is
differential so you have a twisted pair
so you are using the difference of the
two signals on the two lines if you
basically make it common common
vectoring then what you use the binder
as the reference point and use all the
other wires from there then you have
this additional antenna and then you can
start talking about the kind of things
you are talking but here if you use all
the transmit dimensions then you're not
going to be able to do it and then you
have to meet all those constraints of
the papers that came out as to whether i
can actually use those transfer
dimensions or not
you work on vector and on vector da
sauce because it was taken all the way
to stands so so it was really end to end
work in terms of impart thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
