very happy for a in the final speaker of
today Roberto Oliveira from impa Brazil
who will tell us unbounding the time for
mixing of simple symmetric exclusion in
terms of a one particle mixing time well
I'd like to thank you all for being here
those who remain at least and and of
course i'd like to thank both the
organizers of this workshop for the
invitation and also the group of
microsoft research in general for I've
right I'm right in the middle of a
four-week visit and like Fabio having a
good time here and well thanks a lot so
today we're going to be talking about
well this symmetrical extrusion process
so let me start with something simpler
which we all know what it is well when
you have a graph like this and then
they're always going to be the number of
vertices let me say this from the outset
you can define Rena walk on this graph
and today I want to talk about
continuous Iran walk what that means is
that why you have a particle somewhere
on your graph and each edge has its own
clock maybe the clocks have different
rates but for the time being you want to
think of all rates as being one and then
when say this clock rings if the
particle is what on one end point it
moves to the other end point what with
this clock rings nothing happens because
the particles over here but then if this
one rings the particle moves again and
while it keeps going right so this is
simple random walk well simple
continuous-time friend walk that is and
what I'm going to be talking about is a
version of this with several particles
they're indistinguishable particles and
so this is the while what I'm going to
tell you now is it a three particle
symmetric exclusion process well
symmetry symmetric means that what
already said about random walk that its
rate of crossing this edge doesn't
depend on
which end point your end right it goes
in this direction often as it goes to
this direction and now the update rule
is when an edge rings you flip the
states of its two end points so if rings
here nothing happens if it rings here X
moves here if it rings here nothing
happens because there's no particle and
logos are like this right and well I'm
not gonna give the formal definition
right now we'll talk about this later
but i hope the idea is clear I mean all
you should be able to write the genera
if you so wish at this point but right
so what the kind of question you're
interested in is well as you've all
mentions about mixing x x is actually
part of the title so it's really obvious
right so when you have any markov chain
in this case we want to talk about
continuous-time markov chains you can
define this parameter the mixing time
well assuming the state space is finite
and the chain is irreducible so we know
that there is a unique stationary
measure
and the mixing time is the smallest t
for which the transition probabilities
from any point in your state space into
any subset of the state space while
they're close to their limiting value
and more absolute close i should say
right so the state space for the random
walk is just a vertex set of the graph
the stationary distribution this case is
uniform because of the transition rate
to symmetric for the exclusion process
the state space is subsets of size one
this case size three of vertex set right
and well in general going to be talking
about this process here which I'm going
to call exclusion k g which is a que
particle exclusion
and and we want to know what the mixing
time of this is in terms of the mixing
time of one particle and now the theorem
is that uh I can it's actually free
pretty simple to write down and maybe
well let me just move it over here so
that stays in place as i continue to
write it's this so well the mixing time
when it's a bit says a bit more than
what I'm going to state here but the
mixing time of exclusion k g well and
then you have to choose the epsilon just
choose epsilon equal to a quarter which
is like the standard choice this is less
than a constant and the constant by
constantly means something Universal
times log of N and mean number vertices
times the mixing time of one random walk
so r WF g is just a single and a walk so
the theorem is telling you this so that
essentially well if you compare the
ratio right of this mixing time to the
exclusion to the mixing time exclusion
process that's at most log in up to a
constant factor and well I mean that
there should be a reason for why that's
interesting some sense right so let me
for the time being and not going to say
anything about the proof i'm going to
say a few things about the question that
motivated this this work for any k 4 so
the constant doesn't depend on k so for
any k well between one and n well n with
n particles the process doesn't move so
it doesn't say much could be n over 2
yeah so this is independent of g or n k
it's universal right
and now I mean that there is a at least
my mind there's one main motivation for
this for this work which is this if you
if you look at these X's have the
particles there's an alternative
description of this process which is as
follows each one of the axis is doing an
independent random walk following that
continuous time prove they're described
except that when this protocol tries to
jump over here it's blocked so you have
this exclusion rule that forbids two
particles on the same vertex right so
it's it's a system of random walks that
but kind of constrained in a certain
sense right they cannot jump onto each
other and so and then you can ask
yourself how similar this is to a
process of independent random walk so
okay there are obvious differences right
for instance you're never going to have
two particles on the same vertex and on
the other hand there are similar
processes at least from kind of for a
high level perspective perhaps so I the
it seems natural to ask if you can say
anything in general about relationship
between the two mixing time it's a one
way to ask me of whether the way
exclusion converges to colibri and
somehow similar related to the way the
one single r in the walkers equilibrium
so right now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to prove the theorem starting from
an assumption or a conjecture or
whatever that's well far from being
proven and I think very hard to prove
and this is the conjecture well okay
it's a it it's good think of this a
heuristic but I'm willing to bet that
something like this is true
ah
and maybe have to explain what this
means well so I'm going to use the
symbol here r WK g 4k independent random
walks so and well one quarter here as
well and maybe you want to put a
constant here so what I'm saying is this
that k particles doing exclusion
shouldn't take more much more to mix
then k particles doing independent
random walks and well this might seem a
bit weird in some sense because you know
exclusion has obstacles and subject one
parkil blocks the other but uh well
because of the symmetry we have many
properties that sort of suggested it's
true it i mean i'll even give a stronger
form of this later but i mean at least
if you believe me by now you have this
and this of course I mean this is fine
yes just we love them again if you can
say tell us something about the proof of
the theorem without short that
assumption yes but let me just say let
me just say that if you have this more
since I got started I'm gonna finish
this and then I'll jump to the proof
enemy and not so if you have this then
you can prove this well with a different
constant perhaps and this is less than
and this by a general fact this well
this is not hard to prove that I mean 4k
random walks to move to to achieve this
reporter two equilibria you have this as
one over 4k for 11 walks enough and then
you can get this inequality as also
comes from general theory of markov
change and this is essentially the same
result that i have over there except for
having an end here so in some cases we
know that you can get this with the k so
for instance for walks on the cycle are
on discrete Taurus and then you
dimension we can get this with the K I
can only get it with an end right but it
that's a wake up it comes on the proof
so I mean I in terms of applications i'm
at that you know they're there are many
previous mountains about a symmetric
exclusion maybe what I should say is
that this matches or improved upon all
previous balance except in this specific
case that i just mentioned which is when
you have a discrete tours and you have k
particles you can get locked case set up
login but uh well following your valves
requests i'm going to try to move as
quickly as possible to the proof and
okay so there's kind of a very rough
outline of the proof is that you first
consider mixing for two labeled
particles and what i mean by this is
well you look at this exclusion process
over here and with two particles but you
give them names so let's see
a and B right and you have the same roof
so when you have an edge update you flip
the label ok and then well so this is
the first step and well I'll say
something about it it's not too hard to
understand but then you need to go from
22 k of course this is not meant to be
obvious right but and let me just
mention it it always suffice this
consider k that's less than half of all
the vertices because in the exclusion
process if you look at the complement of
the set of particles right it you get
another exclusion process so if you have
K particles the compliment has n minus K
so you can always assume that little
number of particles of lesson or at most
half of the total yeah so well for
people who know I i mean i can actually
do this part for label particles so
that's what's called the interchange
process and i can get this when K over N
is less then well it's bounded away from
from one all right so anything that's
bound away from I can do with a constant
that depends on this ratio you so that's
that actually the way the purport so I
want to know how to do it any other way
need to consider labels it but yeah for
exclusion suffice it to go this far and
write so well how do you do for two
particles well for two products is
actually there's two kinds of coupling
so you can consider and they're sort of
complementary and that's the gold is
part of the proof to show that right so
here's coupling number one say you have
a and B and you have a and be like this
right so it's two different realizations
start from different states so if you
just tried a couple single random walks
one way you could do it is you let them
evolve independently until they need and
they call s from there right so that's
how you prove the usual one one way to
prove the usual Markov chain convergence
theorem
well it turns out that with this labeled
exclusion or interchange process with
two particles you can do exactly the
same thing what you do is well you wait
until the first pair meets aana and then
you can continue from there until B&amp;amp;B
meet right so there's one case of part
one let me erase part two for the time
being which I call the easy case and the
easy case so this is coupling number one
is when for all at vertices in your
graph the expected time Oh for the
expected meeting time and I hope what
that means is clear for random walks
from VW right so meeting timings you let
them evolve in the penalty until they
find one another so the easy cases when
this expectation is less than I don't
know 8,000 at times T mix of a single
random walk so i mean i should say what
what's our goal here is to say that the
mixing time for to label particles is
that most a constant times the mixing
time for one single particle right so i
need the easy case is when these
expected meeting times like this in this
case you can use this strategy i just
described and it's going to show that
the mixing time in this case well see
mix of well interchange process to use
the kind of to label particles it's and
when I right team mix without an epsilon
here means absolutely quick order so in
this case you can prove it something
like yeah well maybe
I guess it got an extra plus I have four
and then it's well 40,000 certainly
enough since I just won a constant now
there's an uneasy case and the nun easy
case the idea that you have to make
rigorous is this so what does it mean
for a graph not to be easy means that
random walks take a long time to meet so
what does this mean in terms of the
interchange process right it means that
if you start a and B from two states
where I random walks are unlikely to
meet then the interchange looks like two
independent random walks that's good
right because we know how to buy on the
mixing time or two in terms of one now
it's what look at this is not quite the
proof because here you're asking for all
V and W so when you negate that you have
there exists a pair vmw from which to
random walks take a long time to meet
but then what you show is that actually
you have the same property for most
pairs of initial state that's the idea
if you have one single pair what random
walks take for a long time to meet well
you can imagine like this right you have
the spare here V W and the Brendan walks
walk for a long time they take a long
time to meet well if they they walk for
a time that's like the mixing time these
two places are more or less random of
course you can say that the pair is
random but you can say something to that
effect right using one of the things
you're going to use here is what's
called the negative correlation property
of a symmetric exclusion essentially
says what so probably that the two
particles are inside a set is that most
product of the probability so if it's
not easy it's similar after a burning
period it's similar to turn the pen and
random walks and then you're done as
well right so this part of the proof is
very clean except for the constant but
its a conceptual very simple now let's
move on to the hard bit and
the heart bet I should say that comes
from well the ideas come from a paper by
then Morris who are already mentioned
it's a paper about a symmetric exclusion
on discrete tour I say you take two
dimensional tortoise with a large side
length and you won no one know what the
mixing time that is so in art analyze
that he came up with something that he
called the chameleon process and let me
try to show you what it is so well so ok
let's see part two firm to 2k and what
you want to do is this so let's say I
want to move from two to three particles
and I mean that's not terribly exciting
it could actually use the same ideas for
any found the number of Walker's right
it should be clear but uh I mean so the
idea i'm going to use here it doesn't
move from two to three to four I mean
does it that would give you a polymer of
your head and K which is bad but so now
I'm going to show you something that
allows you to move straight to any k
wish any case malden n over 2 right so
let's say I want to consider three
particles and one of them is going to be
red and actually let me paint this all
right here and what I want analyze is
not the mixing time of the whole thing
but I want to know how close this is to
uniform given the other two particles it
should be clear that somehow equivalent
right I want to know well so you have
two particles you have n minus two
vacant vertices and how close is this to
uniform conditionally the position of
the other two right and so that's the
idea and now for your going to do a
series of tricks so the first one is is
this is well you remember that each edge
had its possum clock which we're saying
that rings a great one let's make the
clocks ring
at rate to one clock overs of edgy rings
you flip a coin to decide whether to use
it and the effect of this is really
doing nothing right because we know that
if you take the a Poisson process with
intensity two or with great too and you
raise half the point is random fashion
you got a possum process with great one
so this really doesn't do anything but
what we're going to do is this so well
so you can imagine what happened here
right so well this edge rings and you
look at the coin to decide whether
you're going to move or not and this
edge rings you look at a coin to decide
we're gonna move no but then trick
number two is involves what happens when
an edge rings that is adjacent to this
so you could look at the coin to
determine whether this is going to move
here or not but you're going to force
yourself not to look at the coin and
what's the idea here so if you don't
look at the coin the conditional
probability of this being here is equal
to condition probably that's being here
and now what you do is you pretend you
had a one unit of red ink here and well
I don't really have pink here but the
right way to do this according to Mars
will be to paint this pink in this pink
so meaning that these are half red and
half white and now okay so and then so
this by definition for today it's going
to be pink and the trick number two is
do not look at edges
and that the lookbook equines of edges
that touch some red particle and for the
time being we only had one red parka
nuts disappeared but and eventually get
more red particles because we have trick
number three which is when so i should
say well we had one red vertex which is
the location of this tag particle and we
have white vertices which have no ink
and we have pink which are sort of
halfway between right so so the rule now
is that when the number of pink is
greater than number of white or number
of red well I'm going to write it here
like all pink flip the same point
and what I mean by this is that while
the pink particles are going to all
decide whether they're going to turn red
or turn white all together and they're
going to flip the same point so here the
outcome could be that either these two
particles become white and now all red
ink disappears from your system or they
both become red let me pretend that he
can read just continue this otherwise it
ends or it just disappeared and now you
have extra move so maybe this edge rings
and again this becomes half red and half
white so I have two pink now and I guess
I'm in here now I really need to be
bigger and then well eventually this
park will move somewhere and I'll
sharing with some other white vertex and
you have something like this and now
they are going to all sleep a coin
together to decide whether they all turn
red or all turn right and the main point
of all of all this sorgam nastics here
is this so that the prob the probability
that this tag particle let me call it
red here is that a vertex X given all
the rest it can be described by the
expected amount of ink SI x given all
the rest so you can see that the blue
stuff is going to move as it move before
right and what I mean by ink is that
well this is one for red this is half
for pink
and this is 0 for white so that's what i
mean by inc alright so and this is just
some sort of martingale property just
need to show that this is preserved at
every single step right so certainly
when they share Inc it means that
particle if a particle high probability
of being here now has probably p over to
being here proven to be there and you
have to show the discontinuous at all
times so but now comes something else I
mean this by itself doesn't do much what
does a lot is this thing here so by the
way this is a chameleon process and so
now let's look at the amount of think of
the system as a at these times you know
that there are times when Pym particles
completely disappear they all become
white or red right so the amount of ink
in the system it doesn't change you can
see that turning one right into two pink
doesn't change the total amount of thing
right and so it's evolution happens in
these so-called deep inking times where
pink become red or white and what you
have to start from one well if you have
K particles you have n minus k plus one
possible very system of you occupied by
red there's also possibility that you
end up at zero and this involves
randomly well it had a devolved by
taking every bigger steps depending how
high you are right and I mean their own
bias so they might bring you down as
well so it could die or you could
somehow end up here so I guess this is
drawn logarithmic scale really but
anyway so I could both do both things
and while the probability is that well
let's say the prep Phil is the event
that you have n minus k plus 1 red
particles that means that every single
vertex that could be occupied by red /
Khloe is going to be occupied and
because of this morning you property
right at each time step the amount of
ink goes up or down by the same amount
and it's equally likely to do so the
probability of this event given that you
start for 1 is just 1 over n minus k
plus 1
and now Morris prove this that we are
looking at the total total variation
distance between the law of of this red
particle at time T given all else and
you want to know how close this is to
uniform or over the appropriate set so I
know vertex is vertices minus whatever
is occupied by else this while you have
to take an expectation here you have
your taking conditional total variation
this is have taken expectation so what
more is showed is that this thing here
is less than 1 minus the total amount of
think in your system divided by n minus
k plus 1 you have taken expectation and
you have to condition on this event that
it fills up the whole thing so I mean
I'm not saying this is obvious I mean
I'm just throwing lots of things at you
right now but uh that's the main step in
this chameleon process argument it's
just saying that while you have the zinc
a describes the evolution of the
continuous of the conditional density of
this guy and but uh of course at some
point you want to get rid of the
conditioning and this is exactly where
it happened except that you you have to
condition this field event here but you
this is nice because you don't really
have to think too much anymore about you
know the conditional distribution of
this given the rest well that's more or
less the idea and I mean for people who
know this evolving sets technology that
Morzan you've all developed this is very
similar to the kind of idea they use
their except it's different well it's
similar but it's not the same thing but
uh right so and now the at let me make a
remark here so I mean now the your
problem is to analyze the evolution of
the zinc ran a very good condition of
this
and well the way Morris Mars does it is
just well he knows everything he needs
to know about his graph which is as I
said it's a discreet tours right so you
have heat Colonel estimates you have
many things that allow you to show to
control the evolution of this here we
don't have any of this so what we're
going to do is we'll add some quiet
periods of length well some constant
let's say 10 times the tea mix of IP 2g
remember this is to label particle so
this is sort of the same thing as a
mixing time and the the thing about
these periods is that in these periods
where we will look at all coins meaning
no color changes well you can the
college might move around right what I
mean by this is that you apply the same
rule that you have in the usual process
so if this edge ring the blue Park over
here and the pink party over here they
switch places so that particles are
simply going to move around with no
color changes and of course that means
that we don't apply this trick number
two here at those times right so that's
why I say we look at all quite right but
and we need this because we essentially
don't know what the hip Colonel looks
like so right so what what happens here
so I should well basically I do this
evolution hear this yeah these are
reasons so called deep banking times
and that which means that the moments in
which the pink all decide to turn red or
white and when you condition this event
fill all you're doing is you're by using
the coin flips by a certain amount that
can explicit compute towards up so I'm
right because you cannot go down it
cannot go to zero so you're biasing you
have well this is a non biased random
walk which sort of the size of steps
increases you go up and now you're
biasing it towards n minus k plus 1 so
and what we need to show is essentially
so if you want the amount of total
amount of thing to be large which is
what we want here you want to show that
well I mean this is selling the
essential you're moving very quickly the
discrete-time random walk it's moving
very quickly up in a sense they can make
precise but what you want to show is
that well you know the durations of
these periods they are not constant as
I'm drawing here they actually random
variable so that the time it takes
between 12 pink and another and you want
to know that you want to show that those
times they are of the order of the
mixing time essentially so in a very
strong sense so and I mean that's not
completely obvious but a the main goal
of the remainder of the proof is this so
show it show something like the daddy
aren't going to be a bit technical here
but that geeks if you take any condition
any anything on you look at what happens
up to the pinking time k minus 1 and you
want to know that at this thing here
well divide by some constant right team
mix of IP 2g which already said is the
order the from their mixing type I show
this less than some constant here
meaning that it's very likely that this
ends in a time of disorder right and so
and the way to do is really start with
any configuration of red and white and
and yeah you want to know what happens
right and and I me as I said this really
does not depend on this conditioning as
I said because this this condition only
affects what happens when they decide to
the pink right so what do you do here
it's actually not very complicated so
you start with any configuration of
black well black not blue sorry so blue
or the other particles right the ones
you're not tracking the the K minus 1
remaining particles so it's a indie in
this case so you have a set of blue
particles here you have a set of red
particles here and you have a set of
white particles and I and assume that
you have more white than red and because
of what i said i'm going to assume that
they go through a quiet period where no
de pinking times please but which is
sufficient because of its of the other
of the mixing time of two particles it's
sufficient to have the following thing I
mean essentially if you look at any two
particles over here there are going to
be mixed up so you can pretend they're
as likely as any other to be in this
state right so that's important thing
that you only need pairwise
interaction here so you have this thing
here and now you want to know what's the
probability so you wanna you wanna you
need a number of deep paintings that's
uh well I raise the rule but you want to
know how many how long you need to wait
until the number of things becomes
larger than number of white or the
number of red since I have less red than
white here in the beginning while the
other situation is symmetrical I I need
to know what how long does it take until
the number of red goes down by by one
half right so essentially the main thing
as you can check for yourself is that
you need to bound the number the number
attack the amount of time you have to
wait so this is quiet this is
color-changing you need to know how many
of these windows you need to see until
you see many color changes and
essentially what you do the basic idea
is I want to bound the number of
collisions that I have in each one of
these epochs here between a white
particle and a red particle because
collisions are good collisions lead to
things becoming think except I mean if
you just come collisions you're not
going to succeed because there might be
double collisions right sometimes you're
going to have to read particles that
bump into the same white thing and so
you and then you're bound to get into
trouble so maybe this one travel a lot
and came here and bumped on white and
then it's bad right because then your
County the same thing twice so what you
need to do is it besides enemy bounding
collisions as long as this is of the
order of the mixing time is really no
big deal because this white part here
it's a positive fraction say more than
twenty five percent of graph more twenty
five percent of edges so this there are
lots of particles in here so proving
that there is at least one collision for
each one of these is very easy as long
as these days or the other mixing time
before bounding double collisions you
need this extra idea which comes from
this Poisson process is the clock the
the coins and everything else
so in the end you end up looking at
events like this so and so you define
this notion here for if you take a
vertex V hear you call F of V the first
collision time well the particle the
colored particle so that ok sorry the
red or first red or white particle that
whoever started from V collided with
there might be none but it's very likely
to have some part so the bad event and
this you compute for all these guys the
bad event would be something like this
you have read here and you have any move
this way at this point it collided with
some white so this means that here have
V here have W which equals F of V and
here you have some g prime that also
collided with this one so this guy is
also F of V Prime but how do you control
this right so so the basic idea is this
so if you look so here you had a
collision between D Prime and W at this
point you don't look at the coin and
this will become pink in principle right
well maybe there is even an earlier
collision but let's see that this is the
first one but you can pretend that you
just evolve the process as usually look
at the coin those two particles flip and
they continue and then you can ask
something like this well ok given that
these particles collided but we can say
something like this so given that
there's a collision here this guy is
equally likely to have W equal to F of V
and to have V prime equal to f of e
meaning i'm looking at the first
collision right so when they get here
well because of the exclusion property
the way I set up the rates and
everything there's a coin right so maybe
things continue in a way that view hits
w maybe things continue in a way that V
hits V Prime and those two events are
equally likely so using this is somehow
saying that well the event that two
particles meet the same guy is
essentially well the number of collision
bad collisions this word is essentially
the number is equal in the expectation
to the number of collisions with in the
red set so the number of bad bad events
while the expected number of bad events
it's less than you expect a number of
collisions with then read and why is
this good well because as we started out
we said we have less red than white so
you have the expected number of
collisions with red with white minus
expected number of collisions with red
this is typically going to be positive
and then you're good to go that's so the
idea essentially is that once you go
through this mixing stage because these
things these guys are all mixed up here
you can prove that a white particle will
probably collide with a sorry a red park
will probably call it with a white one
and the probability of double collisions
is smaller and that's it and that's
essentially how you how you so you show
that with that constant probability the
number of pink rose by a certain
constant factor in this phase and then
well it repeated and you know so I guess
that's it thanks
so what's the best lower bound is just a
random hug so actually not even that
because well if you have the process
with label particles then sure yeah one
run walks BF your lower bound if you
have a que unlabeled particles I mean
it's not the case right there the one
run walks a projection of K exclusion /
so you essentially have no lower bound
no general lower bound that I know of
and that's kind of them you know the
most annoying problem you could think of
in some sense regarding all of this that
immun it truly is the case that the
exclusion zone over two particles mix is
lower than one written walk but I as far
as I know nobody knows how to prove that
I think it should be true with okay in
this journal actually my own feeling is
that if you take the process which I
called what David called you change
process with any number of particles and
you put any epsilon here this should be
less than T mix of the corresponding
system of K independent random walks
well maybe the constant here and with
Absalom and then you have or get lucky
automatically but any this is very very
far from being something proven or
provable even I mean okay I want to push
this so far but it's it really seems to
be beyond our current knowledge of
things
and I mean I actually think that
actually this holds both ways but you
can look up or a lower about this East
upon
okay thank all of today's speakers and
