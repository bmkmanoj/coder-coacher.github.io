talk I don't know table and the
questions that were asked where how do
you measure bots what are the KPIs how
can we measure different bots in
different use cases and like what are
the clicks and views and users of the
bots so the questions that the answer is
that we came back with is that you can
have up like aggregated metrics which
don't tell you much but give you a sense
of the scale of the bots which is pretty
good if you're trying to compare
different bots in different use cases
but if you're going down inside
different but you'll start to see that
for example messages sent is not a
really good metric because for example
one bot can be just listening to the
conversation and sending one report a
day or a week and that would be a really
useful bod that you can actually pay for
like I know guys it's dad's but do and
another way that can be it could be a
conversational bot that leads you
through some kind of a story and there
could be like enormous amount of
messages and but you'll still have to
decide like is this like can you compare
those two so maybe like an even inside
10 but is it do you measure like the
total number of messages or are you
going to measure average number of
messages per user because there can be
one person who is really engaged in your
character but who is talking a lot to
that bot and there can be a long tail of
people who just messaged one or two
times and never come back so what the
actual metrics of users retention are
actually similar to the apps the number
of messages you should question on what
is the actual use case there and is it
really possible to compare
are different types of use cases like
people were talking about killer use
cases of the bots and as it's like can
you compare it two types of bots I don't
think that we should do that like the
answer that we came up and like we're in
our discussion is that like you don't
count Spotify place against I don't know
audible book rats or something book
listens so there should be aggregated
metrics at the top and specific bot
metrics for each of the spots
individually so yeah that's pretty much
it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
