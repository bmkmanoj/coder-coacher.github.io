okay it's a it's an honor to to host jon
krakauer today from Johns Hopkins
University John is the professor of
neurology and neuroscience at Johns
Hopkins he also directs a lab called
brain learning animation in movement lab
I think he conjured that up to to have
the acronym blam lab and when I was
visiting Johns Hopkins I gave a talk
there at CS and also school public
health two different talks that day but
I had a set of meetings in both places
and of all the people that I met John
stood out as as being kind of
out-of-the-box think thinker and um kind
of his interdisciplinary work crosses
the borders of intersex would work an
interest of many people at microsoft
research so I so I thought I just have
him out when we'd have some meeting
scheduled and see what would happen
given the kind of interesting things
that John does it things like typically
we don't get exposed to it ms are so bad
for us background John did his
bachelor's and master's degree at
Cambridge University then went to
Columbia where he did his medical school
he trained he thought he did a one-year
internship at Johns Hopkins and came
back to Columbia to do a residency in
neurology and he's been and then
followed by fellowship in in motor
control his areas of interest i'll read
these are experimental and computational
studies of motor control and motor
learning in humans tracking long-term
motor skill learning and its relation to
higher cognitive processes such as
decision-making prediction of motor
recovery after stroke mechanisms of
spontaneous motor recovery after stroke
in humans and in mouse models and in New
neuro rehabilitation approaches for
patients in the first three months after
stroke he has lots of interesting
clinical interests but I was quite
intrigued also by his interests in motor
skills learning and gaming and he has
some finishing demos to show as well so
John
q is this on I'm not going to hear it
right it so it's broadcast that's right
well Eric thank you very much for coming
here this is a first for me civic
Northwest Microsoft giving a talk you
know it makes me feel hip um so I'm it's
nice to have this sort of it allowed to
be questioned during perfect wonderful
so I'm going to talk about a lot of
things that I'm just beginning to try
and tackle that puzzle me profoundly and
I think it's always interesting when one
lists what one is you know I don't think
I it's really easily defined the kind of
work that we're doing because the
categories of motor learning and
cognition I think have been artificially
separated and the word skill I think
gets used in a very colloquial sense and
I think when you try and zero in on what
we mean by all these terms it's quite
hard and I think and philosopher that
I'm working with right now said John
don't get so caught up with definitions
just to keep them fuzzy and then show
things and I think that's probably the
best thing to do so this is our labs
website front page as of about a few
days ago I think the animator we have
this wonderful resident animator called
cat McNally who did her degree at mica
which is a art school in Baltimore and
we hired her because of what we're
beginning to do in animation and gaming
and she did this sort of slightly
phantasmagoric version of the old
Hopkins facing the new Hopkins we just
have these giant new buildings but it
was just we are the first lab I think in
a neurology department to have a
resident artist and animator I'm very
proud of her okay what I'm going to talk
about today so I was involved in writing
to reviews one in 2008 one thing in 2009
where they wanted us to sum up the
current thinking about motor learning
and and things like that and so rather
shad me is also at Hopkins as
computational motor control scientist
and we wrote this and then a year later
the Olympics were coming
long and they nature reviews
neuroscience wanted something about
athletics and so they said would you
head up an article about what it is we
know about athlete from why are they so
great and I said yes because I knew that
I wasn't going to know what to say
because what did what it made very
apparent was that when you say you do
motor controller motor learning people
in the real world think that you're
going to tell them something interesting
about what we're all obsessed with which
is sports I mean for reasons which are
still unclear we pay people more to
throw balls around or hit them with than
anything else in human endeavor right
and if you ask yourselves right now why
is that you won't be able to answer
right why do we like to watch car chases
ride roller coasters watch kung fu
movies go to ballet and watch sports I
mean why it's bizarre and we're
beginning to try and get at that and I
think gaming might be a way to actually
formally test what it is about movement
and watching it that is so pleasurable
and that's what we're beginning to move
towards okay so
about two weeks ago a reporter from Time
magazine called me up because he's
writing a piece about LeBron James and
he wanted and I think it's something
like the genius of LeBron James I it's
not out yet I hope I'm not doing
anything wrong by mentioning it but um
and the conversation began to unfold in
a way that there was this idea that
there's athletic and practical genius
and then there's what we really think
genius is you know Einstein and Newton
and that somehow these are different
things and I would argue that that's
nonsense but we'll get there but where
did it all start where did the sort of
scientific justification for this
distinction come from and I would say
for those of you I'm sure you're all
familiar it all started with this
seminal observation that Brenda Milner
made in a patient called hm so for those
of you who aren't familiar hm with a
patient with intractable epilepsy who
underwent bilateral temporal lobectomy
for his intractable epilepsy and
unexpectedly he it led to a profound
amnesia right he would experience
something learn something and then
swiftly forget it right after and a
whole slew of neuropsychological studies
ensued but the famous one I mean the one
that led to the distinctions I'm going
to be talking about today was that when
Brenda Milner asked him to do this
mirror tracing task where you basically
have to trace with a pencil around the
edges of a star in this case and trying
to stay on basically it's a double-edged
star you have to keep the pencil between
the tracks of the perimeter of the star
doing it in a mirror with the vision of
your hand obscured and then you just
look at the mean squared error and you
just track across days and you get this
clear
savings effect in other words come back
on day two and you better on day three
and yet each time he was introduced the
task you've never done it before what do
I have to do right so in other words
this profound sort of double
dissociation between having any
recollection of ever having performed
this task and clearly showing memory of
having done it before so this led to the
famous distinction about separable
memory systems in the brain and in we
argue in a piece that I've written with
the philosopher Jason Stanley that this
was really the neuroscientific
justification for the more sort of
general cultural belief of the
distinction between the practical and
the theoretical right there's sort of
explicit declarative cognition and
there's this sort of unconscious
implicit motor side all right and there
from that that's why these things
separated okay
so fine now let's take a step back and
say well what do we really mean when we
talk about motor learning is that star
tracing task really capturing everything
that we intuitively imagine it means and
is it really one mechanism or is it
multiple so should we be thinking like
this so if you were to go to the
literature on motor learning and in fact
what the literature that we basically
reviewed quite exhaustively in that
first article that I showed you of the
two people do these adaptation like
studies right and so essentially you
apply some sort of systematic
perturbation in this case here the
target here's a curse of representing
your fingertip for example and you apply
perturbation where you aim for the
target now there's some systematic
rotation on the cursor and you miss and
then over time you adapt and so you move
your hand over here and in goes the
cursor and this is sort of the
computer-generated version really of the
mirror drawing task right it's a classic
adaptation task where there's some sort
of systematic perturbation and you
iteratively over time bring down your
errors and this is what happens and you
can fit single and double Exponential's
where the size of your correction seems
to be proportional to the site size of
the error right and this is what you
people do force field prism goggles and
there's an in vast literature on the way
that we seem to implicitly reduce our
errors into the setting of systematic
motivations
like my first this awesome of this work
I was thinking what's the what's the
intersection of this fork with the HCI
kind of fits laws and the scanning tools
we have in HCI that might be outside
because it's disappointing outside of
them studies like that we see a motor
adaptation and maybes up to
opportunities there in itself for for
joining these these communities and i'll
be talking a little bit about speed
accuracy that in a minute actually
because it's absolutely right so all of
the departments also do this
yes I think arrogance reasonably well
known to the psychologists who study by
tonight cognition okay look at it but
you know how's it getting back back back
into KY upsetting typically have a
standard simple tools for freedom kind
of target target acquisition working
point that you know psychologists have
studied these tasks a great deal they
when it comes to motor learning the
psychologists seem to really like
sequence tasks which I'll talk about
very briefly right so you've got
adaptation tasks which became more the
purview of people from engineering
people are interesting in control theory
right and then you had the sequence
learning stuff and then an Al and then
what I would say is that neither of
those are capturing what we might more
colloquially think is skill which we'll
get to in a minute so in psychology yeah
absolutely are you an actor yes yes and
as you those divides a fast a
fascinating to write yeah um so here's
so I'm going to take you through some
stuff that may seem sort of odd to show
you what you can do an in ass in a sense
take that hm dichotomy and hoist it by
its own petard okay so and this is
actually work done by rich Ivory's group
and then jordan taillow's now princeton
that and i'm working with them and this
is stuff that we've done together to
sort of try and push this kind of
paradigm towards limits and see how in
fact even this kind of paradigm is
heavily contaminated by cognition
cognition in the way just for now I'm
just going to admit to a division and
then try and collapse it so here's sort
of setup you have a target the red is
the cursor you start here and you just a
baseline this is you're making zero
error because it's there's no
perturbation you just aim like this you
just have some variability
okay and then you apply a rotation and
now you try move to the target in the
cursor goes off like this you have this
big first error of 45 degrees and then
you start to adapt so here's you on your
way and then you get into the target and
then you can have an after effect you
turn the rotation off again and now you
miss in the other direction okay classic
now with a colleague of mine at Columbia
petrom at Sony we decided to see whether
we could do sort of reverse 8 gem and
bypass this slow implicit system by
using the rest of your brain right so
how would you do that we'd say well okay
here's a series of targets and we're
going to space them by 45 degrees which
is exactly the spacing of the imposed
rotation okay
so same as before you then the rotation
turns on and you experience these two
rotation then we say stop we've imposed
a rotation of 45 degrees so why don't
you deliberately aim for the target
that's minus 45 degrees of the way and
you'll just instantly get into the
target all right BAM you get right down
in one trial right so great this is what
it is to be human you can be given an
instruction and you can bypass or
override this more primitive system
presumably know you get worse and worse
it's very spooky actually right
what's going on and then you say stop
what you're doing just aim for the
target like you did before we started
the experiment we switch off the
rotation have an after effect so here's
the classic one I just showed you and
here's the experiment with the cognitive
strategy very very similar don't you you
start then you start adapting just like
this Italy looks as though this curve is
simply been DC shifted and then there's
the after effect now there's some extra
subtleties which we'll get to which you
may be noticing in terms of why isn't
the after effect the size of the
rotation given the fact that you're
making close to zero error here right
we'll get to that so what's going on
well
and here's another version of that
experiment which we reviewed in recently
what this is suggesting is that even
though the instruction was given in
order to adopt a strategy to not miss
the target the cursor has become a proxy
for your hand which means that when you
say I'm going to aim to that cheat
cheating target and the cursor doesn't
go where you planned to go with your
hand that's actually a prediction error
sighs the brain is concerned why didn't
my hand go where I planned to aim it all
right so even though there's a part of
you saying I know there's a rotation I
shouldn't be bothered by that planning
error there's presumably a part of your
brain and I'll argue your cerebellum
that says I that's an enormous
prediction error I plan to go to that
tithe and the curve didn't go there I
need to close that error so what this is
implying is that adaptation is being
driven not by target errors but by
sensory prediction errors and if that's
true and there's a work that I'll
briefly go through suggesting that to
the degree that it's a forward model
with the forward model it some sort of
neural network that can predict the
sensory consequences of commands and
there's a lot of work on that and that
the cerebellum is the source of this
forward model then perhaps you could
paradoxically see that patients who
can't do Ford Model learning that's
dependent on sensory prediction errors
could actually cheat better than healthy
subjects and that's exactly what you see
this is one of those paradoxical results
we're actually brain injury makes you
better at a task so here's the another
group of controls doing exactly as we
said here you are at baseline here's the
rotation you get given the strategy you
do fine and then you drift here you do
the exactly the same thing and the
cerebellar patients do a much better job
applying strategy and staying on target
just what you'd predict if they're
deficient in a particular kind of motor
lining called adaptation which is Ford
Model dependent learning user role of
damage obviously this is cerebellum is a
complicated machine yeah cuvette certain
kind of this is the these were done in
patients with spinal cerebellar atrophy
types six which is the degenerative
condition which are many of the spiro
cerebellar atrophy is more cerebellar
focused and it just leads to loss of
purkinje cells diffuse loss of the
kinsey cells yeah in fact and you can
sort of this is at you he didn't
test the people in advance to
create a corporate that was limited in
the same ways with the ability to learn
well it's just they all have clinically
diagnosed SCA and then here's a group
for example so here's controls doing
this and then you see that when you try
and do this regular lining in these
patients they can't do it right there
just they don't lost all their purkinje
cells but you see that they're impaired
at just learning this kind of task and
if you do an imaging study of this which
we've done this is an old pet study I
don't know why that's coming up in white
very strange but you know you can see
cerebellar activation performing this
task so the current orthodoxy
represented by that first paper is that
motor learning adaptation is some sort
of systems identification wave your task
goals you have a control policy you send
mode of Gooden trolls to the plant which
leads to a change in state at the same
time you send a copy of the commands to
a Ford Model and you have a predicted
state this leads to the ability to
actually compute a prediction error and
then somehow this prediction error
dependent learning lead to an update of
a control policy represented by this
thick red arrow this is a diagram made
by a postdoc in my allow called Adrienne
Haith is working very much on this
distinction between this model based
learning and another kind of learning
model free learning and you go from this
prediction error which we think is in
the cerebellum to a control policy this
is adaptation this is the orthodoxy
alright and we ins model based learning
alright so this is what you'll be seeing
if you go perusing the flitter on
adaptation and looking at it from
computational standpoint okay so we're
back to this so I you know did this to
encapsulate it a little piece of the
talk this kind of learning led to this
dissociative memory systems and this
kind of learning is thought to be driven
by prediction errors and cerebellar
dependent but you may all be saying
what's this got to do with us going to
watch this is Roger Federer 2006-2007
winnings on top of the world is had a
little bit of a drop off at this point
but um
do you think that motor adaptation in
all the studies are telling us anything
about this and I would say no because
what does adaptation do it gets you back
at best it gets you back to your
baseline right so in other words of I'm
a basketball player and I am transferred
to a tournament on the moon and I adapt
to a change in gravity I'm not going to
be any better at basketball on the moon
the best I can hope is to be as good as
i was once I've adapted to the change in
G to the way I was on earth right but
what we admire is that these people are
better over time then they work baseline
right but not let us to return to
baseline levels of performance and
selling of perturbation so how do we
deal with being better not just being as
good as now that surprisingly it's
understudied in a motor learning
literature so you're adapting to a very
rigid dynamic where it is you're
learning tennis skills oh no I'm not
deny that you're having to update
potentially ford models of your body
your plant the racket you know and I'm
not saying that if you had a taxi from
SC a 6 or cerebella in fat you wouldn't
be able to play tennis right but being
able to adapt and do systems
identification of your own body and
balls and rackets is not is necessary
but surely it's not sufficient to become
really good at it right so we decided
this is Leo he's now back at he was a
postdoc in the lab is now back in Israel
and Pietro we decided we come up with a
simple non perturbation non adaptation
related experiment okay surprisingly
understudied okay so Pietro and the or
came up with the arc pointing task where
you really so you have you know there's
this a retro-reflective mark on your
hand here's an infrared camera and you
simply have to I'm gonna try and do it
right you simply have to try and get the
cursor through this she
boob without hitting the edges all right
you've all played some version of this
right now what's nice about this task
right is it's a continued is a fast task
but you have to make continuous
adjustments you have a mixture of
feedback and feed forward and it's hard
right so I'm just going to hope this
works show you
whoops out you missed that would be what
you the first time you're trying to do
it all right
right so that that's what it's like when
you try to do it the first time all
right and then you train over in this
case they trained over five days three
three to four days
pretty impressive right now the question
is is how do you do that what is
happening over the days of training that
allows you to do that that's what he's
whoever did that is the federer of this
task right now what's interesting is
what we did back in 2009 we applied it
here too is we said we're going to
operationally define this ability as the
ability and Eric mentioned fits to shift
your speed accuracy trade-off function
with practice now it's actually
fascinating that fits law you know this
speed accuracy trade-off with the paper
original paper came out in 1953 and yet
and I say this in all modesty we could
not find an example of where people
deliberately tried to Rive a speed
actually trade-off function before and
after learning all right so what's
interesting here is so this is the
movement time distribution over which
people were making movements while
training and then what you do is you
deliberately test the speed actually
trade off an imposed movement times
outside of the learning situation in
other words it's not a good idea to just
study learning during acquisition
because all sorts of things might be
going on to change your movement time
and your accuracy not because of some
limit but because you're exploring for
example so what you want to do is you
want to have a learning phase and then
before and after the learning phase you
deliberately assay the speed actually
trade off with a metronome and see what
people's accuracy is at fourth movement
times and what's interesting is here is
your day one speed actually trade off
function and then this is what it looks
like after training and you see this
global shift outside ranges notice that
you actually trained in it he study
things like training is fixed that you
allows
we repairs yes so in other words foot
well in this case it is done over days
like these not ringing you appear yes so
so now we're doing clematis yet right so
there's an entire literature on whether
motor learning consolidates with sleep
or not all right okay and the current
thinking and we haven't done it with
this task is that there doesn't seem to
be for adaptation task any effect of
sleep I believe you wait 12 hours on the
same day versus 12 hours overnight
there's no difference if you look at the
implicit components of something called
the serial reaction time task there's no
difference what seems to be causing a
difference is when there's an explicit
component to consolidation of
consolidation has two meanings in the
neurosciences richer one is resistance
to interference by some other task and
is there a window after which the memory
for task a is safe from interference by
task B versus the idea of offline gains
meaning when you come back the next day
your performance at the beginning is
actually incrementally better it's DC
shifted up from your last performance on
the day before right now people confuse
those two but to the degree that it
looks to the there's been a sleep
related effect it seems to be on
explicit sequence tasks looking at the
offline effect right but it's that the
current time it's still fuzzy how
important sleep is but in for sequence
tasks that have a knowledge order
component it seems as though there's an
offline gain its muscle getting it lady
cognition human-like memory we have
models of short long term hmm salvation
models various kinds of masking and
appearance let's motor yes that's like
that no no no so in other words it's you
have a short-term memory defect or a
long-term any of it okay so no it's a
contentious issue right now my position
that I'm taking which is somewhat
polemical is that adaptation is a
short-lived working memory like
phenomenon and that any long-term motor
learning is actually in the skill domain
and is not error based its reward based
is I guess there's no there's a bit of a
parlor punch line but it's it's but it
is but it is the direction we're going
and now but that causes a lot of people
to be upset and because they say wait a
minute you can have prisms and you can
learn over time to take the glasses on
and off and you've switched between
internal models they call it and things
like that I'm not going to talk a great
deal about this but what we're arguing
is that piggybacking on top of the
adaptation system is another part of
your brain watching the solution that
the adaptation system converges upon and
those oh I'll remember that solution so
that when you now do it again you don't
have to go through the error based
process that led you to that solution
another part of your brain remembers
solution that was derived and that gets
recalled now recalling the solution that
one system originally derived is not to
the same as saying that the initial
system has a long-term memory it
provided a solution than another part of
the brain then remembers and so what
we'd argue is that that other system
that remembers solution that the
short-term system found has a long-term
memory I guess
remember means so much I know something
very different for cognitive for calling
an incident or yeah so another cinematic
initiative to remember a complex set of
motor commands that's very very well
okay so that's it that's right so now
let's just talk about this in other
words i'm doing so this is i don't have
a slide for this but i can I draw it on
here so in other words if you learn over
time that to get the cursor into the
target your hand has to incrementally
end up going over here right and you do
that very slowly through this adaptation
process this movement now is the
solution to getting that curve in that
target so now you go away for a day or
two and I come back and I make you do it
again and what happens if you look at
the learning curve instead of it looking
like this you go kachunk like that now
the question is what's this kachunk is
it just a sort of parametric increasing
in the rate of the original system that
did the learning or do you just start
again and then say wait a minute I've
been here before and have a kind of
implicit aha moment of having made these
movements before and what we're arguing
we have I don't have I can send you the
paper is that there's a system that does
remember what you did before now the
question you ask is very interesting one
what are you exactly you remember it
this movement by the way that you make
to get the curse in here is one you've
made all your life and others if I stuck
a target here you can do this right away
that's nothing hard about this are
moving it's just you need to associate
this arm movement with getting the
cursor in right and all I'm saying is
that even though you need a slow
iterative process to get there which is
adaptation or you can use a strategy
that just aim over here all I'm saying
is that there may be a way to remember
this solution in hand space without
having to go through this process again
and somebody would erroneously say
that's a long term memory for this
original process and I'm saying that's
not necessarily true
yes for remembering the policy yes so we
so i'll tell you the art right so so the
way we did it is we said okay usually
their confounded right so what we did is
we said all right what we'll do is we'll
have people learn a 22 targets where the
if you go to this target you have a
rotation is negative and but you end up
converging with your hand over here or
you go to this target and it's a
positive rotation but you also end up
converting over here so this is a plus
30 degree rotation and this is a minus
thirty degree rotation so two opposite
internal models right it just so happens
that way we considered the experiment
the hand solution is the same for the
two internal model now if you believe
that savings and interference that use a
competition between internal models then
when you now come back you do the 30
degrees and now you come in to the minus
30 degrees there should be no savings
but in fact what you see is if you do 30
degree is the first time then you do the
minus you have a huge advantage between
minus 30 can't be that you're a calling
the plus side you're doing the opposite
internal model so what can be causing
the savings well it's because the hand
movement is the same in both cases for
that experiment to my mind very clearly
showed that what led to this improvement
was actually the control policy and not
the fact that you remembered the mapping
because in fact that wouldn't help you
as the opposite okay so that is exactly
what led us to believe that it was a
mistake to think that you were doing
this through either revving up the
initial adaptation process or switching
between maps right
so how are people doing this right and
so what what people are doing when they
bring down their speed out the shift
despide actually trade off this is a
trajectory in that tube in normalized
time these are the five movement times
that you test the speed actually trade
off and this is your trajectory variance
so this is what you're like on day one
and not unsurprisingly as you go faster
you get this increase in variability it
builds up over the course of the
movements of signal dependent noise and
then you compare this to what happens on
day five and you just see this
unbelievable dramatic reduction in
variability now the question is is how
does the brain do this in other words
what is allowing this to happen with
practice right now this is not
systematic error in other words in this
task the mean trajectory that you make
on day one and day five very similar so
you're already at the slow speed like
that slow cursor that I showed you that
trajectory that you made slowly is not
different to the trajectory that you saw
when you made it fast on average right
so now the unlike adaptation where you
are having to make a new mean movement
here the mean does not really change
what changes is the variance around it
okay so I'm saying that some people
study systematic error and we were
studying variable error nevertheless you
could argue that those two pieces are
very implicit right so where's cognition
so before I get to that I just want to
say that we image this in other words
we've done imaging experiments now and
brain stimulation experiments to look at
the neural substrates of this systematic
error process and this variable error
process and this is what Lee or smell
off dear this is just submitted a fMRI
study and there's a lot of images but
basically the main point is that because
so many people were studying adaptation
unlike in the animal literature the
human literature was beginning to
about motor cortex but what we were
interested in is if we're just
interested in that variability reduction
process where is that happening and
essentially the contralateral motor and
premotor cortex and the ipsilateral
cerebellum are activating for the learn
task even when you control for the
performance in other words you can't
study motor learning if you keep imaging
the improved performance because then
the imaging that change you see is
simply the change in the actual
performance not the learning process per
se right it's called the performance
confound so what law did every is he
used this task to clamp the trajectory
and the speed that you moved out so that
on day one and day five you were doing
easy slow version of the task but even
though you were performing the task the
same way trial-by-trial on the two days
the variance was different the second
order part and the activation was still
there so be a little bit equivalent to
if I'm sitting standing here and a
world-class pianist one of you might be
very good pianist and that we both stood
up here and you had to guess which one
of us was the world-class pianist and
all you're allowed to do with press
middle C at one hurts right you wouldn't
be able to tell which one of us was the
because I'd clamp to the performance
right but if you image duss i would say
that for the same phenotype you would
see a difference and that's exactly what
Leo's showed that by there's a different
than they did the extent of activation
in motor cortex on day one day five even
though the performance is the same and
right hmm more more and so so no wait
and so into the air Maggie together well
okay so that we don't these are
statistical maps okay and you have to be
very careful not to conflate changes in
T maps was true changes in extent of
activation right so there suppose you
either either you could be activating
more voxels from day 1 to day 5 or the
same number of voxels but
degree of activation of that same number
is increased and you can't d couple more
activation in the same voxels or more
voxels now we did some analyses to
suggest that it's more but when it comes
to signal to noise there are two ways to
increase your signal to noise one is
more I just have more neurons during the
job or you better recruit neurons tuned
to the tasks that you're doing right now
if you look at the sensory literature
that it seems like you have these two
phases you expand the population during
the task and then you select from that
expanded population the more specialized
units both of which can lead to a
reduction in increase in signal to noise
and one would lead you'd expect to lead
to an increase in activation and then a
sparse decrease in activation right what
we're seeing here at least at this stage
looks like it's the increased part I
guess there's a sense of a well-honed
machine there's less exploration and
costly also the things that gets more
efficient over time eating less of all
this stuff going yeah so I would say
that it probably depends on the task and
when in the learning process you are
alright but here we were more interested
in saying that for a tacit agreement
requires a shifting of speed actually
trade-off and a reduction in variability
usually expect to see changes in the
contralateral motor cortex premotor
cortical cerebellum and that's what we
saw and it's and then in the current
stage of that it looks like it's an
increase in activation but ultimately I
think you have you're right that's what
will happen and then just to sort of go
with that Janine rice and Heidi shaumbra
when they're working in within Leo
Komarov the NIH and I was collaborating
with them we wanted to see whether we
could turn people into super learners on
a skill task with non invasive brain
stimulation and so this is the task this
was devised Pablo cellnet because now
adopt pins to really spearheaded this
and this class is very simple you just
have to is isometric you squeeze a
fourth transducer and you see we have to
get the cursor into this gate come back
get it into that gate don't overshoot
combat
it and if you overshoot you lose the
whole trial it's extremely difficult all
right only venue control over sure is
right right and it's nonlinear so what
they did it right and when it's
nonlinear so basically it's not as
though that there's an exponential
function attached to this cursor so it's
very difficult right so then what you do
is you use you isolate the hotspot in
primary motor cortex using TMS over the
APB so you just say okay we now know
where we're going to put the a nodal
transcranial direct current stimulation
basically you take a six volt battery
and you stick it up your bald head so
this is TMS transcranial managed by this
is healthy subjects we all we want we
know the excessive fans you well
transcranial magnetic stimulation trans
trans trans screen amandera stimulation
you basically have an alternating
current in the coil which leads to a
magnetic field which induces a current
in cortex and actually triggers spiking
in the motor neurons right and you get
something called an MEP a motor evoked
potential and that and it allows you to
say okay I'm over motor cortex and this
is a hand task so you wanted to get
activation of a muscle that would be
used in the task that's what Jeanine did
explain
methodology how precisely from these two
million muscles that way you can do you
think you can student individual muscles
in the hand not all equally well but the
APB and you know abductor pollicis
brevis any you put students say yes
single pulse TMS is is safe you know
things like theta burst and high
frequency repetitive TMS some people say
shouldn't be done in people the history
of epilepsy maybe not after acute stroke
but lots of it's been done known it's
very very safe yeah and then what you do
after you've done the TMS you now do
tDCS which is a direct current which
doesn't isn't thought to make neurons
fire but it may bring them closer to
thresholds when you voluntarily want
them to go they're more likely to go
wrong you think the custodial to ucf but
they're not exactly antithetical to each
other it depends on the placement and
that's an interesting question we have
that control here but and so then what
we did is we trained subjects Janine you
know to do this kind of study by the way
the reason why learning adaptation
studies are so popular is because you
can do them in a day five minutes to
adapt to a prison you want to study
long-term learning you have to do what
Janine and Heidi heroically did which is
you trained over five days and they
followed up over three months I mean
these are the kind of studies that are
needed but they're hard to get funded so
stimulating them as they train and then
following up ok the idea being that if
you stimulate motor cortex and that's
the important substrate for learning a
skill you can actually turn people into
super learners right now that wasn't why
we did there so we're interested in
consolidation you know there's no why
would you have I thought this is that by
this general blasting of a part of the
cortex
in a part of the brain is probably doing
structured things very very fine
precision that that turning on is yeah
yeah that's a very good question so the
idea simply is that to the degree that
you get a delta for any change whether
it's an error on updating right so
nobody look super learning this is the
idea what the idea is can you increase
the gain of the update for a given error
in other words if I for example here you
have a 30 degree error and in one trial
you bring it down by five degrees why
not bring it down by 10 right in other
words now there are Bayesian arguments
to why you don't do one trial learning
right based on are you correct in the
error that you've perceived do you trust
your ability to make a big change right
so based on your confidence about the
world confidence about your plant you
optimize the size of your update based
on your relative certainties number of
my father's guess what's going on blast
grossly blast parts of the brain more
blood flow who knows
you know and in fact to the degree that
people have looked at what tDCS is doing
in slice preparation so Janine and
somebody she collaborated with Britta
fritsch have done this work on a slice
preparation of motor quartet it seems to
be enhancing LTP dependent prudence
protein synthesis for example so your
question is very well taken and but the
idea just is could you just rev up a
little bit the gain on the deltas that
you do in response to errors but you're
right it's not in any way a given and
you're on your right this is what will
happen with deep brain stimulation for
people with parkinson's the idea that
subtle phasic changes can be mimicked by
one big tonic step right you're
absolutely right okay you heard I'm
sorry yeah just wondering if you
compared your stimulation with
changing virtual game so having that
cursor respond with more sensitivity
like what types of game you're getting
yes so we we've done a lot of so there's
slightly different meanings to the word
gain right that would be just changing
you know for one centimeter change in
your hand distance you it's half a
centimeter in cursive space and we've
done a lot of work on that and brain
stimulation what I'm talking about is
when you do a little bit of protein
synthesis and change a synaptic bhutan
on a dendrite right that by doing tDCS
the construction of that bhutan is a
little faster trial-by-trial because of
tds so I'm talking about the gain on the
plasticity process in the brain versus
again in the relationship between a
cursor and they're not the same thing
right did you have a question so I did
you actually test from these 65
five things you don how do you arrive
on the game and put
I ya know this was I think these are
averages of of the days no it wasn't
it's got to be day 29 there was some
jitter on it all right and it's an
average so you terribly so basically you
chose version of the story so
essentially on each of these five days
Jeanine had them get a nodal tDCS as
they practice the task and then we will
show you what happened and then the
follow-up all right but the follow-up is
without stimulation right and this is a
measure of the shift in the speed
accuracy trade-off function and I was
the parameter that we call skill
learning was a parameter the capture the
shift globally of the whole speed
actually trade-off function and this is
people who are doing it without this is
people doing it with it's not subtle
right no your success for one year
various points for additions don't know
how this anymore I don't certain second
I get off of that every single time so
does Pablo sonic more than I do because
he's really the expert on brain
stimulation and there are ethical
concerns because you can't test the
urine for having had a batter in your
head the but you so in other words I
don't know how you're going to do
anything about this you could check
people's any Peas in other words there's
an when you get to UCS transiently the
excitability of motor cortex to TMS goes
up but that's transient right and if you
look I don't have the plot but over time
disadvantage at day 5 was still there
three months later thurs Boca coffee
caffeine nicotine other cancer yeah it
must've the same
for things well I mean that's definitely
true for the bold response for example
with functional imaging I don't think
that coffee is going to make you more
skilled at I the carpets of some
medication oh yeah I mean in fact I
don't as as so much I could show you but
we've got some beautiful work that Steve
zila who assistant professor Hopkins on
using prozac in a mouse model of stroke
and what's fascinating is that if you
take a mouse and you give it a stroke
and then you train it within 24 hours of
its stroke you can get back to the
performance levels that are equivalent
to before it was given its stroke if you
just wait a week and then you train it
again it never gets it gets fifty
percent up and then it plateaus it
having waited a week you've lost this
window of plasticity immediately with
the buzzer but what he's done is if you
give that no no without Prozac and you
start training right away you get back
if you wait a week if you give the mouse
prozac after its stroke but still wait a
week before you start training it now
gets back up to normal right it's very
interesting so in other words the
intersection of brain stimulation giving
drugs is going to that's what we're
trying to do in stroke right now right
it's very exciting um and just Pablo
selnick in his lab this is just to show
that in I just showed you enhancing
learning by stimulating over m14 a skill
task for the variable error kind of task
if you stimulate over the cerebellum
we're using tDCS for the systematic
error task you speed it up if you
stimulate over the cerebellum but
nothing happens if you stimulate over
motor cortex so here the beautiful
double dissociation to bring down the
systematic errors you stimulate over the
cerebellum nothing happens when you
stimulate over motor cortex however if
you stimulate over motor cortex and then
you look at the retention phase later
now what was acquired by the cerebellum
is retained better by the motor cortex
so the link
that we would argue between the error
reduction paradigms and the variability
reduction paradigms is that even in the
error reduction paradigms the memory for
the command may actually be formed in
motor cortex right so and then I would
make the claim that when we're studying
skill we're looking at the motor cortex
and the motor cortex is also the site
for remembering what the cerebellum did
which is a title of Pablo cell next
paper actually so what have you changed
the action to be instead of 30 threes 29
raise your 25 degree how quickly can you
react okay are you literally is there
some current methods vary we don't yeah
generalization of models free learning
has not really been studied okay there's
no I mean people sort of insured they
think that if you have a model like of a
rotation then you should be able to
apply that model anywhere right so I
give you this target and it's a 30
degree rotation or this target and your
model is rotate movement by 30 degrees
that should be global so when you do
gain adaptation it seems fairly global
actually and that if it's just learning
a particular thing it's easy to retrieve
but the price you pay is you don't have
to do that a lot of computation to
generalize so it should not be
generalized but we don't know if that's
true we don't know what the
generalization should be for model free
so this is um Jason Stanley he's a
professor at Rutgers he's moving to Yale
now and he wrote this piece which is fun
to read in the opinionator last year on
this notion of the practical and
theoretical and he argued that it's a
false distinction
this is actually a very nice there's a
photographer called Stephen Pike who's
the main photographer for The New Yorker
magazine and he did a series of very
famous photographs of philosophers very
strange project that philosophers the
ultimate thinking kind of people and you
think that you can work out what they're
like by taking photographs anyway so
let's so so far just be clear I've
talked about two kinds of learning that
sort of acuity learning where you can
bring down your variants and systematic
error both of which seem to be happening
without you having to sort of intervene
consciously all right but that can't be
right when it comes to sport and that
would drive Jason crazy if we thought
that motor abilities are just those two
components that I think I've shown you
in the motor cortex are about so let me
just tell you about movement strategies
so this is a review that Jordan has done
and this is you probably know this story
but this is about the high jump okay so
this is a scissor jump so how people
used to do the high jump right and then
this happened this is the Fosbury flop
now Fosbury wasn't a particularly good
sitter jumper but he had an aha moment
and decided to do that now if you look
at the world records here's the scissors
and there was the western roll peril the
Fosbury flop so what I'm trying to say
is you could argue that within any one
of these strategies you could get
learning of the kind that I've been
talking with you about thus far right
but then you have this kachunk moment
where even if you're not a particularly
live athletic person just the cognitive
switching strategy will get you ahead of
all these really fit Western rollers and
parallel stragglers right for then that
makes you ask well if you're going to
watch someone in like a Roger Federer
where should the credit go is it the
adaptation stuff that I was telling talk
to you about is it that acuity stuff or
is it that the really good athletes a
sort of
no something that no other people don't
know right now as soon as you start
couching things this way it just opens a
Pandora's Box right because suddenly
you're beginning to argue that cognition
is having a huge role in the point
scores and then the distinction between
is inventing the Fosbury flop any less
impressive than the theory of special
relativity
so here we have them thus everyone does
this now there is none of this so
working with Richard I've read the chair
of psychology at Berkeley and Jordan
Taylor at Princeton who was in his lab
and then we're working together we
thought we'd start to look for Fosbury
flop ishness even in this so-called
totally implicit task okay so I've
already told you what happens when you
apply this strategy you drift away but
look what happens over time I never told
you this I showed you the experimenter
there but if the experiment keeps going
you overcome this sensory prediction
error override and you override it in an
intern so what is this right so here you
are cognitive strategy success of
cognitive strategy failure of cognitive
strategy success of something right so
you have this dynamic push and pull
going on presumably between different
parts of your brain and then you look at
the after effect so you say to people
look don't apply a strategy if you're
applying one and the rotation turns off
and look you're at Target error is 0 the
rotation is 45 you're after effect is
only about 15 degrees so what how did
you take up the rest of this slack it's
not implicit adaptation because the
after effect isn't up here right so it
suggests looking at it this way that
something else is going on to take up
the rest of that error so as evidence of
two processes right one seems to be
target error dependent the other one is
sensory prediction error dependent so
you've got what I told you about before
did the movement go as planned this is
the sensor prediction error did I
achieve my goal this is performance and
you basically these two things having a
little duking it out all right
and essentially this is average behavior
if you take a look at individual
subjects you see a lot of differences
and strategies and what looks like an
increase in variability which looks like
exploration so to cut a long story short
I'm not going to go to the idea is that
it seems as though you get a strategy
given you it fails and then you go wait
a minute i'm not going to stick to the
strategy the experimenter told me i'm
going to take a little walk about right
and then the idea is you do a walkabout
and then you begin to have an
incremental walk about that begins to
counter the adaptation strategy and they
cancel each other out and you get
adaptation a 0 target area and you can
assess a strategy by actually having a
series of numbers and what you do in
this experiment is you have people adapt
in a normal way but between each trial
you say where would you point next you
actually ask them to verbally report so
if each target you rotate the numbers
and you can get the report and this is
the instruction before moving tell me
where you think you should aim to get
your cursor on the target now that
question you could argue and we want it
to be the case invokes the use of a
strategy right but it isn't like the
original experiment where you tell
people aim to 45 degrees to the other
target all we say is before moving tell
me where you think you should aim to get
your coat on the target so that's all
that happens you have the numbers you
get that instruction and then you adapt
and looks fairly canonical baseline
adaptation after affair but notice the
after effect is not up here all right
so then what you do is you turn the
numbered spaces into degrees because
they're obviously fixed intervals and
you then look at the mean report that
people make across these trials so you
see that they're sort of exploring and
zigzagging about and then they fix on
this report that has a slope like this
so this is empirical data of verbal
report of where you're aiming
so does it look like an aiming strategy
which is not zero and this model that
I've told you about our working together
right and so you can decompose this
target error into the aiming strategy
the model adaptation minus the imposed
rotation and that gives you where you
should actually go all right so I'm
going to do this I'm going to take this
slide borrowed from Jordan take the
empirical global adaptation take the
report subtract them and lo and behold
you get this slow process where now the
after effect and where it reaches match
okay so what you see here then is this
we would argue is the cerebellar
dependent forward model sensory
prediction error process this is the
strategy which is undergoing change and
notice how this counters that to keep
that flat now understand so you don't
get bogged down in the details what are
we are showing you here is a kind of
task that has been tacit Lee assumed the
entirely implicit and the modern-day
analog of what made hm so famous which
is the non explicit learning process
it's not even true that even this kind
of task has a strong cognitive component
now what's interesting I don't have the
data here is if you don't put the
numbers up and you don't give the vague
instruction you still see this component
admittedly to a lesser degree so what
does it mean it means that your brain
has multiple ways to solve a problem
even a task that you think should be
left to your implicit processes is
contaminated by cognition and depending
on how you frame the problem you
actually will determine which system in
your brain is using it all right so once
you start seeing this the whole
breakdown between the practical and
theoretical just doesn't apply with
respect to task it doesn't mean that
it's not right to consider their modules
in the brain that are operating that can
be decomposed for any given task but you
mustn't make the mistake of thinking
that
modules represent the jobs and the tasks
that you do in the real world and we
don't know whether learning your French
vocabulary or learning math or learning
to do the high jump or tennis are not
all using those modules and that they
all you might be surprised that the
waiting's on them yes in fact there are
lots of projections from the lateral
cerebellar hemispheres which
fascinatingly have evolved along with an
increase in the size of the prefrontal
cortex if you look at evolution it's
been the prefrontal cortex and the
lateral cerebellar hemisphere that have
co-evolved and there are lots of data
now showing the involvement of the
cerebellum in what people have
considered cognitive tasks exactly right
the whole talk unto itself so here's the
idea that these neural systems are all
converging and playing together and sort
of coming out through motor cortex and
that we have to really reconsider the
way we dichotomize these things now
that's my last slide but I want to just
tell you where we're going okay now
those tasks you know the little cursor
going through the loop the the rotator
cuffs are super simple they're the lab
based equivalents of pong right and then
I showed you those two reviews that we
wrote one on athletes and one on motor
learning in the lab how are we going to
bridge the abyss between complex motor
tasks in the real world and these very
simple learn within a day tasks even the
one I showed you in five days so where
we're moving now and I think this is one
of the things that I did talk to eric
about before is that we've decided to
move the lab onto a pad that we think
that gaming is the key to bridging
lab-based motor learning and what most
people think motor skill is in the real
world now what I don't think that means
now they're people like Daphne Duvalier
was doing a lot of interesting work
where you take off the shelf video games
and then you begin to look at things
like a selector spatial attention septra
learning but I don't think that's the
way to go I think we need now need to
take
the capacity of doing having a lab on a
pad to do high-end longitudinal studies
over much longer time frames that has
not been done right the clear way in my
view is to think a priori about the
component brain parts the neural
processes the computational processes
and the behaviors and build them from
the ground up in games all right now I'm
just going to see if I can show you so
what would so this is just a first what
we're doing right now is we have a grant
to study traumatic brain injury now one
of the problems with traumatic brain
injury is that after a while subjects
have subjective complaints after they
recover that you can't objectively
measure I can't concentrate as well I'm
not the same person I'm not as clever as
I was and a lot of the time they get
considered that they have psychiatric
diagnosis so we have a project I'm doing
with an intensive care neurology shin at
hopkins called robert stevens and we
have a grant from the brain science
institute and we call it wake up and
walk out we're interested in people who
who were in coma after traumatic brain
injury but walked out and the reason i
wanted to study these patients is
they're telling us something about
recovery that they were in a coma and
yet they walked out of the hospital or
back into their lives and then we want
to track them over time now how do you
track people in their lives right so we
thought we would use we would develop an
ipad game and we have a group in my lab
now and i am happy to answer questions
about them afterwards we're we're really
trying to do neuroscience longitudinally
in high end with motor learning and
skill it's a big challenge because i'll
say this quite frankly you try to get
the NSF or the nih to fund you where you
say i want to follow 200 people over a
year to look at India individual
differences in there in it so this is
why we're sort of in the dark ages when
it comes to studying learning because
it takes this kind of thing I think this
is the way to do it right you having
hundreds of thousands of people coming
to your lab you know it is no throughput
but this is a way to have high
throughput so what we did is this is
just a prototype of a game where we want
to study the recovery of multitasking
after brain injury and sopra me Troy and
omar ahmad and the artist Kat Kat
McNally have teamed up to start
developing this these games to study
these patients in and so this is a just
an example of this it's not that
compliment Reese the size that works up
I don't know why it does that I'll keep
it small
so this is that this is a beautiful
little thing I mean this isn't this is
this is an ant car this is a not this is
a physically realized creature with its
own physics this is not an animation
okay and what these patients have to do
is to stay in the orange piece of the
track and then not allow themselves to
be distracted by the little fighters
that come and the idea is with your
finger you have to hit the red one but
not hit the blue one and the idea is
when you're trying to both pay attention
to a contingent capture task and
maintain accuracy can you in fact do
both now there's very little literature
on motor skill in the setting of motor
tasking almost nothing actually and so
what's fascinating is that you can see
what we're seeing in the preliminary
data are that you get differential
effects on each of the tasks right and
at the moment in healthy subjects that
we've piloted in they seem to be able to
maintain most of the time on track but
they start to fail at the contingent
capture when they actually have to also
drive right even though you look fine
and both so in other words the idea is
that the patients may look perfectly
fine if you ask them to do the driving
part and perfectly fine if we do the
contingent capture and yet as soon as
you ask them to do both they start to
break down now this is extremely simple
it's very beautiful I mean the controls
very smooth and people enjoy it very
much but this is just the tip of the
iceberg in terms of what you could begin
to build up from the ground in terms of
cognitive components to learning if you
go to our website I don't know if you
can pull it up I guess I could do it
here right I'm online I'm going to show
you our latest just to tell you what
we're now doing okay
don't break down no no look at some
level way yes you can yes so this is
just the new cover to what the front
page of our website and what we're doing
now is this is an exoskeletal 3d robot
which basically can assist 3d movement
of the arm and what we've been doing is
we've been working with the aquarium in
baltimore and i don't have video here
but it's because you know i don't know
how but debate basically what's been
created by our group are unbelievably
gorgeous synthetic fully realized animal
simulations right so the and the
aquarium is the current time negotiating
with after maybe have an installation in
the aquarium so the idea is that you end
up living in animal space as a patient
after injury and the movements you make
and we're using the Kinect full
disclosure are now allowing patients to
exist in an avatar space with a fully
realized animal in this case dolphins
while they get assistance with the earth
girl robot the level of pleasure and
reward that this is giving in order for
patients to explore space is
unparalleled right now we're very
excited about this and others are too
and I think this is exactly what has
been missing in the neuroscience of
learning and recovery is the confluence
of computational principles proper task
decomposition and the whole world of
motion capture and reward and gaming
that essentially goes unappreciated in
the biomedical world we presented the
this project to the president at Hopkins
and everyone was there CS engineering
neuroscience and it people suddenly and
they said to us I you know we suddenly
think we're seeing the future now
right but in order to develop good
science to prove the intuition that all
this gorgeousness and interactivity is
is real it requires publications and
study and it's hard to do dolphin is a
robot no oh yes they say it's a 3d
animation the current animations
allegedly haven't candid like what
they've developed as a physically
realized object that responds in
unexpected ways to inputs night so
having the inputs on that nicer skeleton
to the 3d simulation
is there um you studied with a my study
learning of the joint the joint task
situation or the con going to get better
at that yeah so we're doing that yeah
would you know necessarily curve there
hey how'd you characterize that you know
it's some system I you know it's so new
that I the only way we're going to get
to answer that question in my view is
because people are different I mean some
people take risks other people are
cautious right the exploration
exploitation trade-off some people do it
one way and some people sacrifice one
versus the other the only way we're
going to know is to parameterize it like
you suggested and have a not high enough
n to begin to see because what if you do
what people do I mean I showed you the
what happens when you average the data
the smooth turnaround point that I
showed that's not what any individual
does right it's what happens in your
average to data so and that's what all
studies do you have 12 subjects 15
subjects your average the data but what
we're beginning to notice is the tasks
get more complex there are
idiosyncrasies that people show their
not arbitrary they are alternative ways
to save the solve the same problem and
that's what we need so now with
multitasking just it if I were just say
that I'm gonna use my prefrontal cortex
my motor cortex and my cerebellum to do
the task and I'm going to do you know
2010 70 waiting to do it and another
person says I'm going to do is all my
prefrontal cortex and I'm going to know
model-based and then you average the
data for those two subjects you get
nothing that's that's what we're also
waiting mid-late this for intense
test and question if there's lots of
butter literature like Sterling's wrkn
someone on joint visual tasks rightly
dual tasks scenario with visual search
that might have them up a lot of fear in
terms of the emotions of confounding and
learning because jewel charts me just
becoming dual tasks have been done most
of the time to show automaticity that at
a certain point you're no longer
interfered with by the dual task isn't
that the emphasis has not been on seeing
the dual task as a task in toto that has
to be learned right in other words if
tennis is a quadruple task right you
have to be looking at the courgette of
look at your opponent you'll be deciding
what you're going to do the score people
don't say that the overall task of
tennis is a dual or multi task
interference but that so this it's
framed in the wrong way what I'm saying
is everything that is actually what we
care about is a task made of components
all of which need to be learned together
and that's just not in the motor domain
it's not studying even the perceptual
too many people are usually studying
interference they're not studying
combination of the tasks and it's very
hard to do right because it means that
you're going to have to build the task
from the ground up be able to
parametrize its components and then
study enough people and it's not been
done that's what we that's what we'd
like to do and that's what the gaming is
for let's do the chemistry
just a few minutes before noon to never
actually mentioned earlier some
long-term motor actress or skill
acquisition years ago there was worked
on before people learning to
who's that Jasper
there's the learning
Morse code yes there they studied
individuals so they see current
individuals over the course of years yes
learning it and you can see some
interesting plateaus with sort of like
your tie Johnny example right I mean
those how people have actually looked in
detail at what might be happening during
those sort of plateaus and subsequent
shows there's nothing on it because you
see when you talk about those classic
studies there they take very global
distal measures they're not looking at
the actual kinematics the actual
movements that you're making right in
other words that's a very what we need
is the ability to see what the motor
systems implementation of the learning
is doing over long periods of time right
when they learning Morse code no one
cares that the way you actually tap the
keys right it's it's it's what we need
is a way to actually get kinematics as
well as the more global measure of
performance and that just those studies
have never reaction time get studied a
lot but reaction time the meaning of the
reaction time to motor learning is
extremely we feel and this is
controversial I won't show don't show
these data that there is no relationship
between the reaction time and the
complexity of the actual movement that
you execute right so I don't think it's
a very good measure yeah so just about
how would you explain the studying's
agreed with their private and 70s with
each other
complexity actually affects the reaction
time just in planning so learning
complex movement and then a great
question right right even performed with
movement just the reaction time all
right okay good great question so first
of all we would have to define what we
mean by complexity right you don't want
to be circular right you're gonna say
I'm going to call the movement complex
if the reaction time increases right so
what would have to have some orthogonal
definition of the complexity agree upon
that and then start looking at the
reaction time okay now the question you
are asking is where is the reaction time
being spent is it what am I going to do
so in other words we are doing an
experiment I now with a patient aaron
wong and it's very cool you just have
gates like this and you're basically in
here and you have to get in there so you
go up like that and you go okay now what
about this one look I have to do that
right now you could argue and then you
have the easiest in the world which is
that sure so you could say all right I'm
going to look at the reaction times for
this versus the reaction times for that
and lo and behold the reaction time for
this there's a gradient of increasing
reaction time okay now why is it because
it's more difficult to execute this
movement or is it because you have to
decide to make that movement to solve a
problem so if you now just show this and
you give people the solution and just
ask them to trace out that solution the
reaction time drops to that level even
though they're still having to make that
complicated movement did you see what
I'm saying so it suggests that what is
happening in the reaction-time this is
very preliminary is what do I need to do
what trajectory is going to solve this
problem the actual execution of that
trajectory isn't necessarily going to
make that much more a demand on you than
making that one that's the argument we'd
like to me this is preliminary but
that's it could be that there's a little
bit of a difference even once you've
controlled for that but that's not the
bulk of the reaction time is that that's
what we would argue
so to mention the patient and by name
actually location is this well to
mention his name hm Ortiz itself though
aaron wong is a postdoc was doing yes
yeah no no no no no aaron aaron wong is
the postdoc doing this experiment no no
I've been a doctor too long to make that
mistake the Aaron what no i was giving
credit to a post doc who's actually
doing an experiment very much along the
lines of you're saying yeah yeah so
there's a lot of variability once people
learn skills like high school or
professional athlete you know sometimes
they'll be in the flow be laying very
well sometimes it's an off night or
something in the idea cognitively what's
going on there said committee research
at all right so we did it so there's
this idea of the warm-up decrement right
so no we're wondering about that about
there are three potential explanations
for it right one is is that
physiologically you're not feeling it's
not your skill in that task per se it's
just your body's cold you're not feeling
right so when people say for example to
doctors you know I just don't feel right
today feel washed out and just not
myself doctors go whatever writes me but
it's a turned out that there's this
whole new idea of the interest
interoceptive system which is coined as
the afferent version of your autonomic
nervous system there are nerve endings
unmyelinated small nerve endings
everywhere in your body on in blood
vessels in the skin it's where it seems
like you can detect changes in PH you
can detect parasitic infestation you
just you're much more wired up for
athletes now it's not labeled lines and
so much that what happens is it that all
goes to your insula it doesn't go to
your sensory motor cortex and that's
where you feel disgust and these washed
out feelings so there is this part of
your brain which seems to read out in a
global way the state that your body is
in right now one thing that could happen
is that there are days when athletes
are just not in a good state he said
they're just they actually aren't a
hundred percent right and then and then
that leads to adjust a general reduction
in the quality of your fake having a
cold if you are and we know just to
finish that there's something phenomenon
after stroke or peeling the onion so
you're a patient you've had a stroke and
you've recovered and then you get a cold
or you drink too many glasses of wine or
you take a benzodiazepine and your focal
stroke symptoms come back and these
patients will go to the emergency room
and be and you know it's serious because
oh my god we need to give them TPA again
right and what you're doing is you're
peeling the onion there people at
Columbia Lazar and Randy Marshall been
studying this by giving patients under
IRB conditions these benzos to get the
recapitulate the deficit so what you're
seeing then is a drug that's making you
overall sedated or virus making you feel
systemically ill leading to a focal
deficit right so I'm stretching it I'm
saying that imagine then that you don't
have to have a stroke or a virus or UTI
but you're just not feeling quite right
and you're picking that up with your
interceptor system you just aren't going
to be 90 100 percent and then well so
that's one the other one is is that you
do something where people choke which is
like a cognitive interference which is
that you start trying to use a module to
solve a task that you would be better
off leaving to another one right and so
it's match point you know I'm about to
win Wimbledon what's this I'm holding
right yeah you know it's it's a racket
that's right you know and and and and
and that's what some people think
choking is it's you you have leave it to
the modules and you override so that
that's the other possibility is that the
that just like I've shown cooperation
between modules you can get conflict
between them and it may well be that
that conflict is it is the problem and
then the third one is is that you
actually have a warm-up decrement you
you're just not warmed up enough
and so you you should have spent another
30 minutes hitting before you went onto
the court and we all know about the
warm-up detriment so those those are the
three things that I think are doing it
and I'm sure many slides and these days
we don't actually figure out what that
may actually even is and that's a that's
a whole issue right right okay not at
