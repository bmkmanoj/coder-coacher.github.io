Redmond I started the India internship
program we got about 45 or so
applications nominations from faculty in
India for students or potential interns
these were undergraduate students as
opposed to the usual PhD interns in
treatment and push meet Kali was one of
the interns in the first batch I was
born in Dehradun there this is this
valley town in the foothills of the
Himalayas in North India I ended up
studying in this sort of University in
South India this lation is you know
technology vari-angle
that's where I did my computer science
and engineering degree now when I went
to that college you have to understand
that for the first 17 years of my life I
had sort of lived in a circle of 50
kilometres bushmeat is a very very
bright student I mean I think that his
career you know speaks for itself
he was a great fine one day out of the
blue I get this email from a research
scientist in Microsoft Research
statement and the email read like this
push me
I like your CV I'm looking for interns
through this MSR India program and I
would like to interview you I was quite
intimidated I mean this is proper
research and two days later I'm on a
flight from Delhi to Amsterdam to
Seattle Rashmi does an interesting case
he actually came with the expectation
that he would work on computer vision
but we had placed him in the software
engineering area and I meet Apple French
sure today and he basically tells me
that Oh
which means what we are going to work on
is testing device drivers so I told them
I have no clue what you're talking about
I have not worked on device driver and
he said no no no you will see you will
see there is a connection and there was
a meeting with some very senior
developer
and this researcher and they were
talking about all the problems that
could happen and how difficult this
problem is at the end of this meeting
basically my manager said don't worry
you'll resolve all these sort of
questions we have a new intern bushmeat
at the end of this internship all these
things will be resolved and I was
thinking what is he talking about
so I go back to an immanent I tell him
and then then there has been a big
mistake so initially he was a little
unhappy about it uncomfortable with it
so he came to me and said I really want
to work in computer vision I said okay
let me see if I can figure out a way to
do this I'm gonna come back came back
from London office my manager came back
and said okay push me this is what we
warned this is architecture and this is
how we are going to test the device
driver so that was maybe Thursday or
Friday and on Monday I had a I had a
first sort of fun so the magic came into
for a check on what I had done and I
showed him okay this is the piece of
code I wrote and then I did a test and
it wasn't Frank it was able to find some
bugs and he was like this is it this was
what we wanted what we wanted to do in
that three month internship I was like
ah CV nos that's done here changed his
mind he came to me and said now I really
like what I'm doing in this group so I
want to continue to work there and after
that dinner he was fine the managers and
the search team told me that I should be
thinking about a PhD the intern project
that push me did when he came back in
2006 I was with a team of three other
people including and with it's given an
internship is typically blue skies
research it's some idea that we don't
yet know if it's going to work we have
no idea whether or not it's going to be
in a product but it's some of scientific
interest or it will make the world a
better place if we solve the problem and
what they produced is some I think one
of the most beautiful things I've seen
coming out of the lab they called it
unwrap mosaic and what's going on is a
detailed analysis of a movie in terms of
its three-dimensional structure so for
example we had
trip in which somebody was walking
through a space you take one frame draw
a mustache on the person's face and now
that mustache is in is in every frame of
the movie looking right even when the
person turns around it's fully
three-dimensional it's an amazing effect
and after that he joined MSF Cambridge
and he's really risen up to be one of
her you know most talented young
researchers in computer vision and
machine learning area my first
internship was nine years ago from that
time now I have supervised around 15
interns already so it's it's interesting
experience to be on the other side of
the fence and you're trying to live up
to the standards that were set by your
mentor is during your internships and
you know the quality of researchers that
we have is so good that they get exposed
probably the best in the world in every
area that they work on so not only do
they learn by doing research but also
become very familiar with the way
researchers work and a broad range of
people a very high quality just being in
the organization and being able to sort
of talk to people who are so passionate
about their sort of projects and they're
so willing to actually not only work
with you but also teach you the things
that you would want to learn I think
that is something unique
each year Microsoft Research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
