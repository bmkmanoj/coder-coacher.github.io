research I like exploring new ideas and
working with new technologies and
Microsoft research is an excellent place
to do that so I'm a research software
developer and that means that I work
very closely with researchers to take
some of their ideas and implement them
to test them to evaluate them to
generate graphs for an academic paper I
might go on and write the evaluation
section of the paper but we'll also for
example do much more complete
implementations of the work so that we
can actually run systems at scale or
that we can in fact do some technology
transfer take those ideas and move them
across to product teams so my group they
systems a networking team we build real
systems from the ground up sometimes and
we also investigate different network
architectures different ways of
connecting computers routing data
between them and we will do everything
from small prototypes that we will build
just to see if the core of an idea works
all the way up through to full systems
that we then might hand over to a
product team to then perhaps be turned
into a product if it's been a successful
research project one of the nice things
about research is that yes I've been
doing the same job for 12 years but it's
not really been the same job because
I've been working on different projects
so every say two to three years I will
start working on a different project so
six years ago I learned a lot about
compilers three years ago I learned a
lot about hard drives when I was in the
compiler work I knew very little about
hard drives and now I know an awful lot
about hard drives that's the nice thing
about doing research in a commercial
setting is that you get to try and lots
of different things and if I'd been
doing the same thing for three years I'd
probably be bored but I'm not so I'm not
each year Microsoft Research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
