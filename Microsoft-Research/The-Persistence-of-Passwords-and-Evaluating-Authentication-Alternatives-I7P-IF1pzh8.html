hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
um alright so we're going to get started
here I'm it's a pleasure to introduce
our palvin or shot from Carleton
University who's going to talk about
passwords and stuff today um Paul's been
around for a long time he's his
professor at Carleton he's been an
industry and and academia he's uh maybe
best known as the author of the the
handbook on cryptography which is you
know a monster a monster citation thing
he's got a whole bunch of other things I
won't bother going going through them
but one of the fun facts from his bio is
that he was in the auto the the Waterloo
Warriors basketball team for four for
four years as an undergraduate um so
anyway without further ado Paul on the
persistence of passwords thank you
cormega and I noticed the handbook of
applied crypto was not one of the books
on your shelters I'm gonna ask you a
little bit more about well it's but
probably on the top of your desk getting
this yeah but anyways thanks for having
me here and thanks for for taking your
time out of your day to 210 um I am
going to talk mainly about a couple of
papers actually a lot of this is work
I've done with Cormac soccer Mac will be
the most bored person in the room we all
know a lot about passwords and we want
to try make some progress on solving
some research problems issues related to
password so I'm hoping I'm a company I
might get a chance to chat with while
I'm here for a couple of more days and
this might set a bit of a baseline for
some discussion there and get out of the
way all the things that we agree on we
usually spend all of our time talking
about so we can maybe get to some
research questions and figure out what
we should study next so a couple of
quotes and these are other some papers
and the first one I think is it is the
one that researchers who claim to do
research in this area should really take
to heart and that's the continued
domination of passwords over although
the methods of end user authentication
it really you know we should take this
as a major embarrassment to ourselves
especially if we're the ones who
continue to propose a year after year
things which are far far better than
passwords and none of which ever see the
light of day for a lot of reasons that
we don't talk about or we don't
understand and and you know i'm
personally tired of reading papers and
you know hopefully I don't write too
many of them but you know all these
papers that we propose things that are
much better well somehow we must have
something wrong if we think there's so
much better and and yet they don't get
the uptake in the real world and we all
seem to agree you know the enthusiasm
that most all parties show for getting
rid of passwords it hasn't translated
into support for any single alternative
so there's something wrong here and I
think it's that we we aren't gathering
up all of our information properly
although we all have a lot of opinions
and as soon as we get into discussion
you're all going to tell me your
individual stories about passwords and
they're all going to be very interesting
but very few of them move the yardsticks
ahead and that's what we actually want
to try and do so that you know 20 years
from now we're not having this same
conversation about how we haven't made
any progress in 20 years and yet we all
have more password so one of the things
that we do believe is that to make
progress we have to systematize our
knowledge a little bit better try and
agree upon the things that should be
agreeable upon if we get the red experts
together so at least we can say okay
this is what we know and this is where
we have to go and this is these are the
questions that are still open but seems
we can't even agree upon the things we
should be able to agree upon and that's
what I think you know systematization
here is a bit about so these quotes so
in the talk i'll give the records of it
now there's there's a paper that Cormac
can I wrote in securing practicing
magazine in january-february this year
called research agenda acknowledging the
persistence of passwords and then we and
two other co-authors Frank's I you know
and Joe bono Cambridge had a paper at
Oakland this year the quest to replace
passwords and I think most of these are
probably from the first from the first
paper but some of them might be from the
second and a lot of this talk is really
stop material taken from that and
talking about two particular an
authentication framework we put forth in
the Oakland paper but I think we see
that more as a first step than a last
step ok so in praise of passwords you
know everyone tells us what they hate
about passwords but it turns out that
actually are a lot of good things that
pass
have going for them and and most of them
actually are pretty hard to replicate in
the alternatives that we propose and if
we look at alternatives that are
proposed and people propose their
alternatives and they don't really state
what their requirements are they just
tell you what their proposal isn't they
don't even tell you what problem they're
solving they're solving the password
problem but what exactly is the problem
what are their objectives do they have
the same criteria in mind that you do
and I think actually stating what your
objectives are or the lack of stadiums
one of the problems so for example um is
defense against malware on the end
client is that one of the objectives
that that should be met by alternatives
I mean if it is anything almost all you
know browser based password managers
should get thrown at the window most
federated schemes probably should get
through out the window so if you if
malware on the incline does one of your
one of your threats that you're trying
to address you know that should be
stated explicitly and then it turns out
that a lot of the alternative proposed
you know they just we should end
discussion of the right off the bat but
we don't even seem to agree upon what
what the threat models are that the
alternatives should have it also turns
out because there are so many different
stakeholders we do have a lot of
different interests and and the threat
models of the different stakeholders or
the factors that they weigh heavily as
being important or very different so you
know you take the website website owners
you take the users you take the
corporation's users work for you take
the browser manufacturers you take the
other software companies everyone's got
a little bit of a different list where
you know who loses out who has to pay
what costs what liabilities are there
something goes wrong and so everyone's
list is a little bit different and that
makes coming up with a replacement that
challenging so it's actually a lot
harder than it seems to come up with a
replacement mechanism an alternative is
it's not in any way a simple security
usability trade-off in fact a lot of the
security requirements compete not only
against usability but against other
security requirements some of which
are contradictory deployability is
hugely understated and doesn't get much
attention in the academic papers you
know the economics the quote here is the
economics might play a larger role as
technology who has to pay for what these
these riches which aren't the standard
types of problems that we solve as
computer scientists and are we looking
for one single solution that solves all
the password problems in the world or
are we looking in each scenario in each
environment for the best fit for that
invariant environment and scenario which
means we're going to have many more than
just one solution replacing passwords
some people think you want the silver
bullet and I think we're going to be you
know waiting another 20 years and still
wonder where the silver bullet so that
it seems clear to me the silver bullet
hasn't happened it's very unlikely to
happen but then we have to admit we're
not we're going to have to take several
other solutions how do we weigh the
requirement so if we look at all the
different stakeholders the properties
that they think are important are
different and they should be different
and and in different environments they
also pick up different so how how do we
come up with those factors I think
that's still that's part of the ongoing
future work but it has to be
acknowledged I think that there is a
real diversity of players and
stakeholders involved which leads to
differing requirements so a couple of
challenges in evaluation and and I guess
we we talk about this as the the pie
slice problem so if you think about all
the different threat vectors and you
know maybe you know the standard advice
we give everyone is choose longer more
complex difficult to guess passwords
well that it makes it harder for users
from a usability point of view it helps
not at all against keylogger attacks it
helps not at all against phishing
attacks and so now do we know that the
the brute force or online guessing
attacks are where ninety-five percent of
the problems are
because if they're not and if Alice
ninety-five percent of our problems are
key loggers and all that nonsense we
tell people about choosing longer
passwords is really a disservice to them
but so we don't know how big the pie
slices are in terms of which threats can
contribute which percentage of the
damage but further to that it is is the
point that there's a difference between
a pass for being compromised and they're
actually being harmed to an end user so
if there's a keylogger that gets your
password that doesn't necessarily mean
that that you've lost anything because
your password hasn't been exploited if
there's if it's a password for a bank
account and the charges are reversed
after the money taken out was there
actually harm so how do we even if we
didn't know all the pie slices and we
know how many passwords were lost by
what means how does that translate to
user harm we don't have the data on that
so we're when we're trying to figure out
what the best alternative is and we're
trying to figure out you know does the
cost is a cost greater or is the the
damage done greater than the cost of an
alternative we don't even know how to
measure the costs and so we need some
more data and that's not easy data to
get so we can come up with some
estimates and some plans but I think we
have to acknowledge that we're kind of
data poor here um and that in the
absence of some of this data then we
can't come up with conclusive decision
um a separate problem is lack of
scientific method and this I think goes
to what I think of as a computer science
culture or values problem the type of
work most most of us in the room are
probably from some sort of computer
science or engineering background and
you know the types of things that we
were taught and we somehow came the
valuer like timing how fast things are
and doing mathematical things we most
people don't like anything to do with
end users I mean they're messy and they
get in the way and they complain a lot
of we have if we actually have to run
user studies with real people that's you
have to get approval from
you know corporations or university
board this slows things down and not
everyone agrees and so there's there's
things that that you know in other
disciplines they just take for granted
these are things we have to deal with we
run users then that's not done very much
in computer science and we're bursting a
little bit of a shift the last five or
ten years there's more push towards
usability and security and there's a
strong little sub community but by and
large this is not something that our
broad computer science community values
or does very well or even understands
how to referee so I think that's a
longer standing problem in terms of
publishing and coming up with criteria
on how to evaluate that complicates it I
put this down to really a lack of
scientific method we don't actually do
science in computer science the way that
you do in a lot of the other natural
sciences are and that's a whole separate
discussion we could have and I know that
discussion has been had and it will
continue to go on then I've got this
point here about cherry picking against
that versus benchmark so a lot of the
papers and proposals that you see
written and presented they put forth
their proposal without telling you
really what problem they're solving
other than the the authentication your
password problem and then they pick one
or two things where their proposal
shines it and then they talk about how
it's better than all the others and they
somehow don't talk about the 18 areas
where what they're proposing has
problems and we kind of I don't know we
kind of accept a lot of these papers and
we wish we don't have what I would say
is a standard evaluation methodology and
so that's what I think is one of the
biggest piece is missing that we we
should evaluate even though some factors
are more important than others some
properties are more important notice in
different environments and scenarios we
should still evaluate new proposals
across all these different factors and
then after we see how they rate on the
different factors which allows us to
compare them to alternatives we can say
which might be more appropriate in which
environments and scenarios but we found
we to date hadn't done that too much and
that's a big part of this the paper that
that I with Rio Rico authors including
Cormac here had presented it at Oakland
this year and I'll talk a little bit
more about about that so we came up with
what we call a usability deployability
security evaluation framework UDS
evaluation framework and the idea is
specifically this was for remote
authentication for internet
authentication not to a local laptop but
to a remote web site because the
problems are a little bit different if
you're if you're authenticating just to
a local laptop in terms of threat model
and technologies that work really well
so we came up with 25 characteristics or
benefits properties that we framed as
benefit so we frame the property as a
positive for comparing different
proposals eight of them were categorized
as usability related six of them were
categorized as deployability related in
11 were categorized as security related
and there's no there's nothing really
magical about that set of 25 but amongst
the four co-authors we argued back and
forth about which ones we should include
and there's a second list of things that
if we wanted to extend the list we can
include but those were 25 that we
thought were interesting as a baseline
and then we came up with an evaluation
methodology using those 25 properties
and then we did kind of a benchmark
analysis of 35 different schemes which
actually helped us refine which 25
benefits to that we thought should be in
the course and also the definitions of
those 25 benefits evolved a little bit
as we iteratively scored and change the
criteria and then rescored the
alternatives so I'll go through a little
bit here of a discussion of what the
what the 25 properties are and then a
couple of the schemes including basic
passwords how we rated those and then
some overall conclusions that we drew
and where to go as next steps so um
before I get into the properties if we
look at all the different password
alternatives um we can group them into
categories of schemes and that helps us
compare things as well and and these are
all this is a lot of the schemes that we
evaluated is in this list here so there
are password managers these are built
into the browser's as one category so
they're built into browsers like Firefox
then there are standalone password
managers things like LastPass and some
of them are cloud based on some of them
are client base there are schemes that
involve proxies so you've got your end
client and you've got websites you're
trying to log into and then there will
be some proxima machine that your client
goes to and it will communicate within
schemes and those proxies can address
some of the concerns and give deliver
some of the characteristics that we want
they're what we call the federated
schemes or variations of single sign-on
schemes where somehow you log on once
somewhere to to some third party and
that third party then we'll get you
logged into a bunch of other schemes
there are graphical password schemes
where they're this is really is the end
result is a password just like a text
password it'sit's a string to compare to
verify against with the end sites going
to verify against the idea with
graphical passwords it was the claim is
that we can leverage some inherent
advantages of our visual system for
memory or usability or something like
that there are a category of what we
call cognitive schemes where the end
user has some secret in mind whether
it's a picture image based or whether
it's text-based or something and there's
a challenge and the user somehow
translates the challenge using the
secret that they have into some response
so there's some sort of cognitive
workload has to go on in the user's mind
in answering the challenge there are
paper token schemes so the paper token
schemes tip
eglee these involve lists of one-time
passwords are very very popular in
Europe actually a side point to mention
here our categorization here it's it's
it's there's several different ways you
could categorize schemes so we have a
scheme called paper tokens we didn't
actually in the in the Oakland paper
formally have a category called one-time
passwords games because some of the
one-time passwords games also involve
Hardware tokens which is a different
category so we could categorize things a
little bit there's some alternatives
that you can choose and categorize and
teams there's biometric teams we all
know the standard biometric schemes it
turns out that that again they have
certain advantages in you know
supervised environments and they tend to
be less appropriate for remote
authentication over the web for some
well-known reasons there's schemes
involving Hardware tokens USB keys
dedicated Hardware their schemes
involving cell phones or smartphones
used as an exhilarating that you're
logging in with your smartphone or cell
phone but they're logging in with a
laptop or desktop machine and you're
somehow using your your smartphone as a
second channel or a trusted path or
something to provide a property you
can't get with a desktop machine alone
and then there's kind of complicating
the mudding the water a little bit of
these password recovery schemes because
they're not really typically password
replacement schemes but they always come
into discussion when we do talk about
password schemes so what I'll do here
I'll go through the 25 25 different well
I don't know if I'll go through all them
but I'll try and give a flavor other
types of benefits we're talking about
here and so there you you won through
you ate are the usability than six
deployability and 11 security-related
actually the last two our privacy
related as well so this is for what we
call legacy passwords or you know
ordinary web passwords
this is how we rated it so on this
scheme here on this coding here black is
sorry so green means we grant the full
benefit so for example passwords have
nothing to carry if the if passwords are
remembered in your mind you don't have
anything to carry because you're
typically other than your own body we
don't call that carrying anything so
text passwords get a full benefit of
nothing to carry we have this category
called Kwazii or this rating called
Kwazii which means almost and infrequent
error so with text passwords you have
almost infrequent errors usually we
don't make too many mistakes typing in
our passwords we type pretty well
sometimes the latkes is set and we make
some errors sometimes you're on a
strange keyboard to make technik but
generally we almost we have almost
infrequent errors there and a missing so
the black ones here means that we don't
have that benefit so text passwords
memory wise effortless well it turns out
if you have 50 passwords even if you're
using a lot of them you still have to
remember stuff and as you get additional
accounts the cognitive load goes up so
passwords text passwords don't score
well there are they scalable for users
okay we're talking about 5050 passwords
vs 100 passwords vs 3 it's not very
scalable text passwords more accounts
means more load nothing to Carrick it
physically effortless so um for text
passwords you do have to type that's a
physical effort as opposed to some other
schemes where there's actually no
physical effort whatsoever so we don't
grab that benefit for passwords I mean
it's not a big effort but it is an
effort right Facebook Connect you
actually don't have to do any physical
effort how easy to learn well passwords
have a great advantage here because
they're kind of you know the first thing
you learn when you get your first
computer so it so maybe the maybe the
the grounds unfair here the rating
scheme is tilted towards passwords but
we give passwords easy to learn we give
them that benefit efficient views
yeah we can login in a couple of seconds
maybe five seconds if you if you have to
a very long password and stuff but
infrequent errors talk to it easy
recovery from Los one of them one of the
big challenges with a lot of other
schemes is if somehow you lose your
authentication device or token or
whatever how do you get recovery with
passwords we have various ways of
regaining and password either you know
over the time we've iterated different
schemes and so depends on the
environment but sometimes you can get
mail basket backup password sometimes
you can call it the helpline and
enterprise a corporate environment but
typically you don't have to wait three
days to get a new hardware token shipped
with text passwords right so it's got
that accessible is about people who have
not cognitive but physical challenges so
the two big categories here are blind
users and motor impaired users and we
call the baseline we set here was for if
again skewed a bit towards text
passwords if you can use if users can
use text passwords but they can't use an
alternative than we would penalize those
proposals in accessibility so this is
skewed towards text passwords
you're right so we talked about
for good properties of
the password okay and one of them was
and you should be able to easily tell
your secretary about your password
delegation yeah so we don't we don't
have that up let me let me just think if
that falls into one of the other okay
look there's there's a lot we can we
could come up ourselves with another 25
properties that are nice to have um that
turns out to be a huge one if you go to
anyone who's in a senior management
position if you propose an alternative
and you can't have the secretary read
your email all your way that won't get
approved for interviews never do that
you need an authority delegation
mechanism to let your secretary read
your email it is not involved giving her
your off man yeah yeah you're absolutely
right but it turns out that a lot of
proposals don't even like to do that
right and those schemes will get
squashed by the senior people but that
we see the delegation sit in this
delegation fit in too I don't think we
have that amongst the usability
properties would show up in as a
negative and some of the security stuff
I guess cuz a lot of a replay in some
sense uh yeah but but I guess you could
envision yeah but I guess you could
envision delegation schemes that don't
impact security as well so we tell
because then that also brings into play
whether you have replication right and
and but I'd be interested to look up his
his data for their dirt if you're using
a biometric for example and you die your
next of kin cannot use that biometric to
get back at your online data
they need to get to your stock plan or
anything tonight without telling your
password you have the same property I
might understand but you can write down
your password of putting your will and
lots of people do what I can't do that
with a biometric so there is something
there is some usability factor there
that's worth capturing because unless
you it's a deployability issue to make
every website on the internet that uses
passwords to go and also build a
delegation feature for this purpose that
whatever miss safe box with your will
drink a can of coke with a safe deposit
box let me get for a couple more so
negligible cost per user that becomes
important if you're if you're trying to
have a lot of users and grow company
cheaply but in general cost per user we
thought was important server compatible
do you have to change if with if you put
out up on alternative do you have to
have a couple hundred thousand or a
couple million or tens of millions
websites all of a sudden change what
they're doing in order to adapt to a new
scheme that's not so good so server
compatible is important browser
compatible do you have to change
anything on the desktop and or can you
get access with this new alternative for
passwords without changing any anything
on the client desktop with an ordinary
browser can you get in is it mature
technology has it been used outside of
research environments by the same people
that are proposing it and telling you
it's a good scheme has it has it been
used by people not involved with with
inventing the scheme has it been used by
hundreds of thousands of people in a
real world environment is it
non-proprietary do you have to license
stuff do you have to intellectual
property Orser is their secret you know
trade secrets involved or do you have to
believe people when they do their
security analysis that are secure can
you actually look at it yourself so is
it open source now the security ones
resilient to physical observation i
guess you can think about this as
shoulder surfing including with
recording by you know camera camera
devices is it resilient into target
impersonation if I know Crispin and I
know Kristen's got a cat named fluffy
and these drives a Porsche and whatever
does this information help me guess his
password is it resilient to throttle
guessing so throttle guessing and we
also have a nun throttle guessing so I
guess you can it's not quite the same
look at the definitions but one of these
is essentially online type guessing
11ins essentially offline type guessing
is it resilient to internal observation
if we have malware in the client or if
we have malware on the communications
link and if you're using SSL let's
assume that ssl fails for now because
maybe there's pki problems or some other
issue so if your internal to the
communication channel or the machine is
your scheme going to Brazilian so for
example one time password schemes even
if you observed 11 password going over
SSL you got inside the channel that one
password would not help you on the next
login resilient to leaks from other
verifiers so if there's a bunch of
different websites and for example you
reuse a password and they're storing
password hashes one can leak a database
that would help you log into another
that's the property we're looking at
that's the property we're looking at
there I'm sure never in any Microsoft
run resilient to fishing resilient to
theft the theft one in particular we're
thinking about schemes involving
hardware devices or smartphones or
something where you physically steal
something we don't think of this um
theft for something that's in your mind
we don't think of that as being
susceptible to theft so kind of by
definition is resilient if you write
your passwords down and there's a piece
of paper that can be stolen then that's
subject to theft but when we when we
think about base passwords we're not
thinking about password lists you've
written down so we do grant basic text
passwords to be resilient to theft do
you have to have third parties you have
to have trust in third parties does it
require explicit consent we think that
it's it's beneficial if you have to
explicitly from a security perspective
you have to explicitly authorize the the
you know an authentication as opposed to
again there's some schemes where
automatically everything's authenticated
without you even being aware is a user
and unlink able so here we're thinking
about not reusing user ID names but i
guess the canonical example here is if
you think about biometrics there
linkable your biometrics going to be the
same on all kinds of different
applications so that's an example where
would not have the unlinking book
property but generally passwords can be
used in a way that are on linkable if
you reuse your passwords everywhere and
if you reuse your usernames that that's
a difference so this kind of you know I
don't want to go into a big long
discussion of which benefits should
should be added here and which ones are
less important this happens to be the
baseline for the paper that we presented
that we used and we think it's an
interesting as a starting point from
which other people might choose which
set of 25 or 45 or 20 properties they
might want to use and then once you
decide upon your list all the schemes
that you're comparing should get rated
against the same list okay so I don't
think it's worth going through I want to
leave some time for discussion but we
could go through it and for the Firefox
encrypted password manager see what
properties it got it got and on this
scheme on this coding here I've added a
plus if this is a benefit which is a
better rating than text passwords and a
minus if its a rating that's worse than
regular text passwords in the chart i'll
show you later and in in the Oakland
paper we actually had a little
difference game which we had red and
green which showed which were
improvements or not there's different
ways of doing this one-time passwords
over SMS text messages we can go through
that in general this is what the table
looks like and here are all the 25
properties here are all the 35 schemes
that we rated and hear all the fun yeah
so here's the green as better read as
worse full dot means has the benefit
hollow dot means almost has the benefit
or Kwazii blank means doesn't have the
benefit so we had a lot of interesting
conversations over a lot of phone calls
and we changed all of these dots
probably every
about six different times and to finally
get where I'm most I think most of these
are probably more or less right and some
of them you know it depends on the
definition but the exercise of going
through and comparing schemes now more
important than what the actual dots are
comparing comparing you know two
different password managers on all of
these properties and then saying well
which one for this property is this
scheme better than this scheme a the the
the dots in here don't really matter as
much as thinking about how does the
scheme do on this property and also I
mean if you're filling out a chart like
this the blank is kind of like a zero
rating in the dots kind of a1 rating and
the i guess the hollow dot the Kwazii
maybe you might think of that as an
almost or a point nine writing you
know you could go through this and maybe
have a zero partial info writing you you
could with the granularity that you want
to use you can make that up on your own
and there's advantages and disadvantages
but we we kind of decided that we didn't
want to have a continuous grading of
something between 0.0 1.0 because you're
going to you're going to fool yourself
into how precise you are and it's going
to be impossible within the definitions
to to be too precise again it's it's
more of the numbers or the final ratings
inside are far less important than the
consideration of this of this set of
properties so maybe a couple of
observations about know things that we
learn from doing this exercise there are
some sets of benefits that are
incompatible or rare so for example if
you want to a scheme that's both memory
wise effortless you don't remember
anything and you not to carry anything
well that that seems hard to get because
generally if you don't remember anything
you probably are carrying something to
do the remembering for you just you know
and that's probably the way it works out
so getting both of those things is hard
another another scheme another pair
that's hard is if you want to have
something that's server compatible
meaning there's no changes on the server
the existing text passwords verification
so you're probably doing comparison
against a fix
static string you're probably not going
to be resistant to internal observation
because if that's a fixed static string
once you observe at once you're going to
be able to replay it so by insisting
that you want to have the property of
server compatible you're probably going
to end up with a bunch of the problems
that come with static text passwords so
there are our sets of benefits you can't
get and I think it's interesting to
think about that because then if you try
and generate a requirements list and
there's no schemes that actually have
all of these requirements are going to
have to say okay now we're gonna have to
trade some of these off we're going to
actually actually give something up if
we want some other benefit the the table
also as it can be useful if we want to
see if there's only one or two schemes
or categories of schemes and there if
there's a pair of benefits that can only
be granted that or is only granted
amongst you know one or two schemes you
can then look at and say well what is it
that's peculiar about that scheme what
aspect of that scheme let's it have both
of those when none of the other schemes
have it and then maybe you can try and
adopt that property into other
mechanisms so I think that's another
useful aspect of a of a big table like
that other than all the fun
conversations we had trying to fill in
all the all the ducks so coming up with
combinations of schemes or properties
sub properties of schemes and building
those into other schemes can make frizz
amazed combinations so our overall
observations the password managers and
this is this is quite subjective but let
me just throw out some overall feelings
we have now the password managers gave
us a lot of usability wins and a lot of
security wins but some security wins but
you still ended up with managing static
password static text passwords which we
replayable and therefore going to have a
set of problems so they're not they're
going to be suboptimal for my security
perspective the schemes involving the
proxies gave some interest
properties not available elsewhere but
the security winds were relatively minor
and they were larger usability
deployability costs the federated
schemes and the single sign-on schemes
the usability seemed okay actually
surprisingly good but they had some
deployability disadvantages you
typically and it's hard to measure but
you have to have buy-in from a lot of
parties to get the deployability schemes
to get the theory schemes to work and
the security gains were really
questioned a lot of the federated
schemes kind of give you way too many
options and you can do sub components
using various technologies and some of
them are passwords and some of them are
maybe pki related and but in the end you
don't really know what you're evaluating
so they can claim to maybe be able to
offer high security but in any
particular deployment people might have
made choices that used lower security
technology so we didn't really have
confidence that the claims of security
in these Federation schemes were as good
as as they might be advertised the
graphical passwords some of them offered
some usability advantages but there were
deployment disadvantages and the the
winds and security were relatively minor
so they might win on one or two aspects
but it didn't seem to be sufficient to
be a winning scheme in a grand scale the
cognitive schemes none of them really
seemed very viable we kind of thought
that maybe this is a sign that people
are hoping for something that's not
going to happen here but the security
gains were very small and there were
much larger usability and/or
deployability costs the schemes
involving paper tokens or Hardware
tokens of some sort some sort you know
dedicated hardware or using the phone as
an exhilarating these were the best
overall for security a lot of these were
one-time password type schemes and so we
shouldn't be surprised that they were
best from the security and so they could
resist internal observation but the
usability and deployed seemed to be
bigger barriers than people realize and
one of the pieces of evidence there is
it that they don't they haven't been as
broadly adopted as when
to guess because some of these schemes
have been known for 10 to 15 years
biometrics games actually they had some
usability advantage of some usability
disadvantages but they were surprisingly
disappointed both on deployability and
and security aspects and the password
recovery schemes again they're not
really meant as replacements and just
kind of fall backs and often they cause
security problems um so again the big
the big picture here um none of the
alternatives of the 35 we looked down we
tried to look at the ones that were all
that were not only prominent but also
had interesting properties none of them
came close to having all 35 all 25 of
the benefits and that that's maybe not
surprising but none of them even
preserves all of the benefits of our old
hated text passwords so you're very much
trading off one set of compromises
you're giving something up in order to
get something else and that's probably
why we've had a lot of trouble moving
away from text passwords because people
don't want to give up anything and they
really scream very loudly if they have
to give up anything even if you will
argue that what you're getting back is
more important than what you have to
give up where passwords excel and that's
typically usability the highest security
alternatives are pretty weak so when you
move to higher security you're typically
are reducing the usability and almost
always you're going to reduce the
deployability the deployability was a
category a set of six characteristics
that basically were baselined on text
passwords so everyone's going to do
worse than text passwords on
deployability because that's the de
facto widely deployed scheme so there's
a cost and moving away from the
incumbent um and in general the small
security or small usability gains are
going to be dominated by the disruption
cost of moving to an alternative I guess
the biggest summary comment here is
using this evaluation framework the UDS
evaluation framework we really did feel
again that the
the we say that the the journey is a
reward the discussion is more important
discussion of the properties are the
ranking of all the different schemes
against these projects is more important
than the scores we got and we're kind of
hoping that this can be the start of us
having some sort of a more standardized
evaluation methodology to fairly rank
schemes so that every different person
proposing a new scheme doesn't
cherry-pick on their altars on their own
properties that the benefit their scheme
the most what I'm what I'm most
interested in and in particular
discussing with people over the next
couple of days and and and nonword is
what if we want to make some more
progress on this rather than just you
know exchanging stories about passwords
and how we hate them in and how we
choose passwords and things like this
how can we move ahead so here's some
ideas on how we might move ahead and
some of these are from again the the
research agenda paper that Cormac and I
had earlier this year but i'd be
interested genuinely interested in
getting your opinions on whether which
of these might be interesting research
directions to go forward on or other
suggestions of what to explore so one is
looking at password managers in greater
detail i don't think they've been
studied sufficiently for the usability
benefits that they may be able to give
us if we're going to be stuck with text
passwords anyway better systematization
a better understanding of what they can
offer for the federated systems and
single sign-on type systems getting a
better understanding of why none of them
seems to have done very well to date and
the ones that have failed really badly
which I guess some of them are deployed
now but some of them have felt very
badly and better understanding why they
failed and I'm not sure that we have a
really good understanding of that when
we talk about password strength everyone
talks about pat strong passwords and we
haven't really defined exactly what that
means but a better consensus on what
level of strength is required in which
scenarios in which environments would
would maybe be helpful coming up with
advice for and password policies that
are realistic for real world people and
not giving people advice that we know
they're not going to follow where they
can't follow and the causes of just to
reuse passwords and things like that
systematically studying how to combine
mechanisms and properties from different
mechanisms to end up with overall
schemes or combined schemes that have
you know the best of the security
properties of the individual seems
without losing too much or with while
retaining the usability of the
individual schemes and the deployability
with with minimal deployability impact
so these are some of the ideas but I
want to really interested in getting
some thoughts on where we should explore
next steps to try and move ahead or if
we should just know I did it will just
stick with text passwords from the 25
years what the heck they got us as far
so that's really what I had to say and
I'm interested in having some questions
in conversation
all right Kristin yeah um some property
strike me as vastly more important than
others right right in particular the one
that's jumping into my head and the
tractor listen to your talk is server
deployability me and my two friends are
starting out some new social networking
site we think going to be the next
zuckerberg you know we're going to be
billionaires someday and we can deploy
exotic stuff then but right now it's
just me and these three guys and we want
our website V is accessible to users as
possible so it has to be compatible all
clients what are we going to do we're
going to do passwords because anything
that's barrier to entry any user is not
accepted so your facebook so i guess in
that sense if we're going to stick with
server compatible the logical
implication is stacy okay because
there's two one does how many servers
have to change something into so both at
both of these are important um the climb
compatible you know you might be able to
get people to download stuff or to
change something on the desktop like
that that's the point is that the
clients are now diverse you know android
phones windows phones tablets iPads you
name it it has to work on anything that
speaks HTTP yeah well if you're going to
end up so are you willing to are you
willing to say 10 million websites will
have to change and that's less important
than then deploying new fine fine cause
three guys social network to choose
something other than passwords and I
can't well it's a really big barrier to
adoption if ya and so then but then you
might end up stuck with all the problems
with passwords being replayable and
resilient the internal observation and
that doesn't stop three social
networking
thanks for taking off well yeah but the
three guys don't really care about
security they just want to get rich and
that will that's that economics matters
more well you but but again different
environments so that's one environment
you and your three buddies another
environments Microsoft corporate are
they happy with the security level that
provides so we have a different
weighting of an of criteria later that
point aren't passwords the only thing
that may be nothing to carry criteria
fully know uh I think I got it twice it
does biometrics no nothing scary so
cocky see my metrics are nothing to
carry weight you have to have device did
well so that so does your cell phone
count it's like to know no someone's
like hey um but it'll it'll taste
anywhere where as my cell phone doesn't
work here but i'm using a kiosk and you
have adequate are any big diff i ever
did with the binary keyboard but that's
you have to carry that in it yeah that's
so i'll go behind the camera that right
that i could authenticate to with
biometrics but then i could with a
password because that's an on and off
and if i want to authenticate that to
authorize that it's okay to down with
the pictures i have taken that has an
input device that works for a biometric
but not for not for a password up okay
yeah i think I see the distinction is
passwords or nothing to carry that are
completely ubiquitous and that you
so everywhere so I'm wearing my eyes on
the nothing to carry on the nothing to
carry it's the password managers which
are really password schemes and the
federated and single sign-on schemes
which I think it's nothing to Gary
basically because we're assuming that
aspect gets implemented by passwords the
cognitive schemes and graphical password
schemes are really password seems we
didn't charge for the schemes that use
cell phones or smartphones we said they
were almost nothing to carry assuming
that most people are a lot of people or
soon a lot of people will carry some
device with them so that's almost
nothing to carry and then the biometrics
got nothing to carry because if if you
assume there is some input device
functioning today's yeah well is there
there are laptops there are laptops ink
pads you have been up for ten years and
you're good readers would you marry me
don't like demand is no matter where I
am if I can get to a pc but i need to be
able to login so i think in terms of
scoring though we could score the
biometrics as nothing to carry and then
charge it for not being you know
compatible with the infrastructure I
mean the this we could charge more to a
deploy ability like you can make
trade-offs you can make trade-offs and
how you I did then what was it last and
I was conference call
question you raised whether whether
mathematics reality yeah I want to look
more the password manager sleep it looks
like the password managers can you talk
about our stateful ones and I think it's
also worth considering stateless paste
password managers which also meet the
nothing to do it to carry a partner but
have some security issues and there are
some interesting trade us between to do
when you mistake full you mean that the
local clients then do the remember or
something in the cloud or what could
want your definition is a stateful ones
have a local cache of passwords of some
sort no the stateless ones derive
passwords dynamically for each site off
of state with single master password
right and therefore you can live there
much more portable but it's much more
important that the initial password is a
strong password and write other
securities with us but i do think again
we're starting to see a little bit more
research on password managers but in my
mind you know there was we went a long
time without any real well the
literature spikes and i think the
password managers deserves is more of a
spike if we think this is an important
problem yeah yeah coming back to this
question of the pie chart
what are the relative crackers this is
something we've been trying to get a
grasp on for a while and I think we have
some swag that says malware is the bulk
of the problem and the password guessing
weak password guessing is relatively low
but password reuse is actually one
significant
and you know fall apart maybe two-thirds
malware twenty percent password reuse is
the risk profile across users but for
people in this room I think it's more
likely to say that password reuses the
vagrants so that says to me that for us
collectively a posture manager is a
really good thing it mitigates that risk
of reuse but then you're putting
everything behind a single secret me
everything maybe in the local cache and
then that other specter of the
two-thirds malware thing for most users
problem it's interesting with the
password managers though because we did
a little side analysis where we're
comparing another alternative to
password managers with and without an
encrypted password it's like so you know
by default i think the firefox password
manager will store your passwords but
it's not encrypted under a master if you
look at the standard you know properties
we had four rating here it turned out
that if you have a password manager
without with a master password there's a
danger that someone could observe you
typing in the master password if there's
no master password you can't observe
people typing in the pasture password so
it almost looks worse if it's against
the criteria use worse if you have a
master bathroom because you're charging
for something that you don't penalize
for the absence of so it's like what
threat model if your browser itself is
storing the passwords and storing the
passwords for 50 websites what's the
threat model it's going to get you into
trouble it's malware in the desktop or
somehow you've got malware in the
browser that can read that stash but
that's a lot different so is malware on
the desktop the problem you're worried
about or if is backed up if you're if
you're if you're your database gets
backed up then that's a risk of theft
now but it's I don't think we started
this enough
but I think risk there is I'm going from
putting all my eggs behind four baskets
you know I have for passwords that I've
used across with indie sites to putting
all my eggs behind one basket where you
know maybe maybe it's less guessable
passwords but but as soon as my machine
is on gaming you know it game over for
everything I mean there's also the
password managers where you have one
master password maybe you generate all
the site passwords based on you know
hash of the master and the URL and
there's other password managers which
just take your existing passwords and
throw them into a bag and you get access
to them and then if you're evaluating
the password managers are you assuming
that you're going to keep all the users
these are some passwords or that this
password manager is going to generate
brand new passwords for all sites so
there's it's not so easy to compare them
head up there um but I think that would
be interesting work just writes me come
on look at this a new is that like if
you look at federated here I mean I
guess we talked about this a little bit
early but I think we really missed that
we didn't have complete enough list of
usability stuff because it look it looks
like if you assume that you know users
users govern what goes on and it looks
like federated schemes are just great
from usability point of view and the
world will organize itself around what
users want it looks like federated to
the comfort world that hasn't happened
so federated if we look at things that
are green in this quadrant here this is
our usability rows here and the green
means better than text passwords the I
guess the password managers and the
federated have a lot of green the the
biometrics have some green but also some
red so yeah so these should have done
better unless it's the deployability is
a big road one in terms of federated
like
some of our really big partners but it's
one of those things to wear you know if
not every single scenario supports it
and you can have to have under mechanism
if that's what's really been looking for
us I think we might all I think your
point is that we have a list of eight
usability properties there and there
might be a few others that are shows up
so when we when we talked about these
these symbols too there were other
symbols there were some that we thought
we might designate a row as an absolute
must-have so if you're missing a bullet
there the scheme just gets lost under
consideration but there's other
properties on some schemes that are so
bad we thought we should put the skull
and crossbones in there that if the
skull and crossbones shows up there is
that also so even if you have the
mandatory ones if you have one skull and
crossbones that just blows out of the
water so bad so you know which ones are
we missing here and it's just complain
but i think you know i mean it seems
like open IE is it's not the case that
users are beating the door down saying
we demand this this federated stuff it
looks so good right that's far for me
some clarity but missed out some stuff
there you know delegation is one good
example but the clergy must be other
stuff right and maybe we're just being
too generous when it comes to efficient
to use right because you know you know
your password in about three seconds
something that takes 20 seconds doesn't
sound like a lot but it's a lot more
than yeah and then if you're doing it 12
times a day 3 seconds is maybe your
threshold if you're doing it once a
month and it's online banking or it's
something that you don't you think is
really important maybe 15 seconds is
fine we can actually use this model for
anything predicted we come back and say
you know these are adoption rates for
example on Hardware tokens this is where
we're not out to this is it correlated
that the what we have in fact but one of
the related observations we may was if
we look at if if we look at Hardware
tokens here so you look at these pass
code generators like secure ID you know
they do fantastic on on the security
here and the use abilities got some
issues is it like what was the roadblock
these things been around for a long time
is it cost is it the users only so we
don't know how to wait these different
properties and some of them are what i
would call heavy hitter properties and
they should be weighted ten times more
than some others and that's where i
don't think we have enough information
yet or enough understanding the fastest
one of the things that were suggested
that we that we could do was you know to
take these properties and then to say in
Scenario X this is the waiting that
should be given to these properties and
without waiting which of the schemes
then are the best for that scenario and
in in a corporate environment or in a
banking environment you know I think
people might be interested in knowing
for their one environment what is the
best I think that's a logical thing to
do Chris your table screen some
predictive stuff passwords totally
dominate this market like everyone else
is in the dust and they are the only one
that scores six out of six and
employability yeah and if you look at
the ones that score five out of six or
four they are some of the most popular
alternatives deployability stomps the
rest of this stuff is like a nice to
have you must have the deployability I
think one of the conclusions that we did
site was that the deployability seems to
be not given enough attention by the
academics who we're interested in you
know the security academics are
interested in security and so we got all
these things with fantastic black dots
here and no week we kind of overlooked
all this red stuff right and by the way
we had to give up we had to give up some
red stuff here in order to get some
green stuff right so I believe that was
the negligible gospel very useful right
so r addictive is that you know if you
you want to be facebook and you want to
people you know on your scheme well ten
cents per user in one sense before just
wait you might reconcile and any non
zero marginal cost per user is just an
obsession and by the way you know people
launching those games some of them wait
the security aspects very very low right
no what do they lose your you're signing
up for free they made no promises to you
well they don't they don't care until
they do but they don't rat in general I
mean that's not look at that charge
there is something that I've seen
recently seems to be taken off and I
think it's very close to the pliability
and that's where they say the usual
model is we expect people to switch to
this model what I'm seeing more and more
sites that say you know created an
account on this site or login with your
facebook account or login with your
Google account essentially a federated
scheme look a choice of federated slips
that in other words they don't they
don't require that you get federated
with that they'll also let you create an
account but if you have one then they'll
let you use this and that way you get
the ease of use if you've already signed
up for the book for the pain of yeah I
noticed that being very popular but the
thing that freaks me out about it is the
UX of yes create an account on our and
you ever heard of it website enter your
Facebook password here mmm see a threat
one of the other huge huge problems that
I see and I maybe this has been
discussed a lot i'm not sure but you
know all these websites that essentially
mandate that you're using an email
address as your account ID okay that's
fine but then the next thing to do is to
ask you for your password and so of
course anybody make out up from for that
right but of course a natural thing
you're going to do is you're going to
type in your hotmail door your gmail
email address and then you're going to
type in your hotmail or your gmail
password to that site that you've never
before visited yeah that just seems
wrong now if it was a delegation scheme
and they said use your existing hotmail
or gmail email address and it goes into
a window and that got sent off to
hotmail or gmail
and this idea of having third-party
verifiers that a website doesn't get
involved in they just got back I yes no
that's kind of a pseudo type of
federated schemes kind of a delegated
login right over it features in win8
federated is going to get more
interesting it won't be ubiquitous so it
won't take over the world because when
eight won't take over the world but also
first it well maybe the right thing here
is it is to offer that the people want
that want to escape can escape and I'll
hang around and take questions from
anyone else that wants to hang off a
good learner the doors aren't locked the
doors not long but it's such a polite
so other questions okay this chart looks
like this to carry properties so for
this existing skin
right now if you if if I ask myself what
can I do to make these things better in
existence if they have through in hair
day so inherently have some kinds of
your favorites it's hard to improve that
part the usability part maybe some
things that have currently wrecked we
can you know get better effort since
this easy to wear an efficient to use
that doesn't seem like inherent property
of those matters just now maybe they've
bad into place right now yes yeah so I
mean there's there's lots of schemes
here to UM that it's tough you know
there were you know quite frankly some
very subjective ratings we gave here
like some of these schemes are proposed
and there was never any user studies
done so we you know how do we rate how
infrequent the errors are and how easy
to learn it isn't um so how we grade it
was based a lot on available information
and then you know easy to learn if if
you had a better way of educating people
about it and you got a little time slice
could that I guess we'd have to do a
trial error to see if you can improve
that but yeah that that seems an
opportunity to improvement I guess maybe
that part can we can improve that but
this deployability
very red yeah what one of this one of
the things that we can actually maybe a
silver lining here that I believe if if
you get a Microsoft or Google or an
Amazon and they put their weight behind
one of these all of a sudden the
deployability thing you know moves they
had a big step because there's a big
push and people like fall in line with
it it's very hard for me to propose this
game and to push that but if a big
corporate player someone like format can
move these things quickly yeah so I I
guess there's there's places here where
I don't think we should be too
pessimistic because you know someone's
going to figure something out here by
weaving some of this stuff together I
mean you like Google to step it's you
know it's not really New it's kind of
like you know one time password over
some type of phone interface or even
email but you know if they get a lot of
people behind it and people learn how to
use it and it gives you some advantages
you can move ahead right
we try to look at the banking sector
because they have the most skin in the
game and it's a little bit pressing
actually
but if they don't do to some new scheme
that is probably not better than the
existing one that they have and if it's
not good enough banking then yes what's
the value fruit regular users I think
it's a little bit misleading though to
place too much on what you see of the
banking system because you know we are
our perception as users I think is that
they rely very very heavily on passwords
and they do use passwords but you know a
lot of them are also using cookies to
your browser and a lot of them are also
doing IP address monitoring and
profiling and by the way the banks
typically can reverse all their
transactions which you can traverse a
lot of other stuff in the real world so
they they have really an all-in cost to
users counting compromise and bait they
absorb that cost is not really
so they have the highest interest really
what I'm suggesting is I think the banks
are doing more than you see and probably
in the right pressure but you know when
it comes to specific schemes they
haven't exactly pioneered some you know
newfangled he was really going to
release prosperous that's the boss right
just to come and done that so I I was
interacting a lot with the banks were
they when they the financial regulator
said that they had to implement some
sort of two background education and
most of them started using the pass mark
scheme and the reason they were using it
was because it was something that could
be sold to that met the met the
requirements not that they believed it
worked at all or anything but right they
have a regulator into whatever the
regulator tells them they have to do
they have to figure out and they did the
absolute minimum that they could do to
meet that regulatory requirement so
there's the assumption that there's
there's good usability of research being
done there and that they know what
they're doing they're pretty much doing
what the government has to tell them so
by trusting the banks as they know
you're basically saying well Uncle Sam
is the folks who really know what
they're doing when it comes to
authentication I talked to those guys
too and they said well we knew we had to
pass some law because the banks wouldn't
do anything if we did and we don't know
how this stuff works so we figured tone
they've gotta do something and see what
they come up with and that's where we
how we got where we thing you can
all the losses for veins
get TT
if you've given any serious study to the
possibility passwords really are the
best idea well okay well that was one of
the cool are you look what have you done
with Christine color now actually was
one of the things we we mentioned in in
the security privacy articles was that
you know you know they actually are a
pretty darn good fit for a lot of like
these websites that want to give you a
free newsletter or something and they're
asking you for a user ID and a password
just so that they can you know send some
spam your way and South's most of you
it's like why would you wanna use
anything more secure the passwords
because they're not actually looking for
security they're just looking for some
contact so yeah I use a see your ID by
three guys website yeah so it looks like
a winner I mean I would think that
two-thirds you know you just make a
number up two-thirds of the places where
passwords are used they're probably
perfectly adequate optimal yeah yeah
along those lines I take issue with this
black dot next to easy to learn there's
a load like very minimal
I need to know to use a hazard but I
need to know wow so upz alert versus
easy to learn well yeah what's day to
you yeah so I think a number of these
are very subjective and the idea of
looking at these criteria is important
how they were scored very open to
interpretation but again with this
framework you know you if you wanted to
start up a group here for the next month
and and define your own define your own
definition of of what easy-to-learn
means I think that'll be interesting
again if the same people come up with
the ratings for all those schemes as
opposed to using someone else's rating
and then comparing it to your rating in
addition to using the frequent Durer's
it was kind of a coupling there we you
know we argued a lot of the definition
so the idea with easy to learn was you
know it's kind of intuitively clear do
what you're supposed to do right and the
other shortcomings were kind of captured
elsewhere but yet the factoring there is
it's subject turn criteria criteria that
I think is missing it's sort of related
to the resilient internal observation
sort of related the original question
your product brought up this is supposed
to be resilient to malware running on
which is you know extremely important
problem and we tend to be elected only
because we don't have any solutions we
originally had two separate security
criteria one was resistant to client and
malware one was resistant to
communications channel malware including
looking inside us as hell we collapse
them up into this one protection that
it's again it's interesting where
passwords Quinn is that if I'm if I'm at
a public workstation or something like
that I'm willing to type in my password
access my hotmail account but i'm not
going to type in my password to access
my brokerage account yeah and so it does
give me protection against the you know
the malicious and station that no
federated scheme could ever provide and
most of the hardware based things could
either yeah yeah so I mean the idea can
you use this on untrusted client
platform it is a little bit different
then it's kind of a one-time scenario as
opposed to you know malware on your home
station at work at a point of energy and
it jumps out of pressures been our lives
were taken so does like you look most of
the green here seems to occur on the
security thing which used to be where
the bulk of effort is gone it looks like
that hasn't been that my chart we're
going into
it seems like you know well we all agree
the passwords abide by that because
they're not secure let's work on that
and then as an office not expressed
outrage / surprised when you know the
world doesn't beat a path to your door
it looks like that way there's more and
the other pairing that it seems to be
the one I think about it is really hard
is like negligible costs per user and
server compatible no one except Firefox
password manager achieves those two
right so it kind of means it if you want
to be the next Facebook and zero cost
for user is requirement you have to rip
out the existing server infrastructure
right there's no unless we're missing
something oh here's a research agenda is
come up with something that gets five
out of six in deployability the other
one you're going to never get as mature
because you just came up with it and has
just not laughable security if it can
come close then that would be an
innovation because there's nothing on
your chart this is right you can do
better and deploy if you're not going to
see if already two points you're never
going to see anything there you can have
a play the puzzle game in your browser
I'm not sure that's a good idea but you
can what's them play tic-tac-toe and win
I just pulled that out of my butt that's
a bad idea but what you put into the
browser doesn't have to be text in a
field Rick but it's still not going to
be Greeks it won't be any better than
passwords right you can't our past
everything's built already to use
password so you'll never see green there
no matter even if your scheme is the
null scheme right if it's empty if the
if I did not respect everyone I didn't
ask for that is asking for five dots and
the deployability right you're never
going to see green because you're not
going to see green because you can't do
better than followed us so there's
nothing on his chart there's nothing
I've ever heard of that gets five out of
six in that and I I agree with you that
it's not possible to get six out of six
because mature is going to fail for any
innovation
but this is on the problem of working
with the existing hardware to go at the
existing servers yeah related on thank
you gave you can come up with something
that works on PC Mac and three brands of
phone now we can discuss whether it is
of Merit well I was thinking the
authentication protocols that companies
are coming out of the car for guitars
which I personally hate but nevertheless
somebody must like them which are these
things that you know you carry around in
our pocket it just works kind of thing
and that is easier to use than a
password easier to screw it up too but
so we've exhausted result on this well
we got all the way through top and
password without anybody mentioning XKCD
936 that's a new car still start the
