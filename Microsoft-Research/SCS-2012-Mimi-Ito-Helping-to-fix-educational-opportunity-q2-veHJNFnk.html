fixing some problems and education so
first I'll tell you what I think the
problems are then I'll tell you why I
think this is the community to fix them
because all of you are actually already
in the business of education okay so
some statistics that you may know
already the high school dropout rate in
this country covers at about thirty
percent for Black Latino and Native
American youth it's a staggering fifty
percent this is not okay it's a huge
indicator at academic disengagement
another data point our digital you study
that I did was a great team researchers
including Dana we found that young
people were going online to do a ton of
learning and that was awesome but we
also found that it was only a small my
dream kids probably less than ten
percent that were really taking to the
online resources to do learning that was
highly engaged at oriented to academic
civic and career opportunity so what we
have here is a problem of a disconnect a
gap between the kinds of things that
kids are really socially engaged with
and interested in in terms of their
online activity at what adults and
parents want kids to be interested in it
which is the academic stuff acidic
engagement and things that open doors to
economic opportunity that's the problem
we're hearing a lot more talk about the
Economic Opportunity side of things and
economic privilege and much more sense
we need to be talking about educational
opportunity and who the educational and
learning leads are in this country and I
think the way to do that is to start by
reflecting on our own practices we are
the learning of leads of the digital age
we are the one percent really know how
to mobilise the internet in order to
activate our knowledge our expertise and
develop professional identities through
the use of these new tools here's a kid
who I interviewed as part of the digital
Houston he was also part of the learning
elite the one percent so he's a lot of
comics creator he learned how to be web
comics when he was in college but not
because he had any classes at school he
didn't even have any friends in college
to share this interest but he really
took to the online world in order to
connect with others who share that
good now if you look at the dynamic of
how he did this he started first by
discovery web comics on his own and he
fell in love with it so started with a
personal passion and affinity but then
he went to the online world he started
looking at all my tutorials and how to's
to figure out how to make a web page how
to use digital tools to make web comics
and he connected with a community of
interest that really supportive his
learning and expertise development in
his space and what made take different
from almost all of the other kids that
we interviewed in our study was that he
was able to take that interest in
expertise and add the cave for its
relevance and sites of power that
mattered for this professional identity
he was able to market he was able to
create a successful website and
eventually a professional identity and a
sustainable career as a web developer
now the experience that dave had is an
experience that a lot of us in this room
have had of going on to the internet on
specialized knowledge to further our
expertise to connect with other geeky
people who share that specialized
interest and we use the internet to
disseminate our work to become public
about our work to develop professional
identities that tire personal passion
into sustainable careers this is the
experience that more more kids
to have as they're not having it right
now so what we need to do to guide kids
sources experiences in an era in which
the Internet has radically reduced the
barriers of access to knowledge and
expertise kids are not finding with you
and so we actually need you and this is
where it's important to recognize the
fact that every social media platform is
a learning platform is an educational
platform you are all the business of
Education already regardless of whether
you self-identify as an educator so here
are some ways in which social media can
further the cause of connected learning
build social infrastructure around
online educational resources you all
know that it's not just content its
social connection that drives engagement
and drives learning second platforms
that help tips the nectar out interest
of expertise and knowledge especially
intergenerational one so they don't have
to depend on their peers of its cool
they don't have to depend on schools to
deliver their interests thirdly
reputation systems that reward being
smart getting really good at something
the intellectual civic engagement rather
than systems that only reward attention
and popularity incredibly important just
some examples of ways in their social
you can help expand educational
opportunity for more kids so I've been
lucky to be part of the MacArthur
foundations digital media learning
initiative we need a ton of Health and
realizing the vision of public education
in the digital age that's really about
serving on kids thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
