computational social scientist at
Microsoft Research and today I'm going
to tell you about viral search viral
search is a new means of navigating
searching and exploring content that
spreads over social media we've gone
through hundreds of thousands of stories
that are recently posted on Twitter
looked at billions of mentions of these
stories and reconstructed trees of how
these things pass from one individual to
the next so here's an example of a story
by Forbes which is about Jeremy Lin and
what we can see here is that the story
initially started with Forbes that has
about a million followers and then
direct people who were following Forbes
reposted that story and most of those
posts didn't go any further here's an
example that went one generation further
and then most of the adoptions have
stopped by then and we've got a total of
about a hundred and fifty people posting
this story so this is sort of
traditional broadcast style media where
we have a big outlet posting to people
who directly consume it and then it
doesn't really go much further in
contrast that here's an example of sort
of a viral video a cover of a Gotye zone
and so this is what people sort of
typically have in their mind when they
think about one of these viral videos
but nobody's really been able to
actually look at the structure of these
things to date and so what we're able to
do is going through these billions of
events we reconstruct these trees by
looking at all the followers of everyone
who adopts the content and using a large
cluster to reconstruct these things and
then a novel scoring method to actually
distinguish this tree is being viral
from just being popular we can also look
at all the independent trees in this
story that were started by different
people so here's the version of the
story we just looked at which is started
by the people who made the video that
got 4,600 adoptions but there were many
other introductions of this piece of
content independent from this story and
so we can see some of these get
thousands of adoptions and some get
hundreds and some get only dozens we can
also use viral search to look at
contributions from particular
individuals so
here's posts from Tim O'Reilly over the
past year of popular news video and
images we can see he is quite prolific
and so the larger circles here represent
more popular stories the shading
represents the number of generations
these stories have gone through so
here's an example of a story that he was
involved in relatively early on as
indicated by the concentric circle that
this went on for many generations and it
became quite popular we have another
example of a less popular story this
reached about 500 people and as
indicated by the circle here he was
relatively late in posting this story
so that's viral search which is a tool
that lets you search and navigate
cascades of people passing content on
social media and distinguish between
things that have not just become popular
but I've also become viral in the sense
that they've been passed on from one
person to the next over many generations
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
