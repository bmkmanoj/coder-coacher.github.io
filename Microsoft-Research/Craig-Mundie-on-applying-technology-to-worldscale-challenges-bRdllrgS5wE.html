future is not merely about enhanced
webpages or you know just being able to
search and find more information it's
really about a qualitative change in
what people expect from computers and
how they interact with them in this
specialty category you know I think it's
driven a lot by a world full of sensors
and you know these sensors will play
important roles in many societally
important areas you know I've just
chosen a few to highlight here where we
have interactions now with many of you
in the room you know around the
environmental forecasting which we've
been doing medical image analysis and a
lot of processing of those kind of
sophisticated images the ability to
synthesize or or use 3d display
technology in concert with 3d medical
imaging I think all these hold hold
great promise one of the ones that I
think is particularly interesting and I
just brought the show this morning is
this last one where we've been working
with people and and this is an example
of an ultrasonic detector is there a way
to basically get these images to do
prenatal exams or with someone who has
minimal training and so you know this is
an example of a cell phone you know with
this ultrasonic scanner plugged in as in
through the USB port there's now enough
computing power even in today's
smartphones to basically be you know the
data capture analysis and graphical
presentation capability for that if you
say on top of that maybe I even have
some cloud capability backing it up that
I've got some ability to take the
locally capture data and and move it
somewhere or to use it to create some
type of interaction if you think there's
a problem then I think each of these
things you know creates a chant
opportunity for us to use technology to
solve some of society's biggest problems
