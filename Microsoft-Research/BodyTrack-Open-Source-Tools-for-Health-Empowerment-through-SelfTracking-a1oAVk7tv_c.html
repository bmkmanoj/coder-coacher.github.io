you
an is the co-principal investigator and
director of the body truck project which
he started around 2010 and she's here to
talk to you about today and she's from
Carnegie Mellon University to create lab
correct alright welcome man thank you ok
and we have a little extra introductory
treat here from Gordon I met and at the
quantified self annual meeting at
Stanford last month and through a doctor
Jack Abramson who has a project with a
number of trackies or using buddy track
to capture health data to understand
cause and effect I'm at rocky collecting
symptoms and body characteristics for
someone who's had two heart attacks to
bypasses and two pacemakers with a goal
of extending my own end of life and also
seek synergistic efforts such as
quantified self and quite friendly
doctor perhaps there could be something
synergistic with MSR so here's an who
may be using my recent data include
sleep lack of exercise and pain when I
do exercise so now all there is left is
to analyze okay now tell you a bit of my
own story um-hmm and get my knee going
here um so as she said I'm a robotic
systems engineer I worked at NASA Ames
Research Center as lead systems engineer
for prototype Mars rovers for many years
and this is ms Mars Akkad and canine and
and that was really great job I really
enjoyed it and then I got to stick to do
it anymore and this was this was a real
disappointment and it was it was all the
sort of you know vague stuff that that
messes with your ability to do what you
care about but comes up negative on all
the tests and after pushing things as
hard as I could
and realizing that you know i'm i'm not
going to get really a useful answer out
of out of the standard fare medical
system except for what's not but nothing
could useful about how to run my life
better to be able to suffer less I said
well okay I know how to debug one-off
systems I'm a one-off system what can I
do here and this was before the
quantified self movement started and
actually several years before I actually
found out about it but did a lot of the
same sort of things you know found
trackers that I could like the heart
rate straps and start take mixtures of
food and recording what I was eating and
things like that and I I did eventually
come up with an answer that allowed me
to you know feel much much better most
of the time but in the process I get was
really really frustrated with the tools
and in the end the the answer i found
actually that the most useful thing was
was taking the photos of the food
because it did turn out to be a food
issue luckily the when I kind of hit the
bottom of the barrel the the doctor sent
me dire veda and he said this is about
imbalance Ayurveda is like thousands of
years old Indian science you know go go
figure out what they say to do about
vada imbalance and from paying attention
to what I was eating when and when I was
at home cooking the way they said i
would get better and then i would go out
to dinner and just about anything i went
out and ate no matter how hard I tried
it would be a problem and i would pay
attention to the few that succeeded in
the many that failed and tried to find a
pattern eventually figured out seem to
be an issue with nightshade which is
tomatoes potatoes eggplant peppers stuff
in that family turn out to have
neurotoxins in them apparently some
people seem to have problems with them
this is obscure knowledge that no one is
ever going to tell you about but there's
a lot of people have figured out
experimentally and they write really
really crappy books um maybe someday
somebody who can write well will write
such a book but in the process basically
I said well you know this goes against
everything that I thought I thought that
were about the way the world worked you
know that everything I've heard is that
vegetables are good for you these are
vegetables therefore they're good for
you but somehow my experience is is
different so are there other examples of
people have had the similar sort of
experiences where
are they through paying attention and
experimenting have figured out that
there's something about the way they
reacted to the world that is
significantly enough different than the
way that they expect based on what
they've been told that they really do a
whole lot better if they come up with
sort of custom strategies write their
own user's manual and there's there's
examples in all sorts of ways and people
sort of know about the the typical you
know peanut and pollen allergies and
stuff like that people are starting to
earn about celiac disease but those are
just the tip of the iceberg all sorts of
really weird stuff the weirdest actually
was my boss said at NASA Ames is
allergic to talc and he had a problem
where he would he would itch
uncontrollably whenever he was in a warm
room for like ten years it turns I was
dosing himself with talc because in his
supplements we figured that out you stop
you figured out it's in rice and all
sorts these other things you know talc
is an unlisted ingredient now he's fine
so there's there's you know that is it
he may be unique in the universe but he
figured it out so how do we take the
examples of people like me like him and
like like lots of others who've gone
through this process and figure out how
to make that opportunity available to
more people who are kind of suffering in
these kind of obscure ways that may be
amenable to this sort of approach and in
going through and looking at what people
were doing it really looks like a
feedback loop where you observe capture
reflect and adjust so you pay attention
to what's going on you capture it which
may be just in your memory or maybe on
paper or maybe electronically you
reflect on what was going on in the
context around various experiences when
you either did well or did poorly and
see if there's anything you can learn
and then you adjust your approach based
on on what you've learned and so it
looked at this and they said okay well
well what can we do here and what how
can we contribute how can we make this
less of a burdensome process and what we
realized is there's sort of this capture
and reflect peace in the middle is
really the peace that we can help with
so this was around 2009
I mean that I that I started saying okay
you know the tools sup we need better
tools what can we do is that
conveniently enough when when self
tracking devices started coming out so
these are the the co sleep monitor the
body media armband the withing scale and
the Fitbit activity monitor and they all
came out within a year or so of each
other around that time and then there's
also active tracking devices because
there are things like you can these guys
can tell you certain kinds of things I
can't tell you other kinds of things I
can't tell you whether or not you're in
pain they can't tell you what you know
what your what your mood is and so we
started looking around for people who
could partner with who who had a good
handle on this and the best we found was
was a some folks doing an app called my
me that allows you to to do observation
caption I'll talk about that more later
and then just things like you know
taking pictures of things this is very
powerful especially in dealing with food
and then there's lots of other
contextual data sources that may not may
or may not be directly related to
whatever you know symptom or experience
that this that is of concern to you but
that allows you to reflect more deeply
because it gives you more information
about what the context was at the time
you can never get all of the data into
the computer but what our hope is is
that you get enough data into the
computer that the person can look at
that point in time and sort of figure
out you know where they were what was
going on in a way that they can sort of
access that that internal memories of
that in ways that that just sort of you
know looking at the date on the calendar
you can't and so we started building web
tools started project called body track
should I building web tools in the last
year we merged with another open source
project called flux stream that was
doing similar sorts of things and the
idea is that basically we we find data
sources that contribute in useful ways
to this to this process for people and
we figure out how to add
great all the data timestamp data put
them together in the in the same system
and here's an example of from the first
version and in all these cases you
really want to kind of understand both
your personal context and also kind of
relationships between things and we we
built a little environmental base
station that talks to an air particulate
monitor and so the the green and the
black our air particulate readings small
and large and then we've got humidity
light and photos and we just you know
wanted to sort of poke around and see
what you know what goes on with air
particulars because not something that
you can see but it's potentially
interesting my husband has asthma and so
he's very interested to to look into
this and you know just what jumps out at
you is there through these these spikes
with these with the slow decays and saw
some of these decays are like 12 hour
decays on on on these spikes well what
are they so we start actually going and
poking around and exploring you can you
can see that each of these really big
spikes has something in common which is
these are all places where I was cooking
a meal using a particular cast iron
grill pan now the meals using the
crockpot the meals using the skillet
those didn't have these spikes but this
one particular pan did and you know
that's something we didn't know and when
we and when we realized that we stopped
using that pan and start using the cast
iron skillet instead and then we don't
we don't have that happening to that
degree it's also interesting in that the
folks that we've worked with with this
you know all see pretty much the same
thing you get these these spikes caused
by by personal activity and a lot of
times it's actually very interesting for
things like you can tell when you're
cooking even when it's not you know
ridiculous like that you can tell when
you're cooking versus going out and that
can tell you for instance you know how
well you're doing you cook on more at
home when you're doing well then if
you're not that kind of thing so there's
a lot of interesting information to be
gathered from stuff like this and having
an interface where you can just you know
go and explore it and see what there is
and kind of understand the shape is is
really important this is an example with
body media and Zod
so this is a body media activity so
number of the the multiplier on basal
metabolic rate so like these spikes are
like going out and walking or running
and this is whether or not you're lying
down and then this the zo orange is
awake the greens are deep and light
sleep and then the gray is I sorry deep
and REM sleep and then the gray is is
light sleep and you can just sort of
that this is a kind of an example of
using the exploration for for just kind
of remembering what things were like so
here I took a nap there I it was a
pretty good night of sleep reactive that
day here I'm what's going on in the
middle of the night there ah so I've got
up and read email that's just you know
walking to the welcome to computer
walking back no big deal oh man that's a
mess what's going on here yeah looks
like I'm going for a run here in the
middle of the night well it turns out
that's waking up and being very very
sick and it turns out that I assume
because of GSR being very very sick
looks like you're running around and and
so this is this is now useful because
you know that this sort of thing happens
to me sometimes has happened to me
sometimes since I was in high school and
now you know I can it's easy to find
them cuz I know what they look like
here's an example using the the newest
system after after combining with flux
stream and here we have some additional
sort of interactivity it's easier to add
channels select from all the available
ones you can modify the channel height
you can modify the channel settings you
can go through and and explore and this
is an example for my own data so that
the top the the main issue I still
struggle with is is happy vs. unhappy
guts and for his happy guts and the
higher readings are unhappy so this is
the kind of an example of starting from
some sort of symptom and then trying to
understand what context is so you know
here this this looks really bad what was
going on then and so in the in the new
system we actually have additional views
like a map view where I can see well
this is right after I got back from a
trip to Boston and I went out to dinner
with some
from out of town what did I eat okay
well pineapple I almost never eat
pineapple that was desperation getting
getting back in the middle of the night
and that was all I could find at the
walmart and here's a some red wine with
with the Brooks's and I've I was
dabbling with red with red wine just you
know then and in Belgium I usually don't
do that maybe that's not such a good
idea I'm I think the red wine experiment
is done and what we found you know sort
of going through this and and and
building the tools and trying to figure
out you know how this is going to
contribute is that the tools are
important but alone they're just not
enough and sort of the typical story
that you hear from this is well they're
not enough because people are stupid we
don't think that we think we think very
very much differently than that what we
think is that passing on culture is
complex and really what we're talking
about here are cultural practices and
developing and passing on cultural
practices and just like we don't expect
somebody to learn how to cook by going
to the store buying a knife and a pan
and reading user's manual yeah that's
kind of where for some reason that's
where we're we're generally at in the in
the tone of the discussions about
self-tracking right now and you know we
know with things like you know cooking
and fishing and stuff that that's that's
not how it works you know you you have
somebody who knows what cooking is like
or somebody who knows what fishing is
like and you hang out with him for a
while right um and so we think that that
was sort of that sort of big missing
piece also revising personal narratives
is an interactive process and that and
the best person I think I've seen to who
explains this is Rachel known Naomi
Raymond and kitchen table wisdom she
talks about how the process of
interacting with other people telling
them our stories we revise our stories
and we come up with with new ones and
it's really this this this sort of
process you can't do very well in your
head and you know having having the
tools helps but the real thing that
we're trying to support is this sort of
process of self narrative editing and it
works much better with with a second
human it doesn't have to be a trained
human just has to be a human who'll put
up with you and who cares about you
so we came up with this me and dr.
Abramson came up with this idea of quant
coach and somebody who kind of you know
knows the shape of the space has kind of
done it before knows what the tools do
who works with somebody who's you know
got these sort of issues and who doesn't
know how to use the tools yet to kind of
do you know skill development and and
and help translate and having somebody
who kind of knows what what things do to
help select and configure and use the
tools it just makes a huge huge
difference because when you're by
yourself you know a lot of these these
sort of speed bumps that you hit along
the way where you just don't know what
to expect somebody who does know what to
expect you can just can just help you
over them and it's no big deal but
otherwise then people can really get
stuck and not be able to get back to it
and reflecting on the data together and
looking at specific incidents i think is
really really useful and when you go and
you talk to your doctor you're really
not usually able to go to the level of
detail looking at specific incidents
what you're talking about is your
current your current edit on your story
what is it that you currently believe
but it doesn't really give you the
ability to see the context and to end to
sort of challenge your current set of
stories and maybe to come up with some
that you know fit the data better and
give you a couple of examples here so
one of the we've done a number of pilots
with this I've done to my lab directors
done one and the Miami folks in New York
have are kind of doing an ongoing pilot
and Marcy was one of the participants in
the first pilot that we did in August in
California in preparation for the
medicine two point O conference and
Marky's big issue was sleep disruption
so this the orange is is awake yeah then
she went to Burning Man so orange is
awake and she'd had the so this is this
is August and she had a zo since
may and pretty much every night looked
like this I'm not kidding it was said
she's just waking up constantly and you
know understandably concerned about that
and her number one theory as to what was
going on is that her in her partner were
waking each other up which you know
leads to some relationship stress and
and finger-pointing and wasn't so good
and so actually worked with both of them
and today and you know doing the quant
coaching thing and it turns out that
when they actually looked at the data
synchronized together they saw that
that's not what was happening and she
had some other ideas about food and
stuff caffeine that just didn't really
pan out and either and she went to
Burning Man and they had a ritual where
you take your burdens you symbolically
put them on a pyre you burn them and
then here we have perfect under night's
sleep and she continued to have perfect
under up nights of sleep and when she
came to talk to me after coming back she
was all excited she's like wow you know
it's I think I've figured it out and the
news story that she came up with based
on this this sort of surprise
serendipitous event is that maybe it had
something to vigilance some sort of
low-level vigilance response that she
wasn't really aware of were able to
access that somehow going through this
this ritual had had access to her and so
now she's you know that wasn't on her
initial list at all but it's it's
working well for her mike has has a
sleep paralysis so sleep paralysis is
where is heard of the opposite of
sleepwalking you become aware but your
body is still paralyzed and it's it's
pretty disturbing and it's been
happening all his life and there's
really nothing the doctors can do about
it there's no drugs you know no
treatments and and so he didn't really
have any stories go any any theories
going under the other than you know
sucks to be me and so we we started you
know send him over the zeo and my me and
he started cracking and within the first
week actually he he had the first sleep
paralysis episode yeah monitor
your sleep please oh it's a it's has an
EEG so it's a little van ug wireless
band and then they do classification on
the base unit and and so I actually got
email at you know three something am
from Mike saying I had a sleep paralysis
episode is the first time I was happy
about it so that was kind of funny and
sort of points out how changing your
role can actually change your experience
even you know when you're still having
the thing happened to and so then it
happened a second time before before he
met and we looked at this together and
from this he came up with an idea which
is an idea that he hadn't thought of
before which is these are the nights he
went to sleep the latest when his when
his schedule was sort of most disrupted
so he said maybe it has something to do
a circadian rhythm disruption which he
hadn't thought of before and so he
started working on how to reliably get
to bed at 1am and and that's something
we've been working on since and and his
experiences since have actually
reinforced this idea of circadian rhythm
disruption when he when he goes to Haiti
and he's sleeping in a tent and getting
up with the sunrise it doesn't happen to
him when he flies to Italy and and you
know is you know in a hotel and many
hours different it happens and so you
know he it's um and there's something he
can do about it you know he's and he's
actively working on his he's getting
batteries not hundred percent but he's a
PhD students Alan is a engineer and the
Bay Area works for Fitbit he's been a
type 2 diabetic for like twenty six
years and he was he had to stent
operations his hba1c was very high he
felt like he was doing everything he was
supposed to do and it just wasn't
working he begged his doctor for a
continuous glucose monitor and so the
green line here is a dexcom seven
continuous glucose monitor sent to body
track via the upload API and in at the
beginning it's it's out of range a lot
and he actually in paying attention to
what happened you know we would eat
something and then you'd kind of watch
the trending data
and go out for a walk and watch the
training data and he ended up coming up
with strategies that were not the
strategies his doctor told him that but
it worked for him and that you know as
time got on he got better and better at
keeping it in between the lines and at
this point basically he's got normal
hba1c s and he's weights way down and
yep this monitor work because you have
to sample blood right interstitial fluid
actually the glucose there's a slight
delay but it but it measures the
interstitial fluid you have a little
needle in your tummy that wirelessly
transmits to a little pod and it shows
you a little craft and gives you the
trending information in real time and
you have to do finger sticks about four
times a day to keep it in calibration
but you know it's he said he's much he's
much happier doing the finger sticks
keeping it in calibration and getting
the data from it than he was you felt
like doing the finger sticks alone he
was not getting the kind of insights he
needed now give you an example here so
the green light ends at the Dexcom data
and this is the Fitbit data one of
things he noticed is that if he was
getting out of bounds and he went for
like a one to two mile walk then over
the next few hours it would come down
but with transients okay so depending on
when you stick your finger you're going
to get very very different answers here
it's going to give you a very very
different idea of what the effect of
this is but when you actually have the
continuous data and you can see it over
the long run you can see these trends
and that really helped him to change you
know his idea of how to how to act and
how to how to self-regulate so talking a
little more detail about kind of the
process rather than just kind of the
what people found so this is this is
Gordon Gordon's been going for a couple
weeks now he talked to dr. Abramson and
then and talked to me before going down
to Australia where he now is and so when
you talk to dr. Abramson he set him up
with with Miami install Miami installs
are all custom and those of us who've
been doing the quant coaching with my me
one of the one of the things that we
as part of the first meeting is talk to
the person about what they want to
capture what they think is relevant both
in terms of kind of symptom or were kind
of experiential kind of things that they
want to capture also contextual things
that they think might be relevant and
that they capture and they can change
over time but this is this is you know
what he has initially so angina and
shortness of breath are sort of his main
sort of symptoms that he wants to track
and then and that are a cause of concern
to him and the exercise so swimming
growing walking he wants to to be able
to see you know what effect that has ur
doesn't have on on that and then hrv and
food are things that he think our he
thinks are potentially relevant context
hrv is heart rate variability it's a
measure a measure of sympathetic versus
parasympathetic activation so
fight-or-flight versus calm and so what
happens when he experiences one of these
things like when you experience is the
angina pain is that you hit the button
and then you can put in a value which
optional value optional comments
optional photo and then all of those get
wrapped up and automatically push to the
to the cloud server and then we can we
can pull them from from there also
suggested to him getting a body media a
new body media armband and and he's got
a heart rate strap he's been using with
a sweetwater hrv app which does not have
an API so he's that's why he's doing it
on on my me and then he's got body track
account the the top two here come from
the body media armband the same ones I
showed you before activity and and
actually this one's sleep rather than
lying down but basically lying down with
some noise and then hrv is recording
from the sweet water and then the these
are observations from the various Miami
buttons
and he's taking pictures of his food so
he can go through and you can see at
various points in time what he's eating
and so you know now he's got the data
you can go in and he can reflect on it
and this is sort of you know an example
of going through and doing that we're
here is a particular point in time where
he had some angina pain had some
shortness of breath and this is
interesting in that he wasn't really
doing much when this happened so you
know what's up with that interestingly
the HR view is incredibly low I so which
which means that sympathetic nervous
system activation yeah so maybe that has
something to do with it don't know
interesting data point and then here
he's actually quite active and the pains
gone little shortness of breath but okay
so it's not as simple as you know the
more active you are the more it hurts ok
so if got more we need to learn and and
he knows that so let's let's go and look
at more more data later on here's a time
when he had some some pain after after
one of these sort of big activity spikes
says walk to pool and 90 degree heat no
past exercise ? and then no pain on long
walk but slight I think the supposed to
be a shortness of breath and so here
sort of his thinking about what's going
on has has has evolved a bit this is
walking to the pool after he hadn't
exercised for a couple of days so now
he's like okay well you know I've seen
he's seen examples where he exercises
and and he's okay and you know so maybe
it's because he wasn't regular enough so
now he's got that story and and the
consequent of that story is probably
going to try harder to be more regular
about it and and this is the sort of
thing that happens it's like you know
you don't know when you're early in the
process like this where you're going to
end up but at each step along the way
he's got something positive he can do
when this happens rather than just you
know you know sucks to be me and and and
he can kind of go through and evolve
these stories to fit what he sees as he
goes along so one of the questions that
keeps cropping up is how can we and
or great medical data and medical data
in quotes and what I mean by medical
data is that there's sort of this this
big dividing line between everything
I've been showing you which kind of
falls in the non-medical bin which you
can do whatever the hell you want with
and the medical data over there which
essentially means that it it originates
within the medical system it's the kind
of stuff that you're the insurance
company perks up about and you know
there's there's all sorts of data over
here that's the that's potentially
useful and there's you know the question
of how to how delete the gap and which
direction should the gap be left there's
an interesting example of someone who
you know like me is kind of involved in
the quantified self movement named Larry
Smarr who has been doing lab frequent
lab testing and has had some interesting
experiences and some interesting results
and and if you're interested in the
Steve's got some good presentations
online he presented also at the qsr
conference and so here he's been looking
at CRP which is an inflammation marker
and lactoferrin which is another sort of
more specific marker and by tracking
that over time and he didn't really have
an agenda when he started is just you
know who hey lab tests but he noticed
that these things would spike at various
times and and tried to understand it and
eventually you know he and his doctors
realized that actually these are these
are bowel inflammation episodes and
having that tracking data and being able
to see things like you know how did it
change over time you know what's the
lead up to it i mean you know before
before they realize anything was going
wrong it's started going up and you see
interesting articles about things like
this about you know it's like well six
months before getting getting diagnosed
you know this the inflammation markers
were already going up that sort of thing
so you can imagine that this kind of
data could be really interesting for
people going through this sort of
process to be able to combine it with
all the other experiential data and you
know what am i eating and you know how
am I exercising and stuff so here's for
me the current situation which is which
is very non explorable I've got about a
half-inch thick stack of pieces of paper
just a lab tests these are these are
naughty
like you know other sort of sort of
stuff that's just the lab tests and you
know being able to combine this with
with you know the rest of the tracking
data is you know not in that form is
it's not so doable so how about
importing into hell fault yay elf oh
okay so I've got lots of lab test
results in here now you know this is
looking up well it's a it's digital now
it's secure but it's still not
explorable and what if you look at the
lab tests what you get is the name of it
and the date and then you actually have
to do a drop down in order to see what
the value is and if you do this this
very juicy looking a little export thing
up here the CSV doesn't have values in
it either um so you know it's it's it's
a step in the right direction but it's
not yet as far as we need to go and one
of the main things that that we need is
that we need to be able to support
comparison over over time and actually
in my just sort of individual poking
around the paper still won the hell
thought was very very useful to be able
to do a search on the name of the test
and be able to see the dates but
actually going through my my you know
date ordered pieces of paper and and
folding them up and putting next to each
other was still much more usable to be
able to see the trend then then looking
at it online in that form there's an
interesting example of a place where one
of the API clients has made a
specialized little tool that you know
only for these particular fields HDL
total cholesterol etc but you can see
the trending data over time and and so
this is cool i mean this is this is
definitely in the right direction so you
know can we make this more interactive
and and combine it you know more fluidly
with with other stuff and my current
hope for that and part of the reason i
was i was i jumped out at when Gordon
said oh hey you should go talk to guys
at Microsoft Research is the idea of
actually healthful acting as a bridge
between these worlds and being able to
you know if we just made this sort of
API client p
being able to incorporate that kind of
data together with the other stuff in
body track and you know there and
probably your lab test results would be
the first thing that would be
potentially useful and and being able to
you know sort of play with how to how to
deal with that you know rather than you
know trying to trying to deal with it
directly and so I think that your health
fault is really playing a unique role in
the ecosystem right now and it is the
only thing that I've been able to find
it that you can just haul off and make
an account on that is is working on
bridging this gap and so I think that
you know if we can sort of combine
forces and take some of the the Explorer
ability tools that we've been working on
and then and they usage models for that
and be able to also then leverage the
health fault data I think I think
that'll be awesome so hopefully while
I'm here I'll be able to you know kind
of kind of find out you know who are the
right people to talk to as part of that
vision as well as you know other folks
in other other departments so questions
so for folks like yourself who are
trying to solve a mystery huh can you be
a little bit more explicit about what
the practice is like today of doing
hypothesis formation and then hypothesis
testing you mean the in the standard
sort of medical model or in the quant
coaching model that was been working
like yes so for the quant folks it's so
given the nature of the demos you salute
you showed us it looked like hypothesis
formation is is almost sort of like a
visualization task you're just sort of
browsing your data and it's a task that
the visualization is part of the loop
but I think that that the the question
of you know how do I you know what what
story might better fit what hypothesis
might better fit what I'm looking at is
something that that now
surely comes out of the process of going
and looking at specific incidents and
and talking about them with somebody you
know what was going on well you know I
got up in the morning I went for a run i
went to the museum you know blah blah
blah and you look at a few of those and
it's like you know I've noticed that you
know whatever it is that you've noticed
maybe that's relevant let me go look at
other incidents you know that that kind
of exploratory process is the best thing
that I've been able to find for being
able to do this sort of hypothesis
generation and testing and one of the
really important things about that is
because it comes from the individuals
musings one you have access to a source
of data that nobody else has access to
which is your own you know sort of
personal memories that can be evoked
through that process and two it makes it
so that the person whose life it is is
empowered and is and has agency and I
think that that's really important a lot
of people are working on tools that
basically do hypothesis generation in
some machine learning kind of sense and
then and then feed it to the individual
but there can be sort of a gap between
that and the things that they are
interested in thinking about and
interested in exploring and that it
might actually be be something that that
will resonate with them and so I think
that by having you know the person
themselves be the generator of that it I
think there's something important about
that and and in and in not being sort of
you know further kind of disempowered by
the process yes the other side of the
fence best subject and object
what devices hardware whatever you think
you're missing now that
a big question um so the continuous hrv
i think is is sort of the the next
frontier that we all have hopes for and
we actually have a bead on that right
now which is that the polar HR 7 which i
have a picture of here agrega so this
little guy here it is using bluetooth
smart and it actually gives you are two
hour intervals which look pretty dang
clean so the the first step in the
process of doing heart rate variability
is to have really really dang clean
unfiltered our two-hour intervals and
this little guy now does this so my my
husband just in the last week has gotten
an uploader working for that that works
on so right now it's iphone 4s and 5 and
ipad 3 are sort of the only portable
things that we know of that have a
usable developable bluetooth smart stack
the androids aren't there yet
unfortunately the ones that have the
hardware still don't have the software
and uh well it depends on your usage and
if you if as part of sort of a
biofeedback kind of thing it's important
to get real time for our purposes real
time isn't as important as having the
accurate time stamps you want to really
really know when that happened in a very
precise sort of fashion so you can
combine it with other things all that
you're talking about a lot less power
and not having to have something right
so as long as it has a real time clock
that it can sync up with enough so that
it doesn't have too much drift yeah and
if you look at the base station for
instance that's that's what we do with
that but the person who did the base
station looked into it and he said that
the the Bluetooth smart reception
devices aren't there yet you have to
build your own stack and and so it's
just not quite there but hopefully it'll
get there mmm
stress what are the trade-offs between
using hrv GSR um so nobody really knows
and there there there are pluses and
minuses of either one both kind of in
the in the time domain you know how
quickly they respond and in terms of
false false parts of the signal and you
know really you want both BodyMedia
armband natively gets GSR they will not
give it to you the via the commercial
thing you can get at it with the the
research band but the the usability of
the research band is unfortunately
complete disaster I mean I have one it
is such a pain in the butt to use that I
don't so there's something called the Q
sensor that does continuous GSR and for
two thousand dollars a pop but I'm just
not that motivated to deal with it given
that you know five people I know could
it would be willing to buy one and it's
not going to it's not going to have a
bigger impact this thing has a much much
more appropriate price point if there
were a GSR sensor that was sort of
comparably priced and comparable usable
you know please please let me know about
it yeah I haven't seen it so you've
developed an API with good body track
that's kind of geared towards the
real-time data collection
have extensible to new devices yeah so
it's it's um it's actually geared
towards aggregating data with with other
data sources you so you have you have
the time stamp and you have the device
name and the channel name and it's a
it's a sort of package.json sort of
format with double floating-point unix
time timestamps in it and it's it's it's
pretty simple to use and that's what we
use for like for instance the Dexcom
seven data is being just you have to
think use a indeed a perl script that
just they're just called the just you
know HTTP posts and and so and then the
new system has has that as well and you
know so hopefully as these things become
available i mean you we do our own
little things but hopefully the ability
for this too will expand in the into the
environment and there's already several
several people who know how to do this
and have been doing it for their own
throwing little experiments but you know
what hopefully it'll it'll grow any
questions
