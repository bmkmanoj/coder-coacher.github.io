so thanks for coming to the cloak Liam
today we're very happy to have Erica
here with us she's a professor at Duke
working on economic development and
she'll be speaking us to us today about
classic microfinance models okay oh
thank you very much for inviting me to
talk so I haven't I think this topic is
very accessible mainly because there's a
lot of coverage of microfinance and the
media and most people have at least
heard about it to some extent um that
said I haven't given this talk yet to a
non economics audience and so I'm gonna
try to make it as define things as I go
along and make it as accessible as
possible to people who haven't thought
much about microfinance but please you
know cut me off and ask me any kind of
questions as I go along um so let me
just give you the broad motivation for
this topic so I'm a development
economist I spent a lot of time thinking
about determinants of of economic growth
in less developed countries and within
the field of economic development
there's wide interest in determinants of
micro-enterprise growth in less
developed countries just one feature of
less developed countries is that the
distribution of firm sizes looks very
different than firm sizes the
distribution of firm sizes in developed
countries in particular there are a lot
of there's a heavy concentration of
micro enterprises and what people refer
to as a missing middle very few ah
businesses that qualify is small or
medium enterprises so kind of a general
puzzle about why you don't see this kind
of transition from micro enterprise to
small and medium enterprise it's also
just a fact that a lot of the population
and less developed countries are
employed in micro enterprises and so
understanding anything about economic
growth of micro enterprises contributes
in theory to our understanding of just
economic growth more broadly there are a
lot of theories about why we see micro
enterprises remaining micro for
indefinitely and not kind of growing and
transitioning to even even very
profitable micro enterprises not not
growing but one of the key constraints
that people believe is important and
it's cited by micro entrepreneurs in
developing countries is limited access
to credit so poorly functioning
financial markets which is also a key
feature of less developed countries it's
for that reason a lot of people believed
that the rapid emergence and and spread
of microfinance institutions in the 90s
and over the past two decades especially
um could lead to important change in
this sector so the fact that we now see
a much more availability of small loans
among micro-entrepreneurs led people to
believe that we would also see big
changes in the patterns of growth of
micro enterprises in particular so
microfinance institutions uh were kind
of established in around nineteen ninety
we see the first very large-scale
microfinance institutions emerging in
South Asia by 2008 there were over 150
million borrowers across the globe it's
still an industry that's heavily
concentrated in South Asia many fewer
and the files are located in Africa and
Latin America but it's not exclusive to
that part of the world so we see a lot
more borrowers a lot more very poor
barros borrowers by my 2010 certainly um
and in some sense in that measure
microfinance has been extremely
successful so it's scaled up
successfully it's spread and it's
maintained very low default rates and so
that's kind of one of the key measures
of success um on the other hand there's
been a number of recent studies that
suggest that access to credit through
microfinance has had a very limited
impact on poverty reduction and business
growth so it hasn't been accomplished
what people really hoped it would
accomplish it spread people have have
maintained high repayment rates and yet
it hasn't pulled people out of poverty
and so one way to kind of reconcile this
finding with with kind of economic
theory is that you know maybe credit
constraints are
really not an important hindrance to
business maybe the reason that micro
enterprises don't grow and develop
developing countries is because of human
capital constraints maybe people need to
be trained maybe it's because labor
markets don't function well maybe people
can can't hire maybe there are barriers
to formalization on the other hand
there's actually evidence from another
set of studies there were late more
directly to credit constraints that
suggest the credit constraints actually
are quite important for my courage my
crow entrepreneurs in developing
countries in particular people have done
cash drop experiments in which they
literally go to a set a randomly chosen
side of micro entrepreneurs give them a
big chunk of money and then track them
for years and track business profits and
growth and find that that does have a
big effect on on economic profits from
businesses and so what this this study
attempts to do is reconcile those two
set of findings and we introduced the
idea that maybe it's not that credit
constraints are unimportant it's the
means by which credit is delivered
through microfinance that is limiting
its impact on poverty reduction or micro
enterprise growth and so what we do in
this study is experiment with the debt
the structure of the debt or the term
structure of microfinance debt and then
see if that has an impact on on my
credit price growth okay so before I
continue with the details of the
experiment let me just go over a few key
features of the classic microfinance
lending model this is what is commonly
referred to as the Grameen Bank model
because the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh
is one of the one of the first one of
the largest certainly probably the
best-known microfinance institution in
the world and although there were some
microfinance institutions that predated
the Grameen Bank they came up with this
very specific lending model and that
that model has spread to many other m-f
eyes the key features are group lending
so loans are delivered to a groups of
borrowers so the group is formed before
any money is dispersed sometimes but
increasingly less and not always
group lending involves group liability
so that if one person defaults on the
loan everybody is penalized to some
extent it also involves graduated loan
size so people are screened first
they're given starter loans that are
very very small that are meant to
establish that they have certain like
good financial habits and the ability to
repay and then they're gradually they
start their financial habits given
larger and larger loans and what we
focus on in our experiment is the
repayment plan that's very specific to
microfinance which is a repayment plan
that involves instead of two or three
large payments involves several small
high-frequency installments that begin
immediately after loan disbursement
sometimes literally they give you the
money and then you have to give some
back just as a token payment so what
this means is that there is there's no
grace period there's no period in which
the borrower has a chance to invest the
money and slowly ah before they you know
before the income stream might start
more generally there's there's very
little flexibility in terms of repayment
that's accommodated um so we know one
way of in which that's true default
penalties are basically the same as
delinquency so delinquent if you're
delinquent in payments after a certain
number of weeks its treated as a default
and so it's kind of irrelevant whether
you keep whether you pay eventually now
what's important here is that this kind
of lending model looks very very
different than a small business loan in
a developed country a small business
loan in a developed country would
typically include a very long grace
period and the term structure of the
repayments would be built around the
expected income stream of the business
um and so it would be understood that
repayment should be based on the
expected flow of income from from the
business as opposed to being very
inflexible so what we did in an
experiment with a bunch of
microfinance borrowers in India was to
introduce a microfinance contract that
involved greater flexibility and it was
opposed a very subtle difference from
the typical mfi contract we simply
introduced a two month grace period at
the beginning of a ten month loan the
idea was that the grace period would
encourage clients to invest more in less
liquid but potentially higher return
profits so we're imagining a world in
which clients have kind of two different
investment choices what is a very very
safe investment with relatively low
returns and the other is a less liquid
more risky investment with higher
expected returns and so what we're
tempting to accomplish with this is just
to divert some of that the loan money
into these higher return riskier
investments um we we studied the impact
of this by a field experiment in which
we randomly assigned this this new
contract type and the classic contract
type to two groups of borrowers in
particular the control group had the
classic Grameen Bank at lone in which
they start repayment in this case two
weeks after the load is dispersed and
the treatment group had two months
longer to wait before they started
repaying once repayment began the term
structure was identical and so all
clients repaid on a fortnightly basis
every two weeks the exact same amount
and again the idea was just to make the
mfi loan look a little bit more like a
small business loan in in a developed
country or to encourage people to take
slightly riskier investments at the
start at the onset of the loan cycle
what's also true though is that if you
encourage riskier investments in
expectation you should also expect
higher default rates if people are
defaulting because of risky business
investments or because of failed
business investments and that's
certainly consistent with the patterns
if you look at small business loans in
the in the u.s. not even I mean even if
you look ten years ago this small
business loans head
fault rates that were closer to ten
percent where is the Grameen Bank and
most MFIs and in developing countries
have Duvall rates that are two or three
percent so very very low default I think
you know conceptually I guess the
question we were kind of asking to begin
this research was is 2% really the
optimal default rate for entrepreneurial
loans it could be that that's just too
little risk to really expect poverty
reduction maybe if you're really
encouraging people to be very
risk-averse as entrepreneurs then we
might not expect them to be making the
most profitable investment decisions the
interest rates are not higher so the
interest interest rates for microfinance
are relatively high so interest rates in
these I mean partly these are much
shorter term loans and so the effective
interest rate here is going to be about
twenty five percent interest what's that
that's one developed countries do the
banks just lose more money from people
who cannot be so in theory the bank I'll
go over this more in the end but it
could actually be more profitable
potentially more profitable for the bank
to increase its default rate and well so
do they lose more money okay let me let
me maintain you in the same setting it
could be profitable for the bank to
raise its interest rate and increase its
default rate now in the US I mean yeah
it'sit's not really comfortable with the
transaction costs are so much higher in
developing countries that the profit
margin is going to be you know lower
even with much higher interest rates and
developed countries because the interest
rate these are tiny loans and so maybe
there's a fixed cost of lending so it's
not it that's a little bit hard to I
would say like adjusting for the loan
size bias interest rates probably are
higher in the US but that's a kind of a
complicated calculation to make but
right so the idea is that is is the bag
possibly not doing the right thing which
is how we kind of sold this experiment
to the bank maybe you can make more
money by increasing the
alltrade giving people more flexibility
and then in theory you could raise the
people should be willing to pay more if
they are making more money off of these
loans of course I think policy wise it's
a little more confident and so this is
what we we find we find that people
change their investment patterns and and
default goes up I think policy-wise
there are a lot of issues in terms of
what is the optimal level of default in
developing countries or just developed
countries given that there's not a
social safety net in developing
countries it could be that we want to
minimize default much more in developing
countries but that was the idea I mean
is this part of what's going on in terms
of the limited impact on poverty of
microfinance okay so we do this
experiment with one loan cycle and then
compare we compare investment decisions
what people do with the loan and then we
tried people for three years and look at
the long run profits of the business and
household income in general and then
also default rates the research design
was very simple this was just a standard
randomized control trial where the the
treatment unit was a loan group these
were groups um their 169 groups that
encompassed 845 borrowers the way we we
did it was to randomize to assign people
contracts after group formation but
before loan disbursement so people when
they form groups before they're given a
loan by the bank they undergo a two or
three-day training where they are
trained and had in with the expectations
of the bank are they get to know the
group members and what we did in our
experiment was that have warned them of
the possibility that they could be
assigned to either the default
contractor this new contract so we
allowed people to select out of the
experiment before they were told what
kind of contract they would have and
then right at the time they were given
the loan they were told eighty four
groups were assigned to the the new
contract and eighty five groups were
signed the classic contract so as I said
both groups so both contracts we try to
keep everything the same except the two
months the two months grace
it um in practice you have to you can't
really keep everything the same you
either have to vary the size of the loan
the installment or the effective
interest rate so if you have people
repay the exact same installment but
give them two extra months and the loan
cycle then they're going to have a lower
effective interest rate the way to
equate the interest rates would be to
make the loan payments slightly higher
what we chose to do I think both you
know we really wanted to isolate the
impact of the grace period and we were a
little worried about the impact of both
of those other changes that would go
with that we work that what the bank
insisted we do is to keep the
installment size the same they were
really concerned that clients would feel
that different installment sizes weren't
equitable that they wouldn't actually
calculate the interest rate and so they
didn't want the clients to feel they
weren't being treated the same I I
suspect that that's true but it is true
that we have slightly different interest
rates across these two groups and i'll
do a back-of-the-envelope calculation at
the end to convince you that that's not
driving the results ok ah so we did this
with a partner organization which was
it's one of the largest mfis in in
kolkata in india these were pretty
typically small microfinance loans so
the average loan was 175 dollars roughly
and they applied to annual interest rate
I said twenty-five percent the bank
officially says 22% I don't think that
they are correctly calculating all the
fees involved would they do that so I
think it's a little closer to twenty
five percent but it's somewhere in that
range in India interestingly so India
microfinance is a very heavy heavily
regulated sector and the cap on interest
for microfinance loans in this period
was twenty-five percent um so they do
try to kind of squeeze clients with lots
of fees in other parts of the world
microfinance loans have much higher
interest rates so in Latin America it's
more like forty-five or fifty percent uh
so say there's groups of five clients
these were individual liability loans
and so even though clients repaid in
groups
um they weren't actually penalized of
another group member defaulted and the
penalty for default is officially what
the bank says is that the individual
will get cut off from all further future
loans from that bank that's a pretty
heavy penalty at least right now because
the bank is a monopoly lender in the in
this neighborhood um so yeah I think
it's enough of enough of the constraint
that people pay a lot of attention our
clients most of our clients operate some
type of household business when we just
ask them in a survey do you operate a
household business seventy-seven percent
of them say yes and describe that micro
enterprise if we probe a lot about any
kind of self-employment or you know
income generating activity that's
originates in the household ninety-eight
percent of them are doing something that
I think we would actually call a
micro-enterprise so there is so almost
everybody in our experiment is
potentially influenced in terms of their
entrepreneurial investments by this this
type of contract these clients have very
limited financial access very few of
them are borrowing even from informal
sources outside of of our particular
bank and very few of them report any
savings so they really rely on this bank
for for business investments and like
most very poor settings there's a very
high incidence of shocks so these people
face a lot of uncertainty at baseline
sixty percent say there was a negative
income shock in the past month um ah
forty-two percent of the Mist days of
work because of that I'm not actually
sure how that compares um to to
developed countries it might not be that
much higher than in developed countries
but I suspected it is um in terms of
what they do with loans don't well in
terms of their assets more broadly these
are businesses without out a lot of
capital so the main form of assets are
is working capital so there aren't a lot
of there's not a lot of machinery these
are very very small operations there are
also businesses and we
the people people end up taking on a lot
of risk in forms that we didn't expect
it first so most of the businesses allow
their customers to buy on credit which
is a fairly risky thing for an
entrepreneur to do um fifty percent of
their sales are on credit and so they
are they're taking risk in that form
importantly for for this experiment it's
also setting which entrepreneurs report
that there's a very high cost of
liquidating their assets so the a the
investments they are making even the
working capital is very illiquid if if
people could just resell their working
capital at cost to the wholesaler in the
event of an emergency then our our
experiment should not have any binding
effect I mean it should be that people
are not undertaking any risk when they
make investments the risk comes in the
form of the fact that people report that
liquidating their assets would apply a
loss of 25% of profits and this varies a
lot across across the nature of the
exact industry that the households
involved in um just to give you a sense
of but before we do any kind of
experiment like this um we try to spend
a lot of time in the field talking to
clients and getting a sense of whether
this type of changing contract is likely
to influence their investment decisions
I mean you can come up I think we were
actually I really so this this exact
project originated from clients
themselves we were talking about other
types of changes to introduce to
contracts and we were thinking about
things that we thought of as much more
first order changes to the lending model
such as entrepreneurial training so
we're talking a lot to clients about
what would make a difference in terms of
changing their investment behavior in
their entrepreneurial behavior and all
of them said that having more time at
the beginning of the loan to undertake
riskier investments would be would
definitely change their their behavior
so these are the kind of focus group
reports that we received from various
thumb clients in the field that
motivated us to undertake this
experiment um
so the relevance of the grace period
everyone's involved in slightly
different activities so it really varies
across clients but both the people so
most people we talked to said that if
they had some time to wait before they
would make payments then they would
increase the absolute amount of their
investment because they are literally
setting aside money from their loan to
make the first few payments and so
there's going to be a change in the the
quantity of investment they also said
there would be a change in in the nature
of investment so people there would be a
compositional change in investment
because people would be more willing to
undertake more entrepreneurial risk and
the type of risk people said that they
wanted to undertake but we're currently
undertaking where things as simple as
they don't necessarily seem risky at
first but a lot of our entrepreneurs
sell saris for instance these are just
simple clothing that they're selling
from their homes or door-to-door
sometimes in in a stall and they said
it's risky to increase the variety of
saris they're sold because you know you
can't perfectly predict demand and
fashion is is hard fashions hard to
predict there are new fashions to come
on the market even in the sari market um
different lengths son you're different
different materials and learning about
demand is is something that's risky so
you can invest you can you know purchase
a lot of saris it's also true that
people are transforming their raw
materials to some extent so that
increases the risk so you can add
embroidery you can change the length but
once you've done that it's the
liquidation is costly so they said
learning about the market you know
they've always sold one thing so they
know that market very well but if they
want to increase the variety of goods
sold that that's that's going to all at
least initially some risk and the a
tailor that we talked to said that what
he would like to do is expand his
operations into a neighboring state but
that's obviously something that is
involves a certain amount of risk
because they has to go to the state es
to try to find the right connections he
has to try to figure out what the
optimal place to operate is
and again figure out exactly he had
heard that there were parts of the
neighboring state in which there was a
lot of excess demand for services but he
has to verify that so these are the kind
of of changes that we anticipate the
other thing that we anticipated was that
there would be some types of households
or some types of entrepreneurs that are
likely to respond much more than others
and so that's something that we can test
empirically in particular we expect a
difference according to how risk-averse
the individual entrepreneur is in
particular people who are very risk
loving don't need a grace period to
change their investment behavior they're
already taking on that risk they're
already willing to risk default and so
we should see especially large effects
among risk-averse clients microfinance
clients have the reputation of being
notoriously risk-averse um in that MF
eyes seek out that type of client women
are also more risk-averse than men and
microfinance clients are generally women
in our case they're all that well the
client is technically a woman the
business might be a male business
similarly we should see more of an
effect among people who lack other
income smoothing mechanisms if you have
savings if you have someone in the
household who's earning a salary that
you should be able to undertake risky
investments because you're not really
risking default we also expect there to
be a difference between some people who
have enough experience and skills to
actually take advantage of
entrepreneurial opportunities and those
who are novice enough or an unskilled
enough labor such as piece rate work in
which there just are not obviously high
return entrepreneurial investments they
could make and so we look for
heterogeneity in response to the
contract based on some proxies for your
business skill or experience and and
then there's some psychological measures
well there's one psychological measure
that we test which is how patient you
are how present biased you are which we
measure just from a simple survey
question that's not economically
incentive eyes we don't we don't um you
know pay people to wait we actually just
ask them how much they would pay to wait
and then get a sense of how how patient
people are and then we also characterize
households by how at risk they are of a
health shock so here I hear the
intuition is just that some households
are borrowing not for entrepreneurial
activities they're borrowing because
they need to finance health health
shocks and so or some other kind of
financing weddings or they're finding
financing something else and so those
guys should not be kind of changing
their entrepreneurial investment um we
we measure the impact of this experiment
with just a simple regression estimate
in which we're looking at we have a
dummy indicator for being randomly
assigned to the grace period contract
and controlling me we assigned people in
strata and this was done it was a
dynamic randomization that was done over
eight months and so everybody this is an
intent-to-treat estimate and that we're
just using randomization assignment but
everybody participated in the experiment
so this is going to capture the average
treatment effect of being offered a
grace period contract um so the first
thing we look at is self reports of how
you spent the loan what you did with the
money these outcomes have the usual
caveat of the fact that you know loan
money is fungible with all other money
in the household and so this is um
there'll be some amount of mental
accounting involved in how people think
about what they did with the money that
said we we do even with this kind of
self-report see an immediate difference
between those assigned to the classic
contract and those assigned to the grace
period contract in terms of the fraction
in terms of the amount of the loan that
was spent on on the business what we see
is a difference of the small difference
it's this first so the way this table is
laid out is the first column these are
all the different outcomes these are all
different regressions in each row which
is a non-standard so these are
different categories of business
expenditure and the first column just
presents the mean of the control group
the people assigned to the classic and
the second column and the third column
are the same one is just women without
control so you can just focus on the
second column is the coefficient
estimate on being assigned to the grace
period contract so that's the additional
or the amount less that they spent in
that category so what this tells us is
that the average I should have converted
all this to dollars the average client
in the control group spent the vast
majority of their loan on the business
that's what they report at least so six
thousand one hundred rupees on on their
business and those assigned at the grace
period contract spent an additional
three hundred and sixty five rupees this
is about a six percent increase its not
much it's basically all you know most of
their spending as i said is inventory
and raw materials and that's where you
see the bulk of the difference between
clients um where's that coming from well
you know according to our theory the
difference in the the quantity of
investment should really come out of the
money you're putting under your mattress
basically unfortunately when we asked
this these questions I think what we the
mistake we made was to not make that
category very clear we try to capture
that by a category that was savings and
I think ex post my sense is that people
treat savings as a savings account that
you are actually putting into a bank
money that you put aside that you're
going to actually spend in the next
couple weeks people aren't allocating to
that category we did constrain them to
report spending on of the entire loan
amount so that an extra amount they're
spending on the business has to be
coming out of somewhere so I think it's
kind of art it's coming out of home
repairs which in my mind is um just kind
of arbitrary because we didn't actually
give them the correct category um you
can actually you can make a case at home
repairs all the home repair seems like
the most liquid investment you could
possibly make the fact is um what's
there are a lot of accounts that people
are actually buying construction
materials as a form of savings so when
people
say home repairs there including bags of
cement and bricks which very commonly
people store in their back rooms before
they actually you know put the mortar on
the bricks and so you know one
interpretation that's consistent with
our simple model is that this is a form
of highly of low returns highly liquid
savings and you know they're spending
less on that and more on the hopefully
high returns again what I think is
happening is that we just didn't give
them the right category but i think the
relevant yeah the relevant takeaway here
is that people do report more business
spending you also see a a doubling of
the rate of new business formation which
is another type of business investment
that should vary it's a starting a new
business arguably is a very risky form
of business investment there's a very
low rate of business formation in the
six months around the loan so in the
control group only two point four
percent of households are actually
report starting a new business but that
rate does double among those assigned to
the grace period contract so six percent
of clients sorry five percent of clients
who are assigned to the grace period
contract report starting a new business
in the six months around after they
receive the loan and so it was this kind
of initial evidence that we measured
immediately after the start of the
experiment yeah
because you said first
yep now these people are they QB aware
that's now they are given the two month
grace period and sort of back in their
mind they think you are evaluating it
and if it's affecting all the contract
will be changed so that they have no
good that's that yeah that's a good
question um so one important thing is
that we never do focus groups among the
clients that we would have any
experiment so this is a very large bank
and there's a small fraction of clients
that are actually participating in our
experiment so we have lots of lots of
room to do focus groups among people who
so the we worry if we definitely worried
about the focus group contaminating the
experiment I don't think that fully
addresses your concern though I mean I
think there's no way for this to be like
a double blinded experiment that may
people definitely know what the contract
is um and some people have
so do you think it's a very noticeable
change one time and um so I don't well
they're not aware of us so they're not
aware that the researchers are
evaluating it I I imagine that it occurs
to them the bank might be trying out the
bank does try experiment with a lot of
new products you know not in a very
systematic way but they definitely
introduce new things and changes and
then you know either keep them or not
and so it would be logical for someone
to assume that because of this change
the bank is probably trying to decide
whether to do this for everybody I worry
a lot about reporting bias in terms of
you know but things like business
spending but yeah I my instinct is that
it's not likely to be very different
between the two contract types so I
worried that people are exaggerating the
amount they're spending on their
business um because not because oh
because because we're asking about this
loan I mean they know that they're
supposed to be spending money on their
business and so I think you know one
should always so I think I think I still
think it's meaningful to reported
difference between those two I wouldn't
take the magnitudes very seriously I
think it could be even it's actually
even regulated again the regular in the
microfinance official regulation by the
government you're only allowed to give
microfinance loans for business
investment not for consumption although
that would of course be impossible to
monitor the bank is what you know the
bank needs to document that so they go
to their clients and they say okay what
is the business investment that you're
going to make because you have to be
making one and so I think there's a lot
of misreporting what in terms of this
result I I think that I don't have a
strong reason to believe that there's
differential misreporting across the two
groups although you could make a case
that there would be this result was
enough for us to believe that there
could be an important difference and
it's kind of what motivated us to go
back the big the big expense we make in
the surveys and of tracking everybody
after three years and doing the survey
then and so we kind of did this initial
survey and said you know it looks like
people are behaving differently of
course it could be that they're
reporting differently I think the three
year results are going to be much more
robust of that kind of Miss reporting
because it's a long time after the
experiment but yeah I mean that I think
that can always creep in okay so what
I'm not talking so so three years after
the loan cycle began so two years after
they repaid their loan we tried went
back and tried to re-interview all the
clients in our study we achieved a
response rate of ninety-one percent
which was almost identical across the
two treatment arms which is which is
important and we were very concerned
about because default is much much
higher so we were worried about not
reaching as many clients in the in the
treatment group we try to capture
business profits in the literature on
micro enterprises in developing
countries where there are not very good
books necessarily on business profits
people have tried many different ways to
measure business profits so we did it
both ways basically you can just ask
people what your profits were and
everybody knows that people don't report
that accurately you know but as long as
there's not kind of a bias in the in the
mejor manera across the treatment of
control we believe that again the
difference is meaningful for instance
people no one says negative profits they
just they just know so we know there's
some kind of bias the other thing you
can do is try to very carefully measure
all the costs and all the income and you
know all of the stocks and you know
everything which is tricky because you
have to be sure to you know ask about me
people purchase a lot of raw materials
in bulk and then you have to try to
figure out how much of it was utilized
in each production process I think you
can come up with a pretty clear
algorithm for calculating it but I think
the real problem is that there's
measurement error in every single one of
those variables and so if you add up 30
variables that people measure with their
I don't think you get a distribution of
profits that is any more reliable and
it's also very few even when you do it
that way they're very few negative
profits so basically people over report
slightly income and under report their
costs no matter how you ask them so what
I'm going to show you now but it so we
did it both ways and the results look
very
either way um well what I'm going to
show you here is just this question that
asked what were your average weekly
profits now we asked them when their
business was last operational but in
this case that's going to be we're just
going to look at the average weekly
profits of currently operational
businesses and then there's a similar
question for household income which is
just what was your total household
income in the past month and you can do
the same thing with household income you
can add up all the labor income all the
transfers but it doesn't make too much
difference and what we sow our results
are presented this differently than
before so now the table is inverted we
have three different outcomes that are
weekly profits household income and then
capital in all businesses in the
household so these are household panels
we could also do business level but this
is all aggregated at the household so
these are average weekly profits across
all businesses in the household I think
there's an average of one point two
businesses for household and the
difference between this is panel a and
panel B is just we we top coded some of
the observations in panel B because you
have a lot of outliers in terms of
income and profits but nothing well the
magnitudes changed somewhat but the
significance doesn't really change and
this is just control with controls
without controls so they're basically
three sets of results here you can just
look at column one panel a column three
panel a and column 5 panel a and again
this is the coefficient estimate on the
dummy indicator being assigned to the
grace period so it's difference the
additional profits that were experienced
three years later by people assigned to
the grace period and this is log monthly
income so basically what you see is a
huge difference in household income
three years later so twenty nineteen
twenty percent difference in household
income among people that had been
assigned to the grace period it
corresponds almost perfectly to the
reported difference in average weekly
profits which is good so it's not that
differences in household income are
coming off of differences in wage in
Luke salary or or transfers or something
that wouldn't make much sense but people
are reporting much higher average weekly
profits in their businesses
and similarly they are reporting much
higher levels of business capital this
is what really stood out to me now
people have reported a lot of business
capital they have a lot of working
capital at any point in time this is
basically twice as high among people
assigned to the grace period contract
three years after the contract started
you can look at other measures of
business size you see it reflected in
the amounts of raw materials they have
about twice as much raw materials um and
they have sorry I think I was looking at
the wrong number say this is the control
mean so they about twice as much the
value of raw materials in inventory and
also almost twice as much in terms of
the value of equipment of business
assets which we didn't see him very
initially so that's something that's
changed over time you don't see any
difference in the in the size of the
business in terms of the number of
workers and that's kind of consistent
with what you see in a lot of other
settings that people expand their
business in terms of uh in terms of
number of clients an amount of inventory
and the volume of sales long before they
expand labor inputs and people believe
that's just because households are very
constrained in terms of hiring outside
labor so it's not not necessarily
inconsistent with what we would predict
but it's a little surprising given how
much bigger these businesses are um in
terms of those predictions about who
should respond more these are
regressions that test for that despite
looking at the co-efficient estimate on
the interaction between being assigned
the grace period and having one of these
characteristics that i mentioned before
so what this tells us is basically then
risk lovers on average people assigned
at the grace period experience how much
increase in profits unless you're what
we would call a risk lover and so then
you see that that goes down to zero most
things are consistent with our
predictions all they're not always
statistically significant it looks like
that if you have a savings account you
don't really experience this difference
among those
have a savings account there's not this
difference between the two experimental
groups among those who have a
chronically ill household member you
don't really see significant difference
in fact this this difference is
statistically significant so it looks
like if you have a chronically ill
household member you actually have lower
profits later on which is probably a
fluke we're testing a lot of different
things at the same time but could be
explained by a similar model in which
those people are are you know willing to
basically spend any giving utilizing any
amount of liquidity you give them to put
towards the health of their household
member and similarly hassles that didn't
have a business begin with those are
kind of like not the entrepreneurial
households we don't see any difference
among them and those that had a wage
earner we don't see a difference among
them um and then so the what you know
one name so the main benefit we see of
the grace period is just much higher
average income years later and that's
among the whole sample and that includes
a whole lot of defaulters so what we're
basically seeing is that those assigned
to the grace period also experienced a
much higher rate of default and so we're
imagining a setting in which we
encourage people to take advantage of
very profitable business opportunities
but there were winners and losers and
the people who won went a lot because
the average amount of profits went way
up but there was a default rate the
default rate tripled basically the
control default was four percent and the
default in our grace period was about
was twelve percent so we see a lot a lot
more you know people who are not able to
fulfill their contract to the bank and
that's kind of independent of how you
measure and it kind of goes so this is
very high this is whether or not you
repaid everything within eight weeks of
the due date people do repai eventually
but it's still even a year later you
still haven't much higher rates of the
fault
interestingly that if people took
seriously that what the bank says is the
penalty for default you wouldn't see any
repayment after eight weeks because they
basically tell you that if it's if
you're two months late will never lend
to you again and there's no um there's
no credit bureau or anything so that
should be it that should be the penalty
people obviously believe that they might
make exceptions they do keep repaying
like you so here goes from four percent
to almost one percent I mean that
suggests to me that the bank is probably
making exceptions either by accident or
or because its rationale for them to do
so but it's low enough that I think
people don't don't learn perfectly in
terms of the patterns of default there's
it's not that people so it's not that
people are defaulting immediately so
when one theory would be that people are
making all this money and then just
running running away with the money
because they don't need the bank anymore
I mean if you're if you think you're
going to be a rich entrepreneurial maybe
you're like well now i don't need the
bank anymore so I'm just going to
abscond with the money so this that's
what we would call strategic default
strategic default would happen at the
beginning that's alone so that should
fall over time and there's no evidence
that people are doing that you can look
at like the fraction of people who
repaid at least half the loan and that's
no different or the fraction another
another kind of theory would be well if
you give people a grace period this is
what the bank believes if you give
people a grace period these are people
that don't have what they call fiscal
discipline and so if you give them two
months and they're not used to making
that repayment they'll forget I mean
they'll forget that they have to make a
payment and so that again would be
reflected it should be reflected in
whether or not you made the first
payment I would think um I mean I've
done that I feel like I've forgotten to
make the first payment but then you get
reminded and you make it so it looks
like something that's relatively uniform
it's kind of kicking in in the second
but in the second half of the loan cycle
the likelihood of defaulting where the
difference in likelihood is kind of
uniformly distributed across but all of
the months of the second half of the low
um
another prediction which is actually
theoretically ambiguous although we
predicted the opposite because we hadn't
kind of thought it through carefully
yeah I'm at the onset is business
turnover that is whether or not you had
a business closure again if you think
you're encouraging people to take
entrepreneurial risk you would expect a
higher rate or we expected at first a
higher rate of business closure what we
found was actually a significantly lower
rate of business closure now these are
relatively high rates because this is
between loan disbursement and the three
year following so the rate of business
closure is very high I don't seem to
have reported it here I'm so it's
something like sixty four percent of
businesses closed in that three three
year period so it's significantly lower
for the control group although only at
the ten percent significance level our
explanation for that is basically from
one other and what makes it
theoretically ambiguous is evidence we
have from one other question which is
did you ever sell goods or services at a
discount to make loan payment and that's
also significantly lower for the people
assigned to the grace period contract
and so basically one theory is that um
they make investments at our higher
return and less and illegal so they're
less able to make or they're less
willing to liquidate the assets because
it's costlier and so they are default at
a higher rate because of that the last
what we would also like to be able to
observe is that people are actually
undertaking riskier riskier investments
or doing riskier things with their
business we didn't weren't able to
measure that carefully until three years
later and so we have a number of
indicators of risky business activity
but the caveat is that these people now
have much bigger businesses and so it's
not really a test our theory is you know
that at the onset of the loan you should
be undertaking much more risk three
years later we do see lots of indicators
that people are undertaking more
business risk but it's not obvious that
that's because it has anything to do
with experiment or or is just because
they have much bigger businesses
nonetheless they they
now this is certainly contributing to
the difference in profits over time they
are much more willing to extend credit
to customers they're much more willing
to allow customers to preorder goods and
services and then the number the
diversity of services or products they
offer is higher um I mean that could be
I think some people instinctively would
think of that is the opposite of risk of
diversify your portfolio of it I think
in this setting it's more likely to
reflect experimenting with new new
products are expanding to new markets
and I think what this is is also just
trying to explain a big gap in
profitability between these businesses
and once you hit a certain critical
business size you can switch to a much
higher return technology basically okay
so what we fight to month delay just
giving giving a small grace period has a
small a small noticeable impact on
business spending in a short run but
very very large noticeable impact on
income and profits in the long run but
at the cost of much higher default um
let me just say I'm trying to have at
two minutes and many things I could say
I think this is probably good summary of
their all sorts of competing reasons why
you might see this particularly the two
different sets of results so you could
give a lot of stories for why the
default rate might be different between
these two experimental arms it has
nothing to do the story I told you could
also give some explanations for why the
income and profits would be different
for other reasons I think what's nice
about our story is it's the only story
that um I think one could conceive of it
explains both sets of results
simultaneously so it's appealing for
that reason but nonetheless in the paper
we spend a lot of time trying to
convince you that the other explanations
don't have much bite some of them are
simple to dismiss so one is this what we
call an income effect the fact that the
interest rates are different so people
assigned to the grace period get
slightly more valuable loan because they
have a longer period of time good
thats you know slightly more valuable
own we're giving them explain the higher
rate of investment in business it's too
small to to predict any of even if you
give the most generous assumptions in
terms of reinvestment I can't really
explain what we're finding is it that
the extra money from default obviously
when you default you also there's also
an income effect you run away with some
amount of money could that explain the
the profit and income results assuming
that people take that money and reinvest
it and it has you know even reinvested a
high return activity and the extra cash
from the fall is actually small because
people are defaulting not at the
beginning but close to the end so that
that can only explain what we calculate
to be two percent the observed effect
and the last thing we do in the paper is
I'll let you guys read the paper if you
want the details is just try to convince
the readers that even a very small
difference in the amount of investment
you would make from these pretty small
loans if reinvested had a reasonable
rate and accumulating over three years
could explain the side the profit
difference that we find so could explain
like the capital stock differences and
you know the answer is yes under
reasonable assumptions about how much
people reinvest up their profits into
their business um and reasonable
assumptions about the difference in the
rates of return from the high return
technology to the low return technology
over three years you would see this this
size size difference in terms of
household income and the last I'll
summarize this in one sentence the last
part of the paper tries to answer the
question the fundamental question of if
this is so profitable why aren't banks
doing this one simple answer that is
just that like i said before pegs are
heavily regulated from raising the
interest rate in india um so then we ask
it of the hypothetical even though even
if they weren't because even in Africa
and even in Latin America they don't do
this they follow the Grameen Bank model
so what we do is we undertake a thought
experiment in which we take data from
our experiment and ask the question of
whether the bank could raise the
interest rate enough to
recoup all of its losses from default
enough to you know possibly profit from
a hired following a higher interest rate
there's some complications that arise in
doing that that I think are the answer
to why they don't uh there's four issues
and calculating the profits to the bank
if they undertake this alternative
contract one is that if you will if you
will if they can you could think of
different counterfeit you could think of
different thought experiments but the
one we undertake is if the client
offered the two types of contracts and
clients could select into it obviously
clients who select the grace period
contract might be riskier than in our
experiment because we're randomly
assigning it so we could have adverse
selection it could be that our interest
rate was the same more or less if you
actually raise the interest rate that
could induce people to to default at a
higher rate or change their and that
could change their default behavior and
it's also the case that if you offer
these two types of contracts that could
be that people who currently are not
even clients of the bank but they're
unwilling to take out a loan at the
current under the current contract might
select into the mfi and that could raise
default so that could make it
unprofitable and we try to adjust for
these things based on basically ask
clients their willingness to pay for a
grace period contract um so we use that
survey data to try to adjust for adverse
selection and what we find is
essentially the bank is pretty limited
just because of these market forces it's
pretty limited in terms of how high they
can raise the interest rates so if you
incorporate like a reasonable level of
selection and moral hazard moral hazard
is undertaking riskier investments when
the interest rate is very high in this
case um what you see here is so that's
this red line you can see this is a the
amount of interest that the bank would
have to charge and this is the relative
profits it could achieve so the red line
is the same profits it's currently
achieving if there's no selection and no
moral hazard it can achieve that at a
pretty low interest rate but as soon as
you incorporate selection moral hazard
there's basically no interest rate the
bank in charge to
achieve the same profits it's currently
achieving because the market falls apart
basically so that is that's our punch
line and I think the policy punch line
there is that the huge difference in
income and profits and coupled with this
market failure is a case for subsidizing
banks to actually provide this kind of
kind of flexibility and I'll end there
because I went over but I'd love to to
explain anything that was probably
unclear throughout or talk more about
these results don't look at the results
I didn't preserve yeah so use a two
month grace period do you think that
there is another one that would be more
efficient on maximize in common to all
um yeah i mean my sense is that we
actually tried to give give them the
biggest grace beard we could and the
bank was just unwilling to experiment
more than that even though we actually
cut meat we ensured them for all the
risk in the experiment in this client
group they were worried about contagion
to the other clients in their bank and
so they two months they thought was
subtle enough that people might not
notice or it might not get that much
buzz um I think I assume that I don't
know how these two things I assume
you'll get higher default and higher
business investment and risk the longer
the more flexibility you give people I'm
sorry I think um you'd have knew you'd
have to experiment to figure out what
the what the optimal is you obviously
want to balance those things and at some
point the default might be costly enough
that it overshadows the gain in
investment yeah
so that falters have lower income that's
for sure but they're not that I wish I
Judy that the distribution is not there
not it's not like a bimodal distribution
where at year three there you know
impoverished and destitute the
difference is is pretty slight I mean
they're in the lower half of the or tail
of the distribution but they seem to
have recovered largely I don't know what
role they also have not all been cut off
from the bank and so if the bank were
strict about its policies I think about
so the rate of real ending in the
experiment is about sixty percent and
it's about a third of the default errs
have a loan so about half of so that's
contributing to the economic success of
those guys yeah
massive infection because selection
comes from having his period interest
rate and some other words have no please
please yeah that's right that's right
the way you'd subsidize is that it'd be
like following the right you wouldn't
allow the bank wouldn't have to increase
the interest rate they would just be you
could subsidize by for instance giving
economic support for default to banks
instead of penal right now they're
really heavily penalized for for having
any kind of money in arrears and so you
can do the opposite you could actually
it's tricky because there's moral hazard
for the bank to but um you could try to
think of creative ways in which you
don't you can also overcome that
selection problem capital at the end by
a very small small change yeah I I know
that you said paper you did confirm your
calculation I'm curious whether you also
consider the fact that you're saying
like the average of the treatment the
capital is about twice the average of
control right new treatment we have you
know people who are risk risk lobby and
who have a salary workers yeah and who
had like an obsolete those have no
offense yeah that's a great pretty small
proportion while giving that site so so
it's not actually that there's also a
section of the paper that does that so
what's interesting is that those
characteristics that i showed you are
not strongly correlated and so a large
fraction sample possesses some
characteristic that makes them a
potential responder so what we calculate
we and we do an index and we kind of
show that the more of these
characteristics you possess the inverse
of the characteristic as i showed you
you know the bigger and effectors but
it's about sixty percent that we
calculate of their bout yes it's about a
third are slightly more than a third of
people who seem to be of the type that
wouldn't change their behavior at all
and that's about you can see that's like
yeah reflected in the sub
and and the fact that there's very
little correlation across the subgroups
so if you know if you have a chronically
a member but you're an experienced
entrepreneur then you are responder even
though you're less of a responder than
an experienced entrepreneur who doesn't
have a chronically ill member so even
and so that does you're right that
doesn't flate it Yunnan trivially so if
it's c % then that still means that
these doubling of returns becomes much
bigger than that but even that part can
be explained by a small difference in
investment and the rates we're talking
about kind of a doubling of rates of
return to investments which sounds like
a lot but that's consistent with what
people have found in developing
countries there are very high returns to
capital that have been documented and so
you know in this country your
alternative investment it's not likely
to have double the returns but in
developing countries that there's a lot
of evidence that could well be the case
so that's that's what it requires is
that I think that's the belief you have
to hold on to is that there could be
investment opportunities that have twice
the return when US is a chapter 11
bankruptcy like that right and that even
in Europe differences between how huge
structure once bankruptcy and although i
don't know if this is rob for small
businesses is that irrelevant for in
this setting which is essentially how to
pay back the loan
what's that look what's the safety net
for migrants me or what's that yes a
constant in a sense right you're dealing
with more flexible repayment plans which
is in some sense cup like to what do you
do when someone to cook bankruptcy yeah
I thought you said this in studies
arguing that being flexible with regards
to how companies can restructure after
that oh I seasonal just completely
alternative policy that you'd be united
Europe it's a very different chapter
yeah yeah no I see what you're saying
now yeah I think there are myriad ways
you could introduce more flexibility
into microfinance loans and I don't
think this is the most division this was
that you know this was a simple thing
that I think would be an easy policy
change but I think introducing what we
wanted to do originally was kind of give
people you know get out of jail free
cards you know so if something bad
happened they would be given some
flexibility when they need it i mean i
think that kind of bankruptcy is the
extreme case but you know even if
there's just health stock of the family
or demand shocks you know then people
can actually work with the bank to
restructure their loans that would
probably have much more of an impact i
mean its empirical question but in
theory that should in theory i think
those are the right policies for
developed countries to be focusing on
for a reason all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
