you
so much it's super excited again like
last year it was really very very
excited to be here but i found this code
very quickly and i just found a very
meaningful moment to just bring that up
in the beginning so I'm rific on at all
I'm currently a teaching at UCLA design
media arts department and I thought that
there will be very quick 10 minutes of
maybe it's a big big name to say but I
think it'll be very nice to wrap up
things what happened so basically I mean
like most of the media art student I was
truly extremely excited from the future
of and sci-fi was like one of the main
interest points in the in the life and I
was nine years old when I saw this movie
and I probably that's maybe the reason
I'm now in Living Los Angeles we are
almost three years ahead of this this
moment in the movie but if you look at
today actually the problem of public
space is having a huge problems there is
no way that we are closed at three years
and also the democratically using public
space it's truly not in that format of
maybe design while I was researching and
I found this very incredible point doing
the research with lemon of its poetics
of eigen space told a writing and he was
really pointing out the feature that an
artist architects and engineers may
combine a beautiful kind of a maybe a
new medium and if exploration in media
arts and architecture together while we
are today actually having this kind of a
notion of our perceptions truly immersed
by the social computing as an artist I
just thought that what will happen if a
light as a material cambia kind of a new
maybe a storytelling in a public space
and I cited as I media artist like six
years ago used light as a material on
top of an architecture as a canvas
collaborate collaborate with many
different architects to understand what
will happen if this dynamic perception
can be a kind of a new medium but then I
decided to move to light and space mode
space moment which is like coming from
the Los Angeles and then last year I
have a chance to show this kind of a
dream project that I have a chance to
collaborate with Frank Gehry and Los
Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra the idea
was what will happen is a simple build a
simple concept like an advanced design
building like that a cultural beacon can
transform into a kind of an
architectural intelligence form and I
was so lucky and invited to microsoft
research summit with my actually short I
didn't understand how important it was I
was at the state in eight mins I was
shaking but it was a wonderful day for
it was written Thank You Lee and
everybody there that that give a big
anger encouragement and make this dream
happen first Gary and his team was truly
invite invite being friendly and share
all their and trading models which is
kind of like a huge data set and a huge
like everything well there and the idea
was much much easier to execute as a MF
a candidate and then I was so lucky to
be combined with great developer friends
of it create a custom software by using
an open-source software and then the
idea became a kind of a case study and
that was kind of an important moment
that I want to just thank you again and
remind just reminded back so but after
that I was that important moment and
then LA Phil trusted is a case study and
this time the idea was literally
transforming their internal in interior
architectural experience into kind of a
canvas and and again luckily a gear is a
beautiful positive involvement and
transformed this building interior
experience into a canvas and and I was
so lucky to again combines idea with s
epic a sullen and his body motions and
use Kinect as this time transform his
internal I've kind of a conversation
between the 110 musicians and transform
his body motion into a kind of a poetic
connection so but I think the most
important part of that process were
literally bringing music media arts and
architecture in a one canvas was a very
meaningful moment and yet just wanna say
thank you and nowadays I'm also
researching about a temporary immersive
environment experiments I think we are
in a kind of this amazing leaf that is
virtual realities transforming ourselves
but I think we should not skip a
generation that probably will not be
involved and I highly believe that there
may be this kind of interesting moments
in even a simple room that we have all
ourselves in their houses here this the
simplest form of like architecture space
and transforming this into a kind of an
experiment platform and likely
transforming this space in two different
states and and researching on how
humankind's actually without any
political or ending national background
we have almost the same kind of a DNA
gene connection between those immersive
environments and today is that I think
is like one of the another dream that
happened after that amazing Mike served
moment and my dream was kind of like how
to collaborate in a much larger
this time literally finding a way to
create a public art project is permanent
and maybe you know that there is this
big challenge that if your people unlike
a via public artist unit like join this
one percentage competitions it's pretty
highly highly challenging many many
talented artists and genius minds are
transforming their ideas into a public
forms and I was lucky to be invited a
competition one of the artists in San
Francisco in 350 Mitchell Street and
this time and there was this kind of a
vision of a media media wall that has
been already in the mind of the
developer and architects som and it was
a kind of those pre-rendered world of
ideas and the biggest question of course
as a media artist and tried like
transform maybe this field how the
credit stories for public art in 21st
century was one of the biggest question
and actually the big ones but can public
art have intelligence memory and culture
literally transforming public art in
this case of like this very high and
technological input like how to really
bring this huge canvas into a much
meaningful platform by the meantime huge
computational power that needs to be
done so promising things is much
different when have this like kind of
competition challenges which we hear a
lot of beautiful stories today I thought
it will be very interesting to really
bring an open data set from the city's
existing website which is lunch in 2009
and portal contains hunts off to the
data sets for use by developers
anneliese residents and and more so
basically most importantly open data
portals enable a data-driven ecosystem
which supports a range of positive
outcomes such as increased quality of
life efficiency services better
decisions but most importantly maybe an
artwork that is kind of intelligence and
memory and culture so very quickly in
just six months we have to create a kind
of a custom pipeline custom software
that can analyze and listen real-time
many many different data sources and
most importantly divers is very a huge
frozen datasets coming from the city's
archives of open portal and i'm going to
show you very quickly a short video of
the documentation of the piece it's now
up and running and it's a very short
documentation and about peace
you
because it was a beautiful collaboration
with many people and I just like want to
share today with you before closing this
may be days and and I was really very
lucky to be collaborate for the first
time like at such an impressive team of
people and then really understand how
like a massive already openly available
some sort of publicly available datasets
can maybe become kind of an even notion
for the artist and sorry for the bad
language we had to create those with
small hackings for sure to get all these
real-time social network data and try to
transform them into a kind of very
massive GPU calculated heat map and then
transform those data cloud India and
understandable still landscapes and it
mean time learning how to really create
a logical input for the GPU computation
and try it like bring those very highly
detailed almost eight 8k resolution
screen and kind of try to create that
that world and the tremblay part which
was a huge inspiration and create this
parametric laser sculptures to transform
that screen and have this kind of an
awareness to know where it's located and
how it's going with its surroundings and
I think now I'm trying to teach this
topic to my students at UCLA and try to
understand how to like achieve 21st
century approach to public art thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
