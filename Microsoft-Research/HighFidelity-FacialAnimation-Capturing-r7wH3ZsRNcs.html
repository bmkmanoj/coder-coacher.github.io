graphics group of the Microsoft Research
Asia so in this talk I will introduce my
research project named high fidelity
facial provements acquisition our key
contributions that will provide an
end-to-end system for acquires a high
fidelity visual performance data which
captures a large skill deformation of
the face dream by the muscles I'm the
middle skill geometry details such as
the wrinkles and folds and left lowes
fun details no structures over the face
and you can see here and the odds of
facial geum each details and such subtle
motions are well captured there are a
lot of applications of this data you can
see that we can use these in the games
movies and also for the personal data
and for the TV show here there are not
how exciting work here however you can
say layer no one can achieve both the
high spatial resolution and high
temporal resolution here and our system
first are curious go by combining the
power of the Swedish scanner and the
motion capture system so that we can
achieve both the hand temporal
resolution enhance high spatial
resolution here we can represent our
system using a linear combination of the
high-resolution 3d faces there i'm still
at we can capture is 3d pieces using 3d
scanner and their motions using the
motion capture data and the cup I
combining these two to data together we
can achieve the final goal under on the
left side you can say it go and choose
our face it captured on right side you
can say the result rendered results from
our capture data with the texture visual
texture and a result texture you can see
that all the facial details those
wrinkles and layer motions are well
captured by our system
so in conclusion very first time provide
the end-to-end system for captures high
fidelity fidelity visual performance
data by combining the power of the 3d
scanner and emotion capture device are
we achieve risco</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
