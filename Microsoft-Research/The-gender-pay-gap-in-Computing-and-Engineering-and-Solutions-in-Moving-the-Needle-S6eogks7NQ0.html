hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
all right we're gonna get started I'm
really pleased to welcome you to the
third installment of our gender
diversity talk series we have two great
talks today but before those get started
I like to welcome Peter Lee up here c vp
of ms our next to give us a quick
introduction great thanks and I did
write note since I wanted to be sure to
get a all of the details right on our
two very very distinguished speakers
before I do that let me just to set a
little bit of context what the gender
diversity lecture series is about I
think it's been just a terrific series
and we're halfway through now this is
installment 3 of a planned five lectures
this year and I think in talking to the
organizers now I'll name them in a
minute there was significant inspiration
from a company wide QA that Satya held
last October that really sparked a
discussion on how to bring more
knowledge about the academic research on
diversity inclusion to Microsoft
Research and it makes sense to bring the
best research in topics of tremendous
strategic importance to Microsoft to
Microsoft Research and hopefully that
research can be translated eventually
into into real action the series because
of that was created with the idea of
bringing top thought leaders and
researchers in gender diversity to
Microsoft Research and help all of us by
doing so become more innovative partners
in supporting a diverse innovative
workplace and I think it's been really
fantastic though first two sessions that
we had this year I think we're really
terrific so I'd like to spend a little
bit of time introducing today's speakers
but before doing that I wanted to just
thank all of the people the whole team
that's been involved in organizing this
and especially
single out the three people who have
really been leaders in putting this
together those being Scots Epona's Jamie
teva and rain Johnson so please join me
in thanking them for doing this all
right so we have to really quite
distinguished speakers and they've
thought deeply about the challenges and
approaches to solving the issues in the
gender wage gap in computer science and
in engineering and I think there's going
to be sort of a tag-team approach if I
understand the plan so to start off
today we will have dr. Catherine Hill
who is a vice president for the American
Association of University Women or AAUW
and you can see the logo there and
besides being the VP for a UW dr. Hill
is also a COPI I on an NSF sponsored
project on women in engineering and
computing it's worth saying just a
little bit about AAUW I spent some time
this morning actually on their website
and they actually have quite a bit of
very interesting content there if you
haven't seen it i think it's worth
spending some time it's the nation's
leading voice in promoting equity in
education for women and girls
interestingly it was founded way back in
1881 which is quite an amazing thing and
today has over 170,000 members and over
900 college and university partners not
including just verified this morning in
discussion though the University of
Washington in Seattle they take and
examine positions on fundamental
educational social economic and
political issues and in doing so helps
to bring the latest thinking in policy
and research on these fundamental issues
to wider accessibility dr. hill before
coming to a UW was a study director at
the Institute for Women's policy
research and an assistant professor at
the University of Virginia she has a
bachelor's and master's degree from
Cornell University and a PhD in policy
development from Rutgers University
today she focuses on translating
scholarly research into reports that are
accessible to a wide audience including
to the media she will begin today with a
talk on the latest data on pay
differences by gender and computing
compared with other historical email
fields such as engineering and we'll
look at both the long-term trends as
well as projections for the future so
that's part one of three part 2 then
will be our second speaker speaker who I
think many of you know already dr. Nancy
Amato who is a unical professor of
computer science and engineering at
Texas A&amp;amp;M where she directs a parasol
lab she was also for a time in 2013 and
2014 the interim head of the department
dr. Amato's main areas of research are
in motion planning and robotics
competition biology and geometry and
parallel and distributed computing she's
graduated 17 PhD students with all Batu
going on to careers in research in
either academia or research labs she has
an undergraduate degree in mathematical
sciences in economics from Stanford
master's degree from UC Berkeley and PhD
from the University of Illinois she was
an eighteen t bell labs PhD scholar
received an NSF Career Award an ACM
distinguished speaker I Triple E arias
distinguished lecturer and it just goes
on and on including being a seat on the
CRA Board of Directors in the co-chair
of the CRA w as well as the NC with
academic alliance interestingly we are
having I feel a little bit guilty dr.
mario has to come to Seattle three times
i think in the by the two month period
she was here apparently just a few weeks
ago and next month is the icarus
conference which she is the program for
which he is a program chair it crowd
being one of the top robotics
conferences and it's being held in
Seattle and so despite those she's
coming again today and I'm glad there's
a little bit of sunshine in 2014 dr.
Matta received the 2014 CRA ha vermin
award really quite an honor
as well as the inaugural NC with Harold
napkin research and graduate mentoring
award she's a fellow of both the
triple-a s in the I Triple E so after
dr. hilde dr. motto will come and
discuss how texas A&amp;amp;M specifically
tackled the wage gap challenges it faced
and how they increase the number of
female faculty to nearly a quarter of
the department and what this has meant
for the culture of the computer science
and engineering department that's part
two and then after that dr. hill will
come back to the podium up to the stage
and transition to a discussion practices
that can help women pursue historically
male fields like computing and this will
be based in large part on a forthcoming
report from the AAUW entitled solving
the equation women in engineering and
computing and as part of this this will
include a special focus on ways that men
in particular can help create a
workplace climate that works for women
and people of color I think we're really
really fortunate to have two such highly
distinguished speakers with us today I
hope we can all learn a lot and be
inspired to take our learnings into
action so with that have our first
speaker all right are you talking to
this mic or I'm oh okay that's nice
alright I'm going to start off really
simple what is the pay gap it's a ratio
alright I'm not gonna stay too long on
that because I think you guys can do
that math but um the pay gap is
important issue in this economy and spin
issue in America for quite a long time
in fact a a UW's first study was back in
1896 and are we found a a pay gap back
then in the modern era on the way the
pay gap is measured is men and women's
typical not average earnings and it's
based on either the current population
survey
it or the American Community Survey and
it can be looked at in terms of hourly
weekly and annual now and it's always
full time workers but that's 35 hours or
more so there's full time workers and
then there's very full time workers and
sometimes especially in for annual for
example it includes self-employed and
includes annual bonuses and I bring up
all this all these weeds because the
numbers when you see different numbers
people often think well it must be wrong
oh it's just not you know really
counting for everything well this is
actually the reason it varies is because
there are many ways to measure it but we
have some historical ways to measure
which is normally the annual number
weekly numbers often use and sometimes
hourly it has on what question you're
asking all right so this is just a
description of where the pay gap is in
terms of the annual earnings and I share
this with you because it starts back in
nineteen sixty and moves all the way to
basically the present and it shows you
that there really have been three
periods in terms of the annual pay gap
and one reason by the way we continue to
use that annual number is that it has
this historical background for the
weekly and hourly earnings we don't have
that same data set in the same way so
what you see here is that there was a
big increase in the pay for women
through the periods of 1982 2000 and
since then it's been pretty flat and in
the beginning was pretty flat so the
question in terms of where we're going
with the pay gap depends a lot on which
trend you think is going to be most
representative of where we're going in
the future are we going to have a lot of
social change in the future or are we
going to have more of a stagnant or flat
pattern I wanted to point to education
because this is one of the big reasons
behind the improvements and gains in the
pay gap for women in eight in the 80s
and 90s and 2000 so what'd you see back
in the 70s I'm and goes back up to a
little pasta 210 and what we see is that
women have made gains a lot of gains in
education so this is the percentage in
fact in bachelor's and master's degree
in 1982 roughly 82 we saw that more
women we're getting degrees than men and
that's still true today although it's
sort of leveled off it's not continuing
to climb like lives in the doctors level
the phd level we're now at a slightly
above parity slightly so this tells you
a big piece of the story but what we
have to question now is is when we look
forward going forward where are the new
gains for women's employment going to be
and for women's wages okay i want to
show you just a few other things about
the overall number and then we'll focus
in on computing and i will look in at
college students so overall these are me
this is the weekly earnings but what you
see is that women and men we see a gap
at every level of education so but less
of a gap at the high school and less in
high school an associate's degree level
and a bigger gap at the professional
level seventy-four percent and so it's
interesting education of course was
really the crux of how the pay
difference is narrow so much in the past
and yet we see bigger differences among
men and women in terms of the pay in
professional fields oh you'll notice
just for all of you with a PhD you'll
see that we the salaries go down a
little bit with the PhD from the
professional field so you can feel and
make your friends who are in doctors and
lawyers can pay for your lunch so your
earnings by age is another important
factor of course when we start out young
people earn very similar amounts there's
a smaller gap ninety percent
in age of 16 to 19 and of course during
the prime earning years during the years
of the near 30s and your 40s and your
50s when you're making the bulk of the
income you're going to bring in there we
see a higher a larger gap in men and
women's earnings and this of course is
by race and ethnicity and we see gaps in
it across the board but the gaps are
really different and different racial
groups so by four white innocent has
asian men and women we see a gap of 78
and seventeen seventy nine percent um
the in the other fields is a smaller gap
so it's gap itself between Hispanic and
Latino men and women is only ninety
percent of course you also have to
consider the overall earnings because in
fact we don't really want to close the
gap right we want to raise women's
earnings and raise men's earnings we
don't want to close the gap at all costs
um I wanted to just to point out that
when we talked a lot about pay but we
need to look a little more broadly than
just pay we need to look at all the
benefits and compensation I think all of
us are probably aware of the different
kinds of compensation that is tied to
our paychecks so pension plans are often
tied to our paychecks and so over time
we see that women men are the darker
color the brown or mustard yellow and
the gray is women so what you see is
that it's more likely for educated men
to have pension plans than for women to
have their own pension plans and that's
of course important it's one of the
reasons why we see women having such a
being so much more likely to be in
poverty in their old age is pensions and
other kinds of savings of course all
right well this should be sort of
familiar I don't know if you can read
these but this is just a regular
everybody civilian employed population
this is computer programmers computer
support specialist software developers
computer system
analysts industrial engineers electrical
mechanical and civil engineers so let's
go back to say software developers
there's an eighty-seven percent gap
between men and women in that field and
there's a similar gap among computer of
say between computer programmers here is
actually a ninety-two percent gap and
that's actually really fairly small and
so what we have to say is that within
computing the gaps tend to be much
smaller than they are elsewhere in the
economy this is the rest of the economy
and in computing we do see differences
but they're not as large and if you want
to understand the next question of
course before I go on to answering that
question I want to just address the
question so while this is not so
important and why is it so important now
and it's because we've seen a real sea
change in terms of how people are living
in terms of the households that people
are living in and you know back in
nineteen sixty very few people were
single mothers it was very uncommon for
women to be the ones who were supporting
the family when they were Co supporting
the family today that's changed a great
deal today twenty-five percent of
mothers are this are single mothers and
another fifteen percent are jointly
bringing in income a large percentage of
income in the family so about forty
percent really can be looked at as
breadwinners and that was not the case
in the past so what women earns matters
a lot more to women today especially
those who are having kids on their own
are not I mean families with with men or
just are single alright so of course one
of the questions that I think you
probably all have is okay so what are
you taking into account is are these
gaps real are they what are they based
on that based on women's choices or they
based on things that women have no
control over and I'll give you a heads
up that the answer is it's both of
course but I wanted to talk about a
study that we did
at AAUW where we looked at men and women
at a point in their careers when they're
more similar to one another so we looked
at college graduates one year after
college graduation we use a data set
that is available on the website for
anyone who would like to use it it's
called the baccalaurÃ©at beyond data set
and it's in the National Center for
Education Statistics website and it's
free and they have something called a
power stat tool so if you want to try to
reproduce any of our numbers you should
be able to do that this is not a full
apples to apples comparison that's a
little bit of an overstatement it's not
but this is a group of people who tend
to be most of them were childless they
or not yet married there this is the
first time all of them are going to be
working full time we're not looking at
the stoop people who went on to grad
school we're just looking at the people
who are working full-time and not in
school you know and they came from you
know similar colleges and universities
and similar grades and we looked at all
of these and found a pay gap of
eighty-two percent one year after
college graduation and this was really
interesting to us because it you know
you just we had a lot of these guys have
a lot in common well we took a careful
look at what some of the main issues
were what was driving these differences
then one issue was college major women
were more likely than men to major in
some of the fields that did not get
higher salaries the humanities you know
social science was sort of mixed but
surprise surprise computing and
engineering do very well in terms of
salary right out of college better than
in fact a lot of other professions where
you need to get advanced degree to
really benefit from your from your
education economically okay so we looked
at hours work hours worked was another
one we looked at women tended to work
less hours by about three hours a week
the college major differences in college
major differences in occupation so women
were more likely to go into say a math
major might go into teaching as opposed
to a firm so some of these things are
about people's choices but what we did
is in a regression analysis when we
looked at all these things that we know
affect earnings and what we found is
yeah it did explain a big chunk of it so
we got to ninety-three percent that
could be accounted for by all the
variables that we could find which
suggests that there's a small amount of
difference that was not um we can't
account for now it could be a lot of
things it doesn't have to be
discrimination but one of the things we
were interested in is is discrimination
because we won't look take a look at the
experimental data not something we're
going to be talking about today when we
talk about a number of different studies
where we see that men and women to both
don't consider women to be quite as good
as men in mathematical tasks so I think
that this way is some questions for us
and made us want to take another look at
this this information and some ideas for
action I wanted just to throw out now
and maybe we'll we'll talk more about
this later but um some of the things
that we've seen in our conversations
with both employers and also with media
and other folks who have been reached us
on this issue people have experimented
with using initials rather than names on
a resume conducting a job audit to
monitor pay across companies different
parts of the company that's also
something that's not always done this is
an idea that may not work for computing
but it's an interesting idea of setting
a price for the job like it's you get
paid 80,000 for this job and that's the
price no negotiation if you want a
different price you have to be promoted
to a different job and that's because
there are differences in negotiation
strategies for men and women and women
tend not to negotiate as much and also
so lose out on some opportunities you
know of course the the idea is we one of
the things we don't see is enough women
going into the technology and
engineering fields in general so that's
really something that we need
to to be doing in terms of women's
choices is helping them envision that
these fields can be for them another
issue we look at is the question of
transparency and pay which is always a
little controversial but there's
different levels of transparency and
different ways to talk about it and
think about it your company so those are
some of our comments on equal pay so
thanks for having you here and Peter I
have to say that um I don't mind coming
to seattle that much because I'm
actually from here and my parents are
very glad that I have been coming so
frequently although this trip is pretty
painful because I left after my class
yesterday and I'm going to take the
red-eye back tonight so I can get back
in time for my class tomorrow morning so
um what I want to talk about is some
kind of more specifics about how we've
dealt with some of these issues at Texas
A&amp;amp;M and I'll first start off talking
about some institution-wide salary
analysis that that we've been doing and
how we're using that to basically make
changes then I'll talk a little bit
about how we've increased the number of
female faculty in our department from
about eight percent to around quarter
now and then i'm going to give a plug
for some of our CAW programs that we've
been using to I think have helped us in
you know what the latter part there so
first off um basically I'm going to
start off and tell you a little bit
about my own experience but basically
state universities usually have fairly
typical uniform starting salaries as
assistant and the standard raised on
promotions annual raises are basically
determined pretty much entirely by the
department head and at Texas A&amp;amp;M like
many state universities our salaries are
publicly available you can find them
online so um that's that that's all some
of the transparency issues which
companies have right you know you don't
really know how much that person next to
you is making necessarily but here's
just so my experience i started at texas
A&amp;amp;M as an assistant professor in 1995
and I've been there ever since I was
basically
promoted early to associate so in two
thousand and a little a little bit early
also to full in 2003 so you would
imagine that I was doing pretty well
okay so when I got promoted to associate
professor um there was a guy I don't
know who it was I have a suspicion but
somebody would go around our department
and they would make a photocopy of all
the salaries for our department from the
day go to library and get that they put
in all our mailboxes so when I saw that
right after I did she always so proud
I'd been to so promoted and all that and
I thought I had a pretty good race well
I looked and um my race of five percent
which I thought was you know good was
less than some people that were still
assistant professors you know just kind
of and ones that I knew weren't doing
that great and you know and they'd have
like ten eleven percent raise so I was
like shocked so I talked to my
department head and I remember he still
came to my office and I remember him
writing on my whiteboard and he said
what those of you who don't know my
husband's also a faculty member in
computer science and engineering he
although came a few years after me so he
was still an assistant professor at the
time but he told me like Nancy you and
Lords together make almost as much as me
and I'm like so what but how is that
what what's the relevance there and then
he also told me that these two assistant
professors that I noticed had received
much higher races and I did on my
promotion year remember that they had
families you know they had wives and
children that needed to to provide for
so I was just honestly flabbergasted and
I'm I'm not that shy but you know I
think it was pretty clear that I was
pretty upset so but you know I'm like
what what can I do um so then about six
weeks later I get a note in my mailbox
that there's been an error and it's been
corrected and I then had a ten-percent
raise which I later on found out
everyone's supposed to get a ten-percent
raise when you get a promotion from
you know assistant to associate or
associate to fall so I really don't know
what's going on there but that was one
of my experiences and then when I was
came time for me to be to go for full I
did want to go a little bit early but I
wanted to go up for you basically decide
when you're going to put forward you
have often no choice for the assistant
to associate I did choose to go early at
the time that's another long story I
want to share with you but for the
associate to full I wanted to go a
little bit early because I wanted to go
on sabbatical and I did not want to have
to deal with that process while I was on
sabbatical and I thought I was doing
pretty well so I went and I talked to my
um that our associate head who was he
was kind of in charge as a promotion and
tenure committee so he was the right guy
to go talk to and he'd been sitting in
and doing the annual evaluations of me
every year with the department head so
you would imagine that he would be
familiar with my record and what he told
me is he told me he's like Nancy um you
know people don't get promoted full
professor for service and I was like
just shocked because I thought I was
doing pretty well in terms of research
and so then I thought oh boy maybe maybe
I not doing that well so i went to
actually one of my colleagues the only
other female professor in the department
and she was on the promotion and tenure
committee and I asked her hey Jennifer
can you look at the letters i got when i
was promoted to associate maybe there
was something wrong with him maybe they
weren't good and um so she checked and
she came and she told me no they were
really good you know don't worry about
it so I didn't worry about it I went and
it worked but you know basically i got
that negative feedback that I wasn't you
know somehow good enough to already go
for full um and then um and I think that
this happens frequently you know
basically because he knew I did a lot of
service and so he kind of somehow
thought well if you're doing that much
service you can't possibly be a good
researcher to or something but he was
evaluating me every year and then the
other thing is that I kind of got a more
global picture of how things work a year
ago I was our interim department head
and basically the department heads are
pretty much solely responsible for
deciding what the races will be for all
the faculty and staff in the department
the department had proposes the raises
you typically have some Ray's pool which
you are given some parameters as to how
you can allocate it and then the Dean
has to approve it but basically they're
pretty much just agreed to what you do
so now I want to tell you about
something that Texas A&amp;amp;M has been doing
which I experienced as the department
head and I think it's a really great
thing so we have an advanced grant from
NSF and this is and if you're not
familiar with NSF advanced program it's
a program which is basically trying to
help institutions come make change with
regards to gender equity in their
institutions through maybe leadership
promotions pay many different aspects in
Texas A&amp;amp;M has a grant and part of that
program is they do an annual
university-wide analysis of the pay for
all the tenure and tenure track faculty
members and what they were trying to do
that kind of the initial goal was to see
if there's any difference between the
male and female pay rates and you know
correcting for things like you know
years in rank etc and they were also
used this as an example to see if there
were any differences based on race and
ethnicity and auto natural origin
whether you native born in the US or not
and so they were kind of developing some
kind of statistical measures just to see
if there were any issues and then they
also were flagging individuals and both
of those things have been very effective
and it's been so successful that the
universities can committed to continuing
this after our advanced um grant expires
this year so kind of how does it work
there were they were trying the
researchers were actually they're both
from Texas A&amp;amp;M one is a social scientist
researcher and another one is a
researcher basically working with the
dena faculties office but they want to
come up with a predictive
model for salaries for the tenure track
faculty that's based on oops that's one
of my edits based on ten years of data
and they were trying to use democratic
variables such as gender title age race
and ethnicity the years in service it
does not account for productivity okay
so but it's just things that are
measurable okay and they come up with
these models and they developed a
separate model for every college and
they allowed for different ending
indicators within the departments ok and
they got input from the deans and
department heads into this model I will
talk a little bit more about that later
so here's some results of what happened
just kind of the statistic wise from our
last one that we had in the College of
Engineering so computer science and
engineering is in the college of
engineering as well as ECE is also in
the College of Engineering so all the
computer science you know faculty are in
engineering and what you can see here
this is a weight just as the so this is
for college of engineering science and
agriculture and life science they have
things like biochemistry and biophysics
in there but this is a female salaries
as a percentage of the male salaries and
in engineering you see that the females
the women are making 102 percent of the
male salary so they're doing a little
bit better than on average then the men
now there are many fewer women right and
at the bit but it's very similar
basically just looking at these numbers
they're really it seems like engineering
is doing pretty well oh man it is in
fact in science which includes math
biology chemistry and statistics the
women aren't quite the same as the men
and in some of those departments are
quite a few women like but still there
you know men are a majority now in Ag in
life sciences they broke it up into the
ones that are considered in the STEM
fields ernin on STEM fields and
interestingly in the non STEM fields are
doing worse than
in the STEM fields but in the STEM
fields we don't have as many women
generally here's another one that I
think interesting and we're looking at
this for using ethnicity and natural
born okay so basically there's three
values for each College Asian as a
percentage of the white salaries other
non-white so this would be like
hispanics and blacks etc as a percentage
of white salaries informed worn as a
percentage of the native-born so in
engineering it's looking honestly pretty
good the Asian salaries are 93 99.3
percent of the white salaries the others
are 99.4 and basically parody here for
the native versus foreign-born some of
the other colleges are a little bit
worse but you know overall it these
numbers look pretty good but they didn't
always look like this these these
numbers have improved over the last
three years really because of these
stories analysis um this is the one that
I think is more important honestly than
you know the average is because the
numbers are really big so in engineering
for example we have around 400 faculty
so I think that's from what I've heard
that's about the same size as like
Microsoft Research number of PhD
researchers so on the same order so
those are numbers honestly big enough
that you know averages aren't always
that useful but another thing that's
done is individuals are flagged and this
is provides a report to the deans and
the department heads identity
identifying faculty whose monthly
salaries are not in line with that
predictive model now remember that model
does not account for research
productivity ok it's not quality it's
just aged number of years at rank etc
for each one of those individuals that
flagged the department head has to
either provide a justification or
address it so the justification can be
really simple you know it's warranted by
you know productivity then the Dean must
review that and submit that report to
the Dean of faculties now you have to be
care
to do this as the interim department
head and there were individuals in our
department that were flagged none of
them caused me to actually make a salary
adjustment for the 10-year tenure track
faculty but i did get another report
which they've started running on the
teaching focus faculty and i did make
one adjustment based on that we had a
this is all recorded we had someone who
was significantly under paid based on
the statistics and by twenty percent and
i was able to justify putting forward a
twenty percent raise when we were given
a two percent raise pool um but it was
basically because of this the statistics
that I was given I was able to do that
now when you you do have to be careful
you can't just write warranted by
productivity because the Nadine is going
to look at your annual evaluations that
you're putting forward and if if that
person is not getting you know if
they're not getting a negative
evaluation in their underpaid that's
going to be a problem so these these are
taken very seriously but I found this
really useful and I had no idea what's
being done honestly although it's very
public in the reports on the website
it's just something they didn't really
talk about too much in terms of this but
it has had some impact so here's to show
you kind of the num percentage of
individuals that get in flagged so in
engineering last year in the 24 1 so
okay so these numbers so in engineering
there were five point three percent of
the faculty female faculty work that
were flagged because their salary was
lower than predicted by this model and
five point eight percent of the men okay
and there were five point three percent
women that were flagged because they
were higher and eight point seven
percent of the men were flagged and for
the other colleges to you know business
I you know it was kind of interesting
because they didn't have anyone that
were flagged to be too low but they had
a number that were flagged because they
were very high but this um you know it
is even after the third year of doing
this there are still individuals that
get flagged
for this process and initially when they
started doing this it was met with
distressed by the deans and department
department heads they basically did not
want to have to deal with this they
thought they were good it was going to
be um bad data and you know just another
thing that they were going to have to
deal with the pis who to who ran this
study they basically went around and met
with all the department heads and the
deans and they made sure that they spent
serious time with the departments who
ended up with a lot of faculty that were
initially flagged okay they realized
where those problems were going to be
and spent time with them and they got
feedback on the model and in fact they
brought in other variables to the model
so one of the things for example that
ended up that they ended up adding to
the model that they originally hadn't
was the rank at higher so that when
people came in and like an associate or
full percent professor rank their
salaries tended to be higher and so that
needed to be adjusted for appropriately
and they came that came from the College
of Architecture for example and then
that helped them you know basically kind
of improve the model and also you know
they could explain it to the faculty in
the department head so they know where
it was coming from the Dean of faculties
finds this extremely useful and they're
planning to continue with this after
this program is you know the advanced
grants over and they said that you know
initially the deans and department heads
were unhappy with it but now they they
believe it and there you know it's just
kind of part of the annual you know
salary process and they said that from
the our dean of faculty said that every
year ten to twenty faculty get raises
because they show up on that report and
it's not just women I mean it's it's
helping everyone it's better for the
whole institution really in its it's
something that maybe came from this
advanced grant that was focused on women
but it's been good for everyone overall
so
there's I can you know this study was
done by Lori Taylor who's a faculty
member in the in our Bush School of
Government and public service and Jeff
Freud who's in the Dean of faculties
office Laurie is very happy to answer
any questions or people have questions
about it and we have the this report is
online and actually the previous ones
are as well so if you have any questions
about this i'm happy to try to take them
but you know if you have methodology
cool studies about questions about the
study they'd be better to go to to
Laurie but you know I i have used it you
know seeing it from the perspective of a
department head and it was you know I
think really valuable frankly in my
experience and i think that overall most
people aren't you know evil they are
just um everyone i think kind of agrees
that diversity would probably be a good
thing sometimes they're just not
knowledgeable about it and sometimes
there's also just a general lack of
sensitivity they're not aware and so we
end up with a lot of unintended
difference in treatment and expectations
so for example from my personal
experience when I went to Texas A&amp;amp;M we
have an industrial affiliates program
like most universities do and typically
what would happen is the new professors
would be asked to give a research talk
to the you know brief research talk to
the industrial affiliates to let them
know what they're up to well the day
before our I showed up in January which
is kind of unusual and so normally it's
in the fall when they have the
professor's do there the new professors
give their talks but I came in January
in the day before this meeting our
department head who had hired me right
so he obviously thought I was a good
addition to the faculty he asked me to
come and talk to our industrial
affiliates about women and computing and
donned about my research in and you know
honestly at until that point I hadn't
really done anything with women in
computing I didn't know anything about
it at all so I I knew that they were
starting some women
computing group at University of
Illinois when I left but I honestly
hadn't been too involved in it and so I
didn't really know anything at all so I
frantically was trying to find
information and and I did that and then
I started the women in computing group
in our university which is you know in
our department which is going strong
today and I'm really glad I did that but
you know that was not how I it was kind
of different that he treated me that way
and often were asked to do extra service
and I like to do it i still do it a lot
today and i'll talk to you a little bit
about more later on with CR aww but then
when i was trying to go for promotion to
full professor because I done all this
service he's like you know that's how he
kind of you know pattern matched me
you're Nancy does service you know and
didn't think about me in the same way as
he did about the other people who maybe
weren't doing service cuz you know he
didn't know about those other things
about then and Nyssa was never um no one
ever met me ill but it would just kind
of colored the way they thought about me
and so I think that that's we don't have
there still are some things that are
really done for bad reasons or that are
really prejudicial but I think for most
cases it's not that it's it's more
benign but it ends up hurting a lot of
people so we'd really need to improve
awareness here's something that happened
at Texas A&amp;amp;M just in terms of our
faculty when I started in nineteen
ninety-five I was a second woman in the
department and then I was still the
second woman up until about two thousand
and one and then at that point we had a
we hired a the next woman who many of
you know Valerie Taylor we hired her as
our department head and then we hired
you know from since then we've been kind
of steadily growing and now today we're
about twenty five percent women which is
quite high for a research you know
department and so and we also have
generated
ethnic diversity among those women we've
got two african-americans one Hispanic
and two Asian women so how do we do it
well I think it really requires you know
grassroots buying institutional
practices we have required training for
all of our search committees you
probably have things like that here too
but it used to be originally they just
made the chair of the search committee
go but now they make everyone go and you
have to go every two years it's frankly
pretty annoying but you know you have to
sit here and listen to all that stuff
and it reminds you things are important
and it reminds you like those questions
you're not supposed to ask and those
kind of things and it just makes the
whole process I think work better and
then we've also been really good about
sending our faculty and our students to
external programs that helps them build
a community because even if you don't
have that locally they can build that
community nationally or internationally
or within their research group and I'll
talk a little bit more later on I want
to make sure that you guys all hear
about the cre w and the great programs
that we have but they've been really
really helpful for me and for many of
the others in our department and then I
think something that's really kind of
key is that basically leadership in our
department since basically from 2001 up
till now we've had female department
heads except for two years um during at
2001 2002 jennifer welch the other woman
in our department she was an interim
department head and that's the year that
we hired Valerie Taylor as our
department head so then Valerie was our
department head for eight or nine year
nine years i think two four-year terms
plus that second that last year where
were lurking and then we had a male
department head for two years then I was
the interim department head for a year
and we hired doma dasilva who's just
started as our department had last fall
so I think that this really does impact
your ability to kind of have a good
culture within your organization and
also to recruit and
attained people so um then the last
thing I wanted to talk about is to make
sure you're all aware of the CRA
Committee on the status of women in
computing research or CR aw um how many
of you have never heard of it you all
have I find that hard to believe but
maybe that's just why you're here okay
so okay but that doesn't mean you all
came ok I'll see your so you all know
about these things well this is like one
of the best groups i have been involved
in in my career honestly it I've been
involved with it as a board member and
since 2000 and every committee member in
order to be on that committee you have
to have a project and you get evaluated
and and you are you know removed maybe
not immediately but that's you know not
it doesn't take too long if you're not
you know doing your job and you guys
here at Microsoft Research should be
really proud and the of this too because
the last two cuts governed by co-chairs
which served three year terms in the
last pair of co-chairs included
Catherine McKinley and she was co-chair
with Tracy camp from Colorado School of
Mines and now I'm a co-chair with AJ
brush so we are we've been doing this
for all what it started in September as
a co-chair so yeah so um okay well then
I really won't spend too much time if
you've already all had this but
basically CRE w has programs for
undergrads which are research
experiences the drew program I've been
running that since 2000 I think it's a
fabulous program that takes undergrads
from other all over the country and
matches them with faculty it at
universities for summer research in AJ
was when it was called DMP but you know
it's really effective and then the grad
cohort this is something that Microsoft
Research is a one of our main sponsors
and and we're really grateful to that
but that program it gets almost all the
graduate women in the country basically
participate in grad cohort at some point
and I think you know almost all the PhD
students and it brings them together for
day and a half workshop once a year and
it's it's been really effective and then
we have career mentoring workshops for
people that are early in their career
like senior grad students beginning
researchers and professors and then
mid-career the mid-career that's in June
in Portland but I we can get you in we
have space so no it's a great program
yeah so it's at FC RC and if you can
still apply I believe not sure if there
yes AJ can get you in she has she has an
in but the other thing I want to make
sure you knew about was Serpas the
Center for evaluating the research
pipeline and this is something that CRA
w started as one of our as part of our
grants a few years back and it's um
really effective what it tries to do so
we always want to evaluate these
programs to see if they're effective and
you know it's it's kind of obvious right
you would imagine that you know
undergraduate research experience should
be good right but we wanted to evaluate
and compare like our programs versus
students that participated in other
types of programs versus students that
didn't part of pace participate at all
and that was difficult to do an NSF who
funds many of our programs wanted us to
do that so you may have heard of the
data buddies project this is where many
universities are participating in this
they allow their faculty and their
students to be surveyed annually and so
we can capture data about students that
participated in like undergraduate
research experience or who didn't and so
then we can compare the effectiveness of
like those programs like a standard are
you to the are you programs run by CR aw
and here's um some things that we found
out for example we have more later data
but these this one showed that basically
if we looked at the graduates of our
programs the green were graduates of our
programs the orange is they were they
did research experiences as
undergraduates but not through our
programs and the blue is they didn't do
any
all so if they were going to be enrolled
in a program ours our graduates were
about twice as likely eighty-one percent
of them percent of them were PhD
programs versus thirty-seven percent who
were did like a regular re you and
eighteen percent of non-participants and
generally we have good results showing
the effectiveness of our like grad
program cohort programs as well but this
is you know an evaluation that shows
that these programs really are effective
and we need to do more of them and we're
really grateful to Microsoft researches
support of these and rain in particular
so she was here but you know so anyways
these are kind of the main points I
wanted to make is that I think that this
salary analysis institution-wide was
good for everyone it helped identify
anyone who is getting you know
inequitably paid and made their manager
have to explain it or fix it and
increasing the number of female faculty
it took time I mean it's taken like 20
years but it's really changed the
culture of our department and it's it's
made it a better place for everyone
again you know fixing these problems
makes it better for everyone not just
for the women and the crw programs have
been an important part of our at least
our departments um progress in this
regard alright so let's invite Kathryn
back up yes just a few more things to
tell us about I'm not gonna I'm gonna go
through all my novel I'm not going
through all my stats and stuff here so
what we'll do is we're going to skip
ahead to the end because this is a
really important study that I want to
leave you with so we're just going to
talk about one more thing and if you
want to see a bunch of stats about where
women are in computing and engineering
you can always download the report on a
UW's website but this is a study by fuad
and her Nadia fuad and her colleagues
and she did a study on engineering but i
think this study and engineering is very
relevant to what you're all doing here
in computing field so this is about
retention and what she looked at was the
survey of women who had
gotten a BA and engineering at some
point as she looked at where they have
gone and what they were doing and if you
look at women and men right in the
beginning right after college you see
that about sixty percent about the same
went on of the people who got the degree
went on and got a job in an industry
with their bachelor's degree others may
have gone to graduate school that may
have gone to a different field we don't
know what they did so these are the
years since the they graduated so this
is zero to four so you graduate here and
now we're at ten years after graduation
and here we're at 20 years after
graduation and we start to see a little
bit of a shift and then when we get down
to 30 to 35 years 34 years we see a very
large difference between women and men
so the yellow is women and the blue is
the men so at the end of that time we
still see these people in the workplace
and what's interesting is she asked them
so she's like to look at these two
groups the women who had you stayed in
and were in the workforce with
engineering degrees and women who had
those in engineering degrees but had
left within the last three to five years
yes if you're looking at zero to four
years you're culturally looking at a
very different kind of quick of people
know and you're looking at 34 years
which is like 1980 yeah so I mean is
there some way that this these
differences in gender can be kind of
normalized against this curve right well
what you're gonna the reason we is if it
would be ideal to do that over time to
look at the same people but it's just
obviously you can't so that that is
actually just an artifact of this study
that you're going to see that the people
at the end or different people than the
people at the top and so there may be
differences and we may see that these
folks who came in at 65 64 just stay in
yeah we might but this
people who are currently working
currently not working the other
interesting part about this i'll just do
the next to slide but that's a very good
question thanks for clarifying that okay
so she looked at these two groups and
what she found was the women with low
set job satisfaction had experienced
sorry this color is really bad um
they're the pink and purple is for high
so women who did not observe who did
observe sexist behavior who experienced
undermining behaviors and undermining
behaviors by the coworkers okay those
were the things that cause people to
leave engineering it was the the true
groups were similar in terms of their
age in terms of their parent status in
terms of their confidence in their
engineering skills and their interest in
engineering the thing that the
difference that came out really strongly
was the workplace that the people who
stayed the engineering had good work
places they felt supported all those
other good things and once you left the
field had not experienced that so I
think that the importance of this study
is that the workplace is making a big
difference and when we want to talk
about reach you know retention we should
be talking about how these work places
can better support everyone working
there one of the places I often cite for
people to take a look at okay who sees
these things that employers can do one
of these I want to mention that's
knocking me on this is on the ad
initiative ADA initiative how many of
you have heard of that okay is they have
some great and interesting valuable
things to do with how you grapple with
sexual harassment in the workplace how
you grapple with sort of cultural
misunderstandings in the workplace and
they really recommend them highly so
what we found in terms of what the fuad
study came up with what can you employ
us do
people want to have clear roles and
responsibilities training and
development feeling like they were
growing it was incredibly that was very
important everybody many many people
mention that being acknowledged for
their contributions these aren't any I
know this isn't anything surprising but
it's it's just a good thing to know that
these things really made a difference in
retention and rooting out on civil
behavior you know one of the things that
I show on a slide that we're not going
to look at is that women and men in
engineering and computing tend to have a
more wide difference in their stereotype
of gender this is so you know in in
engineering computer you see different
kinds of stereotypes about gender
between women and men women be much less
stereotyped in that sort of traditional
role and men be more tending to have
more stereotypical views so it's a
particular challenge when you talk about
uncivil behavior even benevolent things
like trying to protect a female
co-worker which is a nice thing to do
and it should be nice is actually not
necessarily helpful in the long run oh
and the last thing I'll say is that this
is our report it is on the web now and
we're very excited about it we have all
of our slides many of which you didn't
see but you can download them for
yourself and use them and do whatever
you like with them so thank you I was
