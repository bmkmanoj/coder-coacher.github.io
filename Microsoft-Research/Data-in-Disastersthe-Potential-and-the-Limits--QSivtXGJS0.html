hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
I want to start by taking you back to
october last year when Hurricane sandy
was threatening the east coast of the US
now I am a social scientist who
researches crisis data and social media
so I was really interested to see what
was going to happen with this particular
event and as it was I got to see it up
close and personal because i was living
in new york city at the time in zone a
otherwise known as the compulsory
evacuation zone so while the water was
flooding down my street and the power
went out in my building i could rest
comfortably in the knowledge that my
collaborators both at microsoft research
and at a range of different universities
work quietly and consistently gathering
all the data that was emerging around
this time so that we could use it to
reflect on what was occurring during
this particular disaster event and I
think there's an enormous amount of
potential bringing together crisis
informatics with machine learning with
information retrieval with social
science to reflect on how we can use
data better in disasters but there are
limits as well so we can take the
hurricane sandy Twitter set as an
example here there are around 20 million
tweets which is a substantial data set
for anyone really but if you look at
where the majority of those tweets come
from they almost all sent it in
Manhattan so if we only analyze those
tweets we're missing out on the far more
seriously affected areas places like
breezy point the Rockaways Coney Island
so the Twitter data in a way is skewed
towards a very urban privileged
experience of that disaster and this is
just one of many examples in terms of
how these datasets can both tell us an
enormous amount of information but they
also have gaps and they have biases so
working with my colleagues fernando diaz
at microsoft research in New York City
and Megan Finn at Microsoft Research in
New England we wanted to bring together
some of the key researchers in this
field to share with you some of the
stories that we think are really
interesting they could be done with
crisis data but also some
the limitations and challenges that
we're facing and how we might try to
overcome them by working together across
different disciplines so we're trying to
think about these concepts of data and
disaster very broadly so when we're
talking about data we're really talking
about a whole range of different kinds
of data challenges and here eight
honored are from the University of
Michigan has an enormous amount to
teachers we're also thinking about
disasters from the angle of natural
disasters which we heard this morning
from tony hayes excellent introduction
but we're also thinking about particular
kinds of social disasters and here on
thinking about the mexican drug war and
the work that's being done by ondrea's
minori Hernandez who's based here at
Microsoft Research in redmond and then
finally I'm extremely excited to present
to you later Palin who is one of the
leading researchers in this space she's
based at the University of Colorado
Boulder where she's an associate
professor in computer science but she's
also the director of project epic which
is one of the leading projects in
thinking how the public can use
information better during a crisis event
so what we'll be doing today is hearing
from each one of these fantastic
speakers and then we'll move to a brief
Q&amp;amp;A so you can ask them questions that
hopefully will help you reflect on your
work as well so to begin I would like to
introduce later Palin please welcome
good good morning so i'll be talking
about crisis informatics we turn this
down just a little bit it's not better
for everybody maybe i'll move it down
does it seem a little loud
feels like security all over again
security checks Airport yeah
it's all you can do
let's take this sorry folks just a
second see Hulk all right all this will
depend okay just me one more second
we'll set up this this is the kind of
intro I wanted to have by the way a
really powerful start okay all right so
I'm going to give a very broad overview
of some things that we've learned about
in this area that we've come to call
crisis informatics an area that
considers both the current uses of
social media social computing and the
future uses of such technology in
emergency management so the time I have
all I'm really attempting to do is to
try to compel the area and situate the
research conceptually right with
highlights about what some of those
broad issues are so I'd like to first
begin by framing this as a problem of
okay that good great okay so I'd like to
first frame this as disaster as an
environment of mass convergence of
resources of people and of information I
think that's often contrary to how we
normally think about disasters are an
off-the-cuff kind of definition of them
we think about people leaving and
evacuating and get it you know getting
away from the scene of the incident
let's see here boy I wish I could just
start over again but don't worry I just
hope I have a few more minutes Kate
because of this okay all right so but
but even when we have times for people
are leaving a situation they are they're
diverging from the scene of the incident
but they're converging somewhere else
right they're converging on the shelters
and a in the area surrounding the event
but even then that kind of divergence
activity is for a very small amount of
time and otherwise we have people
converging on to the scene including the
first responders that we've come
to know and expect will come to our aid
but also the victims who are well enough
to do something their friends and family
and then other people who are known as
the spontaneous converters the unpaid
professionals who are interested in
helping those who are on the ground
those who are interested in finding out
what's going on and maybe turn to help
so these are existing phenomena that now
have digital analogs in the in the
online sphere people create online sites
in response to disasters that they face
or might face they congregate and on
those online sites they search for
information they then produce
information and then we get people who
are self-organized in social networks
because of those pursuits of information
and the provision of information so this
idea of mass convergence online is both
of interest to study behaviorally and to
support socio technically in terms of
new innovation and of course it's the
yield of that convergence all that
digital data that is also of interest to
us as computer and information
scientists the second way I'd like you
to think about the role of computing and
technology emergency management is that
we need to build not just for the formal
responders and up until just about three
years ago this was a really major point
I think it continues to be when we think
about technology I think we first and
emergency response we think about those
who are on the ground who need good
tools and aids and we think about those
in emergency operation centers and of
course we want to continue to provide
good tools and services for those people
but we also need to care about the
informal response to why do we care
about the informal response well
participation by members of the public
in disaster and mass emergency it's
always been absolutely critical to the
tactical aspects of emergency response
and this has been well documented in
empirical studies of human behavior in
the sociology of disaster the true first
responders are often the immediate
community members here you see a mix of
formal responders and then community
members helping to save this boy and
this is particularly true in the case of
structural collapse where aid workers
have a hard time getting in right rows
are obstructed it's hard to get
communications out those who are doing
the rescues are those who are in the
area because
they know the lay of the land literally
they know how to get around when there
are roads that are otherwise blocked
they know who who is in these buildings
they know and they can and of course
people have a better chance of surviving
if they're rescued nearly immediately
this is true for as long as we have been
able to document it I think the
waterborne evacuation in the wake of 911
is very illustrative of this very point
Kendra and walked into work out of the
University of Delaware explain this very
nicely in a series of studies looking at
the waterborne evacuation in 911 this is
an image taken from the US Coast Guard
it's fuzzy because the air is pretty bad
at this point in time these are people
who are converging in Battery Park and
later the waterborne evacuation begins
which is the spontaneous convergence of
watercraft boats of different sizes
fishing boats tugboats personal boats to
evacuate people off the island and it's
described as a very well-organized
self-organized event there was no
precedence for this there was no plan
for this and so this is this analog that
we see in the real world and this calls
back to the evacuation of Dunkirk in
World War two in 1940 when I think three
hundred and forty thousand soldiers
Allied forces were evacuated from the
shores of Dunkirk and it's called the
miracle of Dunkirk because it's the same
story it was the Merchant Marines
fishing boats pleasurekraft small boats
big vessels who are all evacuating these
troops over less than the course of a
week which is remarkable so we know so
how the public participate in disaster
with digital support that's new right
that's what we're trying to study and
design for intentionally in the future
but that they do it is not new so one of
the things I try to convey to audiences
of emergency managers is that this isn't
something we need to be afraid of we
need to understand the pitfalls and the
potentials but this was always happening
and so we just have to we have to
understand why people do this and how
they do it and then look at the
opportunities as well as the concerns
that this might have so in terms of our
then what I would argue for in research
in this area in the future we look very
broadly at the ecosystem of data that is
moving around in emergency response we
look at the internal ways in which
people share information we look at how
Emergency Management seeks and and
provides information and of course how
those activities are sharing our
influence each other very broadly
speaking we are interested in the
mutually constructed information
interface that that is between those
rather than seeing them as a kind of a
cold hard divided we are increasingly
seeing this and sort of designing for an
ideal future not exactly sure how this
will work but where there's a more
socially distributed way of information
managing information than certainly what
we see today okay so I'd like to
characterize so as Kate said there were
22 21 million tweets or so that that are
meant to that capture the hurricane
sandy event the growth has been
exponential in terms of Twitter activity
so for example in 2008 we were studying
hurricanes Gustav and Ike and those two
hurricanes which occurred closin time
generated about a hundred thousand
tweets in Haiti was about four million
tweets and sir hurricane sandy was about
20 million tweets either two year
intervals they're not perfectly
comparable events but it doesn't matter
because the exponential growth is
clearly there we've looked a lot at what
is under the hood what are people
talking about you know there's a lot of
stuff around expressing emotion and
desires to help and donate and prayer
activity all of which actually is pretty
sociologically interesting we are
interested in the situational awareness
information that could be gleaned from
the from the disaster event and in that
way I think there are two forms of
public response we should be thinking
about there's the spontaneous public
response those those reports of things
that are happening on the ground the I
feel an earthquake the photo of
devastation we might want to think about
how we can aggregate those together
using machine learning techniques and
human computation techniques to get a
view excuse me of you of those
activities together and then of course
they're solicited response which is
basically the crowdsourcing angle on
this so what can we do to get
information that we need from people on
the ground this is one tweet I'm going
to use to capture both of these ideas
this is a little bit dark with the photo
is actually naturally dark this is a
photo taken in send in Japan in the
aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami
it's of a marketplace and they're
standing in line here and this case this
refrigerated case is all empty and this
is an example of the kind of spontaneous
data that does arise in emergencies if
you can find it so here's a rough
translation of the Japanese so first we
get some really good locational
information says Fukushima City you keep
any mall peace temple store waiting in
the checkout line so in absence of lat
long information precise information we
have a pretty good idea of where this is
there's no bread yet as for daily items
we are without water rice plastic wrap
there used to be more than enough on
abundance of everything you can imagine
from vegetables to fish to meat ok so
again this kind of marketplace data is
actually pretty valuable in emergency
response so that we we sort of think of
it as sort outside the kinds of medical
concerns that we might have in the
rescue and the debris removal and all of
this this kind of information is also
very useful so this is an example of
some spontaneous data that if we could
find enough of it we might be able to
get some good ideas and then pursue
other kinds of information this is also
a good design inspiration for the kinds
of tasks we can give the crowd to do or
perhaps a selected part of the crowd to
do so market surveys micro market
surveys are really valuable in the
aftermath of disaster for two reasons
one is that humanitarian aid workers are
very interested in knowing what's
available on the ground in terms of the
supplies that they need to do the work
that they're going to do but they also
need to know if they can sustain
themselves for two weeks or three weeks
or whatever it is so having a sense of
what's happening on the ground and how
that varies over a large area is very
important later during when we get into
stages of recovery the the health of the
marketplace with respect to price
gouging in this kind of thing
is very valuable for assessing community
health so this would actually be quite a
nice place to do some crowd crowd work
and you can talk about a few others if
there's time later self-organizing of
digital help help core networks is also
something that we see in response to all
this data coming up so people might see
I need a request I need to request any
antibiotics and somebody else might
saying he's saying I have antibiotics
and what we're seeing is that there are
remote volunteers who are putting those
requests together and saying hey you
should talk to each other this is a
matchup right they're doing all this
human computation work that's one
example of some what then becomes very
elaborate self-organizing tasks very
much like the waterborne evacuation but
in the digital world there are also
groups that see themselves as amateur I
don't know what to the vet that should
call him amateur there there more than
spontaneous volunteers they have a
desire to stay with this for the long
term and Haiti was a very catalyzing
event for many of these groups that were
starting to form in 2009 and then the
haiti earthquake hit in january and we
see some real new organization around
them and i have a video that describes
in their own voices better than I can
this sort of zeal they have about
helping others this is geeks for Haiti
as a programmer we can actually help the
people in haiti
my name is Chaddock itachi oh and I work
with a group of volunteers it's called
crisis camp we're really a community of
disaster response and relief specialist
so we have firefighters here today
people from the UN working with us in
the Red Cross and we've got people from
google yahoo it's really a whole bunch
of people who are really trying to build
applications for this kind of situations
the reason why I came and I mentioned
the reason why a lot of other people
came is because it's a surprise a happy
surprise to think that as a hacker as a
coder as a programmer we can actually
help the people in haiti our stated
goals are to build a new base layer map
for portraits another is to coordinate
all of the missing persons directories
and applications into one application
i'm on twitter right now and i set up
from the camp's crisis and I'm finding
other tweets about donations and how to
help out and just resending all that
information the reason I came down
because I'm haitian-american and this
story that's very personal my
grandmother's brothers somewhat mark in
Haiti right now stayin home and watch
the scene and I couldn't I couldn't just
do that for another day or just look at
the internet or just give money I felt
like I need to volunteer and do
something you know you send your money
and that's it no you feel like you can't
get on the plane you can't help people
with up the rubble so we have a set of
skills here and we're just trying to
apply them just like with the urban
rescue teams they have a set of skills
they go they can lift rocks and they can
find people we can code in google maps
and try to provide them a better way to
find those people I don't know how to
fix people but I know how to fix
computers I know how to code so if I can
if I can help people like live by doing
that I mean Oh fantastic
ok so this describes both the desires of
the spontaneous volunteers those who
come in after disaster events and want
to help for two weeks a month at a time
but you also in here embedded are folks
who then went on and formalized and
sometimes even incorporated their groups
and now respond disaster to disaster so
looking to them as an example for the
kinds of work that can be done and how
they're formalizing it is a very
something very important to look at not
just to advocate for volunteerism in
emergency response which I do but also
to look at what these early volunteers
are doing as a way to think about how to
professionalize that work and how that
will change the institution of Emergency
Management in years to come probably the
most successful example coming out of
this effort I mean there were some
things that were successful some things
that were not but one thing that was
sort of undeniably success successful as
the work of the OpenStreetMap team this
was this is a snapshot of port-au-prince
before the day before the earthquake it
was a virtually unmapped country not
just for osm but for other mapping
agencies as well this is what it looked
like 21 days if you can see the very
fine resolution if you can bore in this
whole thing is mapped it was done by 600
volunteers in three weeks using donated
aerial and satellite imagery and so it
was as matt it was mapped to within an
inch of its life as best as it could by
remote volunteers looking at you know
the the sky eye view of what's going on
and it became the de facto map for
humanitarian aid response so you know
these are volunteers people who are
building sandbags to hold back the flood
rivers of the 2009 Red River what are
the good disaster based crowdsourcing
tasks that would be that would that we
could design this turns out to be a
pretty hard question there are some good
ideas but there are many ideas for which
we have to think about issues of
liability the usual way in which we
think about liability is on the part of
formal response what problems do they
assume what liabilities do they assume
thank you for for taking in
crowd-sourced
but there's also liability on the part
of emergency of digital volunteers who
are not protected by Good Samaritan laws
and if we as computer scientists are
issuing tasks and we've had to think
about how to design them really well as
well as platforms that will deliver
those tasks we are intentionally
intervening and we are also not
protected by those same things so I
think very hard about what those will be
we can talk about that perhaps in QA so
what's ahead crises are places of
innovation they always have been we can
think about this now literally in terms
of computing on innovation so it's a
wonderful thing to innovate for
emergency management I advocate for it
strongly but I'd also like to offer that
emergency management itself is a place
for innovation for computing so we can
learn a lot about computing by looking
at situations of emergency management as
a mass convergence event we're going to
see fundamental institutional shifts in
practice and policy because the things
that are happening here really big
changes in the institution of emergency
management in addition to this it's
becoming very clear how much computer
science can contribute to national and
global interests and how immediate those
concerns can be so we get this shot from
my lab of a group of public information
officers who are doing some design work
in our lab and not very long later their
cohorts at hour down the road from us in
Waldo in the Waldo Canyon fires are
working a real a real event and so we
are finding that are we are perilously
but excitingly close to real world
application so with all the computing
research we do in natural language
processing and human human computer
interaction and CCW and software
engineering we discover that disaster
after disaster just how deeply
consequential computer science research
really is thank you
thank you so much later it's a pleasure
to have you here next up we have a tonna
da who is an assistant professor at the
University of Michigan I first met a
time when he came to Microsoft Research
as a visitor and we happen to be working
together at the exact time that the
London riots occurred so we actually
started working with that data to see
what we could learn about it and I
personally learn enormous amount from
Aten and he helps me do data better so
please welcome him
I look good perfect okay so high thank
you thanks for that great introduction
this will be a tough act to follow from
nice glacier as Kate mentioned I'm sort
of studying abroad level the idea of
using behavioral data at very large
scale so what can we take from what
people are doing on the internet and
learning something interesting from that
so I'm going to try and talk today about
how some of these ideas might apply
within the context of crisis informatics
so trying to leverage some of the ideas
from as early as the 60s on kind of
nonreactive measurements to take into
account what people are doing and learn
something interesting from that so this
talk is broadly about measurement the
first set of things that we use to
measure our kind of these very directed
applications so surveys question here is
interviews and so on what I want to talk
to you today mostly is about the shift
towards some of these indirect measures
these non reactive or unobtrusive
mechanisms of collecting data and
there's a huge shift and kind of the
community of people that I work with
where we're trying to take these
extremely large data sets from Twitter
from the news any kind of behavioral
data sets that we can take and trying to
learn something interesting about some
behavioral attribute of that data so
what I mean by nonreactive measures are
basically basically this that we're
measuring without asking people we're
not directly talking to them or asking
them to contribute stuff we're just sort
of looking at the digital dis Irie asst
that they're producing so what are they
creating as they live their lives and
produce either on Twitter or consume
through the news and so on so the story
of non reactive measures is basically
this of accretion and erosion studies so
measuring the kind of cow paths that
people take through their digital lives
and that allows us through some
sophistication to tie that into
something interesting about what we
actually want to measure so let me give
you a specific example which is can you
feel this earthquake ok so in August of
2011 there was a big earthquake in
Virginia how many of you guys felt it ok
a bunch it was pretty sizable no
so although the actual scale was only
five point eight but it was kind of felt
throughout on the eastern seaboard and
the way the USGS USGS traditionally
measures whether this was felt is by
asking so you come to this website and
you answer this question yes I felt it
and sort of how much and for this
particular highly felt event 148,000
people responded okay and this response
was basically accumulated over many many
hours so this is where there was a
direct request by the USGS for
information now compare this to data
collected from Twitter okay so what
you're going to see is a big shock wave
moving through the eastern seaboard and
tweets basically capturing I felt it I
just felt an earthquake and so on okay
so as the circle moves you're seeing
tweets and just for a sense of scale in
the first five minutes after the
earthquake there were 90 thousand tweets
a lot of them directly feeling the
earthquake and it's very interesting
because if you track sort of where these
tweets were coming from you'll see a
very nice fit to the actual wave as it
propagates on through the eastern
seaboard okay and we'll come back to why
this is good this is bad in a second but
let me just tie this back into the idea
of non reactivity and we're sort of the
tradition of non reactivity comes from
because this has existed since the 1960s
and people have learned sort of where
it's good and where it's bad and so the
question is can we apply some of those
lessons from the social sciences in our
analysis of these very large scale
pieces of data so in three minutes there
are lots of cute examples of what people
do using nonreactive measures so to
figure out how scariest story is people
would watch a group of kids sitting in a
circle come tighter and tighter into the
circle the scarier the story the more
they would tighten too into the fire
okay when you want to measure how
popular a piece of art is people have
talked about looking at replacement of
tiles on the floor okay so people are
just sort of making a path through the
through the museum and as they're
standing and watching a particularly
popular piece of art they're wearing
down the floor
if I'm a person who is selling cars and
I want to figure out who to advertise to
what this guy discovered in 1962 was
looking at his customers and what their
radios were tuned to when they came into
the store ok he would learn basically
what channels they were listening to and
then sell advertisement or by
advertisements on those channels
nonreactive right didn't ask them he
just looked at what the radio was set to
ok there's a huge tradition of figuring
out what people are consuming in terms
of alcohol in terms of drugs by studying
people's trash ok there's a garbage
project that's been going on since 1975
I'm looking at how much trash people are
producing what kind are poor people more
likely to consume more or less people
study citywide drug levels by looking at
drug levels in the sewer system ok again
nonreactive we're not asking anything
we're just sort of measuring through
these secondary needs to measure where
the traffic is people use cell phones ok
so as you move through your world your
cell phone is switching towers and you
can sort of measure how much traffic
there isn't a particular site by looking
at this this is a kind of clever one
someone wanted to know how Walmart was
doing so they studied aerial photography
of the of the store and looked at the
number of cars in the parking lot ok so
these are all kind of cutesy examples of
non reactive measures and the question
is where does it work and where does it
not and so you're probably thinking to
yourself ok but you're starting to see
the problems if you are reviewer 2 in
the room how many review or tues you're
going to start asking me about bias and
of course their advice it's a huge
problem this population bias and the
things that we measure who is if that's
actually using Twitter do they have
phones is there power people are reading
the news they're being biased by the
news in weird ways there's incentives to
produce and consume we see this in
vlogging networks a long time ago this
was a research project that I did
looking at what bloggers were talking
about and what more recently tweeters
tweet about basically they're trying to
get some social capital by presenting
new information to their community and
so there's a bias there right
there's the benefit in being first and
the social signals are performed it's
not like throwing trash as you would in
to a regular trash can it would be the
equivalent of throwing trash into a
transparent trash can right so there's a
little bit of a performance art in the
way you communicate with your public and
that has consequences for the way we
utilize these nonreactive measures okay
there's a ton of noise in these things
and this is part of the the work that
I'm doing now and you see this kind of
nice trend that's fitting the line as
the wave propagates through the is the
earthquake wave propagates but there's
also a ton of this other stuff okay and
that other stuff represents part of the
ecology of people communicating about a
particular event yeah and the notion
that i want to emphasize is that
everything here is signal but it's a
question of what you're measuring and so
what we've started studying is a
particular ecology around a specific
event in this case the japanese
earthquake tsunami and kind of nuclear
catastrophe in march of 2011 and what
you look at when you see these kinds of
pieces of information that are coming to
you at a very large scale you see people
on the ground tweeting about the event
itself so these lines and white are
basically people tweeting about the
actual event they're experiencing it you
see their friends and family tweeting
back and you see people sort of having a
meta conversation about this there's a
huge diverse set of people who are
talking about this okay you see
government organizations producing data
and pushing it into social media and
people are reacting to this this is a
image of the tsunami as it simulated by
the NOAA I do a little bit of
visualization work this is a kind of
scary image so it looks much scarier
than it actually is but that gets a
response you see the news doing what
it's supposed to and sort of the news is
interaction with the way people are
acting in social media is an interesting
thing to study so this is news behaving
properly you see people producing rumors
gossip this is a fake piece of
information attributed to the Australian
radiation services this is completely
fake but it was passed around by a lot
of people and even the news started
picking this thing up and so this is
from Austria
this is from Australia sort of
rebroadcasting this fake image you see
people reacting to the fake image so the
common public reacting this is a sort of
conspiracy theory website but they're
reacting to this and they're telling you
that to treat the impending doom of the
nuclear holocaust that's coming once you
take shots of organic apple cider and
potassium iodide okay and we're going to
see how this has an effect actually on
the prices of potassium iodide in a
second okay you see activists starting
to work so they're communicating through
social media streams and sort of adding
signal you see people really behaving
badly so this is a you can't really read
it but it is a timeline of sort of
people doing really bad things like
spamming adding a SEO attack so search
engine optimizer attacks basically
pushing millions of pages into search
engine search engines using Japan and
tsunami as keywords and you see lots of
fake donation scams going out through
the public and people reacting that you
see people behaving really well so this
is tweets about pray for japan over kind
of the time of the crisis stickers lady
gaga anyone want to guess what this peak
is justin bieber okay justin bieber
decided to pray for japan that day oh
anyway it propagates me okay the point
that I'm trying to make with this is
that noise is rare okay everything here
is signal it's just a question of
whether it is it measuring what it is
that you want to be measuring okay we
are getting this tidal wave of data and
it's coming from this ecology and lots
and lots of signal and it's great but we
sort of have to find ways of separating
that out okay so that's kind of the
central problem that's been addressed
extensively in the nonreactive
literature how to make sense of lots and
lots of signals that are coming at you
at the same time but to have this high
level opinion that everything is signal
okay even people who are scamming if
you're trying to measure how many scams
are going on during a crisis situation
that's where the data is yes you have to
treat everything as a signal
okay there's inevitably the question of
ethics and I'm sure we'll talk about
this in a second we laugh at people in
these situations but I'd like to point
out that frequently these are people
these are sensitive populations and even
if they weren't sensitive before they're
being made sensitive by the crisis
itself and so as much as we joke about
them this is clearly a problem and
there's a problem than in terms of
privacy there's a problem in the bias we
have in terms of response so if we take
these massive datasets and learn from
them and then go out and act in the
public we're potentially biasing our
response based on the population that
we're studying and so hopefully we can
have more of a conversation about this
at the end there might be an
exacerbation of this through nonreactive
measures we're not sampling in a way
that's you know controlled in the sense
that we frequently like to think about
it in the real sciences but I'll reserve
that judgment for later we can talk
about it okay so some solute some
solutions and a few more problems the
non reactive measurement community talks
about multiples for everything okay I
think this is a really great strategy
that we should think about and apply
extensively so multiple indices I'll
give an explanation of that in a second
we should have multiple theories about
what's going on we should have multiple
hypotheses about what's going on we
should have multiple instruments we
should be measuring in lots and lots of
different ways and bringing those
results back and constructing an idea of
what's going on based on these on these
multiple instruments Ramona k'hal almost
a hundred years ago and his advice for
young investigators talks about the
addiction to a specific instrument as a
disease of the will and I think that's
kind of a nice way of thinking about it
there's lots of ways of measuring things
and I think bringing them together is
good yeah so we've been thinking about
different ways of using specifically
nonreactive measures many non reactive
measures simultaneously to measure
things so one of the questions that we
have in my group is how the public
reacts in fear to certain kinds of event
events and so you can do things like
look for the word scared or scary in the
Twitter stream but you can be a little
more sophisticated in that there's other
things aside from Twitter to study and
so we've been mining things like eBay
and looking at the prices of potassium
iodide
and what you can see is sort of the
trend in price per milligram over time
that's correlated with some specific
events so as one course starting to melt
down as stuff is being dumped into the
ocean and so on we're seeing these
reactions and all these signals together
telling us something interesting another
thing we're studying is sort of the
presses contribution to the fear of
comparison kind of thing so you're about
to die I'm kind of stuff and the other
thing that I want to bring up is again
that the multiple instruments i think is
key here so yes we can do this and
that's great but there's something to be
said about actually asking people what
it is that they're experiencing okay so
this is what the website looks like on
the USGS lots and lots of questions but
we're getting lots of lots of
information having those two things
simultaneously helps us triangulate
what's going on so this is my wish list
to support multiple multiple acquisition
systems getting lots of data multiple
and better models this is a huge problem
the predictive community doesn't
understand the explanatory community the
explanatory community doesn't understand
the predictive community I think there's
a little bit of effort that needs to be
paid there to make that work knowledge
mining systems I think can be improved
and multiple integrated instruments I
think can help okay so to summarize I
think nonreactive measures are great I
think there's huge limitations I think
we can learn from the history of
nonreactive instruments and sort of do
better and apply them to the scale and
scope of the problem that we experience
today okay with that thank
thanks so much a tunnel just feel a
little time talking to about how amazing
our final speaker is today this is
andres mono hernandez who is based here
at microsoft research in redmond he has
been doing a lot of work looking at
social media and crisis events prior to
that though you might also know him as a
person who invented the scratch online
community for kids when he was based at
MIT now Andres is doing work that I
think it's really important thinking
about politics of visibility what
happens when we make particular kinds of
communities visible through data and how
do we need to think about that
differently during a crisis event thank
you undress switch you said thanks a lot
Kate hi my name is Andres monroy
Hernandez and I'm going to talk to you
about issues of visibility with social
media data during disasters so Kate
asked us to think about challenges and
opportunities of big data and social
media in the context of disaster so I
thought about telling you about three
different case studies of collective
action where I could hashtag collective
action related to disasters the first
one comes from Mexico where the drug
were a war against the drug cartels
going on and where social media is
playing a very important role the second
one is a social movement that emerged
last year during the presidential
election also in Mexico as a result of
what people perceive as you know some
bias of the media and the third one is
more recent just as you know a few weeks
ago as you probably seen on the news in
Brazil there's been a lot of protests
against the government and we started to
analyze some of these in the in the
context of how do we think about you
know a crisis or acute events in this in
this world so first with the narco to
its example that I was mentioning so
here the issue about visibility actually
plays a really interesting role because
both visibility and opacity empower and
disempower citizens in this case so used
to give you some context you know the
Mexican drug word is an act of war it's
not just like this you know metaphorical
way of referring to to the drug the
world against drugs so there is a crisis
happening every day as part of everyday
life in many cities and there's more
than 60,000 people who have that dies
they were starting 2006 but typically
you know when we think about emergency
response just like glacier was saying
you have you know the government
officials who are kind of the origin the
official source of information about
these events and you have the media that
is you know typically helping broadcast
these messages unfortunately in the case
of Mexico these two institutions are not
working both the government and the
media are being quiet about what's going
on and here I'm just going to quote from
the wall street the washington post an
article that describes this very very
example so here it says you know fearing
for their lives and the safety of their
families journalists are adhering to a
near-complete news blackout under strict
orders of drug smuggling organizations
and their enforcers who dictate via
Daily telephone calls emails and news
releases what can it can be printed out
or air so again the Duke the drug
cartels are dictating to the media what
can and cannot be printed and this
obviously creates a lot of concern among
journalists many of whom have been
killed similarly this this kind of
censorship extends to the government so
here again the same article says you
know the news blackouts extends to the
government officials in one example the
city of Nova Loretta which is in the
border with Texas the mayor mysteriously
disappears for days and refuses to the
excuse drug violence the military
general who presides over the the
soldiers patrolling the city does not
halt news conferences issue statements
or answer questions from the media so
you have if you're a citizen in this
place you know you see a shooting
Grenada tags you know car bombs and then
you turn on the TV and all you see is
soap operas or you know all sorts of
mainstream media that you know that is
being censored and one of the
interesting things about this the drug
war in Mexico is that this is coupled by
you know the general pervasiveness of
social media so in the past few years
you know just like many other countries
especially in the developing world where
people are getting access to technology
to technology through you know mobile
phones you see an increase adoption of
social media so these couple with these
weekend institutions like the media the
government and the increase of violence
created the following so when we started
looking at this issue when other things
that was really interesting to me is you
know looking at Twitter for example
tweets like this one and I'm going to
translate this to Spanish so here it
says you know a person named Angela
obviously change the name but the quote
is still the same quote he says caution
on Gonzalez Avenue by the big
supermarket people report the recent
risky situation and then hashtag empty
why follow so risky situation is a
euphemism the people use on Twitter in
particular in Mexico to refer to all
sorts of violent events from grenade
attached to shootings two car bombs and
people if you go right now on twitter at
the leave you go to mty follow you will
see a lot of tweets like this ones
reporting what's going on in the city in
regards to the drug war the empty why
follow is empty why is the initials of
the city of Monterey in Mexico is the
airport code and follow it's like an
invitation to follow these so if you
really know if you really want to know
what's happening in the city your best
bet is to go to Twitter and check what's
going on there and so what we do this
you know you look at a bunch of
different tweets with different hashtags
for different cities and what you see
you know just kind of a typical work
cloud first pass analysis that we did
you know you see words like balacera
being one of the most prominent ones
which is shooting in Spanish you also
see things like percussion you see the
tone asianness which is blast and you
see also you know the names of some some
pure users as well as locations in the
city that refer to where things are
happening we wanted to be more detail
and what we did is we looked at four
different cities in mexico from north to
south Reynosa which is one of the cities
in the border with Texas all the way to
Veracruz at the bottom which is a city
in the Gulf of Mexico that is also being
affected by the drug war and one of the
things that we notice is that the spread
of you know amount of volume of tweets
you know also represents the way the
violence has spread from north to south
in the country the other thing you
notice is there are bunch of spikes and
these spikes actually correspond to
major events in the cities so for
example the spike in Monterey with the
second city over there it corresponds to
an event where 52 people were killed in
a casino by the drug cartels so you see
like more or less the kind of volume of
tweets represents what's going on in the
streets one of the things we wanted to
know you know who are these people
tweeting you know what lecture was
saying is that there
of different people who come into it who
can be tweeting from emergency
organizations to just regular informal
people who are you know talking about
what's going on and so we decided to
plot this very simply the tweeting in
each one of the cities and this is
represents similar patterns in all the
cities that we looked at basically on
the x-axis you see the number of tweets
that they contribute to this
conversation on the y-axis you see the
number of followers that people have to
kind of train to measure the amount of
impact or or influence at these people
might have and we know this is like this
kind of three categories broadly
speaking the first one is you know
people like CNN in Hispaniola
organizations like that that actually
are using the hashtags that the citizens
themselves came up with like empty why
follow that when I show before but they
tweet very little with that hashtag
because they obviously reporting on
what's going on all over the world just
in Spanish but they do twit some time so
you see these people have like millions
of followers but they have two days only
a couple of times with the hashtag then
you have you know people a virg citizens
who happen to be at the wrong time in
the wrong place and they can tweet what
happened and what they seen and then you
see what we call the curator these are
people with lots of followers not as
many as CNN obviously but lots of them
hundreds of thousands in some cases and
who have contributed a lot of content to
the community that discuss what's going
on in the city and these are people who
have taken the responsibility of you
know checking on Twitter connecting with
people even calling on the phone and
kind of broadcasting a message of what's
going on on the streets so you know if
you look at a network of retweets you'll
see the same group of people also
emerging as kind of highly influential
so we decided to actually talk to them
and reach out to them obviously is very
difficult because as you might mind
these are you know it's very difficult
job that they do but we talked about a
bunch of the man is just some quotes
from some of them Angela on the one side
she was just about 25,000 followers
Claudia here has about 30,000 followers
and you see the number of tweets that
they produce you know 35 thousand tweets
over the course of only a few months in
the case of Angela 60,000 to it's in the
case of Claudia and the number of hours
per day I asked and you know how much
time did you spend on Twitter doing this
job Angela said that she spends about 15
hours a day I don't know exactly what
she does for a living by impression is
that she has a job that allows her to be
you know on her phone on the side but it
was quite impressive to me in the amount
of time that these people spend
on Twitter I asked them you know just
one of the many questions is how do you
see your role in these communities and
in the case of Angeles it says you know
I'm a journalist it is as if I was a war
correspondent on social networks of the
world we are living in Mexico naturally
this is the title of one of our papers
exciter was really interesting to see
how they see themselves as journalists
rather than just average citizens but
then you have people at Claudia who says
you know my role on twitter is that of
yet another citizen but people tell me
that I'm like their angel for looking
after them so a lot of people before
they leave home or refer lately work
around my friends actually who live in
the city they tweet at them and say you
know is this city safe or not or they
you simply check what what areas of the
city are safe to navigate since they
really play an important role so one of
the challenges hear from you know the
point of view of social media data is
you know the visibility that these
people may have on the one hand you know
empower them to help others but on the
other hand you can imagine as in the
case of these two social media users you
know it can't really put them in danger
so they're trying to navigate and decide
how to best use these technologies in a
way that doesn't put them in danger so
one of the kind of practices that people
have decided to do to approach social
media with is you can report on public
information so as shooting outside the
street it's public information for which
the cartels are typically not interested
in going after you but if you report
private information like you know the
hidden location of a particular person
or safety houses and things that
actually leads to issues like this one
people also have to be worried about the
government like this is the case of to
Twitter users in the state of veracruz
who were sent to jail on charges of
terrorism for spreading misinformation
on social media about the word that's
going on at the end of the day we didn't
know exactly if it was true or not what
they were tweeting but definitely the
government believed that they were
spreading fear and they charged him with
terrorism they were sent to jail for a
month after you know Amnesty
International and other organizations
help them to get out but it really you
know created a lot of challenges for
people who are reporting the news the
second a case that I want to talk about
is a movement that happened in Mexico
last year we had a presidential election
and one of the questions that often came
up during when I discuss this job is
this this type of work
people ask you know how what can people
do to go beyond just reporting what they
see on the streets other people you know
organizing politically and this actually
happened last year so just to put the
context of it this is the movement was a
movement as a response to this
particular candidate candidate for
president and people were really upset
about his track record on human rights
and once he went to the University
engines in real quick he went to a
university he gave a speech just like
you know they do every day and students
started to protest there and recorded
with their cameras and uploaded videos
to YouTube of the protest but it was a
you know somewhat small protests at a
university however what happened the
next day was really interesting the
mainstream media reported that his
presence at the university has been
quite successful despite attempts to
bite cut him by some you know opponent
so the students were really upset that
they were being portrayed as trying to
boycott and being paid by one of the
opponents so they released this video
that went viral one of the days a few
days after this event and the students
were holding their IDs saying you know
I'm a student and we are 131 students
and you know here's my ID to prove you
that I'm not being paid by the by the
opposition so this video went viral and
and you know leader a few days later the
movement started to spread and the
movement was called I am 132 kind of as
a response to the 131 students on the
video and one of them said we think we
know you wanted to see who was reacting
to this movement in the sense that they
were tweeting with the hashtag I am 132
and one of the fascinating things is
that both people on the left and people
on the right we're kind of responding to
the call for action by the student
movement she was not just the students
anymore it was kind of growing and
growing and even the kind of Tudor aati
the people who are really active on
social media in Mexico start to engage
in this discussion one of the also
really interesting things is and in
Mexico's you know in the US as well
there is a strong class division and one
of the fascinating phenomena that we
observe is that people from different
universities are all the names of the
university's started to tweet it in
support of the students of the first
University which is a very rich and
wealthy university that typically is not
associated with political this you know
protest so at the end you know
people's going to the streets you know
people claiming that you know the by the
media was bias and that democracy is not
a soap opera people also calling others
to join this team at a protest and even
making references of social media and
protease themselves and then also
claiming that now we are the ones in
charge of giving the news no longer
these two TV networks the movement
exploded when all over the country and
even outside the country from Chicago to
China and even Julian Assange kind of
join the movement as well one of the
really interesting about things about
the movement is that they were able to
galvanize interest across multiple sides
of the political spectrum and even
organize the third presidential debate
just like completely organic all
students and and obviously that
candidate that they were against to the
kielian decide to participate but the
other ones did and they had a like a
live Google hangout and broadcast on
YouTube of the presidential debate and
they even had like a group of people who
were fighting against bots to reduce the
number of tweets that were in favor of
the of the presidential candidate
unfortunately or fortunately for for
other people they movement them sell
itself didn't end up making a big you
know impact in the outcome of the full
day of the election and Pena the
candidate that they were against he
ended up winning the election and one of
the reasons why is because you know the
politics beyond so showed me they were
actually more important for this
election there is a lot of people who
are not on social media who you know
couldn't express their voice and whose
voice was not really part of the
discussion on social media so these
people you know we're not heard and and
people kind of had a biased version of
what was going on in the politics
because they were paying attention to to
tradition to social media instead of you
know this is an image of the gifts that
they candidate from Pena Nieto from the
PRI gaffe gave to indigenous people in
remote areas of Mexico who whose vote is
as valuable as a vote of those who are
on Twitter so I don't have as much time
to talk about some of the work that we
have done recently on Brazil but one of
the interesting things which is going to
go quickly here is that one of the
things we notice is their connection to
the Turkish uprising that is going on at
the same time and what we looked at you
know again using
Twitter data is the mentions of the
hashtags related to the Brazilian
movement and the ones in Istanbul and we
saw a kind of the Istanbul people kind
of referring to the hashtags of Brazil
as a way to kind of connect the two
movements and the last thing i want to
show is this plot where we show kind of
how the protests change over time and
how these are the interactions among the
top 1% of protesters on Twitter for the
Brazilian movement and how it kind of
started very sparse it grew a lot by
june nineteen seventeen and it kind of
went back to the same group of people
and more sparse connections among them
on social media so again some of the
challenges challenges and opportunities
that social media gives us to understand
what's going in the movement are
anything from visibility on the drug
cartels and opacity that you know
empower some citizens all the way to you
know the visibility that may allow
different social movements to connect
with one another across in international
barriers I mean that thank you thanks so
much Andre as well we have a little time
left now for questions so we'll have all
the speakers up on stage and Fernando is
going to take a mic if you just like to
raise your hand and we would love to
hear your thoughts and ways in which
these issues might be coming up in your
work hi I'm Doug org from the University
of Maryland great set of presentations
up I don't work on the social media side
of this i work on information retrieval
a little bit of natural language
processing and when I look at work
that's getting started like this we
always do simple things at the beginning
we plot how many times this words being
used we plot what the level of activity
is we look at the social network and I
have this feeling that 20 years from now
that's not the way we'll look at the
problem that that will have much more
sophisticated ways of asking questions
and so do you have anything to offer to
us of sort of a wish list of things that
we might be able to take from what we
know how to do for example in processing
news and be able to bring it into this
world fantastic question the lysogenic
it yourself jump in the deep end um yeah
no I think so so let me say that I think
all the ways that we're trying to tackle
this problem now are things I support i
do find if i could just answer the
question from a slightly different angle
i do i'm excited by all the new research
that's happening in this area I've been
waiting some years for it I do want to
make sure that those who are working in
this space and bringing their respective
techniques to it really do understand
the domain of Emergency Management or
mass disruption or whatever it is that
they're sitting very very well because
there's a lot of cute and clever things
that we can do but do they map to the
things that we really care about and
those I think give rise to new methyl
ajah chol approaches or at least
variations on what we normally what we
what we've done in the past to address
those kinds of problems so i think that
commitment to the domain will will
naturally change the kinds of questions
and the ways in which people study those
so in our work for example we combine
behavioral research kind of you know
both quantitative and then qualitative
almost ethnographic investigations of
these large qualitative data sets to
then think about well what would that
mean for building classifiers to get at
that thing that turned out to be pretty
interesting it's like we didn't know
about the digital volunteer networks
until we were you know deep in the data
and then realized well these people seem
to know each other would oh wow look at
them and they because I didn't advertise
themselves in any other way so if i can
add something to that I feel like when
are they can I use this oh yeah one of
the interesting things and most
frustrating things about doing work on
this space is the fact that most of the
analysis always happens afterwards and
afterwards you can speak you can see and
analyze things very easily but I haven't
seen as much work on like real-time
reaction to these events and the most
sophisticated we have right now for the
mass audiences things like trending
topics on Twitter right something
standing on Twitter may be worth pain
especially if it's related to an
emergency or something like that but I
haven't seen as much work in the outside
the research on things that try to
aggregate and how people in real time as
their practices change because a lot of
it a lot of the technologies for
emergency that I've seen are things like
an app that you can download when an
emergency is happening but the reality
said you're not going to download an app
you know when something bad is happening
you ha you are using the tools that you
are already accustomed to so that I
think that to me one of the most
interesting challenges for CS I guess I
just like to add that I think there is a
trend right now towards having more
sophisticated techniques there were a
bunch of low-hanging fruits that were
available to us and that's sort of what
a lot of people ended up doing but
people are applying really sophisticated
named entity extraction to the news
articles that are being cited by the
people on Twitter and so you could sort
of do lots of cross-linking and deeper
analysis of what's being produced and
consumed I think those huge research
challenges and the way people are
communicating around crisis events or
anything on Twitter actually if you want
a broader problem the language is messy
shallow I don't know what you want to
call it but it's hard to have an apply
kind of standard algorithm student I
think there's a huge opportunity there
so we're seeing some people i mean
there's a bunch of work at like CMU at
u-dub of people trying to kind of more
deeply understand what's actually being
spoken in instances like Twitter and
other places where there's really sparse
information but I think that's you know
something that we can keep working on
and making better and I think also
honestly a lot of the people working in
crisis informatics so I was one of the
people who started I cwm the web blogs
and social media conference and I see a
lot of the papers that come in and
there's sort of a separation between the
people who are building the tools and
the people who want to use them and
there's a huge disconnect and the people
who want to just use them use these
sophisticated tools frequently aren't be
given tools that are actually useful and
I think that needs to change a little
bit so as we're manufacturing new
analysis techniques and code to make
that available to people who are not
necessarily interested in directly
contributing to the latest and greatest
part of speech tagger but actual
want to use it in their own in their own
lives and I just like to add to 810 a
scientist perspective just top down what
can we extract from this data how can we
understand what's happening on the
ground better I think what I hope will
see in the next few years ways in which
communities can actually use these tools
themselves to address issues that are
important to them rather than
necessarily this top-down view we tell
them how they can use resources more
effectively I think that's something I
would like to see and I know there are
several people in this room we're
working towards particular kinds of
programs and tools that I hope can make
that happen do we have another question
ed Kootra land at MSR in India and this
was fabulous but it was really really
heavy on Twitter and so I'm I you know I
mean there was a touch about you know
multiple sources that we talked about
there's ethnographic stuff there's this
notion at the very end of andre's talk
about the fact that oh we kind of missed
this giant group of tribals and other
folks that actually made all the
difference and I'm wondering if you can
talk a little bit about this vast amount
of stuff that's not Twitterati that's
actually really important signals and
how do we start to get at that and what
do you think where that's going great
question you don't have to worry about
too much longer because Twitter is
shutting down access to researchers so
it's been easy to get that data I think
for a lot of us and a lot of the
community at large but there's activity
within Twitter to shut down access and I
think people are building more
sophisticated ways of acquiring data
part of it is that it's easy to turn on
the knob a faucet basically and just
keep track of what's coming in from
Twitter but when you're reacting to
specific events you have to go and turn
on all these different places all these
different data sources that are really
custom so for example to measure the
price of potassium iodide on ebay i had
to write special scripts and and do all
this stuff i had no kind of
off-the-shelf stuff and so there's a big
delay and how long it took before i
could actually start capturing that
information so that's a huge a huge
concern for us and I think tools will
get better but for a little while you're
going to see more Twitter i think this
so a little so
methodologically it's been very helpful
to begin with Twitter as the immediate
data set that you collect that one
collects in quick response research
because you can turn it on right and so
but what we do is we think of it as not
just the object of study but it as a
navigational space so if there's some
other online resource or activity that
others are using then the thinking is
that it will appear at least once in
some Twitter message and so then if we
can't reverse those links then we start
getting an idea of the universe of the
interaction so it's very hard to know
when one is collecting data during
events like this are you collecting
something selectively and do you know
that and can your research question
stand up because through selective
sampling or do you need to know about
something representative so in terms of
representativeness twitter is a good
place to begin for that and then we move
on and we look at many other kinds of
online resources as well you just to
mention one type of word I've seen that
goes beyond Twitter is a last week at IC
wsm David lesser and his group were
showing how they were in stout they're
installing apps on people's phones that
allows them to then go back in history
and see what phone calls they've made
after for example the Boston bombing and
things like that to validate the results
they may see on Twitter and obviously
there's a huge growth now in census as
well and we're seeing an enormous amount
of City data being generated by sensor
network so I think certainly in the next
couple of years we'll be seeing a lot
more of that as well a great question do
we have probably time for a couple more
yeah hi ho Chi from Northwestern
University so really great talks thanks
so my question is about going beyond
information and data so it seems like
there's been really great work on
thinking about both how to use the crowd
to get information from them on what's
happening on the ground but also to use
them as aggregators and curators in that
process so that information can better
be shared and then for people to build
tools on top of that for the information
to be even better communicated both to
public officials are trying to actually
deal with the disaster or the crisis
situation but also to the community so
people know what's going on and my
question is can we go beyond that is
there a role for the crowd to actually
also people in the community to actually
maybe participate in disaster relief to
form individual or collective action
plans and be able to have a sense of
resources that others have and also the
resources that they have being shared
and being able to somehow put that
together in a way where they have their
local view and also a global view of
what's going on in the course of the
disasters I just would love to get your
thoughts on that fantastic one thing
that I always thought about about the
crowdsourcing and the kind of crisis
that I've been describing is typically
one of the challenges of crowd season
that I see is that the people doing the
work like Turkish and the people needing
the worker kind of totally separate from
one another and the Turkish probably
don't care at all about some of the
tasks they're being asked to but in the
case of some of the crisis that I've
been looking at that is that separation
might actually be an asset so the fact
that you are living you know 10,000
miles away from the person reporting the
problems might actually help you in
terms of privacy and some of the
challenges with say the drug cartels
going after you so I feel like there may
be ways I don't exactly I don't exactly
know wet but there might be ways of
leveraging that distance between those
crowdsource workers and the people
having the problems that might actually
we use as a positive feature of these
systems and then if I can just answer
quickly it's a really great set of
questions and thinking and I think that
is I think that is where we need to go
just to look at some real world examples
that we can draw from now the World Bank
has done some really great stuff in
cooperation with the OpenStreetMap
community to localize mapping efforts in
developing regions to make those regions
more resilient and develop a kind of
capacity and self knowledge about their
geographies and resources so that they
can then hazard a hazard much better in
the future so you're starting to see
these kinds of things that are happening
in serious ways but there there's so
much opportunity as you rightly point
out and if I can just give you an
example of a little case study that I
think is really fascinating do you know
about safecast in Japan so after
Fukushima and when a lot of Japanese
residents were concerned about the
radiation levels they found that the
Japanese government wasn't giving them
enough data around
you know what was happening and what
were the various radiation levels around
the country and so Sean Bonner was
having a discussion with Joey to space
at the Media Lab and they said what
about if we actually try to get
radiation detectors Geiger counters to
people in Japan and then they can use
this to let us know how the radiation
levels are shifting depending on where
they are because there are radical
differences depending on what side of
the street you're on but they found of
course that what happened is that all
the Geiger counters had been sold out
because this is what happens after a
major nuclear problem so what they
decided is they would design a really
basic DIY kit that would act as a Geiger
counter release the plans actually get a
whole lot of really basic you know
almost pre-made kits to people in Japan
and they formed its extraordinary
network and if you look up safecast
you'll see just how much data they
gathered so I think these kinds of
interventions that can often happen
obviously within institutions like the
World Bank their leashes pointed out but
I think also outside of institutions
people are finding ways to organize and
do really extraordinary things with
community based data time for one last
quick question if what someone has on
just here yeah hi i'm kaye you great
presentation so my question is somewhat
similar to what address asks so this
reminds me of two major event which
happen in India few years back so first
one was jessica lall murder case which
happened few years back and the recent
one in 2012 was the corruption movement
in against the government so first
question is with respect to do so just
to give a background jessica lall murder
case the messages were very prompt and
messages were used to inform of the
people to come for the protest and in
the second the facebook and other media
and majorly a yoga guru called baba
ramdev he had played a huge role in the
protest getting people over there so my
question is first do you really look at
the paradigm shift from what kind of
technologies or what social media has
changed over the years that's what
second thing is do you really look at
these data's apart from social media for
example the way I said about yoga guru
having a huge impact on the
protest and if yes you do see that
aspect of it do you see any kind of co
relationship between these political
issues and the social media and you know
yeah that's that's media makers it's a
huge question so perhaps we can just
have a quick response from each of our
panelists and an idea so is that is the
question what does the unlike online
activity do in relation to the physical
world activity of protests is that kind
of the summary of the questions yes so
do you find any kind of co relationship
between both of them yeah so there's
been some good writing on this in the
CMC world that is really tried to tie it
more closely I don't know if I can speak
to that off the cuff but we can
certainly talk to about that offline
we've done a little bit of work looking
at the online sphere so really failing
to connect it to the real world because
we knew we couldn't this is work I did
with Kate starboard because we weren't
on the ground and doing the work it's
you know that's very difficult thing to
do but we did look at how ideas get
diffused in the rest the world around
something is happening on the ground to
the extent that the knowledge of the
awareness of the rest of the world
happening being aware of those things
that are happening on the ground
supports them in some way or expresses
some kind of solidarity I think there is
a kind of solidarity but I don't know
what it does in terms of galvanizing
action there is actually a really good
paper by say sign up to fakie on the
impact of Facebook and Twitter in the
willing to participate in some of the
projects in Egypt that actually gets it
exactly that is so if you'd all just
join me in thanking our speakers today
we've run out of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
