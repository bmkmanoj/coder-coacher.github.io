so why don't we just start so we have
very happy here to have Greg Lewis from
Harvard and most of you probably well
some of you have been here for longer
probably no crack because he has been a
visitor before and you know has been
consulting researcher for a long time
and actually even though only told Irene
yesterday that we need an office for
Greg it still worked out because he's
still on an NDA so that kind of saved me
because I read was about to be very
upset with me but it's actually have to
do that part especially it actually
worked out fine I was sure she will and
Greg is going to tell us about
procurement auctions okay great thanks
very much for having me um yes so I
wasn't entirely sure what to present
when I was invited and so in the end I
end up picking something y de la girl to
stuff I've done while I working at
Microsoft just just died around so you
can see something slightly different for
me so this is a this is joint work with
Pat Barry who's now the chief economist
at amazon but was my advisor and and
we're going to tell you a little bit
about public procurement in particularly
time incentives in public procurement
this is based on a couple of papers
we've worked on together one of which is
published in one of which we're revising
okay so basic motivation public
procurement turns out to be economically
important I to be honest I had no idea
how important less blood looking into it
it turns out it's about ten to fifteen
percent of GDP in most developed
countries it's a massive massive amount
of GDP you spend procurement in it and
it's ubiquitous various kinds of
procurement federal procurement the
largest source of procurement in most
cases of military procurement but health
care through Medicare there's a lot of
procurement going on in the States as
well a large part of any state budget is
highway procurement and that's what
we're going to be talking about today
and then even if you go down to sort of
local levels there are procurement
contracts for you know contracts to
trash removal contracts for pothole
repair write these things are getting
are getting late all the time and
economists interest in contract design
and letting procedures and there are two
main designs that economists sort of
noticed are pretty common and have been
sort of interested in so one of that is
the one of those is the cost plus
designs this is a contract in which the
owner hires are contracted to do
something and agrees to pay them
basically their cost of doing whatever
this task is of the pothole repair or
the highway construction plus a fixed
fee or case a cost plus the other main
kind of design is a fixed price contract
where you negotiate a fixed price up
front which is the amount of money that
I'll pay you to do this job and if your
costs happen to run over that amount
that's your problem if your costs run
under then you make a profit okay so
this is the the second main kind of
design and so LaFonte role and others
have written a number of papers based on
this I thinking about this trade-off
between cost plus verse fix price
designs and the sort of the main
takeaway from that that literature is
that the problem with cost-plus
contracts is a moral hazard problem so
if you offer to pay people all their
costs then they have no incentives to
take cost-saving measures right they're
not going to work very hard to reduce
costs and as a result of that you might
end up paying a lot more in the long run
then you should for this project fixed
price contracts by contrast a sort of
high-powered incentive so you're
basically saying you're the residual
claimant on any amount of money you're
able to save if you go ahead and take a
bunch of cost-saving measures that lads
to your profit and so you should expect
that that under this sort of system the
final cost might be lower the trade-off
here is that is an adverse selection
problem if there are many different
kinds of contractors out there under a
cost plus regime basically the
contractors don't get any benefit from
any asymmetric information if they
happen to be very cheap since you're
only paying them their costs you get
that cheapness right you get it up front
on the other hand in a fixed price
setting they may
get information rents right they might
get additional money because they're
cheaper than everybody else and the way
you solve this typically in federal
procurement is they seem to have settled
on the system of a fixed price model so
it's always the cheapest guy gets it but
then an auction so that to the extent
that there are differences among
contractors and how cheap they are it's
the cheapest guy who's going to be doing
the job and the amount of money they're
gonna earn is only the difference for
the cheapest guy in the second cheapest
guy right so they earn some surplus but
the surpluses bounded by competition
okay so all of this this analysis has
been about money and in fact what you're
buying is typically a lot more
complicated you know and it's it's not
all just about money so take a
particular example which is the example
we'll be talking about today you want a
highway bolt and when dimension is that
you'd like that highway to be both
cheaply but you'd also like that highway
to be both soon right sooner rather than
later or repaired sooner rather than
later this is particularly true if
you're thinking about something like a
bridge where the traffic delays or the
externalities cause to commuters for
having to drive around to the other side
of the river say if you close down a
massive bridge for example is going to
be it's going to be very very costly and
so time is going to be a very important
dimension and how so how do you deal
with this in a contracting problem well
typically you specify a complete designs
you say this is exactly what I want and
you write that down in a contract so I
want a bridge over mass ave that's built
by this date and then everything becomes
about money so now we have this product
it's entirely specified what the product
is and now we're trying to find some
sort of design that's going to achieve
this in the most cost effective kind of
way most efficiently but people have
started to think about more innovative
designs recently which give people which
leave the design a little bit more
flexible and give people incentives to
deliver a slightly better product so to
to be a bit more precise about this the
standard design is into with respect to
time is that you set a deadline and you
set a penalty rate to every day late so
that penalty rate is laid out in the
contract typically the
delivery date for this is the 30th of
January and every day they're off to you
Oh s another five thousand dollars okay
we're going to pay you five thousand
dollars less these innovative designs
work in two different directions so
they're two different ways they've been
implemented what is it you can just
start giving bonuses for being early so
you know the design we have in mind is
that you're going to hit the 30th of
January but if you happen to deliver it
on the twentieth of January here's some
extra money to compensate you for it and
so that makes the product sort of a bit
more flexible you can deliver any
product really you don't have to live
the city of the January product you can
deliver the 20th of January product or
the tenth of februari product and we're
going to have a contingency plan that
specifies how you get paid out in each
of these different deliverables you
might come up with a second thing you
can do which we're going to spend quite
a lot of time talking about today is you
can allow people to bid directly about
on the deadlines themselves so you're
going back to the bidding stage you can
have people compete on both money and
time and you can award a contract to the
person who's the best in terms of some
combination of money and time so no
longer only about money but really
auctioning off a combination of money in
time okay so here's a sort of a concrete
example so in 2007 there was a gas tank
explosion in a very big interchange in
San Francisco so whenever I give this
talk out in California everybody knows
what this event changes but I don't
really but this is a sort of a huge
explosion as you can see it kind of just
completely messed up you know multiple
highways multiple sort of roads and that
interchange so this was an Oakland and
eighty thousand people a day traveled on
this interchange and so when Caltrans
went ahead and estimated the externality
from this negative externality then
basically worked out that the cost of
that interchange being down with six
million dollars a day in terms of
commuter time Hugh caused huge traffic
delays people couldn't get where they
want to get there weren't that many
other way routes around it was a
disaster so what Caltrans decide to do
is take one of these innovative
approaches rather than saying we'd like
this contract we'd like some new repair
this bridge and here's the deadline they
decided to put in place a deadline but
also give some bonuses to try get it
done a bit quicker so the goal is that
it should be down to 50 days the cost
estimate was
5.2 million that to be done and then
they agreed to pay a
two-hundred-thousand-dollar per day
early bonus which was capped 2 million
dollars you can see that's much smaller
than what they thought it was worth they
throw is worth six million dollars a day
they're paying 200 thousands a day and
then also a huge penalty for being late
to incentivize people to really get it
done on time so does any have any
guesses as to what happened yeah they
got it done even quicker and they got it
yeah well you can see three slides ahead
okay it was 24 exactly you knew that
yeah the interesting thing is they did
it very quickly and then they and then
they in addition to that they they
didn't make a ton of money offer as you
say so the first thing is that
contractor was completed in 25 days the
contract to earn the full business of 5
million dollars a bonus 5 million
dollars but was interesting is that that
bonus was entirely anticipated and their
foot was competed away because there was
an auction right so everybody everybody
realized they were getting a five
million dollar bonus because they can do
in 25 days and the top three bids were
all under 1.5 million dollars so the end
the winning bid turned out to be sick
867 thousand dollars the contract cost
them five point eight million dollars
which really seemed very reasonable
considering they were expecting to cost
them five point two million dollars
anyway and only get it done in 50 days
okay so this was very very successful
okay so if this is this is a very
successful project it's a it worked out
really well very high high bonuses very
large amounts of money involved one
thing we'd like to know is whether this
is sort of a signing more general and
would like to ask what happens when you
put in place time incentives on project
delivery in cost and I'm going to use a
much larger data set to look at this
yeah was it surprising I think they were
surprised yet so the the design engineer
genuinely thought that this was a
project that had to take 50 days and
middle edesign engineers from what I
understand tend to build in a little bit
of slack so they always pad things a
little bit you know so that people come
in and to target rather than lost
targets but I think they were I think
the 25 you know half the time was
surprising
yeah like this is the first time they'd
used high-powered incentives on the
deadline they might past observations
might have led them to think that things
take a long time yeah so they they had
they had had other instances of this
before I think this is the first case
they'd said it had been that big but
you'll see from the stuff that I'll show
you later than in fact it's it's the
fifty percent of the time is not even
that surprising so i think i'll show you
later you get about 35 centime
reductions pretty routinely yeah I mean
clearly all the contractors knew they
could build it in 25 is so I mean it
seems in the lake the design engineer
should have been able to work that out
right yeah right and so there this
should be something that was known from
a while back I mean I think what's
surprising so let me rephrase I think
the design engineer maybe knows this but
the way the design engineer actually
comes to that number of 50 days is
basically to assess what a standard work
crew working a standard way on this
design would take and so they're not
anticipating that of course given these
huge incentives people will do
non-standard things and so I think that
yeah that's maybe one would think about
okay so what we'd like to do is is work
out how much these time instead of due
to produce delivery in costs compared
the fare against the data to see if
there any substantive differences and
just see if we can suggest any
improvements in contract design based on
this and so today I'm basically going to
talk about two papers I'm gonna spend
most of the time talking about this
paper in California which basically
compares outcomes in standard auctions
versus these scoring auctions where
people bet on both time and money and
then I'm going to talk a little bit at
the end about Minnesota in Minnesota we
have not very much variation in
incentives in fact all the contracts
we're going to look at Minnesota
standard contracts but we have is very
detailed production data so we actually
see every day what was happening on the
site what the contractor did whether
they short of work how long they worked
how many hours it took and so we can
think a little bit about whether there's
whether the theory we have
the basic theory that we both the
California is really actually correct
letter the Minnesota data and you'll see
that there are some sort of slight
differences okay so California we
basically in a finding just to highlight
the findings in advance we find that the
scoring work should design it seems to
be a good idea contracts end up being
completed a bit faster and we estimate
that the commuter gained a less cost is
about 5.2 million dollars a contract so
we think there's an average contras
about 20 million dollars so we think
there's about twenty five percent a
surplus being left on the table here so
it's a pretty pretty big number and we
think moreover the based on this our
analysis that the way that they using
them at the moment is not enough they
could go much further they could use
these contracts for more often and
achieve much more significant welfare
gains from doing that yeah just no power
contracts but set a deadline of 25 days
yeah they'll Chico late what then
they'll just go late I mean if it's a
super low power to contract and you set
a super-tight dip actually essentially
you said I'm not going to get to it but
in Minnesota we simulate exactly that
kind of factual very low penalties very
tight deadlines you just complete really
late and you paid penalty no no I fellas
just like well then you back to a high
pod contract yeah no I mean well no
people but they just put a lot I'm
willing to do this for a lot of money
and then it actually gets you a very
similar outcome what we'll see is that
there's a big difference between um and
you say this in theory is a big
difference between between incentives
that look like quotas he has a deadline
and then here some penalty and
incentives that look like taxes here's a
flat rate at which I'm going to
incentivize you to be quicker or slower
and you want taxes you don't want quotas
so they're actually a lot of reasons why
25 dot 25 days and huge penalty is
already bad idea but we'll see that but
later 25 days and 200,000 or fine for
every day if it's a bonus if you're
getting a hundred or thousand dollar
bonus Oh as well yeah you could move 20
so if you don't do your bonus you
so if you yeah so if you move to am if
you move to a system in which basically
you can create a tax with a quota you
can create a text by basically sitting
at in any case a a deadline of 0 days
will always generate essentially the
same incentive structure as a as a you
know as anything and so 25 days if they
can never completed sooner than 25 days
there's no risk in setting a 25-day
thing the danger is always sort of you
want something it looks like a tack so
if you take the minimum possible
feasible days they could complete it in
and then everything after that you're
going to charge them a penalty that's
attacks effectively if you said it's
sort of in the interior of what's
feasible and then there's a sudden
discontinuous jump in the incentive
structure then that looks like a quota
and it's not going to be up tax or a
quota because it depends on whether on
whether 25 day because there was a max
we never force yeah we did was feasible
to do any better that's certainly they
weren't gonna do any better because they
didn't have any incentive to maybe they
could have done better but yeah so we
don't know whether this what they did
before in that case was optimal or not
since we don't know what the
technologies yeah yeah but I guess you
get to that but they must somebody find
out how you borrow uncertainty because
so depends on how you think like mr. I
mean taxes must be somehow because
there's a lot of cases where I have
legitimate reasons by around three days
over and I don't want to like lose all
my you so it matters a lot so it's
selling model specific so the way we're
thinking about this is that there is a
known benefit and there's an unknown
cost on the contractor side and in that
case the tax turns out to be the right
the right solution to that but we'll see
in the theory but later okay um so
Minnesota we find you know the penalties
work even in low powered contracts if
you have so all the penalties here are
not very big but some penalties are
bigger than others and when their
contracts have stronger penalties they
tend to be late less often so even at
lower levels they matter but we also
find Minnesota when we look at the
production data that there are
significant production shocks so things
go wrong that's not
surprising and contractors respond to
these shocks so they respond in a bunch
of different ways the theory model that
we lay out there just has a something
about them adapting how how much they
work a day so when they work longer
hours or shorter hours they do that but
it turns out they also work on weekends
they'll also work in the rain because
one way that that these contracts are
designed to deal with the risk is they
say if it's a terrible the rainy day
when you can't get any work done we're
not going to count that as a day so
you're not being exposed to weather risk
because if it happens that you get a
horrible raining season or mom soon as I
make that that's not going to count
against you but it turns out that in
fact on days in which there's light rain
the project engineer might say that
doesn't count as a real day that's okay
and then they go to work on it anyway
because they can get some work done and
they don't get charged for right so we
see all these interesting kinds of
adaptation to the the shocks under the
different incentives and one thing that
comes out of this is because we measure
significant production shocks we can see
that when you have high-powered
incentives you really are genuinely
transferring risk to the contractor it's
not like the contractor can say there's
a technology as a fixed technology you
give me different incentives I'm going
to return a different amount of days I'm
willing to work do this contract
contract in they can change how they're
going to approach the task but they
still face risk because there are these
shocks and so if you're going to ramp up
the incentives then you know there's
going to be risk because their payments
are going to going to vary a lot and so
that suggests that relative to the
caltrans analysis where I'm going to
ignore risk aversion the risk aversion
actually is probably realistic and so
welfare gains maybe a little bit smaller
than I would have told you with the with
the California data so what I'm going to
do is start off the California tell you
a lot about the data to a little bit of
a program evaluation and go through the
model and some kind of factual
simulations and then a little bit about
Minnesota at the end so in California we
have a large data set most of which is
publicly available in their website so
we have the contract plans and
specifications this includes basically
the entire contract itself which is a
multi-hundred you notes
many hundreds of pages PDFs parts of
which different Ras have to go through
we have a bid summary so it's basically
what everybody bit on each of these
projects and we have the payments to the
contractors which include the completion
dates that includes measures of when
they started when they finished how many
weather days they were given how many
other kinds of days were given to them
as special days that they didn't get
charged etc and we have this data
between 2003 and 2008 yeah means you
have information on all which whether
they won or not exactly okay that's that
you're going to be important for us
because we're going to learn something
from all the beds rather than just a
single but in the in the estimation
later okay so a standard design
basically says that there's a target
date specified by the design engineer in
these damages the scoring auction design
is we already said is something where
you bet on both price and time and in
fact they have a very particular kind of
linear scoring rule you've been an
amount of money that's the a part of
this a plus B design and then there's a
user cost which is a parameter and that
user cost times B gives your score s and
the person who has the lowest score wins
the auction okay and then there are
additionally damages specified in the
contract so this is an example of a
particular contract and this is actually
you know this is a piece of data right
so this is a text file that you can
download from their website so it's a
particular contract that's its at
multiple locations they're doing work to
replace existing median barrier in a
bunch of different places and there are
many bidders so I haven't shown you all
the birds but here are the top two so
dasilva Gates is the winning bidder they
bid about 10.8 million dollars and they
said they'd be willing to do in 108 days
the user cost parameter here is 11,500
so that's how much a day is worth in
dollars and so then that gets multiplied
by the 108 it gets added together in the
a plus B scores 12.1 million dollars OC
Jones &amp;amp; Sons was willing to do it for a
little bit more money but in a lot fewer
days in 135 days they really weren't
nearly as competitive they end up being
about 300,000 dollars
final on the score okay so this is
basically how an a plus B auction works
everybody's going to submit a bid and a
number of days and then we just take
this we just take this linear score and
take it give it to a low score so a plus
B contract to use pretty systematically
in California one reason we we work with
California's is a big state they do a
lot of these Road contracts and in fact
they've embraced this a plus B design so
it's pretty common there in most
districts they have a rule for when you
use an a plus B contract they use them
if the value of the contras over five
million dollars and the estimated cost
of commuters of the five thousand
dollars a day so it has to be a big
contract otherwise they don't bother and
it has to be a contract where they
really think that the road closure is
going to be bad for commuters however
and this is it's very useful for us but
it's a little bit puzzling one of the
districts which is San Francisco
basically just has a completely
different role that they use because I
whoever's in charge of district for
one's do things differently and their
rule is that if the contract is over 100
days just as a flat rule they'll use
they must be design yeah does that mean
they that if that's always if that's
true they always use a square ruler if
that's just when they can use it no they
they they let me rephrase they the right
thing is they can use it so they don't
always use it but they never use it fits
below 100 this is the right thing yep
that's right that's right so if the a
plus B contract is used then how they
set user cost is also a little bit
random in outside a district for every
basically the traffic department goes
ahead and calculates what they think the
cost commuters of this delay is and it
turns out that the way they calculated
at least by our calculations always seem
is to be unreasonably low so somehow
they come up with numbers that make it
seem like people's time isn't very
valuable we're not we really we've tried
very hard to reconcile our numbers and
their numbers and we're just pretty much
convinced of that their numbers are in
reasonably low and in in district 4 they
just have a formula so they don't even
try to work out how much traffic is
going through these these different
areas they just literally apply the
formula and active
I use a cost yeah freeway great so so
this is going to be a different design
at least on its face it looks like it
should be it should be quite different
we're now bidding out on a deadline
rather than getting a contract which
pays the penalty in theory for a lot of
theory models you write down their
completely equivalent it doesn't matter
you could have turned the one model into
other nurse shouldn't make any
difference I think interesting empirical
question is whether in fact they do
behave the same in practice I know I've
seen papers from lab experiments which
suggests that that they had do perform
pretty similarly but the lab experiments
are set up in such a way that it it
looks like they're going to end up
performing pretty similarly so I don't
know how much I believe those results
but at least in principle if you can
work your way through it you should be
indifferent between a contract that's
going to pay you five hundred fifty
thousand dollars a day or one in which
it's valued in the auction of $250,000
day yeah the pound is equal to the user
costs the penalty is equal to the user
cost in these contracts and the user
custody but yes so they've been cases
where the penalties be less from the
user cost that's a terrible idea because
then your optimal decision is to bid
zero days and then pay the penalty and
in fact that happened in Minnesota and
everybody called the contract is called
the people up and said can we but there
it is and they said no and so then they
bid 20 days when it was a hundred a
contract whatever they thought they
could get away with without being
disqualified sort of all random yeah
there's some kind of reputational
incentive from being able to bid
accurately about you good estimate of
the time so no is the it's a short
answer you'd think there would be um and
at least according to federal
procurement rules you have to water
based on either the score in the auction
you know whether it's a scoring auction
or normal auction and so really as long
as you actually deliver you can't really
be penalized now that being said the
state could in principle try to bar you
from an auction I could say you're not
not a reliable contractor anymore you
didn't deliver that's potentially going
to lead to lawsuits so you probably have
some sort of reputational concerns but
not as much as you think because the
state is going to be very nervous about
trying to disqualify anybody yeah
finishes in 100 days he does not get any
bonus no no so even here if there is no
reputational effect you would expect
them so it should be sort of a dominant
strategy to bid zero days or something
that's below the support of the
uncertainties however yeah that's right
so you'd expect that why don't I just go
ahead and go at zero and then always pay
out penalties so people don't do that in
fact what you'll see them doing the data
is they almost always basically pick a
target they think they can hit and they
pretty much hit it you know so maybe
that suggested the uncertainty is not as
much as you'd think although the
evidence from Minnesota would say that
there's some genuine uncertainty about
this so it is it is curious as to why
they don't just pick more ambitious
targets and go late contractors not in
theorists well it is that but they
didn't work up the Minnesota they didn't
work out the you know the edge of the
support thing anyway yeah so the Makos
money if I bid 0 and I can do the
contract in 80 days and somebody bid
honesty on 50 days then I'm going to win
but pay the secondary spies and then
actually lose a lot of money no but what
you do is you you bid 0 and you ramp up
your bed at the same time so your mod
you you know you're getting complete in
80 days you know you're going to
complete it going to pay 80 there's more
penalty so you just add those editors
more penalties to your benefits exactly
the same months you're equally
competitive as before but now you're
guaranteed to lock in the bonus because
you're always going to be late so if you
happen to get lucky and be able to do in
70 days then where is it good bid 80 you
wouldn't go to bonus for you down in 70
now you're always going to be late you
so there's a lot of like little cute
little game theory kind of things you
could do here but they in practice
people just basically go with what they
think they're going to be able to do it
in because I can make more money though
okay um okay so actually what I'd like
to ask is a is a is a sort of more of an
econometrics tart which is just will
come back to the theory but it's just
sort of does this does this this is
probably
seem to have good outcomes and so one
way to do that is to basically look at
some set of outcome variables and
compare a treatment and control group so
we're going to construct a control group
of standard contracts that are like the
contracts that got treated so treatment
here is being given an a plus B
assignment you're an a plus B auction
and a control as an auction is an
auction that a contract that could have
been a plus B so it's pretty similar but
for some reason was not a plus B and we
hope that that reason is all foggin all
to the outcomes of interest okay and so
what we're going to get is treatment
effects of bids on on bids so how much
more to people bid and time to
completion so how much long does this
contract take we expect that a plus B
contracts cost you more money because
you're asking people to be faster so
that should cost them money so you
should end up paying more on average so
we'd like to see that effect and we'd
also like to see if they do end up
actually being faster they get
completely more quickly and then we need
to compare these numbers and dollars we
need to convert time to money so we have
to say what's the commuter time worth in
order to be able to compare the
acceleration in time to the amount of
money you're paying our medicine so to
convert time into money we do something
really simple we basically say that the
Lost commuters per day on a highway is
the value of their time which we assess
at about twelve dollars an hour a little
bit more because some roads have trucks
and we think the trucks the value of
delaying a truck is a little bit higher
so we assist that twenty eight dollars
an hour times the amount of traffic
going through that road at times the
delay where we assumed the delay is
basically three minutes we do a more
elaborate calculation but you should too
rough approximation we're just going to
say that we assume that every time
something goes over that road it gets
too late three minutes of it's under
construction and so that gives us an
amount of money put in okay and this is
pretty conservative so we certainly
don't think three minutes delay is about
the right number we think the three
minutes delay is probably a lower bound
for many of these contracts and so we're
ready just taking a very conservative
estimate of what we think the social
losses okay how about constructing a
control group so to do that we basically
follow the policy rule so
we know that there are some contracts
that were eligible for a plus B so this
goes back to your earlier question right
so if you are over 5 million dollars
outside of district for you could be an
a plus B contract if you were over a
hundred days outside of just in district
4 you could be at a plus B contract so
we're going to compare contracts that
are at least big enough for at least
long enough but for some reason weren't
a plus B and we're going to see if those
two groups look pretty similar so this
is what you get so here in this column
I'm comparing standard contracts this
column to a plus B contracts that column
and you'll see that the winning bid in
both of those contracts is pretty
similar the discount from the engineer's
estimate is pretty similar the number of
bidders is pretty similar the amount of
time expected for the contract to take
is pretty similar as well what's
different across these two contract
groups the ones that will stand on the
ones with a plus B is things like
traffic so there's way more traffic on
the ones that ended up being a plus B
contracts it turns out that one measure
of how valuable that the the the traffic
department assesses them as being for
commuters is something called the
reopening penalty so reopening penalty
is basically a penalty that gets assess
if you don't reopen the contract during
peak hour traffic so suppose 5 to 7 p.m.
is peak hour traffic part of the
contract will say you cannot work
between five and seven pm and if you're
late I'm going to charge you this
penalty and it's usually / 15 minutes
it's like five thousand dollars every 15
minutes you're late it's very high
penalty and it turns out that in a plus
B contracts these penalties are much
higher so the story where we'd like to
tell here is look these contracts are
pretty much identical except for the
fact that these are contracts that for
whatever reason of you is more socially
valuable which is why they get assigned
to be a plus B and so our analysis here
is going to basically depend on the
assumption that contracts that are more
socially valuable are not more difficult
to accelerate right so that the the
differences in costs across these two
groups how fast you can accelerate them
are not related to the differences in
how socially valuable they are because
that's what's driving assignment here
does that make sense you have a question
so I cut those the same kind of holds
just different traffic on them yeah
that's I mean that that's pretty much we
can show you so on many on many things
it's true we also do that we also do it
on types of project to what whether it's
a repaving contract or a bridge repair
contract etc and the answer is again
that were reasonably balanced on those
groups so it looks like these are the
same kinds of contract except for
traffic that makes sense because the
rules are basically such that they
should be the same kind of the same kind
of thing except for traffic right this
five thousand dollar a day rule okay and
in here a district forward a little bit
more puzzling right why are there any
contracts are on a plus B and the answer
is the district for believes that some
contracts are harder to so they don't
make some contracts a plus B because
they think that they're going to have
difficulties themselves and getting
permissions for various parts of the
contract so like if you're building
through a farm you need to get
permission from the farmer where you you
know when close to farming you get
permission for the farmer to do that if
they don't have their permissions lined
up in advance they just don't use a plus
B they don't like using high-powered
incentives when they don't already have
all the clearances in place so that
that's the story of district 4 but at
least for the other districts it's
pretty clear what's going on there are
some contracts they don't think it's
very valuable than others where they do
okay so um so what do we do we just run
our last regressions we look at the
outcomes on a dummy for a plus B status
controlling for a bunch of observables
and since the treatment control groups
already balanced the observables this is
they say W robust right it's a rest
because you're controlling for
observables which were already balanced
on okay okay so what do you find you
find that here you find it basically
people bid to complete the contract in
about forty percent fewer days so this
is kind of a huge results already so
100-day contract your average person
average one of these cases people will
be bidding to complete in 60 days guess
it's a big reduction and they're going
to charge you about eight percent more
for it so the contract price does rise
and it rise by about eight percent you
might think that part of this reduction
in
is an illusion because maybe they
actually complete it say they're going
to complete in forty percent few days
but they don't and you know depending on
how you cut the data it appears to
basically hold up so they don't complete
in forty percent fewer days they end up
completing it on time but a standard
contract would have been completed about
five percent early anyway so the actual
gain in time is about thirty five
percent or forty percent so they end up
doing what they said they'd do but you
would have already got five percent for
free if you had written or in a standard
contract so you only actually going to
put about thirty five percent faster the
change in commuter welfare from this is
about 5.6 million dollars a contract and
the change in costs that turns out to be
about 1 million dollars so there's a
large a large gain on a per contract
basis so 25 million minus a million is
about 4.6 movie okay so that's that's
basically the idea here we do a lot of
robustness checks which I'm not going to
talk too much about in the paper one
thing you could do is you could say well
this linear regression is too simple I
should really match more carefully so we
do nearest neighbor matching we're
basically pair contracts based on the
observables sort of nearest neighbors
sense and then we DIF them we find
there's no real change in the results
and the other thing we can do is we can
do a regression discontinuity design
around these thresholds these
hundred-day thresholds and these five
million dollar thresholds and again we
find significant results okay so um the
next question you might want to ask is
could they have done any better so they
did pretty well with these scoring
auctions and obviously they've continued
the program so they thought it was a
good program could they've any better so
now we come to the theory so what should
they have done in theory that's the
question yeah is it the case that these
contractors are working on several
highways at the same time and diverting
resources between them so that you might
actually just be something seeing
substitution away from this from the
standard contract that's a great
question uh so you know what we that
would be a good thing to check for we
haven't checked for that and we'll in
Minnesota we've had a look at this and
Minnesota we find no evidence of people
moving things across contracts
but in Minnesota we don't have the same
sort of variation incentives so we don't
have like huge instead of small
incentives you might think that what's
going on is yeah sometimes it's huge
something small oh yeah i mean the short
answers we should just check I don't
think that's what's going on even if
they are doing that I suppose you have
the right order of magnitude for the
welfare in the sense that it's the less
important contract that are getting the
weaker incentives yeah that's right so
already you're in the right direction
but um I actually just don't think it's
what's going on to be honest I think
that I mean I'm happy to look for it but
I you know the the what we're seeing
what I guess you would expect be seeing
the data then is that there are a lot of
late standard contracts going on and
their standard contracts are pretty much
finishing on time so it doesn't look
like there's just a sort of massive
rearrangement it looks like this
genuinely just and the way they describe
its isn't there was new york times
article about this the people who do
these very accelerated contracts
basically say look we just change the
plans completely so you said you were
going to do it on this plan we have a
completely different plan we negotiate
better deals without input suppliers so
they can get our suppliers supplies
quickly right so it's already about a
reorganization of the way they're going
to produce the thing more than just a
you know a movement of like well I had a
crane here I could put that crane here
and then this one gets slower I actually
requested to do I mean this is a punch
line that oh you know you're costing you
know a million dollars more the
government but you're saving the people
you know overall net welfare whatever
mode I mean you could say this that look
all it takes is a school you know a
public school system to invest two
million dollars in better schools and
the effect to the population down the
road will be you know 50 million dollars
so you know clearly we should do this
with a pointed at the end of the day you
know California does need to come and
say hey guys look we've saved you a
bunch of money getting your roads fixed
faster can we have more taxes that's
right so answer is always like you know
52 responsive to that so one response is
sort of like California so is no but
yeah we don't really know what the
effects of like of
of investing schools are in people spend
forever measuring be searched so it's a
sort of useful thing to do but I'm
actually we're going to do something
useful here with that respect we're
going to ask one thing we're going to
ask is what could they have done if they
didn't want to change the amount of
money based heads event and will find
that they could have actually not
changed the amount of money spent and
done a whole lot better so that maybe
gets to wash yeah are there different
social for the tumor kinds of options
are there different contractors being on
the two different options in the sense
that maybe if I'm like a really slow
contractor I know I don't bid on the
scored option because I'd never get the
I know I can't be I can't honestly get
my days down enough to it yes the the
short answer to that is no as far as we
can tell in the sense that nothing about
contractor observables predicts where
they bid so we run out we run our we run
a basically a participation regression
it's a dummy for whether you participate
in auction we ask is there something
about the country is this saying about
the observable features of that
contractor that predicted that a bit in
different kinds of auctions so for
example the big big contract has always
been an a-plus be quite auctions or the
closest contractor always been an a-plus
the auction announce there's no there
could be selection and observables it
could be that some people are
selectively better at accelerating but
at least that's not know sort of that
what we can observe about you I like the
Hat the time they take in the past I
mean maybe this is so that's interesting
if we have no Pamela I guess because you
know I mean you have like five years
right so could you take like the first
first half and look at their their time
completion and see if those the people
yeah that's right i mean that's
observable so we could set me look at it
yeah yeah you know like how much of the
uncertainty is foreseen by the
contractor and how much of that is just
private information so that's a good
question so we haven't got to yeah so
maybe Adele they'll probably belong
better with the Minnesota stuff but no
on short answer is not really right so
what we're going to see is a so I can
show you I can show you in Minnesota
there whether shocks and I can show you
that those weather shocks affect hell on
the contract takes even after you can't
for the three days that you get because
it's rainy so that there certainly is
residual and certainly I just conflict
with the weather is the weather matters
but how much of it is which one and the
other I don't know the other things
I mean any big construction project
there's some like you know unforeseen
things like you know I might need a
better foundation I have to add some
more days and you know that's something
I probably you know wouldn't want to put
into I mean a party would mud put all
the risk on the contractor because
contractors are smaller than the
government know exactly so it doesn't
seem efficient that's right so the in
them in the Minnesota paper we basically
so you're right so firstly there's it's
just that contractor knows that we don't
know and the stuff that contractor
didn't know that's going to be realized
that's a genuine some shock to them
we're going to basically end up assuming
in the Minnesota stuff that the
basically we know everything the
contract notice everything we that isn't
observed as a shock to them I'm going to
find those shocks do matter in the sense
there if you if you really put hi pod
incentives you impose quite a lot of
risk on them and so you know both of
these end up going the same direction if
I can't raise a lot of money because I'm
the government it's hard to raise money
then I don't want to tax people then I
shouldn't use very high-powered
incentives I should use a little more
moderate incentives and also if there's
a huge amount of uncertainty that isn't
resolved then I don't want to use super
high pod incentives because again it's
going to impose risk and so both of
these statements are going to go in the
direction of saying yes you want to use
incentives and yes you want those
incentives sort of moderately powered
and that's that's sort of where we're
going to end up okay so um so what
should have done the theory is is
reasonably easy to answer every day
taking is going to impose a negative
externality on the commuters and so what
you basically want to do is you want to
make the commute the contract to
internalize that externality and so what
you do is if the externality is $3,000
day you basically sale penalize you
three thousand dollars a day i'll text
you it every three thousand dollars day
you you bid and that basically makes
their objective function coincide with
the social objective function okay so
this is an easy solution on the other
hand the standard kind of contract isn't
doing that so this is sort of the
picture I have in mind at least with
respect to the standard contract so here
is a contract to cost curve and the C
prime means that it's the marginal cost
of accelerating by a day so manipulating
the amount of time they take my one day
and either
from the other we imagine that it's a
very you know accelerating by a day is
very cheap at the beginning but very
very expensive so if you want to reduce
from 30 days to 31 for 31 days to 30
days that's not so expensive but from
two days 21 days would be insanely
expensive because you'd have to do a lot
more work very quickly these Thetas here
are just sort of different types of the
contractors this goes back to world in
which all the asymmetric information is
ex ante right so this is something that
the contractor knows about themselves
that you don't know this is their
different contract contractor cost
curves so in a standard contract there's
a deadline and the penalties just jump
to some penalty rate at that point and
so one thing you get from a standard
contract is that you might have
different contractor types who are
nonetheless all going to complete the
exact same dates they're all going to
pile up a bunch at the deadline and the
reason is that you know the most
efficient contractor theta one here has
no incentive to be early the most
inefficient contractor doesn't really
want to be late because he's selling out
to pay as high penalties that all these
people end up bunched in the middle
doing the exact same thing that's not
efficient whereas with an a plus B
contract there's some constant user cost
which basically provides a flat
incentive and what these guys are going
to want to do is is basically work out
where this user cost cuts their marginal
cost of Lake cost acceleration curve and
bid that number of days so where this
where this point these two curves cut
each other's is what they actually have
bid i'm going to say look given--given
those three thousand dollars a day I
wouldn't want to accelerate more than
ten days but I will accelerate ten days
the tog was 80 days so but 70 days used
by that picture because he said that in
these contracts typically the
disincentives actually a lot lower than
the user cost oh yes no so the
disincentive is usually equal to use a
cost so this picture should be done let
me if you go to the authorities measure
of the user car it should be from the
social cost ya so that's right so so
think about this as being the actual
user cost this is the weight in the rule
this is the penalty rate which can be
equal to that and then there's a social
cost
which we think is actually somewhere way
up here much much higher and all i'm
going to say in the theory is that you
know the user cost should be set equal
to the social cost of it said low the
social cost you're going to get
inefficiently low acceleration but yeah
so we haven't got the social cost in
this picture ok so the right level is we
just said the user car should be set
equal to the social cost ok and so you
know that's the theory that's so theory
is really simple the theory you know
relative to what Marcus was saying
before we have no ex post uncertainty we
have no risk aversion so we assume risk
neutrality then you know adding ex post
uncertainty doesn't really matter too
much if we assume risk aversion plus X
post uncertainty then the incentive
should be lower than these incentives
right that would be too strong neck ok
so then the second question you want to
ask is how much better would be society
be if you use these optimal scoring
options so do get wealthy estimates you
actually have to go and estimate the
contractor costs so somehow what I don't
know at the moment is what this cost
curve looks like what the cost of
acceleration actually are and even more
it's a little bit more complicated if I
wonder in a counterfactual I have to say
suppose I would have changed the
incentive structures and all these
auctions who would show up in these
auctions were to change who ends up in
these auctions and who would win these
auctions which again is you know it's
obviously who bids the lowest but I have
to have a model of bidding to work out
who's going to bid the lowest yes this
is kind of complicated and we're going
to end up modeling the entire auction
process but because i have 10 minutes
i'm not going to tell you about all of
that i'm just going to tell you mainly
about how we estimate the cost so one
thing we do is you write down a
parametric form for this function that i
was showing you before this curve so we
assume the marginal cost of acceleration
which we know is going to be set equal
to the user cost in equilibrium it has a
very particular form in particular we
assume that it's it's got this log
linear form where the number of days
they excel or offer to accelerate just
raised to some power alpha is going to
determine the marginal cost of
acceleration and so these are the kinds
of curves we're going to have in mind
very similar where i showed you before
it's going to be convex where the
convexities can be determined by this
parameter alpha ok so what i can do is
that i can take that equation
I could take logs and rearrange terms
and when I do I get that something that
I observed which is the amount of days
they accelerated was a function of
something else I observed which was the
user cost on this contract as well as a
bunch of controls okay and so this is
basically like estimating a supply curve
in economics if I if I am if I offer it
if I offer exhaust Leah different series
of prices to people and I observe how
much they're willing to supply at
different prices I can trace out that
curve so here's the same logic we have a
lot of different user costs being
offered to people different incentives
for acceleration I see how much legs
offered to accelerate again that's
basically that identification argument
so here I'm basically just showing that
in pictures as the incentives go up as
i'm offering you different user costs
i'm going to see different amounts of
days bid and that's going to tell me
something about the shape of this curve
and then also because i have many
bidders in every auction i can learn
something about the amount of
heterogeneity so at any given user cost
on the seat and any given auction for
example i'm going to see many different
beds and so it's going to tell me some
about the distribution of of these cost
curves across people it's I can learn
both about the shape generally and I can
learn something about the hedge annuity
between people okay so you know what
when I go and estimate that I can
estimate that actually buy all or less
it's not pretty complicated i have a lot
of controls I have a lot of fixed
effects but basically what i end up
getting is a is a parameter on this log
using the cost of about point to 75 and
to interpret that that tells you the
elasticity of acceleration with respect
incentives is about point to 75 which
means the modular cost of acceleration
have the form roughly d to the 3.5 in
other words saving you one day pretty
cheap two days sort of it's greater than
a cubic function so the cost
acceleration got very very very fast
okay so we have extremely convex module
costs of acceleration it's really easy
to get people accelerate a few days but
if you want to accelerate a lot of days
that's really expensive and so that what
that suggests is that if you set small
incentives that can have pretty big
effects on completion time right so if I
have a
very convex function means that if I set
a small instead of I can get mini days
out of you I can get even more days by
setting a bigger incentive but the gains
to bigger incentives the diminishing
very fast right they go away pretty
quickly and so with budget constraints
going to the budget constraint point it
would be better to give small incentives
and many contracts rather giving very
big incentives in very few contracts
right because I'm gonna get these gains
across the board and I'm going to get
them pretty cheaply I'm just doing it in
a in a few country in at small levels in
many contracts okay so to get it that we
simulate for kind of factual policies
one of them is we keep the set of a plus
B contracts exactly the same but we
change the incentives we said that the
user costs away too low they should be
equal to social costs we just changed
incentives and make them bigger a second
is to use them only for contracts with
social costs above 100 k so only you use
them for really really important
contracts the third thing is to expand
the set of a plus B contract to all
contracts so to basically change the
world quite a lot and move to every
contract being a scoring ocean contract
with the efficient incentives and the
fourth is this budget policy where we
expand the set of contracts to
everything but only set small incentives
so instead of here are going to be ten
percent of the social costs so very very
low and I can show you many things but I
think the bottom line is the easiest
which is that it doesn't really matter
whether we take the same set of
contracts and change the incentives so
why is that well it turns out the
incentives were too small before so I
can raise the incentives but when I
raise the incentives on a very convex
cost curve since the incentives are
pretty big already let me get a slightly
better day you know slightly slightly
foster contracts and we need a slight
gain but I me raising commuter costs
contractor costs by a lot I think a nap
at a lot of cost to get this little gain
and the end the net social benefit is
positive but it's not great I'm gonna
get a massive benefit from just
expanding the set of contracts so
instead using all the contracts as a
plus B contracts is going to do much
much better and I'm gonna get most of
that benefit even if I have a much
smaller
five if I'm only using ten percent of
the social cost as the incentive right
so I don't need a I don't need the fully
efficient instead of structure to get
most of the benefits so I think this as
being sort of the main punchline of the
paper it's something you could have got
the numbers you couldn't have got eggs
anta but the idea you could have got
anxiety right you could have base user
said well if I assume a convex curve
then obviously the right thing to do is
expand to everything at a smaller level
if I want to maintain a budget
constraint you could have shown that
pretty easily yeah so the restriction
adapt about Lena are being our penalty
right I could have yes but you could
interact with their supply i can
actually smarter penalty hey smoke for
it for a kind of so is that the problem
here is that I pay a lot if i increase
their bonus i pay a lot even for a few
days that I as I would have gained for a
smaller bones right that's kind of the
yeah exactly that I can't that I can't
squeezing money I can't crisis committee
essentially comprises come in exactly on
your curve yeah yeah that's right they
seem to have done opposite with a
California one they gave you like bonus
for up to 25 days and then nothing yeah
now one example I give a smaller bonus
at the beginning and four ish for a
little bit in advance and then it's
right to you yeah you could give it like
a nonlinear you give a nonlinear
schedule and you can in principle
squeeze out every more I get even more I
guess if you knew exactly what the shape
of these that's what I mean so that yeah
it's low because I started steps if you
don't know for sure as opposed to watch
them right yes if you know that these
convex if you know to come back to you
can as well my guess the class the door
but if I can bid on if I can get on the
number of days wouldn't i just did a
really a long number of days then you
have to set a penalty schedule but
related video very complicated yeah I
mean yeah so the questions yeah whether
you could do better than a linear linear
rule here i'm not sure like Biddle's may
business away even if you
even if you tailor a bit like a convex
cross a non-convex cost like it matters
what other's virginity when videos on
the on the schedule and the convex
exactly how schedule but if does not
then just be like that it you get it all
back it just gets better yeah i mean so
here we think there's a Trinity we think
that it looks you know we have a model
where it looks kind of like this right
so my other question is like after Lee
you won you won this for years you
actually learn something about what is
the more correct like time for
completion yes so after you have bit
more information about the correct time
conditions we still want to have the
Navy contract or do you just want to
have a regular contract but with a it's
nothing wrong with a navy contract at
least the way we've set it up here I
mean it doesn't it doesn't barely create
any additional administrative costs you
may as well run it and that the question
is just is that if there's if there's
some residual I'm certain do you still
want to have this kind of contract if
you really thought there's no real
there's no asymmetric information left
you basically just say I'm going to
compute the efficient time I'm going to
write it into a contract and then assess
penalties but if you just don't know
what it is did you say that cost went up
under they be conquer yeah cos cot cross
clarify bottom so it may be that like it
does it tells another little genki
another dimension of Georgian 80 win
contractors then the evaluations are
going to be further apart of the a/b
contract then under standard contract
and the folder gonna get gold like
ohbert's okay this is one of the
complicated things there that we sort of
discussing the back end of the paper so
it depends on whether you think that if
you think the contractors type is
something about how cheap they're on how
fast they are depends with a fast and
cheaper positively or negatively
correlated so if they're positively
correlated you're sort of enhancing the
market power that negatively correlated
your you're decreasing the market power
and I think we actually find in the
paper that they are positively carlot I
think yet we actually have a finding on
this in the paper I forget which one it
is but we come up with a number when we
send look it appears that these things
are
I want to say that positively correlates
so there is additional market power
going to these guys but it's still very
small relatively gains to commuters okay
so let me I've got I'm really out of
time so i'm gonna i'm going to just show
you like a picture from the soda i think
i'm gonna have dinner with ok so in
minnesota one thing we can do to try and
get up this question of you know what is
a shock how much is unanticipated is to
say look we know a lot about these
contracts we know what the design
engineer new we know how many hours of
design engineer expected the content to
take me know what kind of contract it is
we have i always go through and classify
thing everything very carefully we know
we know me gaze it was supposed to take
we know what the engineer's estimate was
we've got a bunch of observables and so
basically regress the total number of
hours that these guys ended up working
on the job and that's something unusual
to be able to measure to actually see
how much effort somebody put in in a
sort of a principal-agent setting this
is how much they worked and we regress
that on everything we know about the
contract and we come up with this
measure of a shock the shock is an hours
per day so that's the normalization so
this is the difference between the hours
that it actually end up taking and the
best possible guess we can get of the
hours it should have taken and that
shock turns out to be pretty big so most
contracts it's sort of about zero but it
can be as big as sort of ten hours a day
that this contract on the end was ready
you know ten hours a day more work than
you would have expected it so that's a
big big shot and what's interesting is
that if you then compare those to the
graph of days late something is sort of
super obvious from the graph which is
that many things are completed exactly
on time and if anything there's mass
that you would have expected to see if
if people were in adapting at all on the
right hand side that seems to have been
shifted to the left hand side so
basically what's going on is I've got
incentives to complete on time I have no
incentives to complete early and so when
I'm on this side of shock I get a
positive shock I don't do anything about
it on this side of the shock I get a
negative shock I actually I actually
pile up on completing on time yeah
they know they're being observed yes so
I would just ride are there is there a
if they think there's a reputation
effect when they may be be working
closer to them yeah so they're two
things so what is a reputation effect we
still don't think that's important here
but other things you might think that
they're manipulating the project
engineer which is one thing we're trying
to look into so is there a question with
the you know this this effect is just
that you're running behind so you really
convince the project engineer to give
you a few more free days and we're
trying to see if that's the case you
know we know that they do a lot of kinds
of different ways of adapting they work
in different ways but anyway so what is
the punch line of this well the punch
line this is look there's they are these
shocks that pretty big that imposes risk
and so in the back end of this paper
which we're not going to talk about we
actually try to again go through the
counterfactual simulations we find that
under the an average 1.3 million dollar
contract when you imply the correct
social incentives the standard deviation
of that payments is about fifty thousand
dollars and that's pretty big because if
you think that their markup is about ten
percent I'm making 130 thousand dollars
on the contract that means that if they
get a one standard deviation shock
they're going to basically lose about a
third of their profits so if you're
risk-averse and your contractor that may
not be a gamble you're willing to take
in particular we be worried small
companies might not be willing to take
this we worry about barriers to entry
for small companies so both of these you
know both these papers seem to come to
similar conclusions one these incentives
work and I think that's more carefully
shown in the in the California case the
Minnesota case we know that many much
variation but to you might want to be
very careful about whether you want to
go all the way to serve whatever the
flurry social optimal incentives are or
something a lot more moderate moderate
incentives are going to damp these risk
problems they're also going to damp
budgetary problems there may be more
practical for kinds of reasons yea maybe
then he ties ideas not so I mean will be
interesting you know as a counterfactual
because you might you know by giving
moderate penalties for like a few days
above them below giving higher penalties
for being
or above for far below that's right so
you could make you better than you my
team at BL just I mean those 40 days
like you know 100 days versus 60 days
it's a big difference right there very
big trees i captured by this deviation
of 10 days more or less yeah so I mean
that's an interesting question right you
know it's we can we could certainly
enrich the contracting space a lot of
them will complicate contracts and then
yeah it's just basically by detonating
it's whether you know because in the
world with nothing system genius Jacobs
exactly right i will just get that out
so it doesn't matter but if there is a
lot of x MK heterogeneity then then you
could actually do better and it's a
question as to how much better you yeah
oh great thank you ah excellent that's a
very practical question great so yeah so
one thing I haven't shown you in the
paper we we look for quality so
basically you can see from the payment
data in California how often they get
dinged for quality say they do these
tests all the time and if you're behind
on quality they then they ding you and
you can ask in the a plus B contracts
that anymore they get charged more from
quality deviations that under standard
contracts the answer's no the
interesting thing about the a plus B
contracts is that they're very aware of
the fact that because they've put in
place higher and said if people are
going to want to cheapen quality people
are going to want to get more weather
days they're going to argue more about
other days and so they basically that as
fault i tell they tell the project
engineers to be stricter than usual and
so there's no evidence that there's any
difference on any of these measures
which is a little bit surprising I guess
the thing that strange about how your
procurement is that it's a very well
designed product and it's something
that's been procured many times before
so we know how to write a contract that
says this is what we're going to check
for this is what you have to do it's
difficult in general somebody's nor pay
or kitchen and then then you worry a lot
about multitasking problems that since I
can't contract on quality effectively
then when I contract on time you just
mess up quality or vice versa yeah
sure how to ask it clearly but does it
matter that tour is it the case that
there is so much nesting of
subcontracting happening here so there's
not just one contractor contractor
subcontracting the subcontract yes right
so that's I mean so it's a it's
certainly in perfectly true there's a
ton of subcontracting going on I think
they're right I mean in principle it
doesn't make that much difference right
so if you at least if you assume that
the prime contractor can right sort of
flexible contest with a sub contractors
in some way either directly like this or
relationally then the subcontractors are
just going to inherit the incentives of
the contractor above them I think that's
pretty much what happens in practice so
I swear a subcontractor can be absorbing
the risk but the contract that we're
seeing on the surface in your data is
not absorbing powers that's true i mean
i guess well depends yeah it depends so
the payment risk is going to go through
so yeah so it again depends on the
weather the prime contractor is going to
be is going to be putting these time
instead of the subcontracts i guess
that's right then then if i'm only
responsible for the first third of the
project and only the risk for the first
third of the project is my problem the
next third is your problem that exited
and then you're right if we're splitting
up at over and FP baby maybe we're
closer to risk neutrality the risk
aversion and we don't care so much about
these risks I think yeah it's a fair
point and if the 50k entirely goes to
one person
explore whiskey well I just depends on
how you're thinking about the shocks
right so like 50k over a third of a
million dollars is more than oh yeah I
get yeah that's right so you're
splitting up the yeah you're both
filling up the the standard deviations
of payments which is putting up the
payment as well yeah I did it but I mean
that I could starting about portfolios
now you've got three of these little
subcontracts I don't know I mean you're
right but it's it's hard I once we start
thinking through this problem cap so the
these engineers they work for the city
right or the estate yeah so do they ever
use like a dependent third parties like
evaluate all since if a delay is
justifiable not as far as i know i mean
there must be independent audits times
because you know the government's I'd be
amazed if there weren't but I haven't
come across them
