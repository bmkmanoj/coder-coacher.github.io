country as opposed to say in Europe is
that many senior people are asked to
take on a few years and Cornell it was
four years for me as department chair I
think it's really a great way to run a
department to have different people
exert different leading different styles
of leadership and emphasize different
things in you know four five year turns
it is an interesting challenge to take
on being a department chair where you
have to no longer to scare about your
own success or subset of the areas of
the department but you have to integrate
the whole department you have to make
good hiring decisions in areas where
it's not you're not the expert and by
listening to your colleagues and getting
the right debates going you can help
hire the right people you can have
promote the right people from the
department and in part because of this
rotating system I think the people who
were department chair sir me I'm
planning to do this will remain in
leadership roles and try to help the
department stay a place where the right
people get promoted and where people
survive and succeed and are very
successful and like working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
