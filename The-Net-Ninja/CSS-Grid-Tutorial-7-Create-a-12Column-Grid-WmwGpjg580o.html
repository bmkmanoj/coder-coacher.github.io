grid tutorial and in this video we're
going to take everything we've learned
so far to make a twelve column grid all
right then so I thought I'd just take
one video to show you how to create a
twelve column grid system using CSS grid
much like you'd find in bootstrap a
twelve column grid system this time this
is gonna be pure CSS using CSS grid so
the first thing you're gonna notice is
this div right here with an ID of
content this is still serving as our
grid wrapper then we have six different
elements inside a header main section
aside nav and footer so these are going
to be distributed on this twelve column
grid system later on now up here in the
stands we have some very basic Styles
first of all we're setting the font
color of white the font family and we're
setting everything to text-align:center
then the content this div right here
we're setting display grid so that's a
grid wrapper now we also have a max
width of 960 pixels and imagine of 0 top
and bottom also left and right this is
going to centralize this 960 pixel
elements on the page if you can see that
right there alright cool
so everything as well which is a direct
descendants of this Content ID he's
gonna have a background of this blue
color and a padding of 30 pixels so
that's each one of these elements right
here alright cool so it looks something
like this
in the browser at the minute where each
element stacks want on top of the other
now we want to create 12 columns on this
grid so the first thing we need to do is
come to our grid wrapper which is this
content div right here and we need to
define our columns using grid - template
- columns right now I'm not gonna write
this out 12 times I'm going to use the
repeat function to say and by the way
spell is currently repeat we want to
repeat something 12 times and each
column is gonna be one fraction of the
whole grid so every column is gonna be
the same width right so if we save that
we can see they're all left to right now
but still we need to kind of distribute
these later on the first thing I want to
do though is set the row height or
rather the minimum height of the row so
I'm going to use a property called grid
- Auto - rose to do that and remember we
can use min max to say
the minimum height of a rope is gonna be
100 pixels and then the maximum height
of the rope is gonna be auto so
determined by the content within it so
if I save this now you can see the row
takes on the height of 100 pixels at the
minute all right cool now I want to set
a grid gap so I'll say grid
- gap is gonna be 10 pixels just solve
it between each column and each row
we're gonna get this little tempest or
gap as well awesome
now what I would like to do is position
these different things right here inside
these twelve columns so let's do these
one at a time let's start with the
header I'm going to come underneath this
rule right here and say header and then
inside I'm going to use a grid - column
remember we can use this to distribute
our elements into a certain column if
you like so we say the start point and
the end point now we've created 12
columns right here I remember when we
talked about column lines there's always
one more column line then there is
columns if you like right so the
starting point is gonna be in the first
column line at the very start and then
the end point is gonna be at 13 which is
after the 12th column so save that now
and we can see the header goes full
width across the top that's what we want
we want it to span all 12 columns cool
so now the next one the next tag is main
so let's come underneath and say main
and then I would like this to start
maybe at line 4 so 1 2 3 roundabout here
live for ya and go all the way to the
end so we'll say grid - column is going
to be from line 4 and it's gonna go up
to the end which is 13 so let's save
that see what it looks like okay so it's
going from line for now over here all
the way to line 13 so it's taking up
this right portion of the the wrapper so
I also wanted to take up more height
than it is currently doing it's just
taking up one row in height at the
minute it's starting at line 2 remember
line 1 is at the top line 2 is here and
it's finishing at line 3 I want to take
this down to line 4 roundabout here okay
so we'll use grid - row to do this one
and we'll say it starts at number 2
where it currently
and it's going to go all the way to line
four so that doubles it in height now
and our main content is gonna go here
all right what's next let's do the aside
so underneath this we'll set aside and
inside that was a grid
- column and I want this to go from the
very start over here yeah all the way up
to here which is line for remember one
two three four so it's going to take up
this base right here so we'll say grid -
column is gonna go from 1 to 4 save that
and a few it and we can see it's right
here like so okay now this section is
currently above it right here but if you
take a look down here that's because
section comes first now I said that we
can place elements wherever we want on
the grid without worried about the order
of them in here and in actual fact I
don't want this section to go right here
we're gonna move it so we'll say section
and inside here I'm gonna say grid -
column first of all and I'm gonna say I
want this to go from 1 all the way to 13
so it's going to be full width right so
one is all the way on the left and then
13 all the way on the right so he's
going to be full width now I want to set
the row so I wanted to go underneath the
main content and go full width all the
way across here now row column rather
row line 1 is at the top
2 is here 3 is here and 4 is here so I
want it to start at roll out 4 and I
want it to end
not at 5 but at 6 down here so let us
say grid - row it's gonna start at 4 and
it's gonna go all the way to 6 so say
that and we can see now the section is
down here and the aside has moved back
up awesome so now let's do nav or say
nav right there and I'm just going to
define grid - column on this one because
I don't need to change is correct row
position which is right here I just want
to take it from this line over here to
line 4 which is right here so we'll say
grid - column it's gonna go to water
from 1 to 4 save that and view it in a
browser and we can see that's in the
correct place now also
so now we have the footer right at the
bottom which is the last tag and we want
this to kind of go for width as well so
we'll say footer is gonna go from grid -
column 1 all the way
oops one on the way to 13 save that I
spans full width now awesome so now
we've distributed these different
elements on a 12 column grid but I want
to show you one more trick now which is
going to enable you to visualize your 12
column grid system with all the
different columns and column lines on
top of this kind of overlay right so
what I'm gonna do to do this is come
inside this div right here inside the
grid itself and I'm gonna create a div
inside it with an ID equal to grid right
so this is gonna be our grid overlay and
inside here what I'm gonna do is just
create a series of P tags and there's
gonna be 12 P tags in total now I'm not
gonna write them all out which is going
to paste them in so it'd have to boyar
and each of these P tags is gonna
represent a column and the grid if you
like and we're going to star these in
such a way that they'll represent a
column on top of this so you'll be able
to see all of the columns so to do that
let's come up here and the first thing
I'd like to do is set the position of
this wrap around here content to
relative because we're going to position
this dude down here
as absolute and we're going to position
it to the top left corner of this grid
right here okay so we starts in the top
left so let's give this a position first
of all of relative then what I'd like to
do is create a rule for this grid right
here so underneath I'll say grid and
inside that we want to display this as
grid and the reason we want to display
this as grid is because we want to split
it up into 12 columns and each one of
these is going to be distributed onto
one of those columns right that makes
sense
cool so after we've done that we want to
position this grid absolutely source a
ABS
a loop for the position and it's gonna
be at the top zero and left zero so it's
gonna start in the top left of this
wrapper right here okay
now I want to define our columns now
I'll say grid - templates - columns and
there's gonna be 12 in total because
it's a 12 column grid system we're
working with here so we'll say repeat 12
times 1fr so it's exactly the same is
the actual grid we've created for this
so 12 columns are the same width on
fraction now let's do a grid - Otto -
rows and this is gonna be min Max and
the minimum is going to be 100% in
height right and auto for max now this
means that it's going to take up 100%
height of its parent element which is
this thing right here so that means that
every element which kind of represents a
column on the grid is gonna be seen in
full height overlaying this thing right
here it's gonna be full height of the
actual grid that looks within this thing
makes sense cool so once we've done that
we want to say the width of this overall
element this grid right here is going to
be 100 percent so that expands the
entire width of the actual grid it's in
our content okay and then I'm gonna say
height is gonna be 100% as well then I'm
gonna set the background to be
transparent how do we spell this they
always struggle that's right okay and
that's because up here we said that
every element directly a descendant of
grid has a background of blue now I
don't want that for this grid thing
right here so I'm overriding it by
saying it has a background of
transparent yeah it's also going to have
a padding of 0 will strip out any of
that and we won't put in display:none
yet but we will do later so if I save
this at the minute view over here you're
not going to see much even if we refresh
there's nothing much going on yet and
that's because nothing is kind of
styling these P tags you ever created
this grid and all of the columns but we
need to style these P tags so we can
actually see them so if I say now
grid pee and then underneath this we're
gonna give each one of these P tags a
border of one pixel and solid then we're
going to give each one in background of
zero zero zero which is black then a
margin of zero to strip out the default
margin and we're gonna get and we're
gonna set the opacity to these P tags to
be zero point two because we don't just
want to see black columns we want them
to be semi-transparent so we can see
through them where the content is so if
we save this now you can see this grid
system overlaying the content so we can
see how many columns different elements
take up and where they are on the page
so if you have your design to the right
in Photoshop or whatever you can kind of
match it up and you can use these
columns right here to overlay the
content to make sure that everything is
the same if you like and it's just a
good kind of visualization of your grid
now and now all of the time when you're
creating your design you don't always
want this thing here so you want
something - maybe toggle it on and off
which is what I'm going to show you how
to do now there quickly so it's a
chocolate I'm going to create some kind
of check box I'm going to put the check
box just above the content it doesn't
need to be inside the grid so I'll say
input type is going to be equal to check
box so the idea is that when this is
checked then we will show the grid when
it's not checked we won't show the grid
right so by default we don't show the
grid so this grid right here we want to
set display to not so it doesn't show by
default and the idea is when this is
checked we want to show it when we
uncheck it we don't show it okay so we
can use a CSS trick to do that I'm going
to come down here and I'm going to say
input which is this thing right here and
then a pseudo selector checked so this
detects when that input box is checked
then I'm going to use a sibling selected
to say the next sibling and that's going
to be content so when this is checked
grab the content div which is right here
then I want you to grab the grid within
it and display
as bloc make sense so by default it
doesn't display but when this is checked
while this will be true input checked
then we grab the content then we grab
the grid inside it and we display it as
block when it's checked so save that
check it out in a browser and we check
it and it shows but something's not
quite right and stupidly that's because
I've displayed it as block and not grid
we don't want it to display it as block
we need it as a grid wrapper so I'll
save that and check it out now okay cool
so now when we check it we can see the
grid overlaying the content and when we
uncheck it we don't see it awesome
so that my friends is how to create a 12
column grid system in the next video I'm
going to show you how to create a mosaic
layout using CSS grid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
