PSD to HTML and CSS lesson 3 and in this
video we're going to take a look at the
overall HTML structure Wow alright so
before we touch any code I just wanted
to point you in the direction of this
website it's brackets IO and basically
this is the text editor that I'm going
to be using for this playlist it's a
really good one it's completely free as
well so I suggest you go there and
download it alright now it's just this
big blue download button here and it's
going to download the brackets version
you need for your computer so once
you've downloaded that install it and
I'll meet you on the other side
all right then going so I'm here in
brackets and if you remember from the
last lesson I created this folder called
website and then within it I've got an
images folder where we saved all of our
PSD images that we need and I've got
this index dot HTML file which is a
completely blank that's also at the root
of the document now what I like to do
when I start a mock-up or a PSD to HTML
project is first of all get all of the
HTML document structure down first and
then I do the CSS if I need to make
tweaks to the HTML later I'll just come
back in and do that so what I've done is
got the PSD open up here on the right as
well and I've just made little sections
here with coloured boxes and the first
section is this one right at the top
that's the header section okay so we're
going to put that in a section of its
own because it would be on every page I
imagine the next section right here is
the banner so we'll do that next and
then finally we have this main content
here and each of these three sections
one two three is within that main
content alright but the first thing we
need to do is create our overall HTML
document outline and that includes first
of all writing the doctype tag which is
just open and we'll bracket and then
exclamation mark type in capitals and
then just hate you map that's the new
html5 doctype and that's all you need to
write okay then we'll write our HTML
tags like that then we need a head
attack where we're going to put on the
title and link up any kind of CSS that
we need
then we'll do a body tag like that and
then within the head we're just going to
do a title tag for now and it's called
green design and remember the title tag
controls what you see at the top on one
of the tubs in your internet browser
right so next thing we need to do is go
into the body we'll add the CSS file in
later by the way go to the body and
we'll start doing these sections now the
first thing we want is this header and
html5 actually has a new tag called
header which is more semantic so we'll
use that instead of writing a div tag
and then after the header we've got this
banner area now we could use again one
of html5 s new tags called section but I
don't really think that wants a section
tag instead we'll just use a div for
this but I'm going to give it an ID of
lead banner like that okay the next
section we've got is the main content
which holds all of these bits here so
we'll just do a div tag for that we'll
give it an ID as well of main content
right and I've given these both IDs
because both of these only appear once
on the page if they were to appear twice
or more times I'd give them a class now
within the main content we've got these
three sections right and for this I am
going to use the new html5 tag section
so let's create the first one I'm not
gonna give these IDs just yet I'll just
write the tax oops and then finally the
last one perfect and then we're gonna
save it there for now so if you have any
questions about this lesson whatsoever
feel free to comment down below I'll
answer all of those otherwise guys if
