11th get and guitar tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
collaborate on github alright so in the
last tutorial I showed you how to set up
a remote repository on github and we
also cloned that repository onto our
computer so that the two were in sync so
we had one computer one local version of
our repository and we also had a remote
version of that repository and we could
push our changes from the local version
up to the remote repository make sense
now that's all cool but I don't really
show you how we'd work in a team on
github we only add me on the local
computer and then the remote version on
github so there's just one of me pushing
to it now there's only one of me so I
can't show you exactly how all four of
us would work on a team but what I'm
going to do is what you through a
typical workflow that I'd given the
office if I was working on github on a
project with about three or four other
people so then in the last tutorial we
made this repo on github
they're crap portfolio and it's just got
a couple of files in at the minute and
we cloned this repository to our local
computer so now I want you to imagine
that this is the project that I'm going
to be working on in an office with maybe
three or four of the developers and what
all using this remote repository okay so
I've got this repository already cloned
to my desktop and we can see that right
here there's nothing much in it at the
minute but say I come into the office
and I've got some new work to do in this
project the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to make a pull to keep my
files locally up-to-date with the remote
repository just in case any of the other
developers has made any changes so to do
that what I'm going to say is make sure
I'm a master first of all master branch
because that's what I wonder to then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to a
git pull and then it'll say the origin
because that's the alias we're pulling
from that's how a remote repository and
then we're going to pull the master
branch so what I get pull does is it
fetches all of the cold from the remote
and then it merges it into our master
branch because that's what we've said
right here mustard right and we're on
the master branch so it's going to pull
the master branch from the remote into
the master branch onto our local and
update
all of the files in this case no one's
made any other changes and everything's
already up to date so that's fine but I
do that just in case the word changes
that other people have made
in the meantime cool so what all
up-to-date now the next thing I'd do if
I was working on a new feature is I
check out a new branch because we want
to preserve the state of this muster
branch we don't want to edit it and
potentially mess it up so to do that I'm
going to say git checkout then - be for
a new branch and what I've checked out
is a branch called index.html all right
because I'm going to work on this HTML
page over here so imagine now oops
I've stopped checkout run so let's just
go back and correct that that's right
cool so what on this new branch now and
what I'm going to do is pad out this
hick to your mail file so what I'm not
going to do is just write out all of the
hipster muffin scratch I'm just going to
paste this in right because I'm sure you
all already know HTML anyway this is
just some simple HTML to make a
portfolio site so all that's done now
I'm going to save it and I'm not going
to add an S on the end I'm going to save
it and what I'm going to do is add this
to the staging area so we say get add
and then I'll say get permits because
we're going to commit to this branch the
message is going to be a dude index
takes the amount so we've made that
commit and now what we want to do is
take this code and we want to push it
back up to the remote repository now
what we don't do first of all is merge
this into the master branch locally and
then push up the master branch because
if we do that it's just going to
override the master branch on the remote
repository and the rest of my developers
and my manager might not be pleased with
that because they might not agree with
the code I've done ideally what we want
to do is push this branch up to the
remote so that my peers my other
colleagues and my manager can review
that code and then they can all decide
if we want to merge this into the master
branch on the remote repository so that
everyone then can download and pull from
the master branch on the remote
repository to update their local files
makes sense so what we're going to do is
push up this branch so to do that I'm
going to say git push and then we're
going to origin and then the branch name
that I want to push up is indexed
first HTML all right so that is going to
push up this branch and we should get
feedback in a second cool so that's all
done and now we can check out the github
repository so you can see right here is
auto updating already so that's really
cool and what I'm going to do is click
this button and compare and pull request
which means we're going to compare the
differences between these changes and
the current state of the master branch
and we can then make a pull request
which means we want to merge it into the
master branch on this repository so I'm
going to do that first of all and on the
next page this is the message we added
to the commit which is cool we can also
leave a comment which is good practice
you want to explain exactly what you've
done so other developers in your manager
can read that and it's explicit then
what we can do is create these pull
requests so I'm going to create this
pull request and that means I'm putting
in a request that I want to merge this
branch into the master branch on this
repository right so when I do this all
the developers are going to get like a
ping or a notification and they're going
to come to this and they can review it
and we can assign reviewers right here
currently I'm working on my own boohoo
but if you were working in a team other
people would show here and you could
assign one of those to review your code
so they could come down here they could
read this and it says this branch has no
conflicts with the base branch so
merging can be performed automatically
that's cool so there's going to be no
conflicts if we merge into my sphere
that's always a good sign now if they
wanted to write a comment about this
code it could do that here and I'll just
put good work because it is good work
and then also what they could do is they
could go down and by the way that
comment goes there you could go down
here though rather they could go up here
and they could see the commits that I've
made and the files that have changed so
you can come in here and all the green
stuff is stuff that I've added in red
stuff is stuff I've deleted so they can
see all the changes in the code right
there and if you wanted to you could add
in a comment here line by line okay so
if there's something they don't agree
with you can add in the comment there
I'll just put I don't like spam text but
what else okay and then we'll just add a
single comment so we can do that and
then if we're all happy with it we can
go back to
Mustard's to the the requests area and
we can merge this pull request right so
if we merge it and confirm merge what
that's going to do is take this branch
that I've uploaded and it's going to
pull it or rather merge it into the
master branch right so now if we wanted
to we can delete the branch as well
because it's already been merged and
then if we go now to crack portfolio to
see the code we're going to see this
index this is the master branch we're on
updating so now we've updated the master
branch cool right okay so imagine a few
hours later someone has been on to the
code and they've seen that I've missed
out the images and they say hey you need
to put these images in can you reload
this so I say okay well whatever what
I'm going to do is start a new branch
but remember before I start in your
feature
I always need to pull down the master
branch just in case anyone's made any
changes so what I'm going to do is go to
get checkout muster to check out the
master branch and then what I'm going to
do is say git pull origin master okay
now this time it is going to pull
something down and we can see we've got
changes now so it's updated the index
page and someone's made a change as well
so the change I made in the last section
where I uploaded that branch has come
down and also someone else has made a
change to this title as well so we've
updated that it's always good practice
to update the master branch first of all
to pull down and then what we're going
to do is check out a new branch for this
new image feature so let's say git
checkout and then - basis a new branch
and then image update okay so now what
we're going to do is we're going to add
in the images so we'll right click over
here and we'll go to new folder I'm
going to save image and I'm just going
to drag in fact we'll rename this to
call it assets ok and then what I'm
going to do is just drag these images in
now I've already made these images and
now you can see all of these things
right here ok so now what we can do is
we can say git add that's going to add
everything they'll just say git commit
and then the message added images and
you can see all those have been updated
there now what we're going to do is push
this to the remote repository so
they'd git push origin and then the
branch name was image update so oMG
update click enter cool so that's now
all done so I can check out the remote
repo and if we come over here we can see
that branch so again I'll compare and
pull and you can write a comment in here
if you want to and what I'm going to do
is create this pull request and then we
can see the files changed over here if I
were to review or the manager come over
here see all these different images that
have been uploaded I'm not going to wait
for those too low because my internet is
really bad at the minute some reason
anyway go back so those files have been
added so I notice that ones missing so I
can say hey can you add the missing
image right so I'll comment that there
so I want this person to add the missing
image before we merge this request okay
so what I do is I go back to my code and
I notice I am in fact missed an image
out down here so I don't need to switch
branches I'm gonna stay on the same
branch because we've not merged it or
anything yet what I'm going to do is
drag in at the last image that I missed
and then what I'll do is say git add and
then I'll say git commit and I'm the
message is going to be added last image
then I'll do a git push again go to
origin and still the same branch because
we're still on the same branch I am
Jenny propagate so we're just pushing
further commit basically to the same
branch on github alright so now that
commits been pushed into get up I can go
and check out the remote repository and
we can see right here added last image
so that new commit has appeared on this
timeline down here so I can just review
that over here if I wanted to and it
says this page is out of date or refresh
because there's now an extra file
changed so now it says eight files
changed and now we can see all of those
files down here so as the manager now
I'm completely happy with this and I'm
happy to merge this into the master
branch so I'm going to merge this pull
request which is going to take all of
these images and add them into the
master branch I can delete the branch if
I
- you don't have to dilute the brand by
the way and you can keep it so you can
refer to it in the future but I'm going
to delete it in this case so if we go to
the code now you can see what on the
master branch and we can see now this
assets folder with all the images inside
it ok so that's how I typically do
things on github if I was working on a
project with different colleagues
because then as I'm pushing up these
branches and merging the branches what
my other colleagues would be doing is
pulling down from the master branch so
any updates that I've done emerged
they're going to get in their local
repository and they're doing that all
updates and pushing them up to github on
their own branches maybe I'm reviewing
them maybe and managers reviewing them
and we're merging them so while getting
these different updates and we can all
work on things at the same time really
easily so that's kind of like the basics
of collaborating in a team what I want
to do in the next tutorial is talk about
forking which is something you'd maybe
do if you wanted to contribute to some
kind of open source project moving so
we'll go through that in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
