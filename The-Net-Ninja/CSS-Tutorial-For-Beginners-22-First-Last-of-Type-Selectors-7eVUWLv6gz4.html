yo guys what the hell is going on
this is CSS for beginners lesson 22 and
in this video we're going to talk all
about the first and last of type pseudo
classes that's coming right up
ah ok then so here I am back in the HTML
file and I've kept up the rule to use
last time when we talked about first
child and last child because I want to
demonstrate how that now I've changed
the HTML they're not going to work and
I've changed the HTML in this way in
each article I've added at the top h2
and that's going to be the article title
and then at the bottom of each article
about this HR tag which remember is a
horizontal rule and that's going to add
a line at the bottom of each article to
kind of separate them so in the last
video we tried targeting the first child
and the last child P tags now this isn't
going to work anymore now that I've
added these extra tags and this is why
the P we wanna tag is this and it's no
longer the first child the first child
is this 82 and this is now the second
child likewise at the end this is no
longer the worst child the last child is
this HR okay this is the second-to-last
child so how do we get around this well
we can use what's called the first of
type and last the type okay
and even though this is not the first
child this P tag here within the article
it's the first child of that type and by
that tag I mean the first P okay it's a
that this you know there's four P tags
here and this is the first of that type
the type is P and that's the first of
them does that make sense
so we can still target that using the
first of type pseudo class and this is
how we write it we keep our basic select
to the same article P because that's
going to have to every P in an article
and then we hold it down by adding the
pseudo class with a colon and then the
keyword of first of type and then
separated by hyphens there in there and
then like I said that grabs the first P
within the article which is this so we
can still do it and likewise the last of
type P is here
because the last P within the article
that makes sense here so again we can
still target disk with a pseudo class by
having our simple selector grabbing all
the peas then adding out coal on to say
pseudo classes coming up and then adding
the keyword last - of - type it's as
simple as that guys that's all we do so
I'm going to save this and we'll view it
in a browser just to make sure it's
worked show this in Google Chrome okay
and absolutely no change from last time
we've got our article titles here we've
got our horizontal horizontal rules here
and here
splitting up the articles but we're
still managing to target this first P
and this last P okay so that's really
cool the fact that not only have we got
first child and last child but if all
the elements are getting in the way
we've got first of tank and last of type
to fall back on and if this doesn't work
then there is another way I'm not going
to cover that here I'm going to cover
that in the next lesson that's called
the nth child selector okay so we're
going to take a look at that in the next
video in the meantime if you have any
comments or questions about these two
pseudo classes then feel free to comment
below I'm going to try and answer all of
those as soon as I can
otherwise please like share subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
