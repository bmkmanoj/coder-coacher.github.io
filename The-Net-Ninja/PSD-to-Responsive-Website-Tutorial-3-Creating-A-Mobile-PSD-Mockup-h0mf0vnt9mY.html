your third PSD to responsive website
tutorial and in this video we're going
to create a mobile mock-up in the PSD
file ah
alright then so as you can see I've got
the PSD file open or right here again
and what we're going to do in this
tutorial is create a simple mock-up for
our mobile design view now you can skip
this step if you want I like to do it
because I like to have a visual as to
where I'm heading with the code to make
our website not responsive now it
doesn't have to be pixel perfect or
spot-on or anything like that we're just
going to do it to give us some kind of
visual guide as to where we're heading
alright so to do that I'm going to go to
file and then new and then I'm going to
choose the width to be about 400 native
pixels because that's going to catch all
the different Mobile's I can remember
remain at 3,000 that will give us enough
room so that is going to be the baseline
for our mobile design then I'm going to
go to this little icon right here this
lets us see this one two screens in one
window so if I do that we can see this
on the left I'm going to move that to
the row and then we've got this on the
left now let's just zoom out a little
bit if we can there we go
alright so now that we just want to
start transferring some stuff over to
the right and on the right I'm going to
zoom it so we can see a little bit more
alright another so first of all let's
get this gray bar know you want to do is
click and drag it literally that's all
I'm doing and then we'll have this
marble thing right there something like
that okay
then what I want to do is create a
little rectangle here that's going to be
like a dark grey something like that and
this is going to be for the mobile
navigation just there like that okay
we're going to put a little burger nav
icon on that in a minute but for now
let's just start dragging some washed-up
across this is the banner so let's put
that at the bottom right there something
like that and I'm just going to resize
it because it is a bit big so let's do
it like that okay something like that
will do
all right and then we need these icons
down here now they're for across in a
row on desktop but as it gets smaller
they're going to have to start stacking
up so what I'm going to do is just get
this icon right here and that one which
is the light bulb yep and then we need
to find the text which is this one and
this one so we'll ctrl click to get them
all like or not that one
now we don't need that this one and this
one so now we've controlled click all
those layers if we just click on one of
them we can drag them all across like
that okay so I'm just going to hold
shift down while I make this a bit
bigger like that okay now we're going to
want four of these and instead of
dragging them all across like that what
I'm going to do is just group those into
a folder and I'll call it a POS point of
sale then I'm go right click and I'm
going to go to duplicate group like that
and then I'm going to click the V icon
to get the arrow then a hold down shift
and press down like that and it's just
going to move it all the way down then
we're going to do exactly the same I'll
just duplicate the group again and hold
shift and bring it down and you get the
point here you know we're just stacking
them up one on top of the other do it
one more time because we've got four in
total and I'll move that down again and
you'll notice I'm not being really
peculiar with the ax or really
particular with the spacing between them
because I'll control that all in the CSS
later they're all going to be equal
later I just want this to be a rough
visual guide and so now we've done that
we can do our latest works which can go
around about here let's just make that a
little bit bigger like that something
like that okay perfect then we've got
these things which are going to go below
it and then the title let's just move
over to this one the title there like
that
I'll lit it up so that's a different one
delete that this one we want okay
perfect
and then some stuff underneath it and
blahdy blahdy blah I'm not going to do
all three of these you just have to
imagine it's going to be three stacked
on top of each other because like I said
this doesn't need to be perfect I'm not
going to pass this off to a client or
anything this is for our own benefit so
after that we've got this little gray
bar with the quote in which I'm going to
put roundabout there that's going to be
after all three of these images that
stacked on top of each other
we'll grab that little thing there that
little icon and also the text which will
just get into let's say do that and go
down here and do it again just so it
fits in I think that will be fine all
right perfect so that's how that is
going to look roughly then finally we've
got the footer down here and to be
honest what we're going to do I'm not
going to drag all the different things
over I'm just going to drab drag one
column because you'll get the idea
because each column is going to be one
after another so get in touch is going
to be first and then we've got all this
jars right here bloody bloody blur let's
just make this a little bit bigger
perfect okay so you get the idea it's
just going to go down in the footer like
that so if i zoom out a little bit now
you can see that this is going to be the
general kind of baseline of our mobile
design okay and you'll notice that none
of the actual content is going to change
from this to this and the odd is going
to be pretty similar as well so that's
why I'm doing this I'm doing it in such
a way that it's going to make our HTML
easy to code because we're not going to
have to write two sets one for desktops
and one for mobiles
we've still got exactly the same content
and it's in pretty much the same order
one two three four one two three four
one two three one two three it's going
to be and then this and then this okay
logo at the top then the navigation then
the banner all the same order pretty
much so we can keep our hasty map
exactly the same for desktop as we would
for mobile that's important because then
we'd have to repeat ourselves in the
HTML which is pretty much bad practice
these days because that's duplicate
content
okay so there's just one more thing to
do and that is just to add a little
burger
icons just three little bars like that
onto the mobile our menu now I've
already created one I'm just going to go
to file and then place and that's going
to place an image into this PSD on the
right and there it is the Bergen app so
I'm just going to pop that up there one
second let's just press ENTER and you
can see that little icon right now I'll
zoom in a little bit alright now it is
so to do that all I've done guys is just
create three little gray bars using this
tool right here the rectangle tool then
I'll go to the color up here choose a
color for it and I'll just create three
little gray bars like that on top of
each other okay so that's all there is
to it and if you double click this well
you won't be able to because you've not
got it but if I double click it it's a
smart object so I'll just double click
that little going to the source file
right there and you can change it but
all you want to do is just add it
directly on to your PSD file here
alright so that is it now guys that is
roughly the kind of thing we're going
for on mobiles
ok so dead simple now we've got a kind
of visual cue or a visual guide as to
where we're heading with these mobile
styles so in the next tutorial what
we're going to do is dive right into the
text editor we're going to start coding
up the HTML for this web page I'll see
