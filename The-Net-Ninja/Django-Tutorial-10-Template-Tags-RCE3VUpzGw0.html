tutorial and in this video I'm going to
show you how we can insert Python logic
and data into our templates using
template tags all right and so now we
have our article model up and running
and we've created a few instances of the
article model and store those in a
database I think it's time that we can
retrieve those articles and show them on
the front end so that when someone goes
to forward slash articles they don't
just see this rubbish h1 on a page but
instead they see a list of articles that
are inside our database so what we need
to do is reach out to our database in
our code grab those articles send those
articles to the HTML template and
dynamically output them so we user can
see them so there's a couple of steps in
doing this the first thing we want to do
is head over to our views file because
this is the function that is controlling
what's happening when a user visits
forward slash articles right so the
first thing I want to do is import the
article class into this file so to do
that I need to say from Doc's models
which means from the current directory
get the models file then I want to
import from that the article class ok so
we saw it using the jungle RM a couple
of tutorials about how we can use this
model to interact with the database to
grab all of the records inside the
article table so first of all I'm going
to create a variable called articles to
store these in you can call this
whatever you like and we're going to set
that equal to article dots objects dot
all remember this grabs all of the
records from this article database table
now
they also want to do is tack on another
method right here and you don't have to
do this I'm just going to do this and
this method is called order underscore
by and this takes a parameter and it
lets us order the records that come back
so they're not in just a random order we
can order them by something and we can
order them by anything is defined here
now I want to order them by date so that
the newest comes first so to do that all
we need to do is passing the string and
pass in the name of that field which is
date all right so when it retrieves all
of these objects all of these records
from the article table it's going to
order them by date so that when we
output them during date order all right
so that's our views file sorting now
well we need to do one more thing sorry
when we render the template right here
what we want to do is send this data to
the template so we can output that data
to the template does that make sense we
want to output all of those articles so
we can actually pass through a third
parameter to this render function right
here and this third parameter is going
to be the data that we want to send to
the view or to the template rather so
inside curly braces we're going to make
an a dictionary right here and the
property is going to be called articles
that's what we want to send along and
that's going to be equal to
articles this thing right here so what
we're doing is creating a dictionary
that we're going to send to the template
we're attaching a property called
articles you can name this whatever you
want you can call it art if you want
just make sense to call it articles and
we're setting that equal to what we've
just retrieved right here so now when
we're rendering this template what we
can do is actually output this data
okay so let's now go into the template
if I go into article under scroll list
I want to output that data inside this
template and we can do that using
template tags in Django
alright and template tags are a way for
us to output some kind of Python code
inside this template and therefore we
could output data right so now we're
receiving this data right here inside
here and we have access to it inside
this template so how do we then output
it
first of all let me just create a div
is going to have a class of articles and
we're going to store all of our articles
inside here right now we might have one
article we might have ten articles we
don't know how many we have so what I'd
like to do is create some kind of for
loop to cycle through all of the
articles and output each one so we can
do that using template tags in jungle
and a template tag is going to be a
curly brace and then it's going to be a
percentage sign that our code goes in
the middle and then a percentage sign
close your curly brace at the end now
there's two types of template tags
there's this one for writing Python code
but not output in any kind of data and
then every one output data we use double
curly braces and output the data okay so
this is the data this is just for Python
code like for loops so I want to do a
for loop first of all so I'm going to
say for articles or rather article in
articles so this is just like a standard
Python for loop and remember this
article's refers to this thing right
here that we're sending down so we're
going to cycle through these and each
time around each iteration round we're
going to have access to that article
okay
now to end this for loop what I need to
do is open up my template tags again and
say end four and then close those okay
so this for loop is going to be
outputting something inside here for
each article now I want to output a div
with a class of article or each single
article inside this collection okay so
each article is going to have a title so
for that will do at h2 and inside it's
going to have an anchor tag so I'll do
an anchor tag as well we don't know what
the link is going to be yet but when we
click on this it's going to go through
to an article detail page late it down
the line but we want to output the
article title right here so double curly
braces because we're outputting data and
it's article title
remember title is the name of the
property on the model right so without
putting that here
so the next thing we want to do is
output the article body so let's do a
pee tag and then output the article dot
body all right and let's do one more
which is going to output the date so
double curly braces article dot date and
save that all right so what we're doing
we're sending all of these articles that
were retrieved right here down to the
view as this third parameter this
dictionary and we can add more
parameters or more properties inside
here if we wanted to but we just have
one at the minute but we're sending down
these articles therefore we have access
to articles inside this for you so using
some template tags we've used a for loop
to say okay for each article in those
articles you've sent down because I have
access to them here but each one I'm
going to output a div with a class of
article and inside that div they'll be a
h2 with the article title and it's
double curly braces because we're
outputting data this time alright to the
user then we want the article body then
the article date okay so we've saved all
that now hopefully when we enter on here
it's going to update and we see those
three different articles now that we
have stored in our database how awesome
is that
now obviously at the minute if we click
on this it's not going to do anything
because we didn't input this H ref
attribute and the minute is just a pound
sign and we'll come to that later on
when we see how to create an article
details page then we can link to but for
now this is fine what we're doing is
dynamically outputting all of these
articles that we have stored in our
database and that is awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
