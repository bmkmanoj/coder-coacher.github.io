through some of the benefits that I
think CSS variables have over SAS
variables and less variables now the
first most obvious one to me is the SAS
unless both have to be transpiled into
CSS for it to work
CSS doesn't have to be transpiled into
CSS that doesn't make sense so that's
one less thing to do for a start now
because sass and less both have to be
transpiled
into CSS for the browser to understand
it that brings forward another advantage
that CSS has over these two technologies
and that is that we can edit the
variables directly inside the browser so
a lot of the time when I'm working on a
website what I like to do is create some
kind of base layout for the website and
then edit the CSS inside the browser and
I do that through the dev tool so you
can open those up in chrome using f12 or
right click and then going to inspect
and that's going to bring up the dev
tools where we see all the different
elements here and I can go into the
sources panel to see my Styles right
here so we can see both of these
variables declared right here now if we
were using sass or less then that would
have been transpired into regular CSS
which the browser understands and we
wouldn't actually see the sass and the
less variables here they'd all just be
applied to the different elements so in
CSS we can't see our CSS custom
properties of variables right here and
we can change them on the fly inside
this console right here so if I am
editing the website through this console
the developer tools which I like to do
then I can change the variables easily
inside it okay I can do that very very
easily now sass unless don't allow you
to do that they don't allow you to
change the variables because it needs to
be transpiled so if we were to change
the variables in sass and less inside
the browser then that would it reflect
over here it wouldn't change the
properties that use those variables I
hope that makes sense to find out more
about sass by the way I do have a whole
series on that on this channel I'll
the link down below so anyway that's
another benefit that CSS our variables
have over sass and less variables okay
so what else can they do
well the next thing they can do is they
can be used inside media queries so we
can't do this with less offsets we can't
use different variables inside media
queries and override them for example if
we had in sass a variable like this
theme color we can't say well okay if we
make a media query here if we say
something like app media screen' and max
width and it's going to be seven sixty
pixels we can't say in sass or less that
inside this media query we want to
override those variables but we can do
that inside CSS variables so to go
through this example what I'd like to do
is focus on these things down here so
these three little blurbs they are
controlled via CSS grid at the minute
okay so we have this grid template
columns which is laying them out in
three columns like so and each column
takes at one fraction of the width which
is why they're all equal length now for
example if I want to store this in a
variable I would cut it from here I'm
gonna reference the variable here so
double dash and we'll call it something
like layouts and save that now we need
to make that variable at the top so if
we come here and say double dash layout
and set that equal to this thing one fr1
if I wanna fire and save it then if we
refresh then nothing it should happen at
the minute it's still using that layout
but it's also using that layout on
smaller screens so if we go down to
something which is less then 760 pixels
it's still using that layout now if I
want to override this layout variable
inside a media query which is saying the
max width should be 760 pixels so the
screens less than this if I want to
override it I can do using CSS variable
something that would be hard to do using
less so again this
has to be declared inside a selector we
can't just put the layout here and
expect it to work we have to use a
selector so I use the route selector
again open it up and inside will place
this layout variable like so so now what
we're saying is when the screen reaches
760 pixels or less in width then I want
to override the layout variable and
instead of being one of our one of our
one if our it's just gonna be one fr one
fraction each so they should all stack
on top of each other and you can learn
more about CSS grid on my youtube
channel as well I've got a whole series
for that so if we refresh then for large
screens we see no difference because the
variable is still this thing right here
but as we go down into smaller screens
we can see when it reaches 760 pixels it
changes that variable and the layout
becomes this right here so each element
now is one fraction of the whole width
it takes up the whole width so that's a
really cool thing about CSS variables we
can easily override them inside media
queries something that's a bit more
difficult to do in sass and less okay so
the last benefit I want to show you is
that we can also scope CSS variables we
can override them in certain selectors
so for example right here we have the
link color which is this kind of yellow
over here this yellowy brown in the nav
and also down here in the content now if
we wanted to override that for a
particular area of the website for
example we don't want all links to be
that color for example we could say
inside there now if we want to override
that variable so it becomes black we can
do that we could say below routes the
inside the nav what we'd like to do is
override this a variable color so I'm
just gonna say nav and inside the - -
link - color is going to be instead
equal to zero zero zero which is black
save that now inside the nav that
variable has been overwritten so it uses
the black color instead but over here
and anywhere else on your site that you
use this variable
this link color variable it's going to
remain that brown yellow color okay so
this again would be really hard to do in
sus we'd probably have to employ the use
of mix ins or something to do that but
in CSS variables it is seriously simple
to do so for these reasons I prefer to
use CSS variables / SAS variables and
less variables where possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
