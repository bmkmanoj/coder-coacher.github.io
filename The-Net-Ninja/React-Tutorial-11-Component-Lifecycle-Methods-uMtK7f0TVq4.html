11:3 art tutorial and in this video i
want to talk about component lifecycle
okay then so in this code you can see
already within this component we have
two different functions right here get
initial state and rendered now these are
two lifecycle functions meaning they
happen at a particular point in time
during the life cycle of this component
they don't all just fire at once
react doesn't do that they fire it in a
particular order so in this case this
one getting it shall state fires before
render so getting this your state fires
and it sets up the state of the
component this data right here then
render fires and it renders this code to
the browser using this data okay so
there's many more different lifecycle
functions as well which make up the
component lifecycle and we're going to
explore a few of them in this tutorial
so first of all I want to talk about
mounting lifecycle functions and these
are just the functions that occur when a
component is mounted to the Dom okay so
the first one we've already seen is get
initial State and this I've spelled it
wrong by the way there but it is get
initial State and this sets the initial
state of the component is set at the
data we've seen that already so that's
the first function to fire then we have
the component will mount function and
we've not seen this yet and any
last-minute preparations we want to do
before the component is mounted to the
Dom we can do here okay so that's total
right before the render method and we've
already seen the render method we've
been working with it a lot during this
series this is the only one required
life cycle method in the component and
this returns HTML which is going to be
added to the Dom it's rendered to the
browser okay so that comes next then
finally we have component did mount so
after the render function fires and
everything is added to the Dom the
component did mount function if it is
within our component if we define it
within our component that fineness okay
and according to react this is a good
place to load in any external data from
a database or something like that so
there the mounting lifecycle functions
are
to look at those in the code in a second
but we also have some updates and
lifecycle functions which are quite
similar so first of all we have the
component will receive props method and
this is called before a component
receives any new props ok so we can use
it to compare the current and new props
that it's about to receive and change
the state if we need to then we have
should component update this again is
any kind of last-minute preparations or
we can also return false if we don't
want to update the component of a qatal
react no we're going to stop there ok so
that it won't fire these remaining
functions however if we don't return
false and we return true then we're
going to fire a component we'll update
next ok and again any last-minute preps
we can do in there before the component
is rendered which is the next life cycle
function for updating and then finally
we have component did update which is
similar to component did mount and in
here again we can operate on the Dom or
perform any Network request that we may
need it ok so there the different
lifecycle functions we also have
component will amount so that is kind of
like a daemon lifecycle function and
that occurs when a component is
unmounted from the Dom so we're going to
take a look at some of these lifecycle
functions not all of them because it
would take forever to look at all of
them but you can read more about them as
well on the react official documentation
I'll leave a link to a page with all the
descriptions for the different lifecycle
functions on them ok there so let's just
add in a couple of these different
lifecycle functions so I'm going to come
right down here to the bottom and do a
little comment this says lifecycle
functions and I'm going to keep this
dead simple
so under there what I want to do first
of all is say components will mount so
remember this function gets called just
before the component mounts the Dom okay
before the render method so in here all
I'm gonna do is say consult got log and
I'm gonna log what this function is
called component
we'll mounts okay so now we're going to
paste this tile rather copy it then
paste it down below and this time I'm
gonna say components did mount and
change this to did as well and remember
this is called directly after the render
method so after the render methods been
called and the component has been
mounted to the Dom then this will find
us okay and this is a good place for any
grabbing of external data okay
so then I'm gonna do one more I'm going
to say component will update set that
equal to a function and I'm gonna say in
here console.log component will update
okay so let's save this now and we'll
head over to the browser and just take a
quick refresh and this isn't working so
let's just quickly see what went wrong
okay it's because we have these little
semicolons inside here rocki mistake
save that dude now and now let's refresh
over here and hopefully we will see the
application okay so straight away we can
see component will mount and component
did mount they both get fired because
they are in the mounting lifecycle so
this got fired before the render method
then this gets fired after the component
mounts now let's try doing something
we'll take off one of these things and
you see this component will update is
fired as well so what updating the data
within this component therefore this is
firing and if they add a new one make
the bed then component will update fires
again so that is kind of like a simple
explanation of the lifecycle functions
and how we can use them within our
components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
