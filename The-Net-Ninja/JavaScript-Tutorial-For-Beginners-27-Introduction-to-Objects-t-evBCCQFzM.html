JavaScript for beginners lesson 27 and
in this video we're gonna have a quick
introduction to objects all right there
so javascript uses these things called
objects and you see objects in all
different programming languages but in
JavaScript we use a kind of
stripped-down simplified version of them
now we've already seen objects in
previous lessons that I've done for
example if I make a string that's an
object if I make a number that's an
object an array that's an object plus
loads of other different things in
JavaScript that are also objects now
essentially an object is just a
container which encloses data and
behavior together where they belong
together for example if I make an array
that's an object yeah and on that array
I can extract data such as the length
property and I can extract behavior such
as the salt function where we can sort
the array into a particular order or the
reverse function etc so I want you to
think of objects like real world objects
for example an object might be a car
right and a Carus properties such as its
color or its maximum speed but it's also
got behaviors such as driving or braking
or accelerating now in programming terms
these behaviors we'd call them methods
of the object and remember methods are
just functions so the behavior drive
would be a function of the car object
right so imagine a car was an object in
JavaScript right we could make a new car
and store it in a variable something
like this say my car equals new right
and that there would create a new
instance of the car object right now I
can't run this in JavaScript because we
don't have an object type of car if I
press ENTER there look car is not
defined but if we did have that object
type and we stored it in a variable
called my car then I could call
properties and methods on that variable
that we give to the car type right now
for example
my car dot length I could use dot
notation which is this here we put a dot
to the variable name and call properties
on it so it's just length or my car dots
max speed yeah and that's going to give
us the maximum speed of my car so we can
call properties on it using the dot
notation we could also call functions or
methods on the car which is going to
invoke the behavioral aspects of that
object such as my car dot drag and that
would call a function called drive on my
car or my car dots break right these
would be the behaviors or in JavaScript
as we call them the methods of this
object so notice how the methods have
these parentheses at the end and the
properties such as top speed don't that
is because these are all properties
they're all bits of information about
the car we're not running any kind of
method of function on the cloud we're
just extracting a bit of information so
we don't mean to call a function yeah
now if we say my car dog drive drive
would be a method or a function of that
car and we call functions remember by
putting the parentheses at the end and
then if we need to pass in any variables
or parameters or arguments as they're
called in JavaScript then we pass them
in here right such as I don't know 35
that might be how many miles per hour
we're going so that is how we would call
properties and methods of an object that
we create now imagine instead of car
right because that doesn't exist in
JavaScript we've not made that we make a
string we've seen that we can save our
my string equals new string and this is
exactly the same way we're creating the
car object up there okay so everything
applies so we've made this new string
and we can say my string equals hello
yeah we're just giving it books not that
put them in double quotation marks so
we've assigned that string an actual
stream now we can call properties on
this called length and that's going to
give us the length or we could say nice
string dot to lowercase and that's going
to convert it all to lowercase etc it
was already lowercase but if it wasn't
we would have done etc so this is
exactly the same as what we saw for the
car example okay so just think of
objects in JavaScript as objects outside
of JavaScript in the real world we can
do all the same kind of things to
objects in JavaScript as we can in the
real world right we can call properties
on it and methods so we've seen creating
an object this way a string object now
saying something like this my string 2
equals hi there that is exactly the same
as instantiating the my string object
right here is just a shorthand version
of it we're still creating a new string
object so we can still then call all the
same properties lengths or we can call
methods such as to uppercase etc we can
do all the same things with it it's just
that we've used the shorthand version
right there so that is a quick
introduction to what objects are in
JavaScript in the next lesson what we'll
do is we'll take this care I D and will
actually make an object called car so
that we can create a variable and we'll
give it some methods oops
methods and properties so if you have
any questions about this lesson feel
free to comment down below I'll answer
all of those otherwise guys I'll see you
