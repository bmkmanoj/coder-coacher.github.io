bootstrap full tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about boost up
utilities and typography okay so the
bootstrap library includes in it a
wealth of different utility classes that
we can use for things like colors
typography borders and tons more as well
so in this tutorial what we're going to
do is explore a few of them to make this
a rather boring looking Jumbotron that
we created in the last lesson a little
more eye-catching
so the first thing I want to do is show
you the documentation for the bootstrap
utilities so that you can just see how
much the library's us so I'm gonna leave
this link down below which is just the
bootstrap documentation then I'm gonna
go down to utilities down here which is
right there click on that and you can
see all these different utilities that
bootstrap provides us with so it's a big
kind of pool of tools that we have so
I'm not going to look at all of them in
this tutorial because that would make
the tutorial about 6 hours long instead
I'm just gonna pick up a few and then
you can explore the rest on your own and
we are going to be nipping back to the
utilities as we go through the rest of
the series as well so the first thing I
want to do is change the color of the
Jumbotron so currently it's like this
great color that's a very boring and
blonde I want to change it into a
slightly more vibrant color so let's go
to colors first of all and scroll down
and see if we can find anything on
background color and here we go these
are the different background colors
right here so I quite like the look of
this one this light blue so I'm gonna
take a look at the example and it's the
third one down one two three so we can
see that this has a class of BG standing
for but ground
- info so this is the way the bootstrap
likes to name the different styles
primary success information danger etc
and they all correspond to a different
kind of color alright so I quite like
the look of this one so I'm gonna grab
this thing right here BT info copy it
and I'm gonna paste it on our jumbotron
class right there so if I save this now
and check this out in a browser then now
we see this blue background which is a
lot better now personally I think the
black text doesn't stand up it doesn't
pop really on this blue color so I want
to make this white instead so if we take
a look at the colors again we can see
right here
where we used BG info it also has this
class of text - white which does this
thing it makes the text white so pretty
self-explanatory I'm going to copy this
and try it on our jumbotron to make sure
it works paste it in the class list
right there and check it out cool now we
have white text so already this is
looking a lot better so the next thing I
want to do is kind of liven up this text
make it a little bigger make it stand
out more so to do that I'm going to go
back to the bootstrap documentation go
up to the top and this time I'm just
going to go to content first of all and
then go to typography okay so this
section gives us a list of different
tools we can use for different type on
graffiti and you can see right here it
gives us some different headings like so
these are just h1 tags through to h6 and
it also gives us the class names of h1
through h6 to make them look like this
as well I like these things right here
display headings they look nice and
clean nice text and nice and big so I'm
going to use one of these classes
display one I think to get this kind of
style for my headings so I'm going to
just copy this class right here display
one and I'm going to go back to the code
that is what I want this text to be so
you'll find that it's this h1 we'll give
it a class equal to display - 1 save it
and check this out this is gonna look a
bit better now we have that large text
right there this is certainly looking
better so far we also want to make this
a little bigger because it looks a
little lost next to this big text so
let's see what else we have if we scroll
down a little bit more we see this thing
called lead and this makes a paragraph
stand out by adding the class of lead so
it looks a bit more like this text right
here so all we need to do is add this
lead class now to our key tag right here
so let's say class equals lead and save
it
and now it makes that text a little
bigger and stands out just a little more
all right cool so there's one more thing
I want to do for now and that is to kind
of centralize all this text in the
center so yeah we've got the container
surrounding this and that brings it into
that central column but it's aligned
left so that central column on the left
side of it right I want all this text to
be in the middle so we can do that using
another class from bootstrap so again
I'm going to go to the documentation and
I'm going to go to utilities again
and this time I'm going to click on its
high paw graphic and if we scroll down
we can see text alignment down here
we've got different classes like text
justify that we can use to align text in
certain ways we also have these things
right here text left text center text
right etc we can also apply the four
different screen sizes if we like I'm
just going to use this text center class
which is going to centralize all of our
text in the middle so I'm going to go
back to our code and add it to this
thing right here the Jumbotron text
center save it and check this out now it
centralizes everything on the jumbotron
and that is looking a lot better now my
friends so these are the different
utility classes that bootstrap provides
us with and the different typographic
plus is like I said I'm not going to go
through them all because it would take
me absolutely ages but I am going to
leave the link to the documentation down
below as always so you can take a look
through that in your own time and like I
say we will be popping back to the
utility classes a little bit as we go
along to make our website look a little
bit better too so in the next lesson
we're going to be taking a look at more
of the components bootstrap 4 has to
provide us with and we're going to start
with bootstrap cards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
