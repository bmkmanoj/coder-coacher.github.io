to describe how the date on our graph
will look so let's make that schema now
inside server I'll make a new folder and
I'm gonna call this said schema and
inside that will create a file and we're
also going to call this schema Jas all
right so the first thing we need to do
inside this file is require graph QL
that's the main graph QL package we
installed in the last video so we'll say
Const graph QL is equal to require and
then graph queue up all right
so in this file is where we're going to
define our schema remember our schema
will describe the data on this kind of
graph it describes the object types the
relations between those object types and
it describes how we can reach into the
graph to interact with that data whether
that be to query it and retrieve data or
to mutate or change the data so either
way we're jumping into this graph to
interact with it right so we'll start
off by inside this schema describing the
object types we want on our graph so the
graph right here is going to have two
object types on it books and authors so
ultimately we need to describe these two
object types in the schema file and the
relationship between them and also how
to query these object types to get data
buck so we're just going to start off
with one object type to begin with the
book so the way we define object types
in graph QL is a little bit unusual at
first what we need to do is we need to
grab something from this graph cue our
package to do it so I'm gonna say Const
and I'm going to use a bit of es6
destructor in here which allows us to
grab a variables out of something else
so I'm going to require or not require
destructor graph QL object type and pay
attention to the capitalization here
capital
ql o and c alright that's really
important so I'll set that equal their
graph QL so this D structure and what
it's going to do is grab this variable
of this function for us from this thing
right here from this package we're
taking it out and storing it now so we
can use this inside this file alright so
once we've done that we can now define a
new type so we'll call this type a book
type and we'll set this equal to a new
grass ql object type alright so that's
the thing we've just grabbed right here
so this right here is a function which
takes in a object and this object is
going to define what this book type is
all about so first of all we'll give
this a name I'm going to call it book
and then we need to also define the
fields on this object type so remember
the fields are going to be things like a
name property genre an ID that kind of
thing so this fields property is
actually going to be a function so we'll
do our parentheses and then an arrow
then another parenthesis and then an
object inside that now the reason this
needs to be a function is because later
on when we have multiple types and they
have references to one another then
unless we wrap those fields in a
function one type might not necessarily
know what I know the type is does that
make sense
it might not a minute but later on when
we introduce all the types as well I'll
explain this a little bit more and why
we need it and I'll show you what
happens if we don't wrap it in a
function all right so this right here
this function is going to turn this
object and we need to define our
different fields inside here so first of
all the ID the ID is going to be maybe a
string of random numbers or something
like that so when we're defining these
fields we need to say what type is is it
a string is he an integer or some other
type so we'll open up an object and
we're going to say the type is going to
be something now we can't just do string
again this is one of the nuances of
graph QL we have to use a special string
a graph QL string in order for it to
understand the type so again we're going
to grab that from graph QL by doing a
comma and then saying graph QL string so
again with destructor in here and we're
grabbing this thing from this package as
well so now we have access to this in
this file so the type of this ID is
going to be a graph QL string all right
so a string of seemingly random numbers
or something like that so that's one
field that we're gonna have on each book
what is another field the name of the
book so again we need to define a type
for this and it will be a string again
so we'll say graph keep our string for
this and then finally we'll have a genre
property and again this will be of type
string so we'll say graph QL string for
that one as well so right now what we've
done is we've defined our first object
type on this graph and it's a book type
it's called book and it has these fields
right here an ID name and genre and that
all of type graph QR string this is
graph QL saying okay I'm expecting a
string for this type and this type and
this type okay so all three of them and
we've wrapped all of those fields inside
a function and es6 function which is
returning this object and again that's
because when we have multiple types
later on this is going to help overcome
any kind of reference errors all right
and we'll explore that a little bit more
when we have multiple types so this book
type here is a first step in defining
our our graph we'll look we've said that
on a graph we're going to have this
object type which is a book right but
this is just one part of our schema
based on this diagram down here remember
we have other things in here an author
type we also have these connections
between the different objects and we
have these entry points as well where we
jump into the graph so this thing right
here is a good first step but it is just
the first step in defining our whole ski
remember ultimately we want to pass all
of this schema into this thing right
here all right
so we've started to define this in the
next tutorial what we're going to do is
we're going to look at our entry points
into the graph so that we can query this
data these are called rip queries and
we'll take a look at those in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
