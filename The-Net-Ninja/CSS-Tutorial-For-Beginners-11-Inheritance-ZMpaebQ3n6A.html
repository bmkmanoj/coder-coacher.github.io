what the hell is going on this is CSS
for beginners lesson 11
I'm the net ninja and today we're going
to talk about inheritance ah okay so
what the heck is inheritance well to
explain that I've done this funky little
tree here it's all color-coordinated for
you guys so hope you enjoy this as much
as I did alright so off we got we've got
a simple simple HTML structure here okay
we open with the body tag and we close
with the body tag that we'd say was the
top-level element the parent element
okay everything in pink here is within
the body tag it's one level deep you've
got this div tag here and the closing
tag and then the h1 tag we'd say this
was a child element of the body tag okay
it's one level deep and then finally
we've got this P tag here with text in
it which is yellow we'd say that is the
child of this div tag here and we could
say it's the grandchild of the body tag
because it's two levels deep within the
body tag but only one level deep within
the P tag now how is this important with
CSS well the way it works is this if we
apply styles to the body tag here then
everything within this body tag will
inherit dog style so if we say okay we
want a front color of green for the body
and we apply that just to the body then
everything within it would automatically
inherit that style and have a green
color a green text color if we say okay
we want to give all the div tags a call
of blue then everything within the div
tags would automatically be colored blue
we don't have to spell the pig directly
because it's inheriting from the div
style all right so to put this into
practice we're going to go back into the
code and go through a few examples ah
all right we put them back here in the
HTML file we've been working on I've
stripped out all the CSS we've done so
far and we're going to go through a few
examples of this whole inheritance
malarkey all right so we're going to
start off with what we went through in
the slide and that was the body so we're
going to write our simple body selector
and give it a property of color and
we'll say red we want all the text with
body to be read that means okay so we'll
save this and we'll view this in a
browser show an explorer and open up in
Google Chrome and there it is
simple as everything's read and that's
because everything within the body all
the tags that within the body are
inheriting that style okay so where we
put here color red it's saying okay well
apply this rule to every div tag within
the body okay everything within that
body tag now what if we want all the
divs these two to be colored blue
everything within that we want blue well
we can override this ER this body tag
and this is a form of conflict by the
way carries on from conflicts and we
could say color blue right well the CSS
is going to say well hey okay I found
the body and we're going to call
everything inside the body red and every
tag is going to inherit that but then
this div tags going to world not me not
me I wouldn't be blue okay so what
overriding that default inherited style
so everything now within the div tags
should be blue so let's have a view
without in the browser again oops let's
save this first open this in chrome and
there we go we've got the div tag at the
top with the headers in and the div tag
with the paragraphs in which are blue so
they're overriding those inherited
styles alright so now what if we wanted
the P tags to be green you know they're
like well and I don't wanna be blue I
want to be green even though they're
inheriting this div style here of blue
the P tags we can override it further by
saying okay well our peas I want to
color green okay so again oops the CSS
is coming down here from top to bottom
it's saying well okay the Bobby I'm
going to color all the text within that
red and then the divs tags are going no
no nuts we want to be blue so we're
calling in all the text within div tags
blue and then finally the bottom you've
got these Peters going no no no we want
to be green so then the P tags are being
colored green so these inherited styles
as we go down through the chain of
children are being overridden by the
star
themselves on the elements okay does
that make sense
so we'll view this in a browser once
more and now we can see okay we've got
the initial red text here because we've
give that body tag and a standard color
red so everything within the body tag is
inheriting that and it's coloring
everything red okay then it's coming to
the div tags and they're saying oh we
want to be color blue so it's coloring
it both the div tags blue which is this
and this this bit here sorry and then
finally the P tags are shouting about
going no no no we want to be green so
finally the P tags have been overridden
again that inherited blue style to color
them green all right so I am going to
throw a spanner in the works because
this inheritance thing doesn't always
work and to demonstrate that I'm going
to go to the bottom of the Hicks team-up
file here and add a link tagging don't
forget that's a and we'll just give it a
hairy for any old thing here just to put
a pound sign in and then I'm a spanner
oops
spun right so let's view this in a
browser now before we do that what would
you expect the color of this text to be
well let's have a look we've said that
we want everything in the body tag to be
red and it seemed the body tag it's not
within a div tag so it's not going to be
blue and it's not a P tag it's an egg
tag so you'd expect it to inherit the
body tag style which is red here
wouldn't you all right well let's have a
look using Chrome again open with Chrome
and there it is wait is blue now why is
that happening well this is where the
default browser Styles are kicking in
remember that video that I did on
default browser Styles if you've not
seen that I'm going to pop a link to the
description below so you can go out and
check that and then come back here but
essentially what's happening is these
default browser styles one of the
default styles implemented by the
browser is on a links on all a tag sorry
and what it does is it calls all a tags
by D
or blue and underlines them okay so even
though we've not specified here and we
want this a tag to override this color
of red the browser has done that
essentially what the browser has done
has said a color blue and
text-decoration:underline okay that's
what the browsers don't
behind-the-scenes that's a default
browser style and it's overriding this
inherited style of red okay so you need
to be careful it doesn't always work
these inheritance things you need to
know what the default browser styles are
so you can keep track of what's being
inherited and what's not alright so just
to demonstrate that we can change this
we can override these default styles we
can color it yellow with one two we'll
save this and open this up back in the
browser and there it is yellow now
barely legible at all
so having that's the basics of how
inheritance works and you need to be
really careful really really careful
because it can get very messy very
quickly you know we've done like what
four different rules here and it's
already start to get a little bit
complicated when you've got rules going
up into the hundreds or possibly even
thousands on big websites you're going
to have to keep track of them that's why
it's always good to organize your CSS
effectively using comments like I showed
you earlier so that's about it for this
video as always if you have any
questions feel free to comment below
I'll answer all of those questions
otherwise if you like these videos
please please please subscribe share and
like them and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we're going to look at
specificity in CSS conflicts I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
