step in becoming a Python and ninja oh
right there so the big question first of
all why should you even learn Python
well honestly because Titan is a really
cool programming language and it can be
used for a ton of different things and
it's really simple to pick up as well so
why not so what are some of the
different ways we can use Python in well
first of all we can use it to create
websites and we can employ the help of
frameworks like Django to help us do
that and if that's a couple of websites
you may know of Instagram and Dropbox
they both use patent as well so it can't
be that shabby right we can also use
Python to run scientific applications
and we can use libraries such as sci-fi
things like that to do that and in fact
absolutely astrophysics at university
yep I'm a geek and we use Tyson to
perform all kinds of computations and
scientific software so it's really
popular in the scientific community and
in fact NASA actually use Python for a
lot of things too and we can also use
Python to control robots which is
immensely cool and interrupt with things
like a Raspberry Pi which incidentally I
will be helping to do a few tutorials on
in the future at some point so yeah
anyway pattern can be used in loads of
different ways and because it's so
versatile it is considered a
general-purpose programming language
right so that means basically it can be
used for many different things and
that's in contrast to something like PHP
which was purely designed for the web
Titan doesn't have any specific use or
restrictions like PHP does so we can use
it for many different things
it's a general-purpose programming
language now you're also often going to
hear Python being described as a
high-level programming language as well
which basically means that the language
abstracts away from low-level machine
code so that it's much more human
readable basically because at the end of
the day machine code is just a series of
random numbers well not random but just
a series of numbers letters which could
be really difficult to programming okay
but because Python language extracts
itself so much away from this computer
machine code we can easily read it
looking easily programming it but for
that reason we need an intern
to run the Python code through so that
the computer can understand it and this
all sounds way more complex than it
needs to be it's actually very simple
for us to do and you get to see all that
later and finally it's also really fun
to learn and it's surprisingly easy to
pick up as well and that's one of the
main reasons I want to create this
series which is going to teach you all
of the building blocks you need to start
creating your own programs with Python
from scratch so what are we going to
learn them well first of all we're going
to learn the basics all the different
types different variables numbers
strings
lists dictionaries so we'll load all of
the basics first of all then we're going
to move on to some slightly more
advanced topics things like classes
objects functions and control flow and
start to build out some small projects
then we're going to look at how to
interact with files on your computer
read files write files that kind of
thing and along the way through the
whole thing we are going to go through
some mini projects such as creating a
bathtub calculator some kind of random
tips and generator and how to download
and save images from the web as well so
the aim is that by the end of this
series you can be in a good position to
write and start making your own programs
from scratch and because Python is one
of the most widely used high-level
programming languages out there you can
find a lot of good resources to help
when you're creating projects in the
wild on your own now this series is
going to focus on places through not
Python 2 which is still you know fairly
widely used by some people but because
python 3 is going to be the future that
is what this series is all going to be
about so like always I am going to be
providing you with all of the course
files for this series you can find it on
my github repository called
Pisces 3 playlists of course this link
is going to be down below so for the
first few lessons there's not going to
be any poem if you can see it start from
lesson 6 up here and that's just because
we're going to be using the the command
line to go through the basics at the
start but once we get to lesson 6 you're
going to find all the code on the github
repository so you can just go to
whatever lesson you want and you'll be
able to find all the code here by going
to lessons or programs if we're making
some kind of mini program and you can
browse that or download it if you want
ok so it's all there if you need it I am
also going to recommend a couple of
different programs which I'm going to be
using in this
well the first one is a text editor
called Adam which i think is just
immensely cool it's free as well so you
can find that that awesome IO that
incidentally I'm going to be using a
theme called ultimate Molokai a lot of
people always ask me that
so that's what it's called at Molokai
the other tool I'm going to recommend is
called commander of CMDA you can find
that at CMD er net again this link is
going down below this is a command line
tool which looks better than the windows
basic form and it also gives us access
to get if you've not already got that
installed and Linux commands as well so
if you want to download that just come
to this website and there's a download
button down here you can have done with
the full-on mini version that's entirely
up to you
but I'm going to be using this and Adam
I recommend that you do too as well so
there we go there's your introduction to
Python and why we should learn it in the
next lesson what we're going to do is
look at how to install Python onto your
computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
