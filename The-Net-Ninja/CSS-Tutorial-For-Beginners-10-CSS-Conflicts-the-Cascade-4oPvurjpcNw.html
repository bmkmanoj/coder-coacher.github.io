yo guys what the hell is up I'm Shaun
from the net ninja this is CSS for
beginners lesson 10 and today we're
going to talk about the Cascade and CSS
conflicts ah so what is a conflict then
well the easiest way to put it is this
it's a conflict okay and essentially
what that means is that it's when you
have two selectors or two rules with the
same selector going after the same tags
in your document and you've got
properties within those two rules that
are different from each other so you
might have one rule that says go after
all the spawns and color them red and
then let it down the line you might have
another rule which says go after all the
spun tags and make it blue that's a
conflict right now you might be sitting
there thinking what the hell is this
dude on I'm not going to make two
different selectors for the same tag
right you might be thinking you're going
to put Maul in one rule now if that's
your attitude good luck guys now that's
not going to happen because as your CSS
gets really large you're not going to
know what's going on you're going to be
under a mountain of CSS and you help me
remember which rules you've done all the
time and your boss wanted this change by
the way 10 minutes ago so you're under
pressure to change the color of these
spawn tags now you're just going to
override it you're probably going to
create your own conflict to do that and
sure you can go back and neaten it up
later but you need to understand what
these conflicts are doing to your CSS
okay and to understand that you need to
understand the Cascade which we're also
going to talk about in this video so
best way to do that is through an
example so we're going to do just that
and like I just said we'll go after the
span tags why not so these four here so
we'll make a rule called span it's just
the element selector open our
Declaration and color them all blue all
right now underneath I'm going to do an
identical selector just going after the
span tags again and color them up or
call them all red okay now what do you
think's going to happen here well this
is where the Cascade comes in now if I
say to you the word Cascade what do you
think I think of the word waterfall or a
picture of waterfall rather and
waterfall tumbles down
from the topic cascades downwards starts
at the cliff or whatever a stream at top
comes down the cliff into the pool at
the bottom and that's exactly what the
CSS cascade does it starts at the top of
the document and it reads from top to
bottom downwards okay so when we have
this CSS file it comes in when it's
loaded and it reads from the top down to
the bottom so it starts here and it says
okay I've got this spun select here I'm
going to go after all these spans and
color them blue then right underneath
it's got this other spun tag
sorry span rule span select there and it
calls them all red okay so because this
is the bottommost rule its applied this
last and therefore this one applies okay
if you're going to take one thing away
from this is that the Cascade runs from
top to bottom and that if the selectors
are identical and that's important if
the selectors are identical then the
bottommost
rule always wins okay so to prove that
I'm going to save this and view this in
a browser open this in the Explorer and
then we'll do Google Chrome and there
they are they're all red which is what
we expected okay and again that's
because the CSS is a cascade run from
top to bottom it's coming in color in
them all blue first of all with this
selector finding this selector which is
identical then overriding it and
coloring them all red okay now this is a
prime example of a conflict to CSS
conflict now in previous episodes in
previous lessons I said that we can use
embedded styling and inline styling and
they also said that I hated it and I do
I don't really like it but if you want
to override something if you want to
create your own conflict just on this
one page okay so your boss comes up to
you says hey guys I've got this I've got
this page here in this content page and
I want the the color of these span tags
changing don't know why I'm doing an
American accent by the way that's just
what I do in urbana voice okay forgive
me if that offends you I'm sorry now
what are you going to do yeah you could
go into your syntax dot CSS file and
this is the best way to do it by the way
and find your span rule and change it
but if you're under pressure you could
create your own conflict you could go
into the head of this page and you could
open your style
close it off and then do a rule here
which targets all the spam tags again
and then this time color them
I forgot what color I said he wants the
purple all right so then the Cascade
also applies here in the HTML file it's
coming in coming from top to bottom
finding this link link tag here with the
stylesheet applied it's jumping into the
stylesheet it's going from the top to
bottom again coloring the blue then
overriding them with red then it jumps
back out at the bottom of the CSS file
carries on down into the document finds
this style tag here and then within that
it finds the span selector which is
exactly the same as these again so you
guessed it it all guides it and colors
them purple and that's the Cascade in
action the bottom most rule is winning
because the selectors are identical so
let's save this again and open it up in
a browser and there it is okay we've got
our spawn tags or purple now so that's
how it's working
it's going from top to bottom and
applying the bottommost rule now we've
also got inline styling so we could come
to one of these spam tags and say yeah
your client or your boss or whoever just
you want the top span tag calling
differently I said we can apply a style
attribute to this and we can say color
green okay so what's going to happen
here well again it's coming from top to
bottom the Cascade is in action it's
coming from the top into the stylesheet
at the top of this stylesheet is going
to call them blue then red then it jumps
out at the bottom comes down into these
star tags colors them purple goes all
the way down the document then it finds
you spun sadly saying hey what's this
I've got a style attribute applied ear
so I'm going to override this span
selector and color it green so I'm doing
it directly on the target this is the
bottom launch rule so it's winning but
then it's coming down to these spun tags
and these have got no style attributes
so then the bottom most select your own
rule for those is this one still up here
this purple so these are still going to
be purple okay now let's say there
and view it in a browser one more time
and there we can see that we've got this
top one here green which we styled in
line and then all these ones are still
from the style tag I call it purple so
hopefully now you understand a bit more
about what the Cascade is remember it
runs from top to bottom
always and what a conflict is is when
you've got identical selectors it's not
only when you've got identical selectors
by the way you could have a selector
which is more specific for example I
could say body span Club blue and then
this one because it's more specific and
this one would still apply we're not
going to get into that now but if your
selectors are all we're all identical
then the bottommost selector which is
identical always wins that always
applies okay so hopefully now you
understand what conflicts are - like
always if you've got any questions feel
