28th of ujf tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about dynamic
components alright then so dynamic
components are a mystery a little tool
that UGS provides us with so that we can
dynamically change which component is
output to the browser in a particular
place in our template
sounds like double the gig okay let's go
through a simple example so say for
example we have this a root component
right here completely stripped out from
the last tutorial so all we're doing now
is importing two components right here
and registering them down here so there
are four one and form two and I've
already created those other two
components form one here which is just a
dead simple contact form and form two
here which is a simple login form okay
so you can get both of these component
codes from the github repository the
link is down below so anyway I've
created those two components and
imported them right here so in previous
tutorials if we want you to nest a
component inside the root component here
we could do something like this I could
say form 1 to nest the form 1 component
which is right here that's what we
called it form one we imported it here
and that's going to show us form 1 in
the browser if I save we can see for 1
if I want to show form 2 I can just go
up underneath and say form - to save
that and this time we're going to see
farm 2 as well but in this example we
don't want to output two components we
just want to output one component and we
want that component to dynamically
change between form 1 and form 2
depending on the user interaction with
the website so if they click a button
for form 1 then we want to show for one
here if they click a button for farm -
then we want to show form 2 here so
we're going to use dynamic components to
achieve this so instead of writing our
components like this what we can do
instead is use a component tag like that
so this is a view tag and it will look
at this and say okay you want to output
a component here tell me which component
you want to output and to do that we say
is
then equal to whatever component we want
to output so I'm just going to use this
one right here for now
form one copy that and paste it up here
and then this will output form one so
this is the same so far a saying form
one okay exactly the same can have the
same effect and if I save this we can
check it out in a browser to make sure
it's work you see for one okay so why is
this any different
well it's different because now we can
apply data binding to this attribute
right here so we could say V - binds to
is and then this is going to equal some
kind of property that we store down here
which is the keep track of whether we
want to shall form one off on - so if we
make a property down here for example
called component and if we set that to
begin with form one then this right here
can be set to component UJS if they look
at this and say okay we've got data
binding to this attribute we're looking
for a component property down here which
is equal to form one so I'll replace
that up here and therefore we're going
to show form one so if I change this to
form suits now we'll show form two so
I'm going to save this and see in a
browser if this works and we can see now
form - cool so now we can dynamically
change this thing right here which will
in turn change which component is output
to the browser so say for example we
have these two buttons one to show form
one and want to show form - let's create
the sub button and then V on to attach
an event it's a click event and this is
going to be equal to some kind of
functions I will say show form one right
here I'm going to duplicate this dude
copy and paste it down below and we'll
change this to two so now if we click
this button we want to show component 1
if we click this button really want to
show component 2 how do we do that well
all we need to do is if we click this
button change this property component to
equal form 1 and if we click this button
change components to equal form - and
then that's going to change this
and change which component is output so
if we click this button we want their
four components to equal and it's going
to be 4 - 1 and the same goes for down
below so I'll paste it in there and this
time we want to show four to make sense
so if we view this in a browser now
we're going to see these two buttons
shelf on 1 and show off on 2 now it's
showing 2 by default because by default
we set component to be fallen - so if we
click on form 1 then we see form 1 if we
click on form - we see farm - etc so
they're my friends we have a dynamic
component we're outputting a different
component depended on user interaction
with the website right here in this
placeholder and what only coding it once
we're not coding two components
we're just coding one component pretty
cool right now I want to show you one
more thing which might catch you out
when you start working with these
dynamic components and to demonstrate
that I want to just add some data into
one of these fields so I'll show form
once begin with and I'll type some
gibberish message in here okay now if I
go to form - and then go back to form 1
when I still see that message in that
box no I don't release him and that's
because every time we go off that form
and show different components that
component is kind of being destroyed
okay and then when we go back to it it's
creating a new instance of that
component completely so any data when we
graph the components is being destroyed
and when we go back to it we get a fresh
version of that component so it's not
retaining this data associated with that
component and likewise any kind of data
that we change in the data property down
here that will go as well okay so if we
have some kind of property down here
which was some kind of counter and
started at 0 and then when we were
seeing the farm we were moving the
counter upwards to 5 if we go off that
component and but the counter is going
to reset to 0 because we're creating a
new instance of that component makes
sense so how do we get around this what
if I want to retain that data say I will
put something in here
I want to go to farm two and come back
to form one and that still be there well
thankfully we cannot do that and we do
that by using the keepalive tag so I can
come here and say keep alive and then
copy the closing tag tasty underneath
this dude scoot down and there yep this
is going to do exactly that forest so if
I go to show for 110 to some gibberish
she'll fall to come back and we still
see this awesome so now I've got exactly
what I want so keep alive right here is
think of UGS hey do not dare delete this
components when we switch to a new one I
want you to keep it alive can pull the
data intact so that when we come back to
it later on everything is still going to
be hunky-dory
okay so there we go guys that is dynamic
component in a nutshell tons and tons of
uses for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
