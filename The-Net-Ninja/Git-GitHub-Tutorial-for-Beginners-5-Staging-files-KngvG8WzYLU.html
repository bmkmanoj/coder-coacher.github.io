github tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about staging files so in
the last tutorial we went ahead and
created our first repo and inside that
repo we create a new file the index dot
HTML file and we added some dummy
content to it now one of the cool things
about adding the text editor amusing is
that it highlighted that index file in
green to say that we've changed this
file and get is aware of that however
we've not committed it yet okay so if we
see any green files in our project tree
on the left then that means that they
have been changed or modified but they
have not yet been committed so right now
since we've changed our index file but
not committed it it's sitting in this
modified zone right here ok now remember
if we created a commit right now then it
would actually commit anything because
when we commit something all it does is
take everything from the staging area
and create a commit from that now
currently all we've done is modify a
file and we've not added it to the
staging area ready for a commit so I'm
going to show you how to do that in this
tutorial ok so here I am in the get 1
directory this repository right here I'm
also in the get one directory over here
in commander and this is the index file
we added in our last tutorial and you
can see it's green right now which means
gifties aware we've changed this file
but it's not yet been committed now
remember if we make a commit now it's
not going to commit that file because
we've not added it to the staging area
so we need to do that first of all now
I'm going to show you a command here
which is going to show you which files
are currently in the staging area and
waiting to be committed essentially and
that command is git status so if we type
sup it's going to show us which files we
have changed and which files are in the
staging area now it says right here that
the untracked files are these index dot
HTML files right here or rather this one
file and that's red which means you've
been changed but it's not yet been
staged ok so if we want to stage right
now we're ready for committing all we
need to do is say git and then add
and then the name of the file which is
index.html and that is going to add this
file to the staging area so now if I say
get status we're going to see this file
again but this time it's in green and it
says new file index dot HTML and right
here it says these are the changes to be
committed so if we run a deep commit now
then it would commit these files ok or
rather just at the minute this one file
so sometimes we add files to the staging
area which we don't necessarily mean to
it's a mistake and we want to remove
those files from the staging area and it
says right here that we can use git RM
double data cache then the final two and
stage anything so I can say if I want to
remove the index file from the staging
area I can say git RM double - cached
and then index.html and now if I say git
status again we can see that that index
file has been removed from the staging
area okay so this is all well and good
we know how to add files now to the
staging area but just imagine we have a
large project and we change maybe 10 or
20 different files now to go through and
say git add and then every single file
separately it's going to take a long
time we don't want to do that and
there's a shortcut if we change say 20
files and we want to add them all to the
staging area we can just say get add dot
and that's going to add everything to
the staging area and to demonstrate this
what I'm going to do is just create a
new file over here get a right-click and
call this file styles dot CSS so now we
have this file as well I'll just do a
simple rule body and then background
they're going to be red ok so now if I
save this we've got two files right here
which we've changed and the both green
which means the change but they're not
committed if I said git status we can
see that both of these files have
changed but they've not been added to
the staging area so we can add them to
the staging area both at the same time
by saying git add dot to say you want to
add every single modified file to the
staging area and then if we say git
status
it's going to come back and say these
two are both now in the staging area so
they're both ready to be committed okay
so now if we do a commit it's going to
take both of these take a snapshot of
the current state of both of these files
and add them to the new commit all right
so you might be thinking well what on
earth is the point of having a git
staging area why don't we just commit
straight away we make our changes make a
commit make our changes and make a
commit without ever having to add things
to this staging area well first of all
it's an extra blanket of security so if
we're making changes we're not just
committing a straightaway too hastily we
have to explicitly add them to the
staging area and by adding them to the
staging area it allows us to review our
changes before we make that to me okay
because committing is not something we
should just be giving all over the show
we should be committed in illogical
points after developing certain features
of our website or application okay make
sense so another reason is that we can
split our work up into separate commits
now imagine I'm managing a website and
there's two books on it I want to kind
of fix both bugs at the same time so I
change two files right one for each book
so I might not want to bundle them
together in the same commit so what I
could do is stage one of the files and
then commit that and then stage one of
the other files and then commit that so
it allows us to split our work up in
this way in two separate different
commits four separate different changes
okay so then now we know about what the
staging area is all about and the next
tutorial what we're going to do is take
a look at actually making commits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
