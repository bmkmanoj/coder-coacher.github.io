tutorial and in this video we're going
to make some get requests using it view
resource okay there's some in the last
tutorial we've already seen how to make
post requests using this view resource
module so we're going to leave something
similar in this tutorial but this time
we're going to use get requests now to
do that we're going to create a new
component because this component right
here is a form to add a new blog and
when we're making get requests where
typically retrieving data we want to
show that data so we're going to make a
new component to show blocks to list our
blocks okay so we'll get rid of this
well we won't get rid of it we'll cross
it off and then we'll create a new
component new file and we'll call this
show blogs dot view okay now the first
thing I want to do is come to my root
component app top view and I want to
import it right here because we're going
to use it in this up top view file so
I'm going to paste that dude and paste
it down below and we'll change this to
show blogs and this to show blogs as
well and then finally we need to
register this in our components so say
show - blogs is show blogs this thing
right here okay so now let's nest it so
we'll just delete this for now and
replace it with show blogs like so okay
so now this is going to be nested in the
root components so when we view it in a
browser we should just see nothing other
than it because there's nothing in this
file okay so to get us started with this
component file I'm just going to copy
and paste all of this and then edit it
because they don't want to write
everything else from scratch but we'll
just get rid of these components because
we don't like these we don't need these
imports and we don't need this in the
style tag and up here we don't want this
okay so now we want to show a list of
our blog so let's kind of flesh out the
view for that first of all at the the
template if you like okay so let's give
this an ID I'm going to set this equal
to show - blogs and then within that
will do h1
and this is going to say all blog
articles and then the initiation what we
want is a div and this is where we're
going to output our blogs okay so each
blog is going to be within a div and
it's going to have a class equal to
single - blog so in the code there's
going to be multiple ones of users going
to be like I don't know ten or something
like that okay but I mean we've seen
this before we don't want to hard-code
anything here we just want to kind of
cycle through our blogs and output them
dynamically so that says to me use v4
okay and at the minute we don't have any
blood to loop through so first of all we
need to go out and we need to make that
get requests and retrieve those blocks
then store them in some kind of local
variable so we can use that then to
cycle through them and output them in
the template make sense okay so the way
we're going to do that is by using the
lifecycle hook created remember a few
tutorials ago I talked about lifecycle
hooks and we can use the created one to
fire when this component is first
created to go out and retrieve some data
if you need a refresher then just skip
back to that tutorial first of all okay
so created this is the function which
will fire when the component is first
made okay so in here we want to say this
dot dollar sign HTTP remember we can use
this now because you've installed view
resource this time we want to make a get
request okay
and similar to post requests we need to
popping a resource right there at a URL
as to say where we're getting these
posts from now again we're going to use
this thing right here Jason placeholder
so we've already made a post request to
posts now let's make a get request to
posts and we want a list of all posts so
it's just going to be two /it posts but
remember it's this thing first of all
this is the route URL so we'll copy that
and we'll head back over here and we'll
paste it right in there and then it's
forward slash hosts okay so now we're
getting the posts from this kind of fake
domain
a peon so we don't need to pass in a
second parameter here like we did with
the post request because that was just
the data we were posting we're not
sending any data here but again this
returns towards a promise so we can
check on the then method which is only
gonna fire this function inside it when
this action has been complete so when it
goes out grabs the data returns towards
when that's happened then it fires this
function right here okay and it brings
back towards the data so we pass that in
as a parameter to this function okay so
inside this function what do we want to
do well first of all should we take a
look at what data is returned to us
so we'll console dot log data save that
and let's view this in a browser so
there's going to be nothing much on the
screen at the minute but if we inspect
and then go to the console we should see
something which is returned towards if I
just refresh then we can see this thing
right here is returned to us so this
response has a body right and this body
is an array and this is an array of all
the different posts if we go to JSON
placeholder and we click on posts this
is what the array is going to look like
you can see this array notation right
here and in each object right here we
have a different post the user ID the ID
the title the body etc now there's a
hundred of these things returned to as
you can see there's 100 elements and we
don't want to list a hundred on one page
we just want to show maybe something
like 10 okay so first of all we want the
body property and then we want to take
ten from this array so first of all how
can we do that well we can access it by
saying first of all data dot body if we
want into body property remember and
then we're going to slice it okay and
we're going to slice it from zero
position to the tenth position so that's
going to get us the first ten elements
from that array okay so now we have
those first ten elements right there
let's just delete this what do we want
to do with it well we want to store it
on some kind of property within this
object right here okay so let's make
that property first of all blogs or
store them in here and at the minute
it's going to be an empty array okay but
when we go out and get this data
retrieve it
then we'll store these things here in
this array so we'll say this blocks is
equal to data body dot slice 0 10 so
we're getting an array right here the
first ten elements and then storing them
in this property here okay cool so now
we have those blocks in this array and
now we have an array we can easily cycle
through them using v4 right so we can
say something like this blog in blogs
and that's going to cycle through all of
these blogs and each time around we can
reference let them give your blog from
this variable okay so we can output some
information now so we can have a title
to the block h2 I'm going to output the
blog the single blog dot title remember
title was a property on each one of
these objects if we just open this up we
can see the title right here is a
property okay and also buddy is a
property so we'll output that as well so
we'll do an article tag beneath this and
output the body so we'll say blog body
okay
save that and now let's check this out
in a browser okay cool so now we're
retrieving all of that data and without
putting it right here but I mean this
doesn't look great so what I'm going to
do is just add in a little bit of CSS to
make it look at least slightly better so
I'm target these show blogs ID which is
the surrounding give right here and
inside this I'll just do some simple
styles so a max width of about 800
pixels and then the same margin is zero
and auto so that's going to centralize
it on the page next we want to target
each individual single blog so it has
this class of single blog so single -
blog
and inside this we'll say each blog has
a padding of about 20 pixels right and
then also a margin of 20 pixels top and
bottom but zero left and right we'll say
the box - sizing is going to be board a
box so that takes into consideration the
padding and border if there isn't it and
will give it a background as well
which is going to be e EE which is a
very light gray so let's save that and
see this looks any better whatsoever
cool that is starting to look a bit
better now okay it's not going to get
design of the year but at least it
doesn't look very ugly cool so now we
know how to use view resource to make
pulse requests and also to make get
requests so later in the tutorial when
we hook this up to firebase we're going
to make this a bit more dynamic so that
we can add new posts then when we list
them is going to list the posts that we
add and then we can click into each post
and see more about that post as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
