27th painted 3 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about how to
write files to our computer
ok then so in the last tutorial we
looked at how we can open files and then
read files in this one I want to take a
look at how we can open files and then
write to files ok so first of all what
I'm going to do is create an empty file
over here I'm going to right click from
the files folder and got some new file
and I'm going to call this write text so
write dot text and this is the file that
we're going to write to now i've already
created this write py python file so
we're going to do all the code in here
now the first thing i want to do is open
up this file so i'm going to use the
second method I showed you in the last
tutorial where we looked at reading
files and that was by sayings we and
then using the open function we're
passing the string to say which file we
want to open it's in the files directory
then it's forward slash right dot txt
and we're going to say what we want to
refer to this as this file in this call
block so I'll say as and I'm going to
call this write underscore file then we
have our code block right now when we're
opening your file we're opening it by
default as read-only ok so what we want
to do is open it up so that we can
particularly write to the file because
right now if we open it like this we're
not going to be able to so we can pass
in a second argument to this open
function to allow us to write to this
file so I'm going to pop a comment after
this first argument and then I'm going
to pass in another string and that's
just great aw which stands for right ok
so now we can write to this file with
inside this code block all right so we
can do that pretty simply I'm just going
to say great underscore file which is
our reference to the file right there
then I'm going to say dot right this is
the method we use to write something
that's in that file and now I just want
to paste something in here you know some
kind of string that we can write to this
file so I've just copied this from my
repo because I can't type in it and it
says hey down and just - is awesome so
if I save this now what I'm going to do
is run this file so I'll save Python and
then right doc you why and you'll notice
nothing actually happens in the console
but if we take a look
right doc Tech now we see this line so
we've now written that stringing from
this program right here when we run it
into this file tool right so what if we
want to write another line well again
we're going to do is just copy this now
from my repo some reason I'm feeling
really lazy in this tutorial so now what
I've done is write another line I've
added on this new line character so I've
escaped this character so it's going to
force a new line and then another string
I love it so much I dream in Python cool
so let's say this and let's try running
it again Python right and take a look in
right and there we go I love it so much
I dream in Python so now we've written
that extra line okay so what if instead
of the writing this here what if we did
all this we wrote this file and then
later on down the line outside of this
code blocks and we're down here we
wanted to open it up against all say
with open and then I'm going to go to
files write dot txt and then W again we
want to write through it and then it'll
be as write file again and inside V and
what if we want to write to that file
again but I'm going to paste this in
this second line so what we're doing is
opening this file first of all up here
at the top of the code then imagine we
have some kind of you know junk going on
here some other code then later on we
open up the file again and we want to
write another line to it so I'm going to
save this I'm just going to delete this
from here for now so we start with a
blank text file then I'm going to run to
this code so now let's take a look in
this write file you'll notice we only
get that second line right I loved it so
much I dream in pison and we've got this
line break at the top because we've
specified we want it done so what's
going on here well when we open up this
file again it's going to start from the
beginning when we write and it's going
to overwrite whatever is already in it
right so when we open it up to write
it's going to take whatever is in it
delete it and right from the beginning
so the way we can get around this is
instead of passing W as a parameter here
passing a which stands for amend
then what we can do is run this again
this time this should amend
the file you know just right through it
after the end of it and not delete it so
let's give this a whirl let's run the
file and now this time we see both of
those strings awesome so that is how we
write to a file that is how we amend to
a file as well okay I want to show you
one more example before we finish up on
this lesson so I'm going to copy and
paste this list that I prepared this
again is on the repository so I'm going
to just expand this to show you what it
is just a few different quotes and
they're stored in a list so each quote
has a newline character and a string
right and there are different elements
inside this list now what if we want to
output each one of these lines to a file
we want to cycle through this and do it
well let's copy this again I'm going to
use this open statement right here and
again we're going to use immense so
we're not deleting what we've previously
written and inside this code block what
we're going to do is try and cycle
through these lines and write them right
so the way we do that is by saying write
underscore file remember that is this
variable right here this reference to
the file so write file dot write lines
right so write lines expect and an
argument inside this function some kind
of list okay then it's going to cycle
through that list and write out each
element to the document so I'm going to
pass in this list which is called plots
and then I'm going to save this so let's
minimize this or rather make it smaller
and run at this file again Python right
this time when we have a look over here
we see the first two which have not been
overwritten because we use amend then we
see each one of these lines which are
output on a separate line each time okay
so it's cycled through that list of
lines and output the right here that is
immensely awesome so then we've got my
friends that is how we also write data
or text to a file as well in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is take
what we've learned over the last
tutorials reading them writing files and
we're going to make some kind of themed
