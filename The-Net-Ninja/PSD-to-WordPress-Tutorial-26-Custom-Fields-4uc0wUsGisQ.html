welcome to your 26th PSD to WordPress a
lesson and in this video we're gonna
talk about custom fields Wow okay then
guys so on the home page right here
we've got these four things these menu
items and I said we're gonna use the
loop to pull these menu items in from
WordPress and dynamically explained them
okay so what we need to do is first of
all create a category in WordPress
called menu items or something like that
okay then we need to create these
different menu items they're all just
going to be basically blog posts in that
category and then each menu item we're
going to upload an image a featured
image the title will give it will do
some content then we're also going to
need two extra fields and these fields
are going to be the price and the rating
which we're going to put underneath it's
like a star rating so to bring in those
two extra fields within the loop we're
going to need to use what's known as
custom fields in WordPress and they're
really cool and flexible and I'm going
to show you how we can add those into
blocks in this tutorial so what we want
to do is head over to the backend area
and go to posts then we're gonna add a
new post and this is just going to be a
sample menu item not think of a name
we'll call it ninja soup all right that
will do let's just pop some lorem ipsum
at the bottom this is gonna be all about
that ninja soup and then what we want to
do is come down here and see where it
says featured image this is where we can
add a featured image to this blog post
now when we come to output this data on
the front page we can go in and grab
that featured image as well as the
content of the title whatever we want to
grab from this page we can do that
alright so this is gonna be that little
thumbnail right here so let's set a
featured image now I've already got four
here but if you don't have any then all
you need to do is click upload files
select files right here then just select
them from your computer
I bloated these four which we're from
the PSD so if you want upload those as
well that's cool you do that alright so
none of these look like ACA which is
great this one looks the most like a
suit so we'll go with that and then that
is now set the featured image so that's
to be the thumbnail on the front page
for this item all right now I've already
added a new category here called menu
items all I did was just go to add new
category and write it in there so I'm
just gonna select menu items and then we
need those other two fields the price
and the star rating so this is where the
custom fields come into play what you
want to do is go to screen options and
then this is what is showing down below
the things that are ticked all right so
we've got all these things showing these
other things we don't have the excerpt
send Trackbacks custom fields this is
the one we want to tick so you want to
take that and just zoom it back up and
now you can see down here that sections
appeared and we can add new custom
fields all right so this is the name of
the field and this is gonna be the value
so we've got the name of this first
field to be price just like that and
then we'll give the value to be $45 do
you know what fun I'm gonna put $200
because this is ninja soup after all and
we're gonna add this custom field all
right
I've got a wife don't dulles just
because there's so many Americans have
had doing tutorial series like this I
think I just got sucked into that we're
gonna change this to pounds because I am
British okay
update that and we've got the price then
now we can add a new custom field and
this is going to be the rating this can
be out of fire so we're gonna pop either
1 2 3 4 or 5 and this is obviously gonna
be 5 stars
all right so then we'll add that crystal
field as well so now when we go through
the loop in the PHP code in our theme
files right here we can now grab the
name we can grab the featured image for
the thumbnail and we can grab the values
or these two custom fields all right so
we can output these on the front screen
now you might be looking at this and
thinking well what we're gonna do just
show that the number 5 under it well no
this is gonna be dynamically output into
a class name all right so it might be
like star - a 5 and that class is going
to have a back
and image of five stars all right that's
pretty clever right so this is what we
can do it doesn't have to be exactly
this we can use it a little bit more
cleverly
and do what we bought with it right so
that is how we add the custom fields in
the backend of WordPress now what we're
gonna do is go on to adding that loop
onto the front page but first of all
what I want to do is just add a few more
posts so I'll publish this and then what
I'm gonna do is add a new one and we'll
call this ninja tube I don't know why
these are all called ninja
something-or-other
and then it's gonna be a menu items
that's important
then we want to select one of these
custom fields now because we've already
added price and writing they're gonna
show in a drop down menu every time you
add a new post so it's easy for the
admin of this website when it's finished
to come in and just select one of these
and add it in okay so the price of this
one is gonna be 100 pounds again pretty
expensive but again it's a ninja shoe
it's gonna make your really quick and
everything the next one we want is the
rating this is gonna be four so not
quite as good as the suit all right so
we'll publish oh no we need a featured
image and what looks like is to you and
that one won't do so what we've got left
we've got this weird but I think I'm
sort of key bulbs
all right so set featured image and
publish that we need to add now two more
so let's call this one let's call it
means you keep abs I'm really really
creative when it comes to names as you
can see we're gonna apply the menu items
category again the price is going to be
50 pounds this time and then the rating
is going to be three so they go down and
the next one it's gonna be two which is
you know really pumps then we're gonna
give it a featured image these are the
kabobs set that and we'll publish okay
and then finally what we're going to add
what was it will just call this weird
but now
think all right and we want to give it
the menu items again price is gonna be
you know what I'm gonna pay people to
eat this because it's not bad - 50 and
then the rating I wish I could give it -
but we'll just give it one so we'll add
that as well all right and then we just
need that featured image this horrible
looking thing right there and then it
looks like you've got pepper on or
something
god knows what that is and we'll publish
this and voila I think we should be all
done leg now if we look at all posts
they're all here with banana thing all
the way down - ninja soup so now what
we're gonna do in the next lesson is
dive into this code again we're going to
go into the index file which is here
index dot PHP and what we're going to do
is in this loop is it this loop where oh
no it's the front page we created front
page didn't win that's right
okay so within this we're gonna replace
all this section here with the dynamic
loop to go in grab those four blog posts
and output the data that we've put in
them there okay so that's coming in the
very next lesson if you have any
questions about this lesson whatsoever
