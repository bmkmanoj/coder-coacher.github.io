18th or wealth tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
redirect users based on their
authentication status okay then so far
if we go through the OAuth process we're
logging in with Google passport is doing
its thing it's identifying which piece
of information we want to stuff in a
cookie we're encrypting that cookie it
was sending it out and right now what
we're doing is we're sending back this
response here we're sending back the
user which is now attached to the
request object thanks to passport which
we can then send to the user so if we
log in let's just view this one more
time using Google and we get that object
back and we can see that we are logged
in this is Who I am right now typically
if we log in to a website we don't want
to be sending like an object back of
your details that's just really bad if
we want to do something else we want to
maybe send them to a dashboard or their
profile page so that's what we're going
to do we don't want to send this right
here so let's comment this dude out and
instead let's redirect them let's send
them to a profile page okay so I'm gonna
say response dot redirect such simple it
is to do this in Express and then where
do we want to redirect them to which you
are out well I want to forward them to a
forward slash profile okay
so if we save this now and try and run
it then we're gonna get some kind of 404
error you can't find this route because
we've not set it up over here and I can
show you that I'll log in with Google
and we're gonna get some kind of error
cannot get profile all right so instead
what we need to do now is set up this
route but I don't want to set it up in
the authentication route because this is
an /or /tpour file it's a separate
entity it belongs in a separate file so
let's create now a file for profile
routes so I'm going to go to new file in
routes and call this profile
- routes ojs and
the first thing we need to do is import
at the top the Express auto source a
Const router is equal to require
and it's Express router okay
so we've made a new instance of this
router and this router instance is going
to control all of the profile routes
make sense so let's set this router up
so I'll say router get and it's just
going to be forward slash remember we
don't need to put profile because when
we go to a pas later and use these
routes much like we did with the earth
routes we're going to say app use
forward slash profile profile routes ok
so if someone goes to forward slash
profile nothing else after it this right
here is gonna be the base URL the base
route that they go to and this is where
we're going to handle it so we'll take
in the request object and the response
object right here and then fire a
function and inside this function what
do we want to do well eventually we're
gonna render some kind of profile page
but for now let's just send something to
the page for example response dots send
and we'll say something like you are
logged in
this is your profile
then we'll tack on
request user remember we have access to
this user object now on the request
object thanks to passport dot username
because dot username is a property we
have a look at the model on our record
so we're grabbing that user name from
the user that's logged in and without
putting it ok so let's save this and
before we can use this route we have to
use it inside a pas so let's go over
here and where the other routes are poor
throughout so I'm going to copy this and
just paste it underneath then I'm going
to change this to profile
and change this to profile over here as
well
we also need to use these so where we
have author outs I'm gonna just ctrl
shift d to add a new line and then say
this is gonna be profile and this is
going to be profile as well oops
don't want it in square brackets
okay so now we can use these routes and
hopefully went in this route right here
we're redirecting two forwards left
profile the application is going to find
that route you're going to handle it
over here and send this response to the
browser now okay
so let's save it and view this in a
browser over here so let's log in again
it's gonna redirect us to forward slash
whoops nope we must have an error and
that stupid low because I've not
exported this over here so let's a
module that exports is equal to the
router that we've just created save that
now hopefully this should work if I go
back log in with Google again
and now we get you are logged in this is
your profile the net ninja awesome so
we've redirected them now to a profile
page and yes this profile page doesn't
look great all right but we are
eventually going to send them a view
which is going to look better and that
if you can display information about
their profile but the whole idea behind
this redirecting them to their profile
is good so one more thing if this thing
right here is a profile we don't want
people who are not logged in to view the
profile does that make sense
for example if I open a new incognito
window and go to localhost 3000 and then
forward slash profile we don't want
people who are not logged in to view
this right and we just get an error and
that's bad for the user so if I'm not
logged in we don't want this to show
instead we just want to redirect them so
how can we do that how can we check if
someone is logged in and secured a page
well pretty simply over here I'm just
gonna create a function and this
function is gonna be called author check
so I'm going to say Const off check and
set that equal to a function just an
arrow a function and in here we're going
to set the request object the response
object and next now essentially what
we're doing here is just creating a
little bit of middleware
right and this middleware is going to be
injected right here in between this
thing and this thing much like we did
with passport over here where we
injected some
whether so that when we come to this
route it finds this first then this
right we're doing exactly the same thing
over here what we're going to do is
create some middleware here a function
that is going to sit in between these
things so it fires this function first
before this function right and sending
the response so this function is going
to be responsible for checking if the
user is logged in because if the user is
not logged in right here then we don't
want to carry on and do this but if the
person is logged in then we do want to
carry on under this we want to show them
their username because then we won't get
an error make sense okay cool so let's
just do a little check and how can we
check if a user is logged in well
remember we have access to request user
so if that is a true value it means that
the user is logged in so if this
is true it means the user is logged in
okay and if it's not true then it means
the user is not logged in so we want to
check if they're not logged in so
instead of checking this because if
they're not logged in this is gonna be
false we want this to be true so we put
a little exclamation mark in front of it
to say okay well reverse that okay so
therefore if the user is not logged in
then this will be false however this
will reverse that so it becomes true
therefore this code block executes so
this executes if user is not logged in
okay so then what we can do here is
redirect that user so we'll say response
stop redirect and we're gonna read that
them to forward slash auth toy slash
login the login page right saying hey
you're not logged in so you can't view
your profile their fault will send you
to the login page however if they are
logged in then this right here will be
true
the exclamation map will reverse that
meaning it's going to be false the whole
thing here therefore this won't execute
but the else statement will so if
they're logged in then what we want to
do is just call next and we do this in
middleware to say okay go on to the next
piece of middleware which is going to be
this the next function right so now what
we need to do is insert this function
right here
orthe check into this part does that
make sense so this bit of code right
here is going to fire when we go to this
route to make sure that we are logged in
and if we're logged in then it's going
to say next okay that's fine you can go
to this bit then it's going to find this
function and show the username if we're
not logged in then we're going to
redirect to this page so the user can
log in so let's save that and try this
out I'm going to refresh over here now
and if I got to forward slash profile
it's gonna redirect me to that login
page make sense however when I am logged
in if I go back log in with Google
when I am logged in and I go to fold /
profile I see this so that's how we can
check whether a user is logged in and
redirect them if they're not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
