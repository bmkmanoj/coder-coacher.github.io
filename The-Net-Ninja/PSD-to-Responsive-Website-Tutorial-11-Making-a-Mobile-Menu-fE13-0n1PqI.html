at eleventh PSD to responsive website
tutorial and in this video we're gonna
start making our mobile drop-down menu
Wow so this is where we left off we did
a few stars for our mobile and that was
at 480 pixels the breakpoints so what I
need to do now is create this mobile
menu because everything else is pretty
much all ready for mobile so I'm gonna
make some Styles first of all then we're
gonna jump back into the code and we're
going to make a JavaScript file to
control the functionality of this
drop-down menu so let's start this up
first now we want to grab the Li tags
here and we want to change those
currently they're going left to right or
I'll floated left and I want them one
after another going down like this so
they're in the header and then they're
in the nav and then they are Li tags so
we need to clear the flow I'll get rid
of the flow brother
so we'll say float naught and then they
go downwards then I want to give them a
width of 100% because currently the
upper width of 16-point sticks and then
I'm gonna get rid of any marking that
they may have as well next thing we're
gonna do is just get the Naville Ament
so it's header now and I'm just gonna
give this a background of some kind of
gray she's gonna be about five five five
like that
now you're gonna notice that this
doesn't go all the way to the edge of
the screen now I want it to so to do
that we have to edit the wrapper in the
header if we go to the HTML you'll see
in the header right here does this
wrapper and it's got some padding left
and right so we need to get rid of that
you can see the width is 96% and the
padding is zero and two percent so let's
sort that out source a header wrapper
and then what we'll do is get rid of any
padding zero if the width to be 100%
like that and that will do a thing and
then I think there's some margin going
on here somewhere let's have a look at
that
that's the header so there's some
padding on the header so we'll get rid
of that as well
so we'll say header padding-bottom zero
and that gets rid of that gap right
there okay so the next thing we want to
do is style these links because
currently the tutor huh can you view
that as it is you're not gonna be able
to see any of those so let's say header
nav Li a and then then here the first
thing we'll do is give them a display
type of block and then a text align
Center and then padding 10 pixels just
so they spread out a little bit that's
why we give it a display type of block
so we can apply that padding all the way
around it but then the color is gonna be
a very much lighter gray so we're saying
no no no something like that that's cool
and then we'll just give each link a
border top property of one pixels solid
and then about 4 F 4 F 4 F which is a
slightly darker gray just to split those
up a little bit alright now that what we
need to do is control the functionality
of this menu and to do that we need to
click on that little big enough icon
that we made earlier on in this tutorial
playlist so currently if we look in the
HTML because you've got this wrap and
then we've got this nav h2 and then
right here we've got this deer with an
ID of Berk and have now currently
there's nothing in it and it's not
stabbed whatsoever in the CSS so we need
to apply some kind of styles and
background image to it in the CSS so
that people can see this burger nav icon
on mobile screens so let's go down here
and let's get that burger - nav and what
we'll do is give it a width first of all
with 100% and then a height of 40 pixels
and then we'll give it a background or a
URL which is images Berger PNG like that
and it's repeating all over the show we
don't want that that was stupid let's
all say no-repeat and then what we want
to do is position it all the way to the
right pretty much all say no yet
across to the right and then sense they
just all line essentially from top to
bottom
in that little bit there okay I also
want to give this a cursor above the
pointer just so that when you hover over
it you can see that you can press it
okay now I know you don't see that on
mobiles but it's just nice to have that
effect if you do have a tiny screen
where you can't have this hover over
effect so let's move on to the next bit
and the idea is that when we click this
then this is going to expand and by
default it's not going to show then when
we click it again it's going to zoom
back up to the top all right so what we
need to do is control the height of the
UL so say head enough you well alright
height is gonna be 0 by default okay
like that but you can still see these
things down here and that's because
we've not set the overflow property to
hidden like that
okay now we can't see anything that's
beyond the zero height all right so now
what we need to do is prepare for when
this is clicked and what I want to do is
when this is clicked I want to give this
you well right here a class of open in
the code so when you click it this
becomes you well got open right and then
what we'll do is we'll override that
height there now you weld opt open so
when it has this class we give it a
height of auto okay so now if I go in
the elements right here and I just edit
this editors HTML and I do this class
and calls don't burn you can see now it
shows okay but when I take this class
away like that it closes and that's the
functionality of this thing right here
when we click it it's going to give it a
class of open when we click it again
it's going to take that class away all
right so that's the CSS sorted so we'll
grab all of that now copy it and jump
back into our code go to the styles and
get rid of all that and paste it in the
new stuff and then what I want to do is
start linking up some JavaScript into
this file so I'm going to come down here
and what I need to do is first of all
link up to a file in here so we'll do
script source equals then we'll just say
menu J s okay like that now we're gonna
use jQuery in this menu J s I'm gonna
create this file right here new file
then you've got J s and we're going to
use jQuery in it now currently jQuery is
not linked up in our document so what we
need to do is add a script above this
one because this rack is going to depend
on jQuery so we need to add jQuery above
it and to do that I'm going to use a
jQuery CDN alright guys so I've got
ahead to code jQuery comm this is where
we're going to grab the CDN from and
basically a CDN is a content delivery
network which means we don't have to
download the file itself and put it in
our folders and link to it there we can
just link to it in this content delivery
network which is hosted online somewhere
and the idea is that if a lot of sites
use jQuery and also use this CDN then
users won't have to download the
JavaScript file over and over again when
they visit different web sites so when
they come to yours they're probably
already going to have that jQuery CDN
and they don't need to download it again
so it's going to make your website load
quicker so we'll go and download this by
the way downside is that we can't
develop offline we have to be online
when we're linking to a CDN so if you
want to develop offline then you can go
ahead and download the file okay so now
we've linked up to jQuery and we've also
linked in our menu J's file so now I
need to do is go in here and do the
functionality so the first thing we want
to do is a document dot ready statement
and then a function is going to fire
when a document is ready and within that
function is where we're going to control
the menu now by the way if you need to
brush up on your jQuery skills I'll
leave a link to the jQuery for beginners
playlist down below I've done that here
on YouTube so you can go check that out
so I'm not going to be going into any
great depth about what this means like
things like this and this right so if
you want to check out that course feel
free to do so but I'm only going to do a
little bit of jQuery here so the next
thing we're going to do is go after the
burger now right here and then on the
element I'm going to attach a click
event so on click
fire this function so when someone
clicks that it's gonna fire this
function in here like this and then what
we want to do is toggle that open class
okay so when someone clicks it we want
to either give it give that ul a class
of open or take it away if it already
has it and the way we can do that is by
using the toggle class function in
jQuery so first of all let's grab the UL
header now ul and toggle class is the
function and the class we wanna toggle
is open and you might be surprised guys
but that is pretty much it that's all we
need to do in the menu gif file so now
when we go ahead and click if we refresh
first of all and then click on this you
can see jump down click on it again jump
up ok so that's how it's going to work
on mobile and you can see in the
elements that when we click on it this
URL gets a class of open when we click
on it again it takes it away ok so there
we go guys that is the mobile done now
we're pretty much there I want to do one
more thing and that is to do with this
banner image right here the default size
of this is really large like that so if
we're viewing it on a mobile we're
downloading this huge image when we
don't really need to we really only need
to download an image roughly about that
size so we're going to look at that and
how we can overcome it in the very next
tutorial don't forget to share subscribe
and like guys and if you have any
questions as always feel free to leave
your comment down below and I'll see you
