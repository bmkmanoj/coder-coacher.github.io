PSD to HTML and CSS lesson 2 and in this
video we're gonna start slicing and
saving our images Wow alright then guys
as you can see I've got this PSD open in
Photoshop and by the way if you've not
downloaded this yeah I've left a link to
this in the description you can go and
get that online and download it open it
up in Photoshop and we're gonna start
slicing some images so to do that we
want to come down here to this tool if
you right click that this three tools
the crop tool which we don't really need
the slice tool which we're going to use
to cut up our images and then this slice
select tool which we're going to use
later on so we select the images name
them resize them if we need to it with
that kind of thing so to begin with just
select this slice tool and then we're
going to zoom in a little bit what I do
is keep all the zed and kind of swipe
right with your mouse and then you want
to just draw a border around each one of
the images like that okay if you double
click it now you can rename it like that
I'll call mine logo you can change your
width and height there if you want to we
don't really need to for this and then
just click OK so let's zoom out a little
bit because we want to get this banner
next now this here is just plain text
and we can do this button as well in CSS
so what I'm going to do is click on
these layers I'm gonna hide them like
that and we'll just save this banner out
of the image so again get your slice
tool and just draw around the border of
the banner doesn't have to be perfect
like mine's not perfect there at the
bottom but this will be double click
that will call it banner click OK
and then follow these three here I'm
going to do the same as well as these
down here and what I'll do now is just
pause the video because this is gonna be
quite boring if you're just watching me
slice things so I'm going to pause it
there do exactly the same with the rest
of the images then unpause it when I've
done everything alright then guys as you
can see now I've selected each image
that I need we've got this banner at the
top so the logo at the top the banner
these three icons here which I've called
CS 1 cs2 and cs3 stands for content spot
one two and three and I've got this
quote here I've got this map here I've
not done this one here yet I'll do that
now and we'll call this had okay and
then I've knocked on these little icons
right at the bottom let's just zoom into
those because I'm gonna do something
slightly different with these now
instead of slicing each icon
individually what I'm gonna do is grab
each icon put them in a row like this
and then I'm gonna slice them all as one
image and the reason I'm doing that is
to create what's called an image sprites
and an image sprite it's just one image
with loads of different icons of small
images normally squash together on that
image now in the CSS we can just show
one of these icons at a time that's a
cool little trick and it's gonna save
the server from downloading all the
different images onto your computer so
it's more efficient to do it this way
I'll show you how to do it later on in
the CSS for now just worry about slicing
this as one image make sure you've got
sufficient room in between each one like
that
all right there so I'll call this logo
whole - sprite like okay and everything
else is saved this one here is called
map if we just go to a slice like tool
now we can double click on each of these
slices you can see that's called map
this one is called head this one here is
called quote and these like a sail
called cs2 cs1 cs3 I've made these ones
all the same dimensions because I want
them to look neat on the page so three
to five by 150 and then we've got our
banner and then the logo at the top so
let's just zoom out make sure we've got
everything which I think we have and by
the way normally when I was doing a
website like this I would use Google API
to get a proper interactive map on the
page but for this course because it's
like an introductory PSD to HTML and CSS
one I just want to use the image I'll do
something like this in the future so
what we'll do now to save all those
slices is go to file save for web and
devices and then we're just going to
make sure that each image is what we
want it to be now as a general rule of
thumb if it's a photo I'd use a JPEG and
I'd probably reduce this down to like
medium or something like that or high
depending on what the quality is like
you don't want to learn
to file downloading because then it
takes really long to download the file
and we're talking back to those days
when we had dial-up and you see coming
in a little bit of a little bits at a
time that's what happens if you have a
really large file so I probably decrease
this down to medium or something like
that
however for things like this where they
don't use many colors and they're kind
of not photo like I would change this
type into a PNG eight and save it as
that but select this one here I'll
change that no I'll keep that as a JPEG
see it's quite a photo like but I'm
going to change this to medium and you
can see the file size jumps right down
here which is cool if it said maximum
you can see it's 87 and at medium it's
just 12 okay so let's zoom down here you
can hold down space and then click and
drag to go down these ones here I use
PNG s4 because they're just like little
icons almost PNG PNG PNG by the way if
you do need some form of transparency in
the background for you PNG use we don't
in this particular instance but if you
do then you go to PNG 24 and make sure
this transparency box box is ticked
all right PNG 8 p-m g8 and this one here
PNG hey what I'll do is we'll call this
PNG 8 as well alright perfect so now if
we just click Save and we come to this
one here this drop down slices change
this to all user slices and that's going
to say about all the slices that we made
into an image folder here I'm just
saving this by the way in the root of
the j/s for beginners website directory
alright so let's save now it's just
gonna take a couple a minute alright
alright guys as you can see I've got
this brackets window open now and I'm
just navigating to a folder to open now
these are all the different courses I've
got currently on YouTube I've made a
folder in here the current course that
we're doing called website if you want
to just create that folder on your
desktop or somewhere on your computer
and then within that website folder this
is where I saved all my images you can't
see them there because brackets doesn't
recognize the PNG files all the JPEGs
but anyway I'm going to open up this
website right here this folder I'm going
to select folder in brackets and you can
do that by going to file and open folder
that's what I've done and that's brought
up this here so just click that and open
folder alright when you can see now the
images are at the root level over this
folder there's our resources and what
I'm going to do is just right click here
and click new file and I'm going to call
this index.html and then that's it so
this is ready now for our next lesson
where we're going to start padding out
the HTML of this document so if you have
any questions so far feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those otherwise I'll see you guys in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
