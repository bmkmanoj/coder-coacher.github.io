name's Shawn from the net ninja and this
is CSS beginners lesson six external
stylesheets
so we learned in the last lesson the
inline styling and embedded style sheets
can be pretty time-consuming and benefit
end developer is all about being more
efficient with your workflow and a great
way to do this with CSS is to use
external style sheets so whereas last
time if we had embedded statutes we'd
have to go through every page and change
those rules if we want to make a change
to specific types on those pages and
this way we just have one external file
one external stylesheet we make a change
on there and as long as that star she is
linked into every HTML page that's gonna
have the effect you want over all pages
so you just do it once instead of
multiple times massive massive time
saver and it's something you want to be
using in your workflow rather than
inline styling or embedded statutes so
what we're gonna do is go back to the
simple HTML file i've already created
and we're gonna add an external
stylesheet and make a few rules and just
demonstrate how this works so I'm back
here in the index.html file from last
lesson and I've just stripped out the
inline and embedded styles and I've
totally ripped out all of the CSS rules
from these syntax CSS file too now if
you've not got a CSS file yet all you
have to do is right-click this pane and
go to new folder to create this CSS
folder and then within that right-click
again to create this new file here and
remember to call it dot CSS at the end
that's what says it's a style sheet it
stands for cascading style sheets okay
so what we're gonna do now is to link
that within our head tag and if you've
not seen our HTML basics course leave a
link to the video which explains how to
add an external style sheet I'm gonna go
through it quickly here as well and it's
a link that we say rel before one of the
attributes and we're going to say this
is a style sheet rel
stands for relation remember the type is
going to be text slash CSS and then the
H reference is going to be this here so
where do we want it to point to well we
want it to go into the CSS folder first
of all so we say CSS and then we put a
forward slash to jump into that folder
brackets is suggesting this since I
store CSS here it's already found the
file so I'll just click that and we're
done I'll close that up now and I'm
gonna save this and then I'm going to
copy this jump into my concept HTML file
and place it in the head here also save
that and now we have this syntax dot CSS
linked to both the index and contact
HTML files so we can start adding some
rules in our syntax dot CSS file now and
one thing we did last time was change
all the P tags we added some Styles in
the head on both pages up here to change
the font size of the P tag so we're
going to do that again I'm gonna say P
open my parentheses enclose them and
then I'm going to give this a property
of font size of 18 pixels this time and
I'm going to say color is blue so what
all the P tags to have a font color of
blue and a font size of 18 pixels and
again don't pay attention to these
properties and values I'm just
demonstrating how we're linking the
stylesheet up in a minute we're going to
cover this later so just to show you
what this is done I'm going to save that
and then I'm going to right click index
first of all show an explorer we're
going to view this in a browser so I'm
going to go open with Google Chrome and
you can see there every PTAC all these
here and the one at the top is blue okay
let's go to the contact file I'm going
to minimize this and open this with
Chrome and same again everything in the
contact to us file is also blue
so hopefully that demonstrates how much
easier and how much quicker it is to
have this external stylesheet linked in
before we would have had to go into both
files and do that and change the rules
depending on what we wanted whereas now
we just have to go into this one file
and change the rule here so if I put red
and then save this again view this in
the browser everything's changed
and if we go back to the contactors page
and refresh everything's changed there
so really simple really easy to update
the best way to add CSS to your document
is via the external stylesheets so that
about covers it for this episode if you

questions as soon as I can
