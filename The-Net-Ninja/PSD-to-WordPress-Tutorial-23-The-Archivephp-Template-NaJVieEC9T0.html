WordPress lesson 23 and in this video
we're going to go through the archive
dot PHP template file or I think I've
shown the last lesson we created this
single dot PHP file and we start that up
to display blog posts right now an
archive page is one of these pages you
might click on this link right here it's
going to show me all the posts from that
particular date time okay this is an
archive page and there's different types
of archive pages so if we just look back
at this template hierarchy picture
there's all these different types of
archive pages you can see the Roman
archive pay so we've got author cut a
category custom post custom taxonomy
date archive which is your soldier and
tag archive now there are the different
types of archives and they're gonna look
for their own template files in your
theme folder or right here they can look
for all these right and if we've got any
of those then each archive is going to
use the respective template file that it
finds to render that page however in our
theme we don't have any of these so no
matter which archive page you land on
it's going to fall back on this archive
dot PHP file to render that page alright
and we don't need to create any of these
because there's no real neat reason for
me to display an author archive
any differently than a category archive
or a date archive and it differently
from a tag archive right so I don't need
to create those I'm just gonna make up
this archive dot PHP file that we
already have but if you wanted to
display something differently all you
need to do is create one of these files
and then cut out that PHP template as
you would like to display all right so
like saying we're just going to focus on
this archive dot PHP file in this
tutorial and they've got it open right
here on the left and basically we're
just getting the header again then we've
got the div of content area then main
then we've got this PHP to see we've got
any posts then we're going to output the
header which is just going to be the
archive title so if this was November
that it had output November then an
archive description if we've input
in the WordPress admin area is going to
display that as well then down here is
starting the loop and is going to loop
through all the posts that it finds in
that particular archive for example in
November gonna look through them all and
it's going to output them using this
template part the content and this right
here just gets the format's of the posts
that it's displaying so for example if
they're single post and it's going to
get the single content if you look in
here the template parts you can see
content single alright so that's what
let's do it then it's going to put the
posts navigation which like I say it's
just the pagination things like that and
then it's going to do an else and if it
doesn't find any posts it's gonna do
this function right here to get the
normal content dot PHP file and output
that and then we're ending those tags
and we've got our sidebar and our footer
at the bottom alright so I wanted to
display this page a little bit like the
post page where we've got the sidebar on
the right and we've got the content on
the left so to do that remember is we
needed to split this up into two gifts
one that floats on the left and one on
the right but first of all I just want
to put our wrapping so that it's all
contained within that central column so
I'm going to copy this over from the
right and I'm going to pop it in right
here
just like that and then come to the
bottom and close out my div there we go
so it's all within the wrapper and now
what I need to do is use that div with
an ID of post content around about here
in fact I'll put it above this if
statement so div ID equals post content
and this is the div that we used in
whoops misspelled this is the div that
we used in the last tutorial to contain
all this stuff on the left side of the
page so we're going to close that off
around about just above that div there
that'll do so we've got all that content
on the Left then what I want to do is
grab this sidebar put it up here then
I'm going to contain that within another
div tag and that's gonna have an ID of
sidebar
and that's gonna be floated on the right
and we already have all the styles for
this because we made them up in the last
tutorial so now if I open this and have
a look I'll refresh now you can see
we've got all the content now on the
left and the sidebar on the right so
pretty good yeah and these down here
these are just the the links that
WordPress output for us so that we can
edit the archive page if we wanted to
alright cool so that is the archive page
in a nutshell pretty simple to do I'm
just going to click on category archive
now just to make sure yeah that's being
loaded by the same template file do we
have any of those no we don't have any
others there but you get the point okay
so now archive dot PHP file is now
controlling all of our archive pages and
it's gonna use that template file to
output any data in any outcome so if you
have any questions whatsoever guys feel
free to comment down below otherwise
I'll see you in a very next tutorial
where we're gonna look at the 404 page
and the search page I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
