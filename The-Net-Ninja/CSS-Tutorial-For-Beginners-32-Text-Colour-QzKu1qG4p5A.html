this is CSS for beginners lesson 32 and
today we're gonna talk about text color
that's coming up Wow okay now before we
start I just want to go over this
there's two types of color property in
CSS okay we've got the first type which
is the text slash foreground color and
you've got another type which controls
the background color of elements now you
must have confused these because they're
totally different things okay and by the
way if there's any Americans out there
thinking no this dudes spell Quran what
a dick
well actually it guys it's just cuz I'm
English I'm sorry but in the CSS
property it is spelt the American way
without the U so now we know the
difference between those two properties
I'm going to jump into the code and show
you
Wow alright then let's get started with
some color properties so we're going to
tag a few different elements here on
this index page and the first one we're
going to start with is this h1 here
alright so it's within the header so
let's just type header h1 let's go to
grab that h1 tag for us and to specify a
foreground color we're simply right pull
it okay and by foreground color I mean
the actual content everything between
the tags so in this case the text and to
be honest pretty much all the time it's
going to be text this color property
here controls text pull so when we do
this by the way brackets comes up with a
huge list of keyword colors so we can
choose from any one of those chocolate I
like that let's go with that although it
does look a little bit too light for
chocolate if any of you guys have ever
tasted Cara Mac it looked a bit like
that anyway besides the point we can use
keywords here to control color if we're
not happy with this those keywords
there's other ways but let's just have a
look at this in the browser first of all
I'll get this opening Chrome all right
there we go so there's that chocolate
call it a bit orange to be honest it
looks like weight chocolate if yes
people there we go
it's changed the text color okay now
there are other options if we don't like
that lets go after the h2 within the
head
and give this a color property or soap
and yeah there's lots of colors here but
say that's not quite what we want we
want to be more specific safe some
designer is really picking over the
colors okay he's designed this PSD this
probably shop file for you handed it
over to you and he says look get the
cooler spot on well you can go into
Photoshop and if you've used Photoshop
before you're probably familiar with hex
code and the way we do this is just put
a little pound symbol here or hash sign
whatever you want to call it and then we
just pull up six characters now I'm not
going to go into too much detail about
this I'm just gonna make any old it's a
nice blue color anyway I'm gonna do a
couple of videos later under the course
explaining loads of different ways to do
color because there are various ways of
doing it we can do an RGB format or HSL
format and again if you're familiar with
Photoshop then you'll know what I'm
talking about if not don't worry about
it we're gonna do a couple of videos
later on in the course about it for now
I just want to show you how to apply
colors to text and the difference
between the foreground and the
background color so either way we can do
a color like that and let's save it and
view it in a browser again I'll pull
with chrome yeah and don't those colors
look nice together okay so that's how we
control the default brown color now the
difference between that and the
background color is this say we want to
give this header the whole section of
the header a background color and I've
done this earlier in the course I told
you to ignore it
so you're probably going to be familiar
with this but it's just simply
background color okay and again we get
all those options let's give it an aqua
white color why not and antique white
rather and view this in a browser open
with Chrome
all right so now you can see the whole
header background is this weird kind of
orangey yellow color this pale yellow
and then that differs from these which
control the font color alright so that's
the difference guys and this by the way
you can also right
background there's like a shot way of
doing it and you can give it a kool-aid
do the same wave let's just copy and
paste that get rid of this and that's
gonna do exactly the same thing the only
differences with this background thing
here you can pass multiple things not
just a color but also like a background
image and I'll just quickly show you
that you could put URL and then put your
URL of a background image in there and
you can do various other things with it
but either way that controls the
background color so that's the different
skies pretty simple and this is again a
pretty short video but if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to throw
a comment down below and answer those as
soon as I can
otherwise if you enjoy these videos
please guys subscribe share these videos
are just like them and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
