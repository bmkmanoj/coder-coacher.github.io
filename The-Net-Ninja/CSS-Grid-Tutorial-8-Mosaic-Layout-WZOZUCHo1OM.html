CSS grid tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how to use CSS grid to
make a mosaic layout alright so I think
we're getting to grips with how to
display elements on a grid and how to
lay them out in different ways so in
this video I want to move on and show
you something which is slightly more
advanced but not really and that is how
to create some kind of mosaic layout so
as you can see it the minute I've still
got this div with an ID of content
that's serving as our grid rappers still
then we have these five divs right here
with the class of 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
these are the elements we're going to
lay out onto our grid in some kind of
mosaic style now at the minute they all
have a background of this kind of
charcoal gray and the content right here
all we've done is displayed it is grid
and give it a max width we can take this
position of relative off we don't need
that and imagine that was zero and auto
so it is centered on the page so at the
minute it's going to look something like
this where each element inside that grid
is just stacked on top of it and that's
because we've not defined our columns
yet so let's do that first of all right
I would like to create a grid with six
columns so I'm gonna say grid - template
- columns and then we're going to set
this equal to the repeat function first
of all and then inside we're gonna
repeat some of his six times because we
want six columns and each column is
going to be one fraction so all the same
width then I'd like to set the row
height and to do that I'm going to use
grid or two rows so grid - Auto - and
rows and I can set a min max for the
height so the minimum is going to be 150
pixels and the maximum is going to be
auto in case there's any content inside
any one of the divs it's going to auto
to that height instead finally I want to
give this a grid - gap of 10 pixels so
we have that kind of gap between each
one of the columns and row so now I mean
it'll look something like this in its
place in one of these elements inside
each of the columns now we have six in
total and there's only five elements
which is why we have a gap on the right
as well so now let's start displaying
these elements on the grid in different
areas so that it creates some kind of
mosaic layout right so I'm going to use
these classes one through
five to do that so let's style up one
first of all so the first element right
here where do we want that to sit well
I'm going to use grid
- column to say where we want it to sit
in terms of the columns and it's going
to start at column line bottom which is
on the very left and it's going to go
all the way up to column line three so
let's take a look at that it spans two
columns over here now I don't only want
this to take up one row in height I'd
like this to take up several rows in
Heights I want it to go up to row line
five so that's one two three four five
so it means it's going to kind of span
four rows in total if you like so to do
that I'll say grid - row it's gonna go
from one all the way to five save that
and we can see now this take off this
high over it cool okay so let's move on
to the second element I'll say over here
- and then inside I'm gonna say grid
- column now where do we want this to
sit in terms of columns well I want this
to sit from column three which is right
here where this one ends remember one
two three and I wanted to go all the way
up to the end so column line seven
because we have six columns and it's
always six plus one if you like for the
column lines so we want it to go from
three to seven if we save that we can
view that right here now I also want
this to be twice the size in height so
two span over two rows instead of just
one so I'm gonna say grid - row and set
this from one which is the very top to
three so now we get number two over here
cool all right let's move on to number
three now we'll say down here three and
where do we want this to sit well I'm
gonna say grid - column is going to go
from three to five so this in essence is
gonna sit in the middle of the grid
right here this is column line three one
two three and it's gonna go all the way
to 5 so three four five over here right
so it's gonna sit in the middle of the
grid if you like I also want it to go
down so
spans two rows as well so ends round
about here so I want it to go from the
grid Row 3 to 5 so 1 2 3 4 5 down here
so we went from row line 3 to roll on 5
so let's say grid - row over here and
again we want to go from 3 to 5 and we'd
get like a square in the middle now
right so let us now do number 4 so
underneath here I'll say 4 and how do we
want to star this well first of all I'm
going to say grid - column and that's
going to be from 5 to 7 and I'll show
you what this is gonna look like 5 right
here all the way 6 7 to the end of the
grid and they also want this to span
kind of all the way down here about the
same height as this right so we want it
to start right here at row line 3
remember 1 2 3 and we want it to go all
the way up to row line 7 so 3 4 5 6 7
down here somewhere so I'll say grid -
row is gonna go from 3 to 7 all right
save that view over here and now we can
see sponge all the way down here now the
final element I want to take up this
whole space over here right so let's
style that will say 5 and then inside
here we want the grid column to go from
1 which is the very start all the way up
to 5 which is gonna be over here 1 2 3 4
5 right so save that and we can see it
stretch all the way over here now we
want to make it twice the size in terms
of depth so two columns instead of 1 so
we want it to go from grid - column and
we want it to go from column 5 all the
way to 7 so let's view this and it's not
gone quite as I'd expect it to that's
because they've done column twice
instead of saying row so grid row now
goes from 5 to 7
alright so if we make this full size we
can see this is kind of like a mosaic
style now and this was really
simple to do with CSS grid without any
kind of floats or hockey techniques just
placing elements onto a six column grid
that is seriously cool and if you wanted
to you could get really funky with this
kind of design and you could do
something like this
I'm just going to grab the content div
again keeping it separate from the one
at the top up here where we style
content just so we can see the
difference and I'm gonna say transform
and I'll rotate the z-axis by I don't
know 45 degrees and then I'm also going
to scale the whole thing down say by not
point seven all right so let's view this
now check this out we've got some kind
of weird diamond into shape now so we
can create these kind of layouts and if
you imagine each one of these could be
some kind of thumbnail for an image in
your portfolio or something create these
kind of things really simply using CSS
