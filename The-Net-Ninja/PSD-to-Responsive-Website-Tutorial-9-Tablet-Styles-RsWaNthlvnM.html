native PSD to responsive website
tutorial and in this video we're gonna
start making our responsive styles in
particular the tablet styles are again
so basically this is what the website
looks like so far for desktop we've got
everything styled and ready to go so now
what I want to do is just start styling
things up for tablets because as we get
smaller and shrink this it starts to
look a little squashed so to do that I'm
going to do everything in the Google
Chrome developer tools only to lose
right click and go to inspect and then
that's going to bring up the developer
tools then what you need to do is go to
sources and that brings you all the
different sources here on the left so
we've got the style dot CSS file right
there that we can click on and we can
see all those Styles in there as well so
what I will do is just move this on a
little bit I'm going to make this a bit
bigger by pressing ctrl+ just so you
guys can see and that's a little bit too
big I think alright that'll probably do
so let's stop making some styles now
where do we put our first breakpoint now
there's typically sets of breakpoints
that people use things like 960 pixels
or 768 pixels for tablets or for innate
pixels for mobiles it's down to you when
you want to use them you don't have to
use them at any specific points I tend
to use a few of those specific ones
because then it does catch a lot of
different devices but what I tend to do
is just move my browser window or
viewport window across until things
starts a little squashed and currently
everything seems to be fine at the
minute so if you're viewing it on a
device that is this big then I see
nothing wrong with viewing like this at
all however when it does get to about
knowledge of the 60 pixels it does start
to look a little squash things down here
especially looks squashed so I think
what we'll do is make that breakpoint at
960 pixels so what I'm gonna do right
here is just make a little comment and
I'm gonna say media queries just so we
know in the CSS where these start and
then down here I'm gonna do my first
media query which is at oops I've enough
flows that there we go that's media and
then screen is the device type so it's
going to get
with the screen and going to attach a
filter with it which is going to have a
max width of 960 pixels like that so now
basically this is going to pick up
everything that's below 960 pixels in
width
and the first thing I want to do is make
these into two in a row rather before so
they've got two here and then two below
so to do that what I need to do is grab
the selling points Li which is these
things if we inspect that element you're
gonna find that out you can see the
current rule is their selling point and
its width is 23% let's get a planning of
1% book I'm gonna change that off for
screens less than now no just 60 pixels
in width and what I want to do is make
the width about 40% like that and then
it's essential centralize those a little
bit more what I'm going to do is just
affect the margin and the padding so the
panning is going to be zero and 5% and
the margin is gonna be 20 pixels top and
bottom and then zero left or right just
to make sure they've got a bit of
spacing going downwards like that so now
we've got four types in width and a
padding of 5% on each side left and
right which makes each one fifty percent
in total so 50 and 50 makes 100 right so
that's what we're doing to centralize
those and to make them two in a row that
looks a bit better it's not squashed and
so next I want to move on to the footer
I think this looks alright for the time
being so I'll just move on to the foot
because that start to look a little
squashed as well so each one of these is
a ul in the footer and currently it's
25% in width
sorry about that that's my tablet going
up okay so what I'll do is now make each
one of those 50% in width so I'll say
footer ul you look inside and then I
want to make each one 50% in width
softly with 50% and that still looks a
bit cat so what I need to do now is get
one of those this one here and Clery
because the reason this is happening is
we've floating each one to the left so
this is for it left the
is fluid left and it's not as tall as
this one so this one's fluid left as
well and it's coming up here because
this left one over here isn't cleared so
this needs to clear the floats so what I
need to do is say footer youwell and
child and then we'll just say odd and
then we'll clear both so that place the
floats just like that so what I'm saying
here is any odd number when it comes to
the you ELLs then clear that salt this
is it on number one so this is going to
clear any floats this is even so it
won't clear the let flow and it will be
floated over there next to it this is
odd it's number three so that is going
to clear the floats that's not this is
even so it doesn't clear the floats and
then if we did add any other columns in
then that's going to clear the float as
well if it's an odd number so the first
one in each row alright so next what I
want to do is just make this quote a
little bit wider because it starts to
squash a little bit to kind of small in
the sense of so to do that all I need to
do is grab the quilt ID which is
controlling it and then what I will do
is give this a width of 90 percent and
I'll give any padding or forty pixels
top and bottom still and then five
percent left to right so five percent
plus five percent plus 90 is eight
hundred percent in total so what I'll
square there alright so what that will
do for this break point I'm going to do
one more breakpoint in this tutorial and
we'll just make it go on a little bit
more this still looks alright
yeah still looking all right let's go
further okay now these are starting to
look a little bit squashed now so what
I'll do is make another break point here
and the break point I'm going to do is
at about seven six eight pixels which is
one of those that a lot of people tend
to use I use it a lot 768 pixels so
let's do that now so I'll say at media
screen and then we'll attach this filter
max with 768 pixels and that will do
this now we'll start making these rules
so I think what I'll also do is bring
the navigation down onto the line below
this
logo because he starts to run out of
room a little bit so to do that I'll say
header mouth and then smoked non Luke's
a random up sign there we've done that
and there we go float now is that
working head a nap let's just see what's
going on with that now I've had an
outflow rights oh I think it's because
we've not quite hitting that break point
yeah that's right okay so floating on
and then what I'll do is header nav Li
we're going to style these up a little
differently we're gonna say we want
margin left to be zero and then the
width is going to be sixteen point six
six percent and that's because there's
six with them one two three four five
six and one hundred divided by six is
around this percentage this goes on
non-recurring but we can't do that CSS
so that will do for the width and then
the texture line is gonna be Center so
it's in the center of that 16 percent of
width it's a assign to it then the font
size will make a little bit smaller 14
pixels something like that okay and then
what I want to do is grab this logo this
one right here so header h1 dot logo it
was and we're going to get rid of the
float of that as well so we'll say float
not notice now the navigation comes down
below it and then what we'll do is
centralize it so I want to say margin is
going to be zero at the top then it's
going to be auto left and right just to
give it a bit more margin at the bottom
I'll see about 15 pixels there we go and
then the the navigation has got a bit
more room there to breathe that looks
better
okay let's come down here and should we
sort these things out so it's the latest
work idea think let's just double check
main banner selling points latest work
yet so let's grab that latest - work and
then the ally tags within it we want
because each one of these is an li tag
ok so what I'm going to do is make this
a width of 60%
so it's just gonna be one in a row but
then I want to centralize it so again
I'm gonna give it a margin of 30 pixels
top and bottom then 20% left and right
like that and it's doing it for the top
one on the bottom one but not this
middle one and that's because we had a
rule earlier on that kind of gave this a
different margin I think using the enth
child so what we need to do this one
here because it's more specific is
overriding this one so I need to put an
important declaration there just
override that or I could have done it
using a more specific you know selector
there and use the empty child again but
I just think for this one case that is
fine okay so that's looking a bit better
I do want to centralize this h2 I think
it is at the top as well so I'll just
say in fact they don't need to be
floated anymore either so I'll just
remove that float okay cool and then
this one here is latest - work h2 and
then I want to do is text align this to
the center and that's going to bring it
right into the middle like that okay so
this is how it's going to look for some
tablets and whatnot and also maybe even
this is how it's gonna offer some
tablets depending on the size of the
tablets so what we're going to do in the
next tutorial because this looks pretty
good now is go even further and reduce
this width even more so we get to about
this size or something like that because
this that's a lot of squash and then
we're going to make a mobile style for
this design okay so until then guys if
you have any questions feel free to
leave a comment down below otherwise
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
