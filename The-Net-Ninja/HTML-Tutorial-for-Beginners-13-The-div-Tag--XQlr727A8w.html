and this is HTML basics for lesson 13
the diptych now I know I've used the div
tag here and there in previous lessons
but I've never really explained what
it's for or what it's about so that's
what this lesson is all about and we're
going to do that or right now so the div
tag simply stands for division and
that's essentially what a div tag is all
about it divides sections of code into
segments in essence we use the div tag
to group content into specific sections
and that's what we're going to do now
okay I'm here back in the index file
exactly where I left it off last time
and like I said the div tag is used to
divide content into specific sections so
say for example we have this kind of top
bit here which is the banner and then
the welcome text we could consider that
some kind of top section like a section
on its own we could put a div tag around
that likewise this UL tag here which is
the navigator the navigation we could
wrap all this within a div tag too
because it's all one section and it's
separate from the topic so we're going
to start putting some div tags around
these things here so we'll open with a
div like that and then close with a div
copy and paste that to the bottom and
then I'm just going to indent these
three lines here by highlighting and
clicking tab just for readability and
we're going to do exactly the same with
other sections on our website so we'll
do the UL tag here indent nap and then I
think this here types of fish we sell
I'd consider that a section of its own
so I'm going to pop that in a div tag
and indent the code in between I think
the about the about Us section here is
worthy of a section of its own so I'm
going to pop that within a div tag to
and indent the code oops and then
finally we've got this contact or
section at the bottom which I think also
belongs in its own div tag so there we
go now each section on this web page is
contained within this division tag so
it's divided into all these different
segments and if I preview this in a
browser right now it's going to have no
visual impact whatsoever however when we
start using the divs with IDs classes
and CSS that's when it becomes really
useful we can start applying styles to
the elements within each div section so
I think there's three main reasons I'd
use a div tag on my HTML document first
of all it logically divides the content
intersections so that it's easier for me
as a developer to come back into the
code and know where everything is as
well as other developers if they were to
pick up this code and look at it they
can see that it's divided into logical
sections and they know where everything
is
the second reason is to do with CSS when
we start using CSS it's going to become
a little easier to attach certain styles
to elements within the document when
they're divided into specific regions
especially when we combine the div tags
with IDs and classes which I'm going to
teach you about shortly in probably the
next few lessons thirdly it's for
semantic reasons you're going to see in
the next few lessons as we start to use
IDs and classes that we can give these
different sections that we divide in in
essence a name our identifier which kind
of represents that area for example a
header area which would be this top bit
here or a navigation area which is going
to be this part so like I said div tags
themselves have no visual impact on our
page but when we combine these with CSS
rules and ID's that's when it's going to
come into play so I mean that's all
there is to show you about the div tag
itself in the next few tutorials I'm
going to talk about IDs and classes and
see
assess a little bit more so we'll expand
on these div tags then and I'll see you
guys in the next lesson if you have any
