26th bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at modal's
Wow all right there so what is a modal
well a modal is typically a little box
that kind of pops up on your website
when you click a button with some more
information or something like that so
we're gonna create one of those in this
tutorial and there's a lot of divs
involved so it's a really good idea to
comment your code as you go along I've
already created these little comments
records so we're going to pop all our
HTML within that and I'm going to
comment everything else as we go along
okay so the kind of functionality I want
to install on this website is when you
click this link it's more info link
we're going to pop up a modal right here
with more information about how to
become a ninja so we'll start off with
the containing element the containing
div and that has a class of modal now we
also want to give this a unique ID and
it needs to be unique in that we're
going to latch on to it later on when we
hook up the functionality with this link
so I'm just going to call it my modal so
I'm super creative and then I'm going to
add another div within here and this is
gonna have a class of modal dialog now
I'm going to throw out quite a few
classes at you here and I don't expect
you to remember all of them I certainly
don't but when you need to create a
modal or anything else in bootstrap all
you need to do is head over to the
documentation and it will tell you
everything you need to know to refresh
your memory
this tons of classes in bootstrap and to
remember them all would be ridiculous so
don't worry about remembering everything
just get a comment here to say where
these divs end so this is the modal
dialog so I'll just write end the modal
dialog and that is typically what I deal
when i'm commenting my code up I'll just
put end and then the class name or ID
name and I do the same right here which
is and modal well right now and then
within this modal dialog we need another
div and that's going to have a class of
modal - content like that okay and then
within here we need another couple of
divs the first one is going to have a
class of modal header
and this is where the header of our
modal pop is gonna go so we'll do that
and then underneath that we're gonna do
a div with a class of modal body and
that's where the main text is going to
go
we just comment this out here and modal
content that will do alright so we can
have a foot as well as the header and
body I'm just going to use these two
because they don't really mean a foot in
this example add them if you want to it
gives you some kind of thing similar to
this in the panel where we can typically
add links or buttons or the content all
right
so within the header now what I'm going
to do is just add a hate to with how to
be a badass ninja like that I'm going to
give this hate to a class of oops plus
of modal - title alright that just
reduces the size of the text a little
bit so it's not so wham in-your-face and
I prefer it now down here in the body
we're going to add a couple of px just
to give it some content I'm going to
grab that bacon ipsum right there and
paste it in oops
I'm not copied that correctly so copy
that and then paste it in alright I
should do and that is pretty much our
modal HTML done right there the next
thing we need to do is hook it up to
this and you'll notice even though I
saved and I'll refresh again by default
nothing is showing on here okay all of
this content is hidden and that's
because bootstrap is clever enough to
understand that you've created a modal
pop-up here and you only want to show it
when something happens on your page like
when someone clicks on a more info link
so what we're going to do now is hook up
that functionality so we'll come down to
this link right here this a tag and all
we need to do is just add a couple of
attributes on this tag so the first one
is gonna be data - toggle and you should
be pretty familiar with that now because
we've used it in another couple of
things like the carousel so far and
we're just going to say modal for that
then the next attribute is gonna be data
- a target and this is going to be equal
to the ID that we gave our modal which
is right up here so let's grab that and
we'll paste it down here where is it
there now we do need to put a hash
symbol in front that's kind of like the
ID sign so we'll save that now and they
give it a quick refresh over here and
when we click on this button now there
we go we get that modal pop-up now to
close it typically you can just click on
here you see it's got like a darkened
background now just so this stands out a
little bit more that's pretty cool
we can click on here to where to hide it
but not everyone knows that and it's
always a pretty good idea to put a
little cross in the top right hand
corner and we can do that pretty easily
up here in the modal so just above the
modal tiger what I'm going to do is just
come down here gonna create a button and
there's gonna have a class of clothes
then I'll give it a type equals button
and then I'll just put a little whoops
put a little cross inside and that
should probably do the trick
Oh No sorry we need one more it needs to
be data
- dismiss equals modal and that's going
to tell bootstrap that when you click on
this cross you want to dismiss this more
dog you want to highly essentially all
right so let's save that and refresh
over here and we get the modal there's
that little cross looks pretty neat and
boom away it goes alright so there we go
guys that is how we create a modal in
bootstrap dead easy I mean there is a
pretty large amount of HTML and div
gives that we have to put in and it is a
lot easier than creating a CSS and
JavaScript ourself but it does block the
HTML code a little bit also so it's down
to you whether you want to use bootstrap
or make your own your decision depends
on whether you want to go for speed or
kind of less verbose cold all right but
anyway pretty quick and easy to do
regardless so there we go any questions
