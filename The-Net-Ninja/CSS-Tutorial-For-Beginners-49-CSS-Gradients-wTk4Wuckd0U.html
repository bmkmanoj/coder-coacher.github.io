watching CSS for beginners a lesson 49
and in this video we're going to take a
look at gradients Wow alright so first
things first what the hell is gradient
well I know many of you will already
know this but for those that don't know
what a quickly cover it here essentially
a gradient is a transition from one
color to another color or from a
particular shade of one color to another
particular shade of a clot for example
or like it's a dark or dark to light in
this example here we've gone from yellow
to kind of a greeny colour so that is
simple example of a gradient okay and
that my friends is a linear gradient
because we're going straight down and
there's many different types of gradient
I'm not going to get into that now I'm
going to jump back into the code and
we're going to learn how to code some
linear gradients Wow all right gang come
back here in the code and as you can see
I've stripped everything out and just
added this simple egg tag right here
with a class of button and it says click
me but like I said Wonderland it said
this is the web version not eat me or
drink me
click me and then a styled that button
class right up here with a display block
with 100% sorry hundred pixels panel 12
pixels get a border of this kind of blue
color here made some text adjustments
give it a color of white this font size
14 pixels border radius and then this
background of a light blue so before we
do anything I just want to quickly show
you what this looks like in a browser
already and it looks something like that
so a nice little button there but we
want to get groove it and add a gradient
to it make it look a little bit more
funky and we'll do that right now so the
first thing we do is we wonder the
background and we keep by the way this
background property there as a fallback
because if a particular old browser
doesn't support gradients because it's
relatively new in terms of CSS
properties if it doesn't support the
gradient property that it will fall back
to this background color of light blue
okay so it's no big deal so to specify a
gradient we simply write background
again underneath this original
background here
and we say we want a linear - gradient I
remember a linear gradient is just a
straight line okay and this can be from
top to bottom left to right
etc and we give it these parentheses
here we're going to pass some values
through in these brackets now the first
thing we specify is the directional the
direction we want our gradients of
running I'm going to write from top to
bottom so I just simply write top and
then the CSS knows that it's going to
start at the top and run to the bottom
then I'm going to put a comment and
we're going to put my original color the
color I want to start with and I'm
simply going to give it a color of this
thing here this light color which is a a
and then for DS just like that and then
I'll say zero percent and what that
there is saying that I want it to start
the gradient at the very top okay
so zero percent from the top and then
I'll do a comma and then we're going to
do our color for the bottom the color
that it's going to fade into and for
this I'm just gonna do a deeper shade of
blue and I'll say seven seven eight
ay-ay-ay
and then that's going to be a 100% right
at the bottom right at the end we're
gonna put my semicolon so just to run
through again we've got our original
background here to fall back on in case
the gradient property isn't supported
then we're specifying another background
here so if the browser supports these
gradients it's going to take this one
instead of this and we say we want a
linear gradient which starts at the top
it's gonna start with this color here
and it starts 0% from the top and it's
gonna finish it this color here and it's
going to finish at 100% from the top
right at the bottom okay so I'll save
that now and let's review this in a
browser refresh this right and nothing
has changed now why isn't that well it's
because like is saying the gradient
property is still relatively new and
there are certain things we have to do
so that browsers supporting now if we
jump back to the code oops you remember
from previous lessons are talked briefly
very briefly about vendor prefixes this
is a prime
example of when we need to use that
vendor prefix now a vendor prefix is
just a way of specifying a property so
that certain browsers can display that
property okay so the way we do this is
copy this here I'm just gonna paste it a
couple of times looks and we're going to
start with this top one and the vendor
prefix I'm gonna start with it's just a
simple - mo zhee mo said and then I -
again and that stands for Mozilla and so
in all Mozilla browsers like Firefox now
that will be supported and then I'm
going to come underneath I'm gonna write
- WebKit and this is for things like
Safari or Google Chrome so now this will
make those browsers support the gradient
property and essentially what's
happening is this your CSS is being
loaded into the browser remember the
Cascade runs from top to bottom so it's
coming in it's giving it all these
properties it gets to the background
here and it's in okay give it a
background of this color this solid
color and then it comes to this one down
below now if this is in a browser that
supports this here this property they
will apply it if not it will stay this
color so either way it moves down here
now if this is in a browser which
supports this property like Google
Chrome it will give this is the
background if not it will still go back
to this or this and finally if no vendor
prefixes are needed and the browser
automatically supports the linear
gradient property that it's gonna come
right down to the bottom and this
background is going to overwrite them
all and it'll stick with this one okay
so it's a nice way to fall back on
different options so we'll save this now
and we'll view it in a browser let's
just refresh that and there we go now
it's running from quite light up here to
darkish down here so now it looks a bit
cooler a bit more I can button but I
want to do one more thing I want to come
back in here and I'm going to copy this
rule and paste it underneath and I'm
going to give this a tour effect because
remember a lot of buttons on websites
they always have these hover effects to
make it look a bit more interactive and
we're going to copy and paste these
things right here
okay we're gonna change them a little
bit now I'm gonna change this background
to this call here seven seven eight a
payday and so if gradients are not
supported whatsoever in any of these
browsers then it will fall back to this
color here so I'll just have a simple
hover effect where it changes background
color if they do support the the
gradients all I want to do is change
this top value to bottom we'll do that
for each one so now hopefully this
should switch the gradient around from
top to bottom so instead of starting at
the top and coming down darker it's
going to start on the bottom and go
upwards darker so let's say that I'm
doing this in a browser and refresh and
now if we hover it you can see that the
gradient is reversed when we hover which
is quite cool next little button there
alright guys that just about covers
gradients and puts it into a very small
nutshell
however there's many things you can do
with them lots of little things you can
change and properties you can mess
around with so what I suggest you do is
check out this website colorzilla comm
forward slash gradient - editor and this
is a really cool free gradient generator
and you can mess around with the values
they've got a lot of presets here for
different gradients or you can put your
own colors in here it's very much like
the Photoshop gradient tool so if you're
familiar with Photoshop you're gonna
find this a doddle otherwise just take a
few minutes to kind of go over this it
will generate all the codes you need
here for your Jenner and for your
gradients and then you can just copy
that and paste it into your CSS it does
offer ie 9 support there by giving you
this conditional code so you can use
that as well as you like so yeah have a
good look at that and generally speaking
when I need to use a gradient that's not
a simple one I just come here play
around with this get the gradient I want
and then paste it into the code really
cool alright so that's about it guys for
this lesson if you have any questions
whatsoever please please PLEASE comment
and we'll answer all of those if you
like these videos don't forget to
