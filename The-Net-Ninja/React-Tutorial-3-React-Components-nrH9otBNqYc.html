react tutorial and in this video we're
going to create our very first react
component whoo
okay so just quickly components most of
our react code comprises of components
for example we could have a search bar
component for the search bar on our
website or a sign-up component for the
signup form or we could have a to-do
list component and components could also
nest other components within them for
example our to-do list component could
have a list item component for each
individual item on the list or we could
have the form at the bottom where you
add a new one and we'd have a component
for that form etc so we're going to
create a very simple component in this
tutorial and then expand it as we go up
okay so hopefully like me you created
that web.config file installed
everything in the last tutorial and
you're where I'm up to now
so I've already run the starts grit by
saying NPM start in CL dia here so you
do that as well then we can look at this
in a browser when we've done it and at
the minute our entry file this index.js
file just has this alert but instead
we're going to get rid of this and
create our very first component so the
first thing we need to do when we're
creating a component is require react
and we can do that two ways we can
either use es6 imports or we can just
use the simple require statement I'm
just going to use the simple required
statement for now so I'm going to say
var react equals require the module we
want to require is called react and we
can do this because we installed react
before using NPM we set NPM install
react we also installed react done and
we're going to need that as well so I'll
say clap react dot equals require and
this time we want react - Dom so now we
can use both of those in this file right
here okay so now let's create a
component now let me just write a little
comment here create component so we know
what we're doing there's two ways of
doing this we can either use es6 or we
can use the react way of doing it now
I'm going to do the react way of do
in this tutorial in whole series in fact
and then at the end what I'll do is a
quick lesson on how we would refactor
this to use es6 classes instead okay so
we're going to concentrate on the react
create class method so let's create
component the way we do this is give it
a variable name first for now we're
going to create a to-do application so
I'm going to call this the to-do
component and notice it's capital it's
also capital letter for each new word
that's just like a convention that we're
going to use so to do component and then
we set this equal to react which is this
thing right here that we required dot
create class so this is how we create a
component we're just creating a reality
collapse if you like and then inside
this we pass an object and this object
contains everything to do with our
component so let's open it up and inside
this object we can have a variety of
different methods etc that we can use
now the only one required method is the
render method and this render method is
going to be a function which returns
some HTML code so this haich-d ml code
is going to be inserted into our HTML
document when we tell react to insert
this component there okay
so let's create that render method we'll
say render and this is a function like
so and then inside this function what we
want to do is return some code now if
we're just doing one line of HTML code
you can just do it in the same line
however I always think it's good
practice to do some brackets like that
and then we can enter them down and
write all of our HTML code in here now
this is JSX in action because we
wouldn't normally write HTML code in
JavaScript
that's a bit weird but JSX allows us to
do this it's really cool so we can do
something like this h1 and say hello and
close that off and this is absolutely
fine this is JSX in action so if I save
this now then what I'm going to do is
show you a little trick you see how this
at the minute doesn't particularly look
like HTML code if we're going to here
this is our HTML is
being formatted here with the red it
kind of texts if you like in here it's
not like that so I've noticed in Adam
what I do is just cross it off re open
it up and now it works alright so that
there is our component just a dead
simple component which is h1 right now
what if I want to render this component
in the index file what if I want to grab
this component and put it in this index
file well I can do that but I need a
placeholder in this index file for it to
go so what I'm going to do is create a
div so just a simple div with an ID and
this ID is going to be to do - a Rutter
so our to do component is going to go
inside this thing right here so let's
save that now and then we also need to
tell react to insert this component in
that wrapper and that's where this react
dump component comes in or react on
module if you like so down here what I'm
going to do is say put component into
HTML page so the way we do this is by
saying react dot
thus this thing we required dot render
and then we need to say what we want to
render now we want to render this
component but we don't just write the
text in we write it in as a HTML tag so
we're going to open my angle bracket
paste the name in and then do a closing
self closing bracket we like the forward
slash then nothing so that's going to
render this component now in the Dom but
we also need to say where we want to
render it we want to render it inside
this to do wrapper so to do that I'm
going to do a little comet and I'm going
to say document dot get element by ID
this is just normal JavaScript and then
inside here I'm going to say to do
wrapper so that's going to look for that
element and place this component inside
it so let's give that a save now and
check it out in a browser so I didn't
need to refresh this is the inline and
hot reloading in action is automatically
refresh when I click Save and if
if I change this just to in Javas and
save it then we're going to see this
reload over here okay pretty cool right
so now we've created a very simple
component using react and we've input
that component into the index file
within this wrapper
where we said we wanted to render it so
what's the important things to take away
first of all we need to require react
and the react on then we created a
component by saying a variable is equal
to react create class this takes an
object and in this object we can pass
through several different methods the
only one required method is the render
method this is a function which is going
to return some JSX or HTML if you like
inside these brackets then if we want to
render this component to the doll we say
react Dom dot render we say which
component we want to render inside it
HTML tag if you like and we say where we
want to render it in the page pretty
simple right and that works and by the
way this JSX
this is just like JavaScript same
document create element or something
like that behind the scenes that is
what's going on so this is a really
simple way to create HTML to dump in the
HTML file when we require it so there's
our first component dead simple
in the next tutorial we're going to take
this one step further Swati goes in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
