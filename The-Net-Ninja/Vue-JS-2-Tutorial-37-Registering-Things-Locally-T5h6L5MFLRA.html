UJS tutorial and in this video I'm going
to show you how to register things such
as directives and filters locally rather
than globally okay then so over the last
few tutorials we've been making things
like custom filters custom directives
we've been making them here in the main
J's file and we've been registering them
globally and we've registered them
global if by seeing review dot filter
and view directive to create them now
when we register something globally that
means it can be used in any component in
our application so if I wanted to use it
in the add blog component I could do if
I wanted to use in the show blogs
component I could do now that's fine but
what if we have filters are directives
that we only use in one of the
components such as we do in this case we
don't use any of these in the add blog
component we only use them in the show
blogs component so then it makes no
sense to register these globally where
they can be used in both components ok
so what we can do instead is just
register these locally to one specific
component which we're going to do in
this tutorial and we're going to
register them to this show blogs
component right here
ok so we're currently using this to
uppercase filter and this snippet filter
right here so I want to register those
filters first of all locally so how do
we do that well death simply we just do
a comma after our latest property in
here and I can say filters and then this
is an object and inside this object
we're going to store which ever filters
we want to register locally ok so I can
say something like this - - upper case
ok this is the name of the first filter
and this is a function which takes in a
value and inside this function all we
need to do is take what we wrote here
and paste it inside the function here
instead so this is exactly the same
we've got a filter call to uppercase
which is a function taking the value and
returns an updated value it's doing
exactly the same thing as this where we
registered it globally so now we can get
rid of this
and we can still use it inside this show
blogs component because we registered it
locally right here okay and we're using
it up here so let's make sure it works
we'll save it and view in a browser and
it still works and I refreshed just to
make sure yet still works cool alright
then so I want to show you one little
thing now right here I've used a string
to define this filter now that's cool
but a lot of people don't do this what
you can do instead is take away a string
but when we take away the string we
can't use these hyphens instead we have
to delete the - okay but when we do that
the next letter we must make uppercase
okay that's not just a pawn because this
is uppercase I mean we have to make this
first letter a capital all right now
when we do that we also don't need this
function here we can just take that away
and the colon and instead of replace
this by just parenthesis like so okay
and that is exactly the same but it
looks a little neater now so this is all
going to work the same never save it
we'll see that are you in a browser nope
it's not working it's let's refresh and
inspect the elements just to see what's
going on and stupid me it's because we
didn't add the value into the filter so
now it should work okay if i refresh we
won't get any errors okay cool so now
that works let's register it the
directive so underneath and by the way
if I wanted to register more filters and
just comment eliminate them like so okay
so let's go on to directive so after
filters will place a comma and we'll say
directives and again this is an object
where we can register at different
directives from this component now the
one I want to do is called rainbow we
did this a few tutorials back right
there it's called the rainbow so again
what I'm going to do is call this one a
rainbow now this is not a function so we
don't need to do the same thing that we
did it right here what we can do instead
is just Procol them and then this is an
object and inside here we have to bind
and inside that we have L binding
and ritual nose so this is a function
now and then all we need to do is copy
and paste this stuff right here so
essentially what I've done is just grab
that and paste it over here so I can
delete this again and basically it like
so so we have the bind function which is
kicking off then exactly the same in
there so now this is registered locally
as well so I can save that deletes it
from the main GLS file and the view in
the browser
and this is still going to work however
we've not attached that rainbow
directive to anything so let's go to the
title and attach it again over here so
I'll say hey - V - rainbow and this
should still work yep works fine okay so
that is how we register things locally
