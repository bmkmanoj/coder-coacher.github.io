watching jQuery for beginners lesson 1
Wow alright gang I want to welcome you
to what is quite possibly the best
jQuery tutorial series on the party at
the minute I'm joking of course but it
is gonna be pretty awesome and but
before we get started I want to go
through just a few things you're going
to need to know to make the most out of
this course
first one is HTML because jQuery and
JavaScript in general are all about
manipulating and changing and
interacting with HTML so if you don't
know any of that then you're going to be
interacting with nothing which is going
to be a bit daft so I've got a course
for beginners HTML I'll leave a link to
that down below in the description the
second thing you need to know is some
JavaScript you don't need to know tons
but you need to know the basic things
like loops variables if statements the
different types of data we can use in
JavaScript and all the same rules apply
in jQuery as they're doing javascript
because at the end of the day jQuery is
not a language on its own it's just a
JavaScript library it enhances
JavaScript for us so if you don't know
any of that go ahead and check out my
JavaScript for beginners tutorial I'll
leave that in the description down below
also third thing you need to know is a
little bit of CSS and you don't need to
be a wizard you just need to know a few
different selectors how to target
content on a page and that's because in
jQuery we're going to use these
selectors to target the content also
making working with the Dom much much
easier alright so now we've got that
other way and I want to go through the
syllabus basically what we're going to
be covering in this playlist all right
so I thought the word syllabus made me
sound too much like a college lecturer
so I went for ninja buffs instead which
I thought sounded quite cool so the new
Java skies is this we're going to be
looking at first of all what jQuery is
and how we use it in our JavaScript
files right second thing we're going to
do is take a look at the Dom in jQuery
and how we use those CSS selectors to
target content within your HTML then
we're going to look at interacting with
that content by that I mean adding
removing or changing the h2
well after we've done that we'll take a
look at how jQuery handles events which
is a big improvement on vanilla
JavaScript much easier in my opinion
then we'll take a look at animations
sliding things from left to right
sliders faders that kind of thing and
then finally we're going to look at a
couple of examples using jQuery
real-world examples that is and some
plugins and plugins are essentially just
additions to jQuery that we can use in
our JavaScript code to make life easier
or to perform a specific function for us
so that's what we're going to be doing
guys and I hope you're looking forward
to this course as much as I am you have
any questions you can leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see in
lesson two where we're going to take a
look at what do you worry actually is
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
