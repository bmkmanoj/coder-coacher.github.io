JavaScript and the Dom tutorial and in
this video we're going to go over the
concept of Dom nodes okay then so before
we go any further with this series I
want to clear up the whole concept of
nodes in reference to the Dom because
it's a concept that's going to creep up
in several different methods we'll be
using as we go forward so I think it's
best that you really understand what I'm
talking about when I say a node and
we're going to look at some of the
different node properties we can use on
elements in this tutorial as well so
pretty much everything when it comes to
the DOM is a node right everything in
this document right here is a node the
HTML tag the head tag the body tag every
single element in this page is a note
and when we reach in and we grab an
element we're reaching in and grabbing
that element node right but elements are
just one type of node there's many
different types of nodes another type of
node is the text node so this thing
right here this is also a node another
type of node is a comment so this is a
node this comment right here and another
type of node is an attribute so
something like this here so there's many
different types of nodes so I'm going to
demonstrate now how we can find out
these different node types and display
some information about them so I'm going
to come over to the text editor and the
first thing I'm going to do is reach in
and grab an element and I'm going to
grab the banner so I'll store this in a
continent called banner set it equal to
document dot query selador and then
inside we want the page - banner so that
the friends is this element right here
page banner this big gray block over
here so we're grabbing that element now
and we're going to find out a little bit
about this node so the way I'm going to
do this is by logging certain things to
the console so I'll say console dot log
and the first thing I want to log is the
node type what type of node is this so
I'll say page - banner node type is then
either called after this I'm going to do
a comma to block something else to the
console and I'm going to say banner
which is this constant right here and
the node
okay cool so let's save this and check
it out over here and we can see that
page Bala no type is one wonderful that
reveals an awful lot to us
so instead of giving you an actual word
they're giving you a number and all of
these different node types have
different numbers but fortunately we can
easily find out what they mean so we can
see right here that no type 1 is an
element and it is in fact an element
because it's the page planet we can also
see that type 2 is an attribute 3 text
etc so we can see all the different node
types here based on their numbers right
so if you ever get stuck you can find
out those here I'm going to leave the
link to this page down below ok cool so
that's how we find out the node type now
I'm just going to copy this dude right
here and I'm going to paste it down
below so this time what I want to do is
output the node name so I'll change type
over here to name and change this to
name as well and let's see what this
does
so save that and this time we get no
name is a div so what this does is
return to us the element name in which
case this is a div not this one this
thing right here where is it in the head
page banner is a DF cool so we found out
the type of element that this is so we
do that by using the node name property
so another thing we can do is also find
out if this node has any child nodes
there for these things right here right
so the webbot is that is using a method
called has child nodes so again I'm
going to paste this down below and I'm
going to replace this with a method this
time so these two are properties this
time it's a method called has child
nodes parentheses on the end because
it's a method and I'll replace this
with has child nodes save it and check
it out over here and I can see page
banner has child nodes true so this
method returns either true or false
right it is true that it does have child
nodes if it's false then it doesn't have
child nodes so I want to show you
another method now and this method is
going to let you close an old right so
we've reached in and we've grabbed this
banner right here now if we wanted to we
could clone that entire node and then
later on down the line we could insert
it somewhere else on the dot so the way
we close a node is dead simple I'm going
to create a new constant and colic and
I'm going to call that cloned banner and
set it equal to ballet dot you guessed
it clone node and we need to pass in
true here and the reason we passing true
is because we want it to go deeply into
the node so if we didn't passing true
then all it would do is create this div
with an ID of page banner and it would
disregard every child node inside it
wouldn't give us the nested content if I
passing true then it's going to give us
all of this nested content and close all
of that as well so it close the entire
thing rather than just this one single
element so I can now log this to the
console I'll say console dot log and
then we'll log the cloned banner
to the console check this out now we
have this thing or right here and we can
see all of the nested elements now if I
was to pass through here false save it
this time we see just that div with an
ID of banner and it doesn't have those
nested nodes in it so this has to be
true if you want to get the whole thing
right so later I'm going to show you how
we can insert elements into the Dom so
what we could do is clone a node and
then insert it somewhere else but for
now we've not learned that so I won't do
it okay so I just wanted to clear up
this whole concept of node I've not gone
too deeply into it but you can read more
about it and just so you know what I'm
talking about when we say child nodes or
parent nodes or sibling nodes that kind
of things so now we know that in the
next tutorial what we're going to do is
move on and find out how we can traverse
the Dom move up and down from child
nodes to parent nodes and vice versa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
