yo people I'm sure from the net ninja
and this is HTML basics lesson 17 what
the hell next Wow okay so if you're
anything like me you're probably going
to be sitting at home right now thinking
what the hell is this I did not sign up
to do a course which is going to teach
me to make a webpage as crappy as this
out of with you this looks absolutely
ridiculous if I saw this on a website I
would leave within seconds but you have
to remember all we've done so far is
HTML raw HTML that's it no design
whatsoever has gone into this and
remember a website consists of a few
different elements this is just one of
them you have HTML for your structure
you have CSS for your design you have
JavaScript for your interactivity and
maybe some other programming languages
but we've just looked at HTML which is
how to structure a web page and we've
done that we've structured it correctly
we presented our data to the user in a
browser the next steps from here would
be to look at CSS and style this up get
it looking a lot lot better so that's
exactly what we're going to do as soon
as I finish this course I'm going to
dive into creating a CSS basics course
and in there we're going to look at the
core concepts of CSS then we're going to
apply those concepts to this website and
get it looking 100 times better if you
want to learn a little bit more about
HTML first then there's a couple of cool
websites you can check out the first one
is the web platform website and that's
found at Doc's top web platform to org
forward slash wiki forward slash HTML
and here you're going to find tons of
documentation on HTML as well as a list
of all the different elements we can pop
in HTML and if you click on one of these
we'll find out more information gives
you the syntax at the top and a lot of
common attributes here that we can put
in the tag and the compatibility between
different browsers and desktop and
mobiles and it gives you a few code
examples as well so this serves as a
really cool kind of reference guide if
you forget anything or you just want to
look up some different tags and
different elements
it's a really cool website and very
extensive the next one you want to look
at is html5 rocks comm and this is
probably in my eyes not as extensive but
still really cool it's got tons of
really good tutorials on here and you
can search for whatever you want here or
just browse through them at your leisure
really cool website I will also be doing
a few extra advanced HTML courses in the
future however for now I think we've got
enough HTML knowledge to kind of build a
website with and add some CSS I prefer
to go for the whole package approach
rather than just focusing on one area
when we know a bit more about CSS we can
dive in and look again at HTML a few
advanced concepts and go from there so I
will be doing more advanced HTML courses
in the future if you want to learn more
for now visit these websites I'm going
to get cracking on with the CSS course
if you have any questions about this
course don't forget to pop them in the
comments below I'll answer those as soon
as I can
and don't forget to subscribe also I'll
see you guys in the next course
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
