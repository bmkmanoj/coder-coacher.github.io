CSS for beginners lesson 17 and in this
video we're going to talk about adjacent
selectors that's gonna be right up ah
okay guys I'm back here in the code and
as you can see I've created a brand new
page for you
it's called articles dot HTML and it's
very simple we've kept the same head and
the body in the header here as the other
pages however we've added this content
in here which is a div with an ID of all
articles and then within that we've got
three W articles which by the way I took
a long time to write as you can see the
content is brilliant so you get a few
spare minutes feel free to read through
that for you guys anyway what is an
adjacent selector so an adjacent
selector is a selector that selects an
element which comes directly after
another element now you might be sitting
there thinking well that's useless if I
want to tag an element our target it
directly now yeah you can do but imagine
this scenario we've got this page here
with some articles some dummy articles
in it three of them and each one is made
up of a h2 then it's going to p tag
directly after it which says who it's
published by and then underneath that
you've got P tag for the actual content
is the same structure in each article
now imagine that we want this second P
tag here to be targeted separately and
styled in a different way than these P
tags here now how can we do that you
might say yep we can go in and give this
a class
I don't know publisher and we could do
that for this one this one and this one
then we could style that class a bit
different then yeah you can do that but
now imagine that you had 50 articles now
you'd have to go and give each one of
those a class of publisher not really
time efficient if you're asking me so
not the best way to do that this is
where adjacent selectors come in because
you can do it without putting anything
else in the HTML which is brilliant
great time-saver
so how do we do this then well if we
were to say give it a selector of all
articles which is this div here this is
a
give and then we say we want all the P
tags which are descendants what's that
going to do well that's going to go out
and find all the P tags which are
descendants of this which is every
single P tag here and it's going to
style all of them the same we don't want
that we just want this one
so what we have to do is delete that P
there and we use an adjacent selector so
in each one it comes directly after the
h2 so what we need to do is say we want
to get all the P tags within all
articles that come directly after the
hey t - H - and the way we do it is this
we same we want to grab all the Higgs -
descendent first of all articles that's
this this and this and then we use the
adjacent Combinator that's a plus sign
and then the P tag and then we can put
our declaration let's just give it a
color of green so this is saying here
all articles is the parent then get me
the h2 descendants that's this this and
this and then this little plus sign is
saying and get me the P tag which is an
adjacent P so any P tag that comes
directly after the h2 which is these
three get me those and we'll style those
that's what we use this adjacent
Combinator for okay makes sense so I'm
going to save this now and we'll view it
in the browser just to make sure that
it's worked get that in Chrome there we
go now you can see that these are star
nicely in green we can apply whatever
styles we want to those and they're
going to be different to this without
adding anything to the HTML so really
great technique now if you have any
questions about this feel free to
comment below I'll answer all of those
