PSD to WordPress lesson 13 and in this
video I want to show you how we can add
a theme thumbnail Wow alright then guys
so this is gonna be a seriously quick
tutorial and basically just want to show
you how to add a thumbnail so this new
theme that we've just installed cuz it's
feeling a little bit left out all the
rest of thumbnails but this one don't so
we're gonna install or rather just apply
a thumbnail to this theme all right now
I want to show you where the store first
of all so if we come down to WAMP and go
to the root directory you want to go
into WP content and then the themes
folder I'm just gonna open up one of
these themes here 2015 which is this one
and scroll down you can se the
screenshot file which is a PNG and if I
double click that you're gonna see the
same image as this thumbnail right so
this screenshot dot PNG is this
thumbnail so when we install a theme
right there basically WordPress goes
into that theme it looks for the
screenshot dot PNG file and then it
applies that as the thumbnail now we're
in the rest'll theme right now and you
can see a screenshot right here but if I
double click on that is pretty much
nothing at the minute you might just see
a black screen I've got this little
white blob yet basically it doesn't have
a thumbnail so we just need to override
that with a better thumb now yeah so
what I did was open up this build this
HTML build that we've been doing in this
playlist so far and I'm just gonna get a
screenshot of this front page so to do
that I'm gonna use snipping tool but you
might have a different tool to get a
screen grab so it's getting new one I'm
just gonna choose a portion of this
website that it's gonna represent it and
make it look awesome
something like that alright so now we
just need to save it as screenshot you
can see them in the resto theme I'm just
gonna override that yeah replace and
hopefully voila Bob's your uncle there
we go guys we now have a thumbnail
pretty awesome so I said quick tutorial
if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'm going to see in a
very next tutorial where we're gonna
take a look at the theme files and
Oh three what each one does so stay
tuned and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
