PSD to WordPress lesson 11 and in this
video we're going to talk about the
permalinks structure in WordPress and
how we can change it Wow okay then guys
so basically the permalink structure
means the structure of your URLs which
you can see right here the localhost is
just the root URL and that could be like
your domain com forward slash this stuff
right here
okay so currently you can see this hello
world post has a permalink of the year
then the month then the title of the
post right now personally I don't like
this stuff right here this year and
month because I deem it necessary it
doesn't need to be there okay for me I
prefer my URLs to look a bit more like
that where it's just a post name or the
page name now we can control this in
WordPress so from the backend what you
want to do is go to settings and then
permalinks and this is where we can
change the permalink structure so
currently you can see by default is set
to month and name which is what we saw
in the post the year the month and that
the post name now yours might be set to
something else by default it might be
this one up here and you can set it to
whatever you want I'm going to set it to
this one right here post name which is
just the base URL and then the post name
now the reason I don't have this one is
because it means absolutely nothing
we've got one two three which is the
page ID on the post ID and if I was
going to that URL if someone give me
that link I wouldn't know what was on
the page and it wouldn't entice me to
click on it right so that's the reason I
don't like that what's today's in my
mouth just dropped on the floor okay so
this one here day and name you can have
that if you like again I'm not a fan of
these numbers here
I don't deem it necessary don't like
this thing here this archives one two
three again meaningless doesn't mean
anything to me if I'm going to go and
read a post about a cherry pie then this
doesn't tell me that does it right you
want it to be forward slash cherry pie
or something like that so that is what I
want this sample post thing right here
just a post name so I'm going to click
Save Changes and then if I click on
hello world again
you
Aaron right and that is because we've
not enabled so far in this tutorial
series the rewrite module in Apache so
to do that you want to go to their state
your web server go to Apache Apache
modules and you want to click this
little arrow at the bottom to scroll
right down to where it says the rewrite
module so that's their should have a
little tick next to it so if it's not
give it a click and then once we refresh
this yeah and there it will enable us to
use this new permalink structure this
rewrite ok so let's go to hello world
again and this time it works yeah you
can see the URL right there alright so
that is how we change the permalinks
guys if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to drop a comment
down below otherwise guys I'm going to
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
