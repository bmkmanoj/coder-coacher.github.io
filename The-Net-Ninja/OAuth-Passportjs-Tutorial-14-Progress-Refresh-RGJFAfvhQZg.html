worth tutorial and I thought this was a
good point just have a quick review of
the whole signing process so far alright
then so I thought this was a good point
just to pause and take a sidestep and
just go over what we've covered so far
and the different stages that we've had
to go through using passport along the
way to sign a user in because I think if
we just carry on coding then we kind of
lose the big picture and we lose where
we're up to we get lost in the code and
nothing has any kind of logical
progression anymore so I want to use
this video to explain everything we've
done so far and how this diagram mirrors
to our code so which part of the code we
use in at which part in the diagram
we're in so if you feel you already have
a really good grasping you don't need
this refresher feel free to skip this
lesson and go on to the next one because
I'm not gonna go over anything new just
consolidating everything we've learnt so
far so that hopefully everything falls
into place okay so it all starts in the
browser if we go to the home page we're
on our application and we want to log in
so we go to the login page which is
forward slash auth /login and we show
this template right here remember in our
author outs we have this forward slash
login route handler which renders this
login page so that's what we're seeing
here and the idea is is that we have an
application where users can log in using
various different providers so Google is
just one of those but if we have
facebook we list that as an option
github with lists that as an option so
they can log in from this page using any
one of those providers now we've always
helped Google and if we click on this
then it would go to forward slash auth
/gu GLE right if it was Facebook it
would go to forward slash Facebook
github forward slash github so right now
we've set up a route handler for forward
slash forward slash gogol because then
they've clicked that button and they're
telling us they want to log in with a
Google right so that's that first step
here they're logging it in with Google
they're clicking that button and we have
that handle are right here for this
route forward slash auth /gu GLE is in
the off
file so it's this one right here and at
this point we know they want to
authenticate with Google so we say okay
well instead of us personally
interacting with the Google servers I'm
gonna hand control to passport that's
what you're there to do to help us along
the way and that's the first point
that you're gonna kick in and take
control okay so they click on that
button and passport says okay you want
to authenticate with Google so therefore
I'm going to communicate with the Google
service for you all right and we've said
right here Google now we had to set up
passport so that it can use the Google
strategy to login right so we can't just
call this right here without setting up
passport in the first place so we did
that so this is the passport setup file
and we installed passport and the Google
strategy and we said we want to use on
passport a new Google strategy and we
had to set up an online project and to
gain access to our client ID and our
client secret this is what lets our
application and passport interact with
the Google+ API and allow that
interaction between passport and Google
- sighing users in and retrieve
information we needed this okay so we
set up passport with those two different
properties right there so the passport
could do this kind of stuff it could say
okay use the Google strategy to
authenticate someone and this is what we
want to retrieve from that person's
profile the profile information okay
that's the scope so as soon as a user
clicks on that Google+ button and goes
to this route then passport is taken
over and it's going to communicate using
our Google strategy and our client IDs
and secrets with Google okay it does
that and it forwards to them on the user
to that signing page a permissions page
to say look this application once your
information your Google+ profile
information okay and they can choose to
sign in with their Google account them
so when that happens we set in our
Google project and also in the set up
over here when they click allow or when
they click to sign in with one of their
and ID's their Google profiles this is
where we want to redirect them to the
callback URL okay so once they've
clicked on their account to log in with
Google they're redirected to this route
right here so over in the diagram we've
gone here passport is taking control and
community communicated with Google
they've granted us permission and logged
in and they go back to this redirect URI
okay this callback URL and this is
handled on our server and it's right
here this one forward slash Google
forward slash redirect so they're coming
back after they've logged in to this
particular route now at this point they
come back with a code a unique code in
the URL the Google has provided us with
to say okay this is the code that you
need to use if you want to get
information from that users profile
because they've allowed you to do that
so at this point we say okay well I
don't know what to do with that code so
I'm going to let passport take over
again and we're going to say passport to
authenticate using the Google strategy
once again much like we did up here but
this time passport says well actually I
can see in the URL that code that Google
has provided us with so I'm going to
take that code and we're going to
retrieve some information from Google
okay and return that profile information
so that's this step right down here to
come back to the URI the redirect URI
with that code and passport takes over
once again in this redirect URI okay
right here and it goes out and it
retrieves information from Google using
that code so Google exchanges that code
for their profile information and then
passport brings that profile information
back to us okay so at this point right
here when it brings back the information
we're still in this section right but if
we dig deep at that point where the
information comes back to us we don't
carry on just yet to this we're still
within this at that point the passport
callback function right here fires okay
so we retrieve that information the
callback function fires and we're saying
okay well now we have access to that
profile that you've returned to us
so we want to take that profile and
check if this user has been towards
before if they have and I can find their
Google ID their profile ID in our
database then what I'm going to do is
not create a new record in my database
I'm going to just retrieve that user
okay because I might have extra
information about that user that I've
stored pertaining to my application so
I'll retrieve it if it can't find that
then instead what we'll do is create a
new user based on that Google user
that's just signed in they've signed in
for the first time we can't find their
record therefore we'll create a new user
and we'll take their profile information
that comes back here we'll take their
user name from it or their display name
their Google ID and we'll store that
save it in our database and when we've
saved it we retrieve that record that
we've saved back okay likewise if there
is a current record or retrieve it back
so at this stage after this bit of code
is run here in this callback function we
now have our own version of that user
whether it's a new one a new record for
a new user or an existing one when
they've been to us before and that's the
point that we're at at the minute but
right here okay so the next step is to
say okay well we have this user now we
can tell that this person is logged in
and they have a record now on our own
database and now what we want to do is
say to the browser okay this user is
logged in right so if they now want to
request a page which requires them to be
authenticated that's fine they can view
that page because they're logged in such
as their profile page right so what we
need to do is somehow get some
information from this record that's
retrieved right and take that
identifying information and stuff it
into a unique cookie send that to the
browser so that then when the browser
retrieves that cookie if it makes a
subsequent request to for example my
profile page they're gonna send that
cookie back to us on the server and on
the server we can take that cookie
decode it and say okay well that cookie
says that you're this person that logged
in before
therefore I'm going to allow you to
see your profile page and I'm going to
send you your profile page does that
make sense so that's where we are at the
minute and I thought I just wanted to
walk through in fine detail what's going
on at each step and refer to the code
that mirror is up to each step here so
we'll hope everything makes sense to you
now and in the next video we're going to
go on to this step right here where
we're starting to serialize our user
take a piece of information from our own
user and then create a cookie from it so
that's the step one and we're going to
tackle that in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
