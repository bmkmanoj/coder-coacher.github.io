fourth REST API tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how to set
up and Express up ok there so now we've
set up our know gymnast environment and
we have MongoDB running in the
background down here then ok now we're
in a position where we can start
creating the code for our API and this
API is going to be built with Express
which is a package that we can install
so we're going to install that in a
minute but one thing I want to make
clear first of all is that we don't
actually need to use Express to create
this API
expressly just a package which makes
life much easier for us so everything we
do with Express we can do without or
Express makes it that little bit easier
for us ok so anyways to install Express
what we do is come to our console and
you'll notice I'm in the correct
directory REST API playlist which
matches ok you need to be to and to
install it we're going to say NPM
install Express double - save that is
going to save it to our dependencies in
the package JSON file right here I'll
hit enter that's going to go out and
grab Express and install it for you so
we can use it in this application cool
so once that installs you can see right
here in the package JSON file we have
dependencies now and Express is listed
as a dependency you can also notice
these known modules where Express is
stored plus all the different external
modules it requires to kind of run if
you like so now we have that installed
we can go ahead and create our Express
app now when we create this package dot
JSON file we said that the entry point
was index dot JSP to create that file
first of all so right click in the root
folder and put a new file call it index
dot JSP
and then in here is where we're going to
set up our Express app so the first
thing we need to do is require Express
in this file so we can use it so I'm
going to say the top Const and then
Express this is just a variable name
that you can call what anyone however it
makes sense to call it Express since
that's what we're requiring and we'll
set it equal to require and then Express
and now we don't need to pop the
exact for the name in here no GS known
to calibrate lease out we've installed
expressing knows where to look in the
node modules folder for it by the way if
at any point you find yourself
struggling to keep up with this nodejs
stuff I do I advise you to check out my
know Jace while beginners playlist
that's going to go through all this kind
of stuff and more so if you can't keep
up check out that first because you know
I'm going to be moving in a pace which
is a little more advanced than very
beginner so now we've done that we can
use it with your cell power Express app
we do that first of all let's put a
comment will say set book Express
and then we can say Pont up that's what
I'm calling this app then created I'm
going to equal to UX press then the
parentheses defy that function so this
is going to do a lot of magic in the
background now to create and set up our
Express application setup but there's
more to it than that
currently it's created it but it's just
sitting around doing nothing we need to
set it up so that it listens for
requests that we might make to it okay
so the way we do that is by listening to
a port number so we can do that I'm
going to come down here I'm going to do
a little comment again which says listen
for requests then underneath emitter app
then we can use a method call that
listen remember app is just this thing
right here that I set up don't listen
and then we're going to specify a port
number I'm gonna say 4,000 right so I'm
going to listen to port 4,000 then I'm
going to do a little callback function
right here which fires once it's
listening to this port number right here
okay
so I've made up this port number right
here but a lot of the time if you are
deploying this application to a hosting
service like Heroku there might be an
environment variable which provides this
port solicit it right so the way we can
listen for that is by seeing right here
process the MV dot fort then double type
like so which means oh so now when we
say app got lithium is going to either
listen for the setup variable in Heroku
for example if it has a port number
specified in the environment then it
will use that and it will listen to
request on that pole otherwise it's
going to listen to 4,000 now we don't
have this set up so it's just
thousands of 4,000 I just want to throw
Loraine in case you're wondering okay
cool so once it's successfully listening
I want to log a little message to the
console just to say hey we're ready to
accept requests something to say console
that log inside here now listening for
requests and then semicolon at the end
so now when our app is listening to this
this callback function is going to fire
to tell us look it's now listening for
requests and we can send it requests
okay so let me just run this in the
console I'll come down here and I'm
going to say nose index which is this
file right here don't need to pop
curious and that's going to rule this
for us and you can see it logs this back
towards now listening for requests so
Express has successfully been settled
it's sent out a port and it's listening
for requests on this port number now if
we make a request to it at the minute
it's going to do absolutely nothing
because we have no requests to handle it
it doesn't know what to do with it right
so in the next video what we're going to
do is see how we can handle requests and
we're going to start setting some of
them all in our API routes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
