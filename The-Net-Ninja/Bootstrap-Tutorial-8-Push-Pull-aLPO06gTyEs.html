eighth bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at pushing
and pulling columns Wow alright then
guys so we've seen in the last tutorial
how we could offset columns we can also
do another thing called pushing a column
or pulling a column to the right or left
now at first glance you might think
these are pretty similar and yeah a
little bit similar however there is
quite a big difference
ok so I'm gonna show you a quick example
here you can see I've just got this
fluid container then I've got a row then
I've got two elements in it and what I'm
saying is it's smaller screens are extra
small screens I want each elements have
a width of 12 columns sort of taking up
the full width then at medium sized
screens we're gonna have to sit scalzi
so half-and-half
then on large screens and want the first
one to be 8 columns of width on the left
and the second one to be 4 columns in
width on the right ok so the idea is
this is the main content and this is
gonna be some kind of sidebar all right
so let's save that and just take a look
in a browser if i refresh so this is on
mobiles where they're currently 12
columns each in win so they're taking up
the full width of the browser then when
we get to medium sized screens they're
going to take up six columns each so
they're equally spaced on each side next
to each other then when we get to large
screens the constant area goes to eight
columns so it's bigger than the sidebar
which goes to four columns okay now all
this is fine but I want to do a quick
change to the layout so I'm okay with
this four more miles and I'm okay with
this what kind of tablets and laptops
whatever but when we get to large
screens like this where the content is
bigger I want the content to be on the
right side and the sidebar area to be on
the left side now I can do this via
pushing and pulling using the CSS
classes that bootstrap provides us with
all right don't ask me why I want to
make this change just want to do it just
to demonstrate to you guys so let's head
back into the code and what we need to
do is apply some classes to these things
right here so what I want to do is push
this element over to the right rule of
thumb is if we're pushing we're moving
elements to the right if we're pulling
we're pulling elements to the left okay
so we want to move this right because
it's currently
left on live screen so we want to push
it by four columns to the right so I'll
say call LG four large push - four okay
so I'll save that and this is what it
does so this is it currently one second
this is it on large screens so what's
saying is I want to take this thing
right here which is eight columns in
width and I want to push it to the right
okay by four columns now this is 4 cups
in width so it's gonna go right to the
end ok so the content area it's now
gonna be over here like this all right
so let's refresh it and now we can see
it's all there like that now you can't
create the scene because this sidebar
area is on the right as well and it's
covering up the content area so what we
need to do is grab this one and we need
to pull it right back over here and what
I want to do is pull it back by 8
columns because this content area is
eight columns in width isn't it so we
need to pull it right back to the start
over here which is eight columns away so
let's head back to the CSS and go to
this element and what's a cold LG for
large - push oh sorry pull because we're
pulling it to the left then we want to
pull it by eight columns so let's save
that and have a look in the browser and
kaboom there we go so now we've
rearranged the order of the elements for
life screens but if we go back down to
desktop our sorry laptop sizes or
tablets then it currently goes back to
the content area on the left on the side
but on the right book or pontil our
screens they switch around okay pretty
cool now there's one little thing you
need to be careful of okay it's not
showing up here because we've only
applied it to the large size screen
bought if I go back to the code and if I
then get rid of these two classes we've
just added and say this time I want the
order to change when it's at the
medium-sized screen okay so currently
this is gonna be first okay on the small
screen so I'm extra small screens then
this second so this is gonna be on top
of that then when we get to the medium
size screens
I want the content area then to be on
the right and I want the sidebar on the
left so what we do we push on with the
con
area sorry cold MD push and we want to
push it six to the right because each
one is six year and then what we want to
do is pull this one Sokol MD pull six to
the left so let's save that and see what
it does in the browser so currently it's
okay here the content area is on top
sidebar area at the bottom then when we
get to here what are what's happening is
for these suits of switch okay so if i
refresh now oops that's not quite worked
what's happened
MD oh I've done ms instead of MD okay
what a spoon all right there we go
now they switched okay so now the
constant air is on the right sidebar on
the left but if we carry on on two large
screens you see what's happened there
those pushing and pulling effects are
still taking effect okay so we need to
clear them off or get rid of them so
what we'll do is head back now to the
cold and we'll say Carl LG polish zero
so we're weak setting that push value
okay because currently is six and then
when we get to the large on this one
we'll say coal LG pull zero save that
out and then hopefully this should
revert back to the original one yep
that's cool so this time the concerts on
the left so bad but on the right but
still when we go to medium size screens
we still get a switch around okay so my
friends that is pushing and pulling in a
nutshell if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to comment down
below alright guys don't forget to share
