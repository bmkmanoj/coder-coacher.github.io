17th boot shop free tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at navbars
Wow when in campus so we are looking at
the code right here that we did in our
last tutorial where we looked at now the
taps and nav pills and that gives us
something like this and I got a
navigation system now this is really
cool and typically used for kind of shop
navigations on my website but I wouldn't
necessarily use it for the main
navigation at the top of my website for
that there's something made a little bit
better so I'm gonna show you that today
and what we want to do first of all is
take off these classes and have tabs and
now justified but we're gonna keep this
class right here this enough class
because that's kind of like a universal
class that we apply to any kind of
navigation ul alright so that all stays
the same but what I want to do now is
give this UL a different class and the
class that I'm gonna give it is navbar
- now okay so that's the new album now
what we need to do is nest this inside
of a nav element so we'll do that listen
now development is just a html5 element
makes navigation a little bit more
semantic so we'll do that and zoom
listen and we also need to apply a class
or two to this Neverland as well so
let's just do that now the first class I
want to give this is just navbar and
then the second class I want to give
this is either navbar default on mouth
bar inverse depending on how you want
the navbar to look now I'll start off
and I'll show you the nav bar inverse
that's just kind of like a dark color so
it inverses the colors should have shown
you default really to begin with I'll
show you that now and that's the color
of this okay so I'm just going to keep
it with default for now and I know
there's a lot of classes here guys to
get your head around when you take into
account the ones we covered in the last
tutorial as well it is really just a
case of either memorizing them or just
heading over to the bootstrap
documentation whenever you want to look
something up it all takes five seconds
all right so once we have done that we
can leave it there if we like but if we
take a look at this I typically like my
top navigations to stretch all the way
across from left to right and not to
have this little gap at the top okay
now the reason it's doing all this and
it's keeping central is because we've
got it in a central container in this
div right here so what we need to do to
get rid of that is take it out of the
container so I'll do that just do that
cut it and I'm gonna paste it right over
here like that and press save and let's
have a look at this now okay that's a
bit better we've got this stretch all
the way across for the background but
these links I don't really want to scoop
them right over to the left over here
I've like the links to line up with this
content right here so we can do that as
well all we need to do is I'm gonna get
rid of that rule there Heights you into
it because that's gonna target the
container and then I'm going to make a
div here with a class of container and
I'm gonna put that around the UL like
sir and the reason I'm just putting out
around the UL and not the nav is because
the nav is what is stretching the whole
thing if I just make this bigger the
whole background great all the way
across and then the container right here
is the thing that's keeping this UL all
the links within that central column
okay so let me just get rid of that blue
line and now you can see still one thing
you want to saw and that's this little
space here in this little space here
that's down to a style I've done
previously this margin right here so I'm
gonna get rid of that as well and save
it and now let me take a look at this
there we go
pretty cool so that is our navigation
are all right there now there's a couple
of more things that we can do to this by
adding some additional classes now on
some websites they have the nav bar
right at the bottom and it stays there
all the time so we can do this we can
say another bar - fixed - bottom all
right and now this web this nav bar is
always going to appear at the bottom
what I'm gonna do is just paste in a
load of different content I think when I
do is just grab those two just so we've
got enough contents to scroll down the
page there we go that'll do
okay now when we scroll down the page no
we still can't do it can we let's say
let's put some more in okay save that
okay now when we scroll down the page
the nav bar is always at the bottom okay
one thing you might want to look out for
is when I scroll right to the bottom
this last bit of content is still hidden
so we might want to give our container
at the bottom some padding so that the
content ends roughly around here so I'll
do that now what I'll do is jump up here
and I'll go style you know we do this in
your CSS I'm just doing it in line so
it's quicker
are they padding bottom I'll just say 60
pixels something like that and zoom this
open again this time when we go to the
bottom we're getting all of the content
it's not cutting off because we're
moving it up 60 pixels so we're making
room for this at the bottom so it's not
hiding anything okay so that's the
navbar fixed to the bottom we can also
fix it to the top if we like by just
replacing this with top save that and
view it again and once again we have the
same problem I'm just going to not focus
on that so we can see they've the same
problem in the this top element is being
hidden by the navbar so again if you do
this as you scroll down you can see it's
all going behind that and extending the
same position but if we do this then
what we need to do is apply some padding
at the top of the container so that it's
not hidden behind here so we'll do that
now we'll change this to padding top and
save that do it again and this time it
works pretty cool right
alright then so that is just about it
for enough bars guys and let's say I
know there's quite a lot of different
ways we could do nav bars and you else
it's just a case of looking at the
documentation when we need to depending
on what you want all right so if you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
to throw those down below otherwise guys
I will see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
