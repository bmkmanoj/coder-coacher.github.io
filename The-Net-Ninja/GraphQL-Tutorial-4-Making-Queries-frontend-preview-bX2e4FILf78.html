that I wanted to give you a quick
preview as to what a graph QL query
looks like when we're querying a gradual
server so to do that we'll be using this
tool right here called graphical which
is a dummy front-end application which
we can use to test our queries to a
graph QL server now we're not going to
go into too much depth about this tool
right here we'll be learning more about
it as we go through the series we're
just going to use it so that you can get
a feel of how these queries from the
front end look alright now for the sake
of this video I've already set up an
Express app and a graph to our server on
the back end we're not going to look at
that at all we're only going to be
concerned with what's going on on the
front end when we're making queries to a
graph QL server will set up all of this
from scratch starting in probably the
next video so for now just focus on the
front end all right then so this is
graphical and notice I'm not on some
website here where this is being served
up I'm on localhost I'm serving this up
myself from my Express server and we'll
see how to do that later on but for now
let's just use this tool to create a
simple query so you can see what they
look like from the front end so I want
to query all books I want to receive
back a list of books from the graph cue
our server so the first thing we need to
do to create a query is open up some
curly braces then inside we want to say
what we want to query what is our
initial jumping in point we're going to
choose books ok now what do we want from
each book
well I want the name of the book I also
want the genre of that book and I also
want the Agda property of that book as
well so this is the whole query right
here we're very very simple we're saying
we want to jump in at the books entry
point the RIC query of books then we
want these three properties from those
books so if I press play now it's going
to make this query to the graph cue our
server and it's going to come back with
this data property right here inside the
data we have this book's property which
is an array you can see that from the
square bracket and each object inside
that
ray represents a book it has a name
genre and ID so we've got all of these
three properties back from the graticule
our server how simple was that
okay so the good thing about graph QL is
that I don't have to return all of this
information only the information that I
want so I could get rid of this ID
property right here press play again and
now I just get back the name and genre
so graph QL is not bloating up the data
that's returned to us
I'm only getting back what I request
which is unbelievably cool now another
great thing about graph QL is that
inside the same query we can request
relational data we don't have to make an
additional query we can just nest that
inside here so say for example I want
the author of this book or each book
rather then I'd say okay I'm going to
nest the author query as well inside
here and from each author I want to get
back with the name of the author the age
of the author and that will do in fact
so if I press play now we're going to
get the books and then down here we see
we have this property author in each
book and that opens up a new object
because it's a relational data type it's
not stored inside the book so it's
giving us back another object for that
where we have the name and the age of
the author for each one of them okay so
that is really cool this is how simple
it is to make requests from the
front-end using graph QL now I just want
to open up my dev tools by pressing f12
and I've gone to network right here just
so you can see these requests being made
so we see nothing at the minute but if I
press play again then we're going to see
this request right here so if we open it
up and inside headers if you scroll
right to the bottom you're gonna see the
request payload so you can see right
here this query property is just what
looks like a string
there's nothing overly special about
that string the special part happens
when the graticule server receives the
string and it can pass it so that it
understands that string and knows what
data to return how to walk the graph how
to
the information that we've requested and
then how to return it to us in the
client in the browser so it's all very
simple from the front end now just one
more thing you might be fooled into
thinking this looks an awful lot like
JavaScript well it does but it's not it
is not JavaScript it is a query language
and they're two different things and
that point is going to become more
important when we start to flesh out the
front-end and start making requests
speaking of that I just want to show you
a quick preview of the front-end in the
code so if I open this we can see we
have our react up here and this right
here my friends is a query from the
front-end so just like we saw the query
in graphical there we're making the same
kind of query from the front-end very
very simple we have all these different
queries here and we're going to request
them at different points in our
application and yeah they do get more
complex as we go along like this one
which is a mutation of this one right
here where we're requesting a specific
book but we're going to learn how to do
all of that as we go along and I promise
you it really doesn't get much more
complex than this so there we go that's
how graph QL looks from the front end
and how we can make queries in the next
video we're going to go straight ahead
and dive into creating our Express up so
we can start making our graph to our
server on node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
