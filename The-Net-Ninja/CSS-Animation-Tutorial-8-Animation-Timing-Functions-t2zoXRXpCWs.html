animation tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about animation
timing functions Wow oh rugged dudes so
we've got Marie of cycling round and
round and Luigi going the opposite way
because he's not sure what's going on
and you'll notice one thing if you look
closely at these an emetic animations
especially on the mario one so when
Mario cycles around you'll probably
notice when it gets towards the end he
starts to slow down a little bit right
and the thing that's controlling that is
the animation timing function so the
animation timing function kind of
determines at the rate at which the
element that's being animated
kind of goes from point A to B so right
now the default value of that animation
timing function is YZ that's the default
value if we don't specify anything and
that basically means that it starts a
little slower then it speeds up in the
middle and then it ends slowly okay
that's the default value and that's
what's happening to Mario now we can't
see the stats so much because it's
off-screen but if we were to translate
this to zero to begin with you'll notice
it starts low and end slow and then
speeds up in the middle right so we can
control this and change this behavior by
using the property animation timing
function so let's go to Mario and add
that one in let's say animation oops if
I can spell animation timing function
okay and as a few different key words we
can use you can see them in that
drop-down right there so currently the
default one is YZ which it is at the
minute right but we can change this to
be the linear if we prefer and notice
the difference there now it's not
speeding up or slowing down at all it's
just going a constant speed throughout
the whole cycle right and in this
scenario that probably makes more sense
because it's just going round around
it's not accelerating and braking at the
end it's just going round around but
there's a few different things we can do
as well so let's go through the
different options we have we can have
ease in which basically just means it
starts slow but then it speeds up and it
doesn't slow down at the end just start
slow
the opposite of that is ease out and
that basically means that it starts at a
normal speed and then it slows down just
towards the end all right and then we've
got ease in - out and that does
something similar to just ease the
default value in then it starts lower
speeds up in the middle a little and
then it slows down towards the end there
is a sort of difference but it is subtle
and you have to look closely to kind of
recognize that but as well as doing of
these different keywords we can also
pass in our own timing function which is
a cubic Bezier function right there and
we pass through four numbers now right
now
that might seem like absolute
gobbledygook bought these four numbers
actually make up a cubic cubic Bezier
curve if you like right and if you know
the four numbers that make up that curve
you can pop them in there to create your
own timing function now it's impossible
pretty much unless you know a lot about
these kind of curves to just pluck those
numbers out of thin air so there is a
cool online tool and he's had cubic
Bezier com I'll leave the link to this
down below and here we can make our own
kind of curve by just dragging these
from different positions I'm just going
to refresh this page now we can see this
curve right so these are the kind of
default keyword ones we have is linear
and etc I'm just going to make this
screen a little bit bigger so we can see
the whole thing right there and yeah
these are the different key words we
have the different curves that they
represent but we can make our own curve
and we just control it by moving the
start and end point little handles like
that and the way this works is the time
is going from the left to right along
the bottom so this is when the animation
starts this is when it ends and this is
essentially how fast the animation
occurs it's called progression right
here so if this is kind of an op speed
curve this means that the progression is
going slow over time so that means that
the animation is slow when it's quite
you know the opposite of steep but when
the curve is steep like that it means
it's going fast so if I do a curve
something like this it basically means
that at the start
it's going to be really fast and then
it's going to peter out go quite slow in
the middle then towards the end it's
going to go fast as well and what that
does for us is create this kind of busy
a point curve for is right here so we
can grab that and we can just copy the
coordinates and then we can pop them
into a curve right here like so save
that and then come back and see what it
does and you'll notice now it starts off
really quickly like the curve said
Peters out in the middle then ends
quickly alright so that's really cool we
can create our own cubic Bezier
functions to determine the timing of our
animations most of the time I just use
one of the keywords but if you do want
something specific it's nice to know
that this is here and available for us
alright so there we go you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
share subscribe and like I'm going to
see you in the very next tutorial
