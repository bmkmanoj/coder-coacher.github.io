fourth PSD to responsive website
tutorial and in this video we're going
to start making the HTML header Wow
alright then guys so here I am in
brackets the text editor got that on the
left and then the Photoshop design on
the right now what I've done is gone
ahead and created a folder called PSD to
responsive website and within that I've
dumped the images folder where we saved
out our images in the last lesson and
then I've also created a blank
index.html file and a blank style dot
CSS file ok so what we need to do first
of all is create our basic HTML outline
and the first thing we're going to do is
just the doctype side which is just
doctype HTML with an exclamation mark
before it that's all we need to do in
html5 dead simple to remember and then
we need our HTML tags and then the first
thing we need within those is the head
tag where we're just going to pop a
little bit of information about the site
first of all a title which is going to
be marble and then after that we're
going to pop a link tag and this is
where we're going to link up the CSS
file which is relative to the index file
so we can just say link href equals
style.css perfect but what we're going
to do is just move this over here to
give me a bit more room like that and
then the relation is going to be
stylesheet and then the type is equal to
text forward slash CSS ok cool so that
is the CSS linked up the next thing I'm
going to do is a meta tag for the
viewport and if you want to know more
about the viewport then I suggest you
check out my tutorial on that in the
responsive web design playlist I'll
leave a link to that tutorial down below
so basically all the viewport is going
to do is override the default viewport
with the sub devices come with like
mobile phones and we're going to set it
to the device width so the meta name
equals viewport and then the content
equals
which equals device weight so what that
is going to do is set the viewport equal
to the device width so if the device
width is 400 pixels then it's going to
set the viewport to 400 pixels so all
that responsive kind of CSS that we do
and we target lower with viewports
that's going to be utilized by the
mobile devices now instead of using the
default viewport widths which some of
them come with alright so that is it for
the head for now next thing we need to
do is a body tag not a bad one all right
body there we go and what we're going to
do is just focus on this tutorial on
this bit right here and then the banner
okay so this bit at the top is going to
be the header so let's pop that all
within the header tag and this is going
to be on pretty much every page that you
do for this website this is just going
to be a one page tutorial but if you
were to carry this on do the whole
website this is virtually going to
appear at the top of every page of your
website I'd imagine so within this what
we need to do first is do a div with a
class of wrapper and I've done this in
or the tutorials as well so you might
know why I'm doing this but for those of
you that have not seen those basically
if you look at the website it stretches
all the way from 0 to 1600 and if the
viewport was bigger than 1600 pixels in
width then it would stretch even further
okay that's this gray bit here the white
background and also this banner however
the content within it starts here and it
ends here and you can see it starts
about 200 pixels and ends at 1400 making
it 1200 pixels in width so that's what
this wrapper is going to do it's going
to contain all this content within a
central column of 1200 pixels and we're
going to control that via the CSS later
alright so that's what that's for the
first thing we need to do in here is do
h1 with a class of logo and that's going
to be for this thing right here now what
I'm going to do is just type in the text
of the website here and this is good for
screen readers because they don't
necessarily read images so if the screen
reader comes to the website or some kind
of bought an SEO thing then it's going
to read this h1 which is good but what
we're going to do in the CSS is
of this out of the picture using the
text indent so it's way off the screen
and then we're going to replace it with
a background image of this logo alright
so a nice little earth technique there
then we need a nav element which is a
html5 element and a nav element expect
some kind of header that's just the
specification in html5 so what we need
to do is pop hate doing that I'm going
to say this is called main navigation
now you'll notice this h2 is not on the
design so what we'll do is we'll just
use the same technique as this we'll
just use the text indent to get it way
off the screen but again it is good for
things like screen readers or SEO and
things like that
okay just properly sorry properly
organizes your website so next thing I'm
going to do is a div with a class of
burger in fact we'll give this an ID
because there's going to be just one of
them on the page we'll call this burger
- mouths all right so this burg enough
is going to represent if you remember on
the mobile design we did a little logo
not a little logo a little icon there
that's going to represent that thing
okay so on desktops it's not going to
show at all but when we do our mobile
styles we're going to take our we're
going to make use of this and we're
going to give it that background image
right there okay so that's why we need
that then we bu L to show the links so
let's do some allies with an a tag in
between I don't need to put these links
in at the minute because I'm not going
to build the whole website but what I'm
going to do is give this first one a
class equal to current like that okay
and that's because you see here this
whole one the first one is a different
color so that's the current page that
you're on so we're going to style that a
little bit differently all right so
let's give that some text of hole then
what I'll probably do is just copy this
in fact no it won't because we've got
that class in I'll do a new one li H
breath equals I'll copy this then we can
just paste it in a few times
how many is the one two three four five
six once it's okay that's five and then
I'm just going to put the different
links in right here so we've got oops
we've got about and then we've got
journal then service I think it is and
then we've got features and contact is
your contact here okay perfect
so that is the headed up because we've
got all this in now now we just want to
do this butter so let's come down here
and pop this below the header so I'll do
a div with an ID if there's just going
to be one of them on the page and this
is going to be main Punnett alright so
in the banner we're going to do an image
tag with a source of images and that
goes into the images folder and then
it's just banner jpg alright so if
you've watched my let's just give this
an alt attribute we'll just call this
banner it doesn't really matter okay so
if you've watched my tutorial playlist
on responsive design then what I said
was we could use the new picture element
to create responsive images so that if
you're on a low viewport device like a
mobile phone then it downloads a smaller
image for you so we don't waste this
data on a big image and then squash it
into a small screen so what we're going
to do is just tackle that later I'm
going to leave a comment here for now to
say change to the picture element and
we'll tackle that later when we do our
responsive design stuff okay
so we'll leave it like that for now so
we're going to save it here and
basically what we've done guys is this
top part and this banner so in the next
tutorial I'm going to tackle all this
stuff here and probably the footer as
well okay so if you have any questions
so far feel free to leave a comment down
below otherwise I'll see you in that
very next tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
