form validation all working for these
different fields but there's still
something missing I still want to add
some kind of feedback to the user to let
them know when their field is valid or
not valid right now at the minute what
we're doing is adding a class of valid
or invalid to the fall fields when
they're valid or not valid so we could
use those classes to style the form
fields differently depending on the
state so let's head over to our Styles
dot CSS right here we have the base
styles already in there but I'm just
going to enter out some space down here
and we'll do some additional styles at
the bottom and these are all going to be
validation styles so let's just do a
little comment there to say so or write
them so the first thing I want to do is
grab an input field that is valid so
input dots
valid that means get any input with a
class of valid attach to it
right so when something becomes valid
what are we going to do to it well I'm
going to change the border color and the
border color I want is a kind of green
and I'm just gonna write out the code
for this it's 3 6 CC 3 6 alright so this
one rule right here is already it going
to make a difference let me save that
and refresh over here and we'll see as
soon as this becomes valid now we get a
green border that in itself is quite a
big step we're letting the user know
that this is now valid let's check the
email Shawn at the net ninja doctor code
at UK like so now we get a green border
awesome so that's that first step done
now let's style it when it's invalid so
input and then dot invalid and this is
gonna have a different border color the
border color this time let's get rid of
that space is going to be an orange 'ok
ready color i in fact just orange will
say border - color is orange alright
then so save that and now if we refresh
notice to begin with we don't get that
orange border because it doesn't have
that environment class to begin with
it's not been touched yet but if we
start to type something in that's not
yet valid it becomes orange until it is
Val
it likewise if I go over the top it
becomes invalid again all right so
that's those two little styles done
however I also want to conditionally
style this now ideally I don't want this
to show until a user starts to type into
the field or if it's invalid right so
when this form field is invalid this
here will show otherwise it won't show
because when it's valid we don't need to
see this do we all right so then let's
go about doing that
we'll say first of all input if we can
spell it plus P now this means grab an
import and get the P tags next to it and
we can see that those are next to each
other input P input P input P alright so
it's grubbing the P tag next to each
input and we're going to starlet of all
the font-family probably don't need to
do this because it's already inherited
it but anyway Ariel the font size is
going to be naught point 9 MS then the
font - weight is going to be a bold I'm
going to text align this to the center
like so I'm also going to give this a
small margin to the left and right 0 top
and bottom 10 pixels left and right the
color is going to be the same color as
the border because we're only going to
show this when it's invalid so that
orange color orange and then the opacity
to begin with because I don't want to
show this by default is going to be 0 so
that elasticity 0 means we're not going
to show it by default the height is
going to be 0 all right so if I save
this and refresh then we're not going to
see those things if I just comment out
this little bit to begin with or plasti
at 0
we'll see what its gonna look like when
the farm field is invalid a little bit
like that don't worry about the spacing
yet alright then so let's get rid of
that and then down here what I'd like to
do is finally style the P tags when the
file field has a class of invalid so to
do that I can say input
dot invalid and then underneath or
rather we need to attach the P so when a
farm field when that input field is
invalid and it has that class the P next
to it is going to be styled in a
specific way and that is when we're
going to get a full opacity so we'll
take it out the opacity zero over ran it
with this thing right here so it is
visible when the farm field is not valid
the height is going to be our toe so
we're overriding this thing right here
where we said height is zero and then
finally the margin bottom is going to be
about 20 pixels just to push it off from
the next farm field all right so if we
refresh now nothing's showing at the
minute but I'll start to tap the
username it's not valid therefore we
seen the orange border and we see the
orange text underneath until it becomes
valid and then they disappear so Sam
again is shown at the net ninja code at
UK becomes valid password blob one two
three four becomes valid telephone
number just some random number there and
profile slug net iPhone ninja valid all
right so there we go that's how we can
create this form and some validation
using it regular expression summer
friends I really really hope that you've
taken something from this course and
you've learned how to make these regular
expressions and whereas before something
like this would have looked like a load
of garbage and nonsense now you can
probably look at that and say AHA that
is an email address so there's more to
regular expressions than what I've
taught you far too many to create on
YouTube so I suggest what you do next is
just have a little play around with
these and maybe research some more on
Google until you become an absolute
ninja at regex if you enjoyed these
videos my friends please please please
do not forget to share them subscribe
and like that really means a lot and I'm
gonna see you in the very next series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
