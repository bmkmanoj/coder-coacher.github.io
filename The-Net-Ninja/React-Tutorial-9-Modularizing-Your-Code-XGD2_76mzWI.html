ninth react tutorial and in this video I
want to talk about how we can modular
eyes our code or either gang so I was
about to add another component but then
if we take a look at this file it's
getting rather long and we don't really
know where anything is so I want to take
a minute to talk about how we can
modular eyes that code that is split it
up into separate modules so that we can
keep on top of it better so ideally what
we want to do is give each component its
own module okay so at the minute we've
got two components we've got this to do
component the parent one and we've got
this one right here this to-do item
component so let's split these up so the
parent component can stay in the index
file because that's kind of like the
root component so what I want to do is
take this one right here out of this
file and into a separate component file
so if we right click click on the app
folder and go to new file let's call
this to-do item j/s ok then if we grab
the code for the to-do component this
one right here
cut that we don't want to cut this this
is what inserts the parent element into
the dot so we leave that there
so let's save that and go to here and
paste in the code we cut out so that's
this component now in this separate file
so this isn't just gonna work as is we
need to tell this file right here
this index one that we require to use
this to-do item component as well
because we're using it right here so
currently this file doesn't know
anything about it because it's somewhere
else so we need to say we're going to
use it so to do that we'll do a little
require statement so I'm gonna do a
comment and I'm going to say module
requires just so we know what these
things are here then we'll start the
variable called to-do item as it's
written their to-do item I set it equal
to require and we want to require this
thing right here
so it's dots forest
to say the same folder that I'm in then
to do item like so we don't be the duck
JFS extension it already knows that so
as we know the reason we can do this
require and split up our code is because
we're using webpack and we could either
use this required statement or es6 code
where we do an import doesn't matter
either on works and we can do that
because we're using webpack which is
going to convert all of this code that
browsers don't understand into code that
browsers don't understand so it's going
to combine these files so that's the
reason we're allowed to do this required
and split up our code so that's one
really cool thing about web pack anyway
now this is still not going to work
because even though we've said we want
to require this module right here in the
module itself we're not saying what's
available to all the modules which
require this module we have to export
whatever's in this so the way we can do
that is just by coming down here and say
module dots exports is equal to this
thing right here to-do item okay so now
we're exporting this and then
essentially we're importing it into this
file so we can use it so if we save this
now do you think it's going to work if
we save both of it
well let's give it a shot save them both
and check it out in a browser and know
it still does not work we're getting
this error right here react is not
defined so why is that so
when we're creating these components
we're saying react create class and it's
saying that this is what's not defined
react now it's not referring to this
component it's referring to this one
right here and the reason is we've not
imported react into this we've not
required it into this file we have
required it right here but we've not
done it here so that's what we need to
do we need to grab this and paste it at
the top of this file so that we can use
it in the code right here now we don't
need to grab this thing right here
because we're not using the react dot in
here we're using the react Dom only at
the bottom down here when we're
inserting the component into the Dom so
we don't need to worry about that it's
just this one right here
so now we've saved it if we check it out
in the browser now it does work so now
if we click these everything still works
but this time around our code is much
more manageable we're splitting it up so
it's easier to maintain you and we know
where everything is rather than just one
big long file so this is loads better
now I want to do one more thing I want
to start inserting some CSS into this as
well now instead of just having one big
huge CSS file which is going to be
loaded into the entire application when
I'm working with react I like to just
use the CSS that I need any particular
point so for example say I need some CSS
for this component I just import that
CSS all right here in the file so then
I'm just importing the CSS that I need
same for this one if it needs CSS for
this component I'll just import that CSS
at the top right here I'm using a
require statement okay
so how can we do that well remember when
we were setting up web pack in one of
the first tutorials if we take a look at
this web pack config we saw a listing
record we had this test and loader
saying we want to use the style loader
and the CSS loader okay so what we can
do with these is import CSS into
JavaScript files and then insert that
CSS into the Dom so all we need to do
once this is set up as is there all we
need to do in our component is just
saying require and then wherever the CSS
is the path to the CSS file and then
that CSS is going to get loaded into
this component when it's rendered in the
Dom that is really cool I love doing
that because it means we can
compartmentalize or make CSS components
if you like rather than just having one
big CSS file so I've created some CSS
already for this application and it's on
a gist I'm gonna leave this link down
below and there's three CSS components
we can create only two at the minute
because we've only got two components
the index and the to-do component but
there's going to be three for the entire
application when we're finished so let's
just do the first two at the minute so
let us grab the index dot CSS file and
that's two
this stuff right here up until that
comment so we're going to copy that and
I'm gonna go out here yeah up and go to
new folder call this folder CSS in here
create a new file and I'm going to call
this index dot CSS and I'm gonna paste
this stuff into that file okay so that's
our index dot CSS and we're going to
load this into the index GS component
okay let's create a new file and this
time I want to call this to-do item dot
CSS so this is gonna be the CSS fault I
want to do component right there to-do
item and this stuff is below this
comment so let's grab that stuff and
paste it right in here by the way
there's nothing difficult about these
stars they are basically just some
really simple styles
feel free to browse through them just to
make it look nicer so now we have those
two CSS components or files if you like
in the CSS folder and we can require
them in our components so that they get
loaded in for those components so this
is the to-do item component so we'll
just say require and we want to require
this thing right here so it's gonna be
dot /to say the current directory then
in the CSS directory then forward slash
to-do item list tell me I'm gonna put
the extension dot CSS so now we've
required that CSS for this component
awesome
well let's copy that dude and paste it
into the other one as well right here
this time we want the index dot CSS for
this one since it's the index component
and save it awesome okay so this isn't
gonna work
just yet and the reason is because we've
not actually installed the CSS loaders
so we need to do that before this works
so even though in the web config file
right here we've said we want to use
these loaders the star loader and the
CSS loader we've not yet installed them
so let's do that let's head over here
and say npm install and it's going to be
the style
- loader and also the CSS loader and
we're going to save these to our dev
dependent
so answer that's gonna install those
Lotus all right so what's those bad boys
I've installed I want to go back to my
command line and I want to run NPM start
again so I'm gonna press control c to
exit out of the current job press yes
and then I can say NPM start that's
gonna run the start script which is
gonna run web pack and all that jazz all
right cool so once that's running we can
finally head back to the browser and we
can see those Styles in action pretty
cool right so now those styles are being
imported into those different components
and we can see them right here in the
browser so there we go we have
successfully modularized our code we've
split it up into logical sections so
that it's much easier to maintain or
edit in their future so in the next
video i want to move on to adding more
items into this list and to do that
we're gonna have to create a form so
I'll see you in that tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
