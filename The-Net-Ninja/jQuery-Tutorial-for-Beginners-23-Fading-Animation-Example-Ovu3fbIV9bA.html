jQuery for beginners on lesson 23 and in
this video I want to do a quick
animation example in particular a quote
fader Wow okay they're ninjas so what I
want to do in this lesson is a quick
example of some of those animate methods
we've seen okay because I've been
running on about doing something that's
practical and you would probably use on
a modern web site okay so that's what
we're gonna do in this lesson we're
going to grab this quote right here it's
a block pork tag and we're gonna fade it
out and show a new quote then fade it
out and show a new one every few seconds
all right so that's what we're gonna do
and you can see to do that what I've
done is copied this initial block quote
I've had right there and I've just
pasted it a couple of times underneath
and then change the text a little bit
now you might be thinking well why if
you've added those to block box are they
not showing on the page over here and
that my friends is because I've updated
the CSS as follows I've said grab all
the block quotes and display them as nod
as default so that's hiding every block
caught on the page then get the first
attack block quote which is just the
first one in the stack and display that
as block so it's just displaying that
first one but not the others all right
but we're going to change that via the
JavaScript as we cycle through them so
then how do we do this well there's a
few different steps the first thing I
want to do is create a couple of
variables all right now the first
variable I want to create is going to be
called all quotes and what that's going
to do is store all the different block
called objects for us
okay so we'll use jQuery to grab those
like this and that is gonna go out and
grab all of those block quotes and store
them in a jQuery object array okay so we
can access each one of those now now
that the second variable I want to
create is called current quote I'm gonna
set that equal to zero to begin with now
current quote is going to store where
we're up to in the cycle okay so if
we're showing this quote then it's gonna
be zero
if we're showing this quote it's gonna
be one if we're showing this quote it's
gonna be two so it's gonna keep track of
where we are through the site
a block book tags all right the next
thing I want to do is create a function
and this function is going to control
the fading in and out of these black
holes so we'll call this function change
quote that makes sense right because
we're going to change the call each time
it's cold all right there so within this
function is where we want to change this
quote now then the first thing we want
to do is grab the current quote that
we're currently showing okay because
we're going to fade that out so to do
that I want to say all quotes that's
this variable right here okay and then
I'm going to use the array notation and
pass through current quote and currently
it's set to 0 so that's going to be 0
and it's gonna be the first quote this
one okay it's gonna bring button that to
us but remember when we use this array
notation on our jQuery object it's gonna
unwrap that jQuery object so now we
can't use that fade-out method okay so
what we need to do is wrap this back up
in the chip weari wrapper like that
alright then we can use the fade-out
method which I will do now fade-out and
then I'm just gonna pass through 200
milliseconds that's how long it's gonna
take so just to quickly go through this
again guys because I know it might be a
little bit complicated what we're doing
is we're saying okay get all quotes
which is this array of jabber jQuery
objects these things right here yet then
we're using array notation to pass him
this number right here which is
currently 0 but if this was one then it
would want if this was 2 then it be - so
it's gonna grab whichever block what
we're currently showing makes sense then
we're gonna wrap that back up in the
jQuery wrapper because when we use this
array notation to grab one of those
objects it all wraps it from jQuery so
we're wrapping it back up in that jQuery
wrapper so that we can now use this
jQuery method fade-out and we're saying
we want to fade out over 200
milliseconds okay so now we've faded out
that current block quote the next thing
we want to do is do a quick if statement
I'm gonna write this code first of all
then I'll explain it I'm gonna say if
Curren quote is equal we use the W
equals remember all quotes dot length
minus one then print Walt equals zero
else
currents quote plus plus okay then so
let me just go through this what we're
doing is we're first fading out the
current quote then we're checking if the
current quote which is this number here
is equal to remember we have to use the
double equal sign because if we use a
single equal sign that's the assignment
operator this is like the Equality
operator to check if something is equal
when we use double so we same if the
current quote this number here is equal
to all quotes length and remember the
length of this is currently three
because there's three elements in that
array so all quotes length minus one so
that's to write this number is two so if
current quote equals 2 which is the last
one here right because it's zero one and
two that's why we had to use the minus
one okay because this is two because
it's zero based so if this is ever equal
to two then reset the current quote
equal to zero
okay so we're going back to that to the
beginning because there's not another
block wall here afterwards so once we
get to the end we're going to reset it
back to zero and go back to the
beginning okay if it's not equal to or
pops not length for example if the
current quote is zero then what we'll do
is add one to the current quote okay and
then that's going to be this one so then
what we wanted to do is fade in whenever
current quote is going to be so I can
sing now jQuery or quotes and then grab
the current quote because we've just
updated this value here depending on
what it currently is right and by the
way I've wrapped that back in the jQuery
wrapper much like up here because we're
going to fade in that current quote now
so fade in and we'll pass through 200
milliseconds there as well that's gonna
be the speed and then that is pretty
much it right but what we need to do is
call this function that's not going to
run on its own okay we need something to
call that function we want this to be
time based so that every say 3 seconds
it changes quote and we know from the
JavaScript tutorial for beginners series
that we can use the set interval method
right built into JavaScript this is a
jQuery method this is just a simple
JavaScript method so let's come down
here and we'll say var quote timer and
I'll I'm doing is storing this set
interval method into a variable so that
in the future if I ever wanted to stop
this interval I can do because this
variable is giving me a handle onto this
interval right you can go back and check
out the interval tutorials I'll leave a
link to those down below so I'm going to
set this equal to set interval and then
the set interval method takes two
parameters the first one is going to be
the function we want to call which is
change quote that's this function we've
made right up here and the second
parameter is the how often we want to
call it so I'm going to say every 3
seconds we want that quote to change so
I'm going to say 300 or 3,000 rather
milliseconds just like that okay
so that there is about it now there is
one more thing we need to do but what I
want to do is refresh over here first of
all and show you what this does okay so
you can see it's fading out one and it's
faded in the next one but it kind of
jumps up and down okay and that's
because we're starting to fade this one
out and before it's fully faded out
we're doing all this code right here
we've started fading then you want in
okay so it's doubling up on the content
before it has a chance to fade this
first one out now what we need to do is
find out a way to wait until this is
complete then we can start to fade in
the next one okay
so we know we can pass through callback
functions to this fade-out method that
was in the fade-out tutorial I did
just a couple of tutorials ago so what
I'm gonna do is pass through a function
here
I remember this callback function only
fires when this animation is complete
all right so just going to wait until it
fully fade-out
so we've got that callback function
right there and all we need to do guys
is cook all this code there and paste it
within the callback function just like
that all right so now all this is only
go fire
once this fade-out animation is fully
complete so let's save that and give it
a whirl again I'm gonna refresh now
let's have a look fades out on the next
one then fades in much more smooth or
smoothly if I've got my words mixed up
there but yeah I think it'd agree that
looks a little bit nicer so that is it
guys we have made our very old quote
fader okay and you see these on websites
all over the show where they've got
loads of different qualities you don't
want to list them and take up loads of
room on the website so they do just a
quick fader like this so they can show
users all the different you know great
feedback they've had from customers so
if you have any questions about this
whatsoever feel free to drop a comment
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to share subscribe and like and I'll see
you in the very next video where we're
going to take a look at another
animation example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
