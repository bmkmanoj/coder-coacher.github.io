tenth angular2 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to introduce you to data
binding okay so so far we've seen
components and we've created a component
now how they can form this tree like
structure and we've seen the parts that
make up a component which is the
component type script file which is
where other logic of the component goes
in that class itself we have the view or
the template part of the component which
is a HTML file that is what is rendered
to the user when this component is
loaded and then finally we have this CSS
file which is part the component as well
which just styles this view and we've
briefly seen the exchange of data
between the typescript file the class
and the template and that was when we
output the title which was defined in
the route app component here but I'm
going to talk about that a little bit
more now so I deal it in an application
what we want is for the area which
controls the logic of a component this
typescript file in the class to be able
to freely pass data back and forth from
the template so the the template can
output whatever data you have to the
user and likewise when the user
interacts with the template on the
website itself then that can trigger
some kind of event which may be passing
data back or fires a function in this
component which can manipulate that data
okay so all this is to do with data
binding in angular 2 and it can go two
ways from the component to the template
and from the template to the component
so the way that data flows into the view
is first of all by string interpolation
and we've briefly seen this already this
is how we output the title in the app
root component and we use double curly
braces to output those variables and
these always result to a string in the
template I'm going to show you these
again in a minute and then the other way
that data flows into the view is by
property binding and that's where we
surround the properties on HTML elements
in this case is the required property we
surround those with
these square brackets to bind an
expression to that property so this
expression here would resolve to either
true or false
okay and we can control that logic in
the class in the typescript file itself
and I'm going to show you that as well
later on so the way that data flows out
of the view and back into the typescript
file the class is first of all by event
binding and this is where we can bind
events to certain elements such as a
click event like this and the way we do
it is by surrounding that click by
parentheses like this and we set it
equal to an expression or function and
the component class can handle this
event we can define this function on the
class itself so that when we have a
click the component class can fire this
function and again I'm going to show you
this later in more detail as well and
then finally data flow can be both ways
at the same time through two-way data
binding and this was kind of a big thing
in angular 1 and the way we do this is
by for example on an input field where a
user can type in some text we say
ng-model
just like that in square brackets and
then just normal parenthesis and then we
set that equal to some kind of model of
object or value so when a user types
into the input field that's going to
update this value right here and then
now that will update the model slash
objects let's value in the component
class itself and in turn that updates
any reference to that kind of value in
the view or template and I'm going to
show you this in more detail as well
because all this right now might seem a
little bit kind of off-the-wall but when
we dive into some examples it's all
going to make sense ok so right now I've
just opened up the whole component HTML
file and the home component type script
file this is the component we made in
the last tutorial or a couple of
tutorials back for the whole view right
now all we're doing is outputting this
homeworks and then this ng-content stuff
and if we take a look at a browser this
is what it looks like just says
homeworks and this hello there is from
the
stuff right here okay so what if we want
to output some dynamic data here instead
of homeworks what we can do that let's
just head to the home component type
script file and then right here in the
classes where we can define that data so
I can define a variable right here and I
can say something like whole title and
then set that equal to some kind of
string it says welcome to the home page
dot dot okay so now that variable is
defined on this component class this
home component class and now we can pass
this data in to this view so let's save
it first of all and then let's pass this
data into the view and the way I'm going
to show you how to do this in this
tutorial is just by string interpolation
which we've already seen and remember
it's just the angle brackets like that
then we can delete homeworks and instead
we want to output this variable so
that's all we do we grab this variable
and we output it inside these curly
braces like that and then this is going
to resolve in the view and it's going to
output the value of that as a string in
the browser okay
so let's save it just to make sure it's
worked and if we go over here we can
wait if we want it will also update but
I'm pretty impatient so I'm going to
refresh plus my computer's going quite
slow and there we go it now says welcome
to the home page pretty cool so let's
just test this if we change this welcome
to the ninja directory save it and this
should now update over here cool there
we go welcome to the ninja directory so
that is string interpolation and I'm
going to show you all the other ways we
can bind data and fire events in the
next few tutorials any questions so far
leave those down below otherwise I'm
going to see you in the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
