lesson over what I think is quite
possibly the best of UGS to tutorial
series on YouTube but then I am bias ok
then so first things first what is view
js well it's a front and the framework
and we can use this framework to create
JavaScript driven applications for the
web now because it uses JavaScript all
of this code can be run in the browser
so there's no need to reach out to a
server to reload pages or to load other
pages so we end up with this really
seamless web application and in that way
is very similar to react or angular so
what makes UGS a bit different well
first of all it is very lean it's about
16 kilobytes the production version so
it loads really quickly and it's also
going very high real time performance
now the cool thing is that despite that
it still maintains a lot of the features
you'd expect from a front and frameworks
such as components filters forms gave
the binding etc yeah routing is a
separate package which we have to
install on top of this but even then
it's very lean indeed ok so in this
series I've kind of split it up into two
sections the first section I'm going to
show you how to install of UGS the easy
way using a CDN a content delivery
network so we're going to get up and
running very quickly and I'm going to
show you the basics such as conditionals
events data etc then when we understand
the basics we're going to move on an
install of UGS with the view CLI and web
pack which is what we typically do for a
larger application we're going to dive
deeper into components review files and
templates and we're going to tackle a
few different projects along the way so
one of those little projects we're going
to be making is this blog right here I
thought I'd give you a sneak preview
where we can lift our blogs we can
search for them and we can also click
into them to see more of it we're going
to also add new blogs and we're going to
hook this up to firebase to store those
new blogs and retrieve them as well so
I'm going to show you that too so all of
this is created with vue.js and firebase
the text editor I'm going to be using
for this series is called Adam I mention
this because a lot of you always ask me
what text editor amusing it's this one
you can download it for free
awesome but I owe I employee to do so
and finally I've created course files
for every single lesson in this tutorial
series Gizem super cool and if you want
the files for lesson 10 for example just
go to the lesson 10 branch and you can
see them and download them all there so
enough talking let's go ahead and
install Vijay s so I've gone to the view
Jas guide right here I'm going to leave
a link to this down below and you want
to click on installation now if we go
down here to the CDN option it's going
to recommend a link to you so let's copy
that link and if we go to Assam now you
can see I've got an empty folder called
view GS playlist I'm going to
right-click this and create a new file
called index.html ok now if I take the
mail tab it's going to make this little
boilerplate for me yours might do the
same thing titled view Jas tutorials and
then we want to link in this script so
let's say script source is equal to this
thing that we just copied and closed up
and one hour we've installed view GS
here we can now use it in this file
pretty cool that's how easy it is to get
started so I want to do one more thing
and let Excel link up a style sheet so
let's say the link href equals style
that's what it's going to be called and
the rel attribute is equal to style
sheet ok and now we want to create that
style sheet by going to here and writing
new file and call in this style of CSS
and while our darielle we're ready to go
now in the next tutorial we're going to
dive into actually creating some view
J's code but before you start the next
tutorial I just want to make sure you
ought to speed on a couple of things
first of all JavaScript this playlist is
going to use JavaScript and very heavily
so I expect you to know at least the
basics so we don't check out my
JavaScript for beginners playlist the
link is going to be down below and
probably popping out on the screen some
time run about now secondly HTML and
maybe CSS we're going is both of these
quite a lot in this series as well and
again I've got a series on both HTML and
CSS the links are also going to be down
below so there we go guys that is your
whirlwind introduction to view Jas in
the next video we are going to get stuck
into writing of UGS code but if you
enjoy these videos please my friends
don't forget to share subscribe
like them and I'm going to see you in
the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
