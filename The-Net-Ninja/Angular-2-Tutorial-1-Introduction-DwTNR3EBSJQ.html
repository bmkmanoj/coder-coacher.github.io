your very first angular 2 tutorial all
right so I'm super excited to create
this course because I know a lot of you
have been asking for it and I really
enjoyed working with it myself
and I know a lot of you are probably
going to have a good idea of what
angular 2 is but just in case you don't
it is just a JavaScript framework for
creating dynamic web applications and
this time around it is component based
it's not your typical MVC we're going to
be working with here and that just
basically means that everything on the
applications that we create is a
component and we can control them
individually in the code for example the
navbar is a component the sidebar is a
component pretty much every element
which stands alone on your web
application is going to be a component
and we're going to learn much more about
them in this playlist it is also written
with typescript and that gives us some
extra functionality that we wouldn't
normally have with vanilla JavaScript
and I'm going to give you a quick primer
on typescript as well so don't worry if
you don't know that and it is also quite
different from angular 1 so if you've
been working with that in the past and
you're moving to angular 2 then some
things are gonna come as it as a bit of
a shock to you but don't worry I'm going
to explain everything as we go along so
before you start I just wanna warn you
that we are going to need the node
package manager and for that we're going
to have to install no JX don't worry it
is super simple and I'm going to show
you where you can download that and
install it from second of all you're
going to need to know a bit of
JavaScript slash typescript and I've put
slash typescript because that's what
we're going to be writing in in this
tutorial series but you don't really
need to know it is very much like
JavaScript it is just a superset of it
which gives us some additional
functionality which I am going to
explain as we go along and like I say
I'm also going to give you a primer on
it as well before we start finally if
you don't know HTML and CSS then you are
in the wrong place my friends because
you need to start off of learning that
first of all every web application
pretty much requires HTML and CSS so
I've kind of split this playlist up into
two and the first section is all going
to be about the core features of angular
2 and how it all works together
we're going to look at things like
component directives and templates then
when we've got the basics covered we're
going to create a simple directory
application from scratch and we're going
to look at things like routing services
and eventually we're going to hook up
our application to a data service called
firebase all right so here's just a
quick preview of what we're going to be
building just a simple directory
application where we can list different
ninjas and their belt color and we can
also add ninjas to by giving them a name
and a belt color and this is all going
to be hooked up to firebase and I've
spelled purple run which is why that is
not being added but we'll do it again
there we go and we can also filter them
by name and we can also delete them as
well so this is what we're going to be
building and we're going to be building
it in Adam which is the text editor I'm
going to be using for this playlist now
this text editor is completely freaking
it from Adam I oh I'll show that website
right here just go to this link and
download it here completely free and
it's really cool I'm using a couple of
packages also for this playlist the
first one is going to be this thing
right down here which is called the
platform ale IDE terminal so you want to
search for that package if you want this
and also I'm going to be using this
language typescript grammars only
package which gives us some syntax
highlighting for typescript I've also
created a repository for this playlist
which has got just a few assets in it
which can find in this folder it's just
a stylesheet and a logo and we're going
to use that for our application so if
you want to go and download those you
can do right here I'll leave the link to
this repository down below and you can
just click this button and download it
to your desktop so there we go that's
your quick introduction to this playlist
in the very next tutorial I'm going to
show you how we can download angular and
install it onto our computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
