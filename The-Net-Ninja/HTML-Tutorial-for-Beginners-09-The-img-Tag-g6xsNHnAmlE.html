ninja and this is lesson 9 in HTML
basics the image tag so surprise
surprise the image tag is what we use to
show images to the user and we do this
by specifying within the tag where the
image is stored using the source
attribute now if you remember from
previous tutorials I said that all tags
can have these things called attributes
and attributes are just a way of
specifying additional information to the
tag about that time so in this case is
the source attribute and within the
source attribute we're going to say
where the image is being stored the path
to the image so we're going to jump back
into brackets now and we're going to pop
an image in our web page right here I am
exactly where we left off last time and
I think what I want to do is pop a
really big banner at the top of the
webpage just to catch some attention but
before I do that I'm going to quickly
explain how I've stored my image so if
you look in the left hand kind of
navigation bit here we've got this image
folder and I've created this folder by
right-clicking and going to new folder
and then you can see you can type in
your folder name app or image too and
then what you want to do is find your
image wherever it stored whether it's on
your computer or whether it's online
from a website you want to save it into
this folder once you've done that we're
ready to crack on I'm going to delete
this image to folder because I've
already done it here and you can see
within this folder I've named my image
fish - banner jpg and I got this from a
website called free images calm and free
images calm is a pretty cool website for
just kind of developing websites locally
on your machine and testing and whatnot
so you can go here I've searched for
fish and I found this one which I really
think kinda captures everything that mr.
mr. greens smelly fish Emporium is all
about so I'm going to use this image you
can use whichever image you want to do
once you've got that save it into the
folder and I'll see you back inside
brackets okay so once you've saved your
image we're going to add it into our
HTML document so the first thing we want
to do is add the
tag and the attribute the sauce we're
going to specify where it's being stored
and this attribute is going to be
relative to this HTML document so our
image is being stored in this folder
here so what we want to do is type in
the folder name first of all and you can
see that brackets is giving me kind of a
tip as to where it thinks the image is
going to be stored itself and it's
suggesting we put this forward slash
here because that means we're going to
say to the document look we're going
inside this folder inside the image
folder I want to put the forward slash
it's found this image called fish -
banner so I can just double click this
everyone I'll just single click it
rather and it's going to pop that in for
me and show me a little thumbnail which
is really cool just to make sure I've
got the right one so we've put our we've
put the path to our image in and we're
going to save this out now and see what
it looks like in the browser ok there it
is and it's pretty big and one thing I
don't like about this is that we're
having to scroll all the way to the
right to see the full image now I don't
want it to go off the page I want it to
be just as wide as as the browser is so
we can do this by specifying some width
and height attributes to the image in
the image tag so we'll jump back into
brackets and we'll say a width attribute
equals 100% and this is going to say to
the browser look whatever size you are
make this image 100% width of that
browser and we can specify a height if
we want but I'm going to leave this
blank you do it like this I'm going to
leave it blank in fact I'm not going to
have it at all because all I care about
is specifying the width of the image I
want it to be 100% and then it will work
out high automatically dependent on the
weight so I'm going to save this and
again we're going to view this in the
browser
oops not that show me the there we go
that's why
there we go so now you can see we don't
have the scrollbar at the top it's just
taking the image and it's just as wide
as the browser is now you can do this
you can add the width attribute to the
HTML tag however I prefer to do it all
in the CSS we're separating the visual
aspects then to the structural aspects I
see the HTML as being the structure of
everything and the CSS as being the kind
of design visual aspects of everything
so personally I'd recommend specifying
the width of the image as 100% in the
CSS but you can do it this way this
entirely your call
so seeing that much I'm going to take
off the width attribute there is one
more attribute in the image tag that I
think is worth mentioning and that is
the alt attribute and what this is is a
way it provided some alternative text
instead of the image so if you've got a
screen reader or a website crawler
coming out to your website and they
don't see images but they will read the
alt text so we just give the image in
some kind of short description and I'm
just going to say mr. greens fish
Emporium so a screen reader wouldn't see
the banner they'd see this little bit of
text here and we'd save that out and
it's not going to have any effect
visually so I'm not going to jump into a
browser this is just so you can kind of
get into the habit of putting alt text
in the the tag just for kind of
accessibility issues okay so that's all
there is to the image tag in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is cover
links and we're going to make like a
nice little navigation system for the
website I'll see you guys then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
