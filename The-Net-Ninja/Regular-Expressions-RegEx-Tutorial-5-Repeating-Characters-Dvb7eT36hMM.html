showed you how we can use ranges in
character sets so we don't have to write
out all of the numbers but we also tried
to match a phone number which is eleven
digits long so to match that we had to
do these character sets in these ranges
in eleven times to match those in eleven
consecutive numbers now this is long
winded and I said if we want to repeat a
certain character for example if we want
to repeat this thing right here over and
over we can do that easier in a regular
expression so I'm going to show you a
few ways to do this
so let's just delete all this for now
and if we place now after this range a
plus sign what this is saying is okay
this character set right here with the
range in I want you to match that at
least one times up to as many times as
you want so any number any length long
will match so if I put a 1 a 0 in this
matches a 1 0 1 matches etc any number
of numbers longer any number of
characters long this is a match that's
what the plus sign does it means
unlimited times but at least 1 ok now
this is fine but this is not going to
match a phone number because obviously a
user would be able to enter in 30
numbers and this regular expression
would say yeah that 30 number string is
a match but in fact I don't want it to
be a match because I want my characters
to be 11 long okay there needs to be 11
numbers in that drink so how can we
specify that we want an exact amount of
times to repeat this well let's delete
that plus sign and what we do is open up
our curly braces after the range after
the count de set and we can type in how
long we want this string to be or how
many times we want this particular
character set to repeat so if we place
in 11 here it means
okay well match this 11 times next to
each other so now if I do a number which
is 11 numbers long so let's just try
this now it works okay so that's a much
easier way to specify that we want so
much a phone number than writing this
out 11 times
next we
Jilla I hope that makes sense we can
also do this with words so if I take out
the zero to nine and instead do a to Z
this means much an 11-letter word okay
because we're going from A to Z in
eleven times now let's just knock this
down to five so it's easier to write and
if I tap out now ninja that's a match
because it's five letters long and the
roll from A to Z and if I type out hello
this is a match etc now if I want
something to be between five and say
eight characters long I can do that we
just place a comma
take out the space if we don't want that
a comma between the 5 and the 8 and this
says okay well match this thing right
here match this character set this range
between five to eight times so a five
letter word will match six letter word
will match seven letters and
eight-letter word matches okay
so let's give this a whirl let's do
something that's eight letters long I
can't think of it off the top of my head
so let's just put Wow on the end of that
may see this is a match and that's eight
letters long and if we do ninja with an
S on the end that sits like this long
this matches so you get the idea we can
match between five and eight letters
using this thing right here and again
that's going to work with numbers it's
not just letter so he was put a zero to
nine in here instead and if I tap one
two three four five this matches because
it's from five four dozen of five does
six seven eight that all matches but
when I do nine the nine is not included
in that match okay so that is how we can
specify any number of times we want
something that repeated oh by the way I
want to show you one more thing imagine
we want something to show at least five
characters long so we take out the
second number but leave the comment in
and this means match anything that's at
least five characters so four characters
don't match five characters do but that
will go up to anything now up to
infinity if you like okay no matter how
long that number is now it's going to
much because we're same from five to
whatever up here okay so there we go
that's how
we can repeat certain things over and
over in a regular expression much easier
than copying this and pasting it in ten
or however many times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
