structure in place in our JavaScript so
that when a user types into a field
what's happening is we're listening for
that key open we're finding out the name
property of that field right here and
we're using this to query the patterns
right here to get the appropriate
regular expression to test against so
we're passing in that regular expression
and the field itself whichever input box
is into this validate function we're
testing that regular expression against
the field value over here so we're
getting whatever the user types into the
field right there if it's true we're
adding a class of valid if it's false
we're adding a class of invalid so this
is all working and now all we really
need to do is add on the rest of the
regular expressions for the rest of the
form fields so in this video I'm going
to show you three of them the username
the password and the profile slug the
email we'll do in the next video because
it's a little bit more complex so the
user name first of all the user name
must be alphanumeric and contain between
five to twelve characters so any
lowercase letter
the uppercase letter and any digit
between zero and nine and the whole
thing's gotta be between five and twelve
characters long so this is pretty simple
to do so first of all we need to give
this a property name in the patents
object and again this is important it
must match whatever the name property is
on that input field so on this one it's
user name so let's grab that thing right
there and paste it in all right here so
that's the property name and this
regular expression is contained within
the two forward slashes we'll do our
carrot first of all and our dollar sign
to mark the start and the end of the
string then what we want to do is create
a character set and I said that this
username could be any letter A to Z so
let's do a to Zed first of all it can be
case insensitive so we'll add the I flag
on at the end so they can do uppercase
or lowercase we also said that it can be
any number from 0 to 9 now we could do 0
to 9 in there as well but instead we
could just do backslash D the meta
character for a digit and that's the
same thing 0 tonight
finally we need to say that this is
between five and twelve characters along
so there we go
that is it for the username and if we
refresh over here we can start typing
into the username field notice at the
minute there's no class associated with
it but if we start typing in something
we can see invalid a minute that's
because it's only two characters long
and it needs to be at least five
characters long but when it reaches five
characters we get the valid class right
there and this is true all the way up to
twelve characters so the minute it gets
to thirteen we get invalid take that
away is valid and we can add numbers as
well so something like that this would
be valid just as long as it's between
five and twelve characters sweet so now
we've done the first input field over
here for the username now the next one
and once a tackle is the password and
the password again must be alphanumeric
but also now we can have the @ sign
underscores and hyphens and this must be
between eight and twenty characters long
so let's go over here and this time we
want to call this one password because
this is the name property of the
password field all right so this
password again will contain in the two
forward slashes for our regular
expression we'll do our carrot and our
dollar to mark the beginning and the end
of the test string and same as above we
could say something like this a to Z and
also the digit character now that would
get us any letter and number which we
said we could have over here but notice
this we also said underscores and what
captures underscores as well as letters
and numbers well it's the word
metacharacter remember we covered that
in a previous tutorial and it looks
something like this it's backslash w and
that says okay match any letter or per
case all lowercase any digit from zero
to nine and also underscores so we've
captured a lot of what's allowed here
using just one meta character so all we
need to account for now is the @ symbol
and the - so we can place that in the
character set we can do a nap and the -
and now we're saying in this position
match any of
these things so any word character any
at symbol or a - we also want this to be
between 8 and 20 characters long so I'll
save that and see if this works
head over it and refresh so the password
let's just do test one two three four so
if we scroll down here we can see now
we've got the valid for the password if
I delete a character goes in violent
because it becomes seven characters long
and we need at least eight so test one
two three four works if we add an at
symbol that works an underscore that's
still valid - still valid but if we add
something other than these things such
as a plus symbol it becomes invalid
likewise if we go over the limit of
twenty characters it becomes invalid as
well alright so now we've sorted that
one thing I do you want to do with this
field is going to the HTML and change
the type equal to password so that it
hides what we're typing because that's
typically what you do refresh and I'm
just going to type something in here for
a password and we can see now that that
is valid - cool okay so finally the
profile slug so the profile slug is
something in a URL so Sates
you know my site com /my - profile this
here would be the slug so we're saying
the slug can contain only lowercase
letters numbers and hyphens and be
between 8 and 20 characters long again
so let's create a regular expression for
this if we go into the validation J's
file this time the name property is
called slug so let's call this log here
again two forward slashes first of all
then the character say the star then the
dollar to say the end so we said any
lowercase letter only so we'll do a to
Zed we also said any number so let's do
backslash D for the digit meta character
and finally we said we can have hyphens
as well so let's add a hyphen in there
as well and we want this to be between
eight and twenty characters long so
we'll add that in at the end so this
should hopefully work if I
fresh over here let's inspect this field
currently no class I'll start to type
something in like Ninja is invalid
because it's still not eight characters
long so they were - I'll do page now
this is valid I could do page one and
it's valid page two because we're
allowing numbers as well but if I add
something like an @ symbol becomes
invalid or an underscore invalid or if I
go too long over the twenty characters
it's also going to become invalid
awesome so now we've covered four of the
fields in total username password
telephone and the profile slogan so all
we really need to do now is the email
and then add some finishing touches as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
