watching jQuery for beginners lesson 9
and in this video I want to start adding
some content to our HTML document Wow
okay they're going so as you can see up
here I've added a new section through
the HTML just beneath the last section
right here that's got an idea of tweets
in that I've got hate to say MIT tweet
that's this green box right here then
within that I've got a div tag and
within that a P tag seen for all tweets
check out our Twitter so what I want you
to imagine is this I've created some
super duper code to pull in my latest
tweet from my Twitter account you don't
need to worry about what code I've used
to do that just imagine it so I've got
all of that tweet and I've stored it in
a string right there within a div tag so
just made some HTML stored it in a
string with my latest tweet embedded in
it alright so that is stored in a
variable called sweet so now that we've
got that tweet what I'm gonna do is show
you how we would dynamically add content
using jQuery to the document and there's
a few different ways we can do this so
I'm going to show you a few and then
we're going to start with the append
method so I've written them all down
here by the way so I'm going to show you
six append prepend before after HTML and
text so we'll start with this top one
append but first of all what I want to
do is go out and grab this element
because this is where we're going to do
all the action this is where we're going
to add content yet so to do that I'm
going to use the dollar sign then grab
first of all the tweets section like
that and then get the div tag within
that alright so that's the element now
we're going to operate on this element
using these different methods and the
first one is append and then within
brackets what we want to do is say tweet
because that's the content we're
appending right there so what append
does my friends is take this element and
then it says I want to add some content
to the bottom of this element alright so
this is the element we've got and we're
going to add some content at the bottom
of it so here after the P right because
that would be the bottom
that's what append does and it takes
this variable this is the content you
want to append to this element makes
sense right so let's save that let's see
what happens
check out this on the right now we've
got this tweet appended to this div it's
been neat the P tag because we set up
end which means go to the bottom the
Bigfoot live have versus cheese
all right so that is append by the way
I've styled is already in the CSS I've
given this base style right here you can
see margin 20 pixels bloody blind blah
so that's where these stars coming from
all right so let's look at the next one
which is prepend which is the exact
whoops prepend that's right the exact
opposite of append
right it adds content to the top of an
element so whereas before we added after
the page this time it's going to add it
to the very top which is before the P so
I'm going to save this keep your eye out
down here and then we switched around
you can see it onto the top of the
element cool alright what's next we have
got before so let's put before it and
this time I don't want to grab the div
because I don't want to put it before
the div I want to put it before the P
tag right so let's put p p-- and save it
and then this should have change on the
right because it's still going to be in
the same position just before the P tag
so let's click Save and yep it's still
the same cool but if we change these to
after this time what we're saying is
grab the P tag and put this after the P
tag you know this content so let's save
again and now you can see it's gone
after the content cool all right
the next two are a little bit different
if we change this to HTML then what it's
going to do is take this P tag and all
this for all the inner content of the P
tag it's going to replace with this
right because is st. in the HTML within
that P tag and replace it with whatever
we've got here tweet now I don't want to
do that because we don't normally have a
div tag within a P tag that just doesn't
make sense so I'm going to delete the P
from this collector so what I'm doing
this time is grabbing this and I'm going
to replace all the content that's within
this div tag with here so
replace this p with this div so let's
save it and find out what it does yet
you can see right there it's done
exactly that
all right now if you change this to text
and put sweet then this doesn't really
make sense first of all we want that P
tag again so I'm going to change this to
P that makes a little bit more sense but
after this we're saying we want the text
of that P tag to be the tweet variable
which is next now this is not all text
alright some of this is cold now if I
save this it's going to print out all of
this as text to the screen so I'll show
you that I'll press save and you can see
right here now
we've got all of that there yeah but if
I say I just want this to be the tweet
around here click Save again this time
it's just updating the text of that P
tag and not inserting the code the div
tag alright so they are a few of the
ways that we can add code dynamically or
add content dynamically to our webpages
using jQuery really simple methods there
are a few more so what I'll do is leave
a link down below and you can go and
check out that link on the jQuery
website have a play around with a few
more of those methods otherwise guys if
you enjoy these videos don't forget to
subscribe like it share and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
