beginners lesson 44 and today we're
going to talk about the background
property Wow there's a Here I am back in
the HTML and as you can see I've
stripped it out quite a little bit we've
no longer got all of those divs here
we've got one remaining and that is the
one with a class of static width and for
that I've written this rule here which
is giving me element a width of 300
pixels and a height of 300 pixels so
we're going to take a look at this
background property all the background
properties I should say and there's
quite a few of them I'm not going to go
through them all just the three or four
most popular ones that you're going to
use probably 95% of the time the other
ones I'll leave a link to the the
mozilla developer guide on background
properties so you can go out and check
that out on your own after this video no
but I say the main three or four you'll
use 95% of the time and that's what
we're going to cover here so we're going
to start with the most basic background
property and that is the background
color and for that we just write
background - color and you've probably
seen me do this already throughout the
course but we can pass a value to it
that is a keyword which is one of these
things here that brackets is thrown up
very helpfully for me and there's quite
a lot so that's pretty cool we can get
whichever color we want from here or we
can use a hex code or an RGB value don't
worry about what we do for the value for
now I'm going to show you colors in an
entirely different video we're going to
concentrate on that there for now I just
want to show you the different
background properties so I'm going to
use a hex code which is going to be 600
600 C so and that's going to be a kind
of medium to dark gray so let's save
that now and take a look at this in a
browser to see how it looks all right
and there we go just a simple square
with a gray background color 300 pixels
in height and 300 pixels in width so
that's the background color that's all
there is to it dead simple now the
second one I'm going to show you is the
background image property and that is
just simply background didn't do do
image and it's a passive image to a
background that we have to first of all
specify because it's a you are
we're gonna give to this background
image property and then once we've done
that we open our parentheses enclose
them and within those parentheses we
write our link to our image so see
you've got your image posted I don't
know on your server or on photo bucket
or wherever you've got your image and
you want to link to it then we just
pasted it in here and I've already done
that I've copied copied one and that's
off the net means your website it's just
that little ninja star that you throw up
people I don't know what they're called
I think he's just a new just so we're
gonna put that as our background image
so I'll save that now we'll view this in
a browser that's assuming it looks like
all right cool there they are all these
little white things here that is the
ninja star and it's repeating itself
from left to right and from top to
bottom in a kind of grid format actually
this little gray thing looks pretty cool
doesn't it like a great relish yeah
anyway so that's what happens by default
it kind of repeats itself to the right
and repeats itself to the bottom okay so
how do we overcome this every only want
to show the image wants well we can do
that by using the background repeat'
party and we'd say background - or
repeat and then if we all we want to use
it once we don't want it to repeat then
we just simply write no - repeat okay
that's all there is to it and now if we
look at this show an explorer
oops as this donor laughs we're not
saved this but grown-ups here's the tip
guys if you want to do CSS learn to
spell because I certainly can't now
fingers crossed this should work
there we go
brilliant only shows once now in the top
left so by default background images
repeat left and right let's sorry left
to right and top to bottom if you don't
want them to repeat then you do a
background repeat property and set it to
no - repeat I'm going to show you one
other value of the background repeat
property and to do that I'm just going
to open this up in the console and you
can see here we've got the background
image property and then the background
repeat' property here and going to port
round and now can you see that it's made
the background image fit completely
within this kind of grid it goes around
the perimeter and it goes around inside
that and then around inside that if I
was to remove this and go back to the
default one you can see how now it's
stretched and it's kind of cut off at
the edges around make sure that it's not
put off at the edges okay so that's a
cool little technique as well so for now
we're going to leave this at no-repeat
so let's just get rid of this in fact go
back here and it's no repeat okay so our
background image is displaying once in
the top left now say we want to show it
in a different position well we can do
that and we can do that by saying
background - position and in this
incident I want to Center the image all
I can do that I can just for Center and
then that is going to align the image in
the very center of the element both
vertically and horizontally so let's
take a look at that in the browser
and there we go that's cool so right in
the middle now and if they inspect that
element I'm going to show you just
another couple of things we can test it
a background position property now we
can write top and left and that will be
the top left that's how it is a default
if we write top Center then it's the
central position at the top if we write
bottom Center then its bottom and center
and if we write let's think bottom right
then it's the bottom right and so forth
you can control these two values you
just pass two key words through and
those key words a right bottom left and
top then you can control where it's
going to be alternatively we can pass
percentage values through so I could say
20 percent and that's going to position
it 20 percent to the right and then I'll
say 10 percent and that's going to
position it 10 percent from the top okay
likewise I could say 80 percent to the
right and 60 percent from the top so you
can position this wherever you want and
we can work in pixels too so 20 pixels
and let's say 10 pixels okay so the
first value here is the position from
the left and the second value here is
the position 4 on the top so we can get
quite granular with this background
position property for now I'm just going
to keep this in the center as we have
done here but I don't like the size of
the background image I want it to be a
little bit bigger so I'm gonna say here
background - sighs oops and then I'm
going to pass this a property of 300
pixels no that's that's too big because
that's as big as the whole element let's
say 200 pixels all right and save that
so that means that the image now should
hopefully be around or exactly 200
pixels in width so let's have a look yep
there we go it looks a bit blurry
because the natural dimensions of my
which I'm much smaller than this I've
enlarged or blown it up and it looks a
bit blue but you get the point if you
want to make it smaller or larger and
you have a larger image to begin with
you can do that you can control it and
make it as large as you want
alright so they're all the different
properties I'm going to show you for
this lesson in the next lesson I'm going
to show you the shorthand way of
controlling the background properties so
that we can write this in one line okay
