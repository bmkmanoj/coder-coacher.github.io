welcome to your sixth responsive design
tutorial and in this video I want to
talk about fluid layouts Wow okay then
gang so before we dive into the car to
stop making it more responsive I want to
talk to you about one little thing and
that is a fluid website layout now what
I'm going to do is compare this to a
fixed layout a fluid layout use these
relative measurements and it responds to
the width of a viewport between your
media queries and fixed layouts use
static measurements and they do not
respond to the width of the viewport so
in my opinion it's always better to use
a fluid layout because you have varying
different screen sizes and you want to
capture them all and whereas a static or
fixed layout will capture certain
breakpoints like for example you've got
a breakpoint at 768 pixels so it's going
to change then but between that
breakpoint and the previous one or the
next one you don't want it to be static
you want to pick up a whole range of
different device widths so I'm going to
show you a quick example now ok then
guys so I'm back here in this website
that we made up and we've got these two
media queries right here just added a
couple of comments and this is for
tablets this first media query and this
second one is for mobiles and typically
when you're making a responsive website
you're going to have these two media
queries or two breakpoints at a bare
minimum okay I pretty much use these in
most of my projects and the first one
tablets I've used a max width of 768
pixels because that's like the ballpark
figure of a lot of tablet widths and I
might do another one Pierre that's like
900 something for bigger tablets but
these are the kind of base ones I use so
that's four tablets and then this one
here for mobiles and it's got a maximum
width of 480 pixels so anything below
that is going to show these styles and
it's going to target pretty much every
our most mobile devices okay so at the
minute this website is using a kind of
like a fluid layout because I've used
percentages and these are relative
measurements they're not absolute or
static measurements so you can see
currently these are all about 23% in
width right and as I reduce the size of
the browser or the viewport you can see
these are
it's smaller but there's still our 23%
in width okay so they're still taking up
23% and they're still equally spaced
apart and that is what I mean by fluid
width for all of these different widths
right here or a fluid layout should say
all of these different widths which
could represent all different device
viewports we're still getting this 20%
23% width on here and they're shrinking
according to the device viewport width
okay so the relative to the viewport
width and they're responding to it
however if I was to use say a static
measurement let's just take it down to
this first breakpoint right here which
is 7 6 8 now if I make this instead with
let's say 320 pixels yeah so we're going
to get to the same hair in each column
but this time they're not percentages
okay so they're not going to change
width depending on the width of this so
as I scoot this lower you can see
they're not changing width and when I
get here it's going to move them like
that we've got this huge space on the
right hand side so they're not
responding to the viewport width and
this is what is considered a static
layout okay and I don't like to do this
because then for all these different
width devices between here when it first
happens and then here phoronix pixels
for all those different widths there
it's going to look like this which I
don't like okay so if I change this back
to a relative measurement and that was
46% then this time as I scroll or rather
reduce the size of the viewport the size
of these are going to respond to the
viewport they're going to get smaller
and they're still going to remain for X
its percent in width until they reach
this breakpoint so it looks good and all
these devices okay so that is what I
mean guys by a fluid layout and that is
why I prefer them so I'm going to be
using relative measurements like
percentages in the rest of this playlist
and I suggest when you're making
responsive websites you do the same
unless you're just targeting very
specific devices with very specific
widths and you're not typed in a whole
range of different widths okay so that
is my suggestion
to you I'll see you guys in the next
