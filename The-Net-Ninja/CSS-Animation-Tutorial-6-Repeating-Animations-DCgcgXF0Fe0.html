sixth CSS animation tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at
repeating our animation ah alright so so
far this animation can adjust runs from
beginning and then he does nothing else
at the end it just does it once and
that's it but what if we want to repeat
this animation right first of all what
I'm going to do is take off that delay
from the last tutorial we don't want
that anymore and then what I would like
to happen is for this dude Mario to keep
on driving around right so we can use
the animation iteration count property
to kind of control how many times we
want this animation to repeat so say we
want this to repeat three times I could
say animation - iteration - count and
then we could set that to three and that
is going to basically tell this dude to
repeat the animation three times over so
let's just take a quick look at that so
it does it once then when it gets to the
end just jumps back to the beginning
does it again and then finally a third
time and then when it reaches the end of
the third time because of this animation
film mode set to both it's staying at
the end so this is all fine but it looks
a little unnatural kind of scooting to
the back each time so what would be
better is if it started from off the
screen beyond the edge of the screen
here and it went off the screen this way
so it looked like he was just cycling
around it so what we can do is set a
beginning point of minus 100 pixels for
the translate X and that's going to
bring it back 100 pixels and that will
set it to minus 200 make sure it's all
off and then let's set this to be about
1000 so it goes off the screen this way
as well so if we save this now we're
going to see it go all the way to the
end and then it will jump back to the
beginning off the screen and carry on
through so now it just looks like
cycling over and over which is pretty
cool but then when it gets to the third
side is just staying off screen is
adding off and you don't want to go
around any more but we want to make him
into a Duracell Mario we wanted to keep
on going round over and over and over
until the end of time
I so instead of putting a number here
what we could do is put a keyword and
that keyword is infinite and that is
just going to mean the animation keeps
cycling around over and over and over it
never stops
so if we put that there and then save
this then you're going to notice this
dude is just going to keep on going and
going and going and he's never going to
run out of petrol it's just going to
keep cycling around so that's pretty
cool so that's how we can repeat
animations and it's especially useful
for situations like this where you just
want them to go off the page and then
back on the page and kind of just cycle
through some kind of animation in the
background all right so if you have any
questions whatsoever obviously feel free
to post those down below otherwise guys
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
