fourth nodejs tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk about the global
object ok then guys when we write
JavaScript in a browser the global
object is the window right the window
object and we could access properties
and methods on that window object such
as alert scroll or set timeout etc now
when we write JavaScript in node the
global object is no longer the window
object because we're not in a browser
anymore the global object in node is an
object called global but much like the
window object it gives us access to some
methods we can use straight out of the
box in ljs so I'm on the node.js
documentation right here and I'm looking
at the global object which lists all of
these methods we can use on it so we can
see things like set interval and set
timeout and console which were also
available on the window object in the
browser and they're also available on
the global object in nodejs plus some
other stuff as well so let's go ahead
into Adam and try a few of these out so
I've still got this app.js file that we
made a couple of tutorials back but I've
deleted the contents of it and here in
the terminal I'm in the node.js playlist
directory so I'm going to show you first
of all something we saw a couple of
tutorials back which is available to us
on this global object and that is
console dot log so we can log things to
the terminal down here using console dot
log in node so I could just write any
message I want here save this and then
run the application in node by saying
node up and then that's going to log
this message to the console so we can
still use that in node now some of the
other things we can use also available
on the window object are set timeout so
let's try that
we'll say set timeout and in this we're
going to fire function and this function
is going to fire
3,000 milliseconds and inside this
function I'm just going to say
console.log and then put three seconds
half past so when we run this file in
node set timeout is going to fire this
function after 3,000 milliseconds which
is three seconds and then it's going to
log this message to the terminal down
here so let's go ahead and type in node
app press ENTER and we still get that
hey ninjas because I'm not saved this
file okay I've done that now now let's
try it again
node up and this time we wait three
seconds and then it's going to log three
seconds have passed to this terminal
down here okay so we also have set
interval available tools on the global
object again much like on the window
object and this time what I'm going to
do is change this to 2,000 milliseconds
and I'm going to pop here in fact what
I'll do is I'll create a variable up
here and I'm going to call this time and
I'll set it equal to zero okay and then
every time this function is called
because we're going to set this to set
interval not set timeout so every time
this function is called after 2,000
milliseconds what we're going to do is
add two to this time variable so we'll
say time plus equals two okay and then
we're going to log here time to the
console or to the terminal Dampier plus
this string so every time it's going to
update by two and it's going to tell us
how many seconds have passed in total so
let's save this now and run it down here
by saying node up and every two seconds
we're going to see a message logged to
the console and it's updating the time
each time around okay you'll notice that
node is still running this file it's
caught in some kind of loop if you like
and it's never going to end unless we
tell it to end so the way we end a
process down here in a terminal is just
by hitting ctrl + C and
not stopped it okay okay so we can also
use clay interval and to do that we'll
set this interval equal to a variable
and we'll call it timer we'll set it
equal to that and then what will be down
here is a simple if check to say if the
time is over five seconds then what
we're going to do is clear the interval
and the interval is this thing right
here the timer so let's pop that in
there save that and let's try this node
app and again we're going to wait two
seconds print out those messages to the
terminal then after it reaches the six
second one because it's over five
seconds right here it's going to clear
that interval okay so we've seen all
these things before on the window object
I just wanted to show you that they are
also available on the global object in
node so we can use these anywhere within
our node application a couple of other
things I want to show you which are
really cool and helpful
the Durr name and file name so node can
tell us where we are in a particular
directory or what fire we are in and we
can do that by say something like this
console log and then we say underscore
underscore good name and this is also on
the global object so we can use this
wherever in our new application so if I
save that now and run it node app it's
going to tell me the directory that I am
in and it's the nodejs playlist and
that's the directory that this file is
in you can see it sits in the no jets
playlist direction and if I copy that
paste it down here and change this to
file name instead and press save we're
going to run this again node up and this
time it gives me the full file as well
as the directory you can see so there
are two really cool utilities that we
can use again anywhere in no js' or
anywhere in our application in node.js
because they sit on the global object so
what I'm going to do is leave
the link to that documentation page to
the global object so you can go and have
a look through that because there are a
couple more things you might want to
look at and we're going to be covering
more things on the global object in
future tutorials such as require and
exports but for now I think what we've
covered we'll do to get us started so
any questions feel free to leave those
down below otherwise guys and bless you
in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
