different types defined for our graph we
have the book type and the author type
so now we have those two different types
I think it's time we can start to
introduce type relations so what do I
mean by that well every book has an
author right and every author has a
collection of books so we want to
translate that idea into our graph QL
schema so that when a user queries a
book from the front end and wants to
know the author of that book we can send
back the author of that book as well
because right now graph QL has no idea
which book belongs to which author so
there's a few different steps we need to
take to let graticule know that each
book has a specific author so the first
thing we need to do is go out to our
books right here the actual data and add
in an author ID for each one of them and
that author ID is going to correspond to
whichever ID down here of the author of
that particular book so for example if I
do name if the wind and put in an author
ID property like so and because Patrick
Rothfuss wrote this the author ID is
going to be the ID of this alter which
is one ok likewise this one here the
final Empire is going to have an author
ID set to 2 or rather yep to the final
Empire that was Brandon Sanderson and
then fighting like this one
the longer which was terry pratchet will
give an author ID of 3 cool all right
then so now the actual data has an
author ID to associate each book with an
author right but when you use a queries
in autumn we don't really want to send
back just the author ID that would be a
bit useless to the end user they don't
want to know a random ID of a particular
author instead what we want to do is
send back the author associated with
that book right we're just going to use
this author ID in the backend when we're
trying to query that data when we're
trying to retrieve it and send it
so we said that each book is going to
have an author and we're defining our
book fields right here the these are the
fields that we're sending back to the
user right when they request them an ID
a name and a genre so likewise if they
request an author we want to send that
back to them it makes sense right so
then let's do a little comma here and
add on the author property inside the
fields and this is going to be an object
and inside the object we first need to
say what type of date is this much like
we define the type here in these objects
we're going to define a type right here
but what type is it well it's an author
type we've already defined that type so
let's copy it and paste it right there
all right the next property we need to
do is the resolve function so we already
know that the resolve function is
responsible for going out and grabbing
data when we use it down here in our
root queries for example when someone
requests a book or an author the resolve
function is responsible for looking at
the actual data and returning what is
needed right then graph QL takes that
data and sends back to the user the
exact properties that they wanted from
that data such as the name of the book
and the genre so that's what the resolve
function does and right here it does
exactly the same thing if a user
requests the author inside a request for
the bulk then what we're going to do is
use this resolve function inside the
author to tell graph QL which author
corresponds to this book makes sense so
we know that the resolve function takes
in two parameters parent and also arcs
now inside this resolve function how are
we going to go out and get the author
associated with whatever book was
requested well imagine we made a request
that looks something like this we have
the book requiring right here and we say
that we want the book with an ID of two
and we want the name and genre
properties as well as the author
property we're requesting this we're
nesting this request inside the book
request and from the author we
the name well what we're doing is we're
sending this initial Rick weary for the
book along right and down here where we
deal with that requiring we're getting
all of the data right here where we say
underscore dots are find we're finding
that particular book right so in graph
QL now we have that data we have that
book object including the author ID now
of that book because we just define an
author ID property on the books now this
is where the first parameter parent
comes into play here because when we
have nested data we already have the
parent data the book we just found that
the user requested and we have that data
right here in the parent object that's
passed through to the resolve function
so on that parent object we have all
these different properties right and so
what we can do is look at this and say
okay well now from the parent object I
can see the author ID and I can use the
author ID therefore to go out and find
that particular author based on the ID
property of the author so let's do that
inside this result function first of all
what I'll do
just to show you is consult up log the
actual parents and we'll see that log to
the console in a minute when we test
this out then what we'll do is we'll
return and then we're going to use
underscore again dot find then inside
this we want to look in the authors
array so we're passing the authors as
the first parameter and what we want to
do is find the author whose ID property
matches parent which is the book we've
queried dot author ID all right so now
what we're doing is looking through the
authors array for that author who has an
ID equal to the parents ID so the ID of
the book we initially requested right
the author ID of that book rather so
let's save that num and what I'm going
to do is just go over to the front-end
using graphical so if I just cut this
for now and refresh then we'll get rid
of this stuff over here as well so we
don't get an error okay now we'll paste
that regress request in here
and what we're doing is saying okay we
want the book with an ID of two that's
the root query we want the name and the
genre of that book but now we're also
asking for the author and the name of
the author so if I press play now then
we're gonna see that author field
returned to us that is freaking awesome
right so what graph QL is doing behind
the scenes is using that resolve
function over here if I will put up the
code again using this resolve function
to take the parent the book we requested
and then find the author based on that
parent and then we're just sending back
the name of the author because that's
all we asked for but if we wanted to we
could send all the stuff back about the
author if we requested it such as the
age over here and even the ID if we
wanted so press play and now we get
those three properties back as well all
right so that's how we can deal with
nested and related data in graph QL and
I said we take a look at the console
which we will do we logged out the pair
and each time around when we made a
request and we can see the parent is
equal to the initial book that we
requested all right so we can see that
author ID right here which is what we're
using on that pair and object that's
passed through to the resolved function
to query it bring it back graph QL does
its thing and sends back to the
front-end which ever data properties
we've requested all right cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
