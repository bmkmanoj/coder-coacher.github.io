third pint in a three tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about our
first data type numbers okay and so I'm
in Commander at the minute you can use
whichever command line till you want
hopefully its commander if you're on
Windows and I'm going to enter the
Python shell by saying python then enter
so now we can start typing python code
but before we do that i want to explain
one thing everything in python is
considered an object and objects have
attributes and functions so let's just
step away from coding altogether and
think about this
imagine a real life object a car for
example it has attributes the size the
color the speed these things all
describe the car there the cars
attributes
it also has functions it can drive great
accelerate reverse etc so these are the
functions of the car so every object has
attributes and functions it's the same
in Python everything in Python is an
object and every object has attributes
and functions and when we talk about
these functions in respect to these
objects with all the methods so every
object has attributes and methods which
are just functions of that object so
we're going to look at different types
of objects in this series list numbers
dictionary strings all that kind of good
stuff and they're all going to have
different attributes and methods
associated with them so we'll look at a
few examples of each in each case okay
so we're going to look at numbers in
this tutorial and in cleiton there's two
types of numbers introduced and floats
so integers are whole numbers since I 1
3 5 7 9 etc and floating point numbers
or floats are any number with a decimal
point in them so 3.14 2 or 1.5 so in
Python how can we find out the type of
an object well we can use a built-in
method which is a function remember
called type so we just say type which is
the function name then to invoke to
start that function or method we use the
parentheses all right now inside these
parentheses we pass an argument and an
argument is just something we pass into
a method so yeah
regular partying is going to be an
object and in this case it's going to be
five remember everything in Tison is an
object and it's going to tell us the
type of this object and we can see it's
an integer it says class int okay
likewise we can say type and then
passing a decimal here 3.14 to that is a
float all right so we've got these two
different types of numbers that we can
play with so what can we do with these
numbers right we're gonna do some basic
math we could say 5 plus 5 plus 10 5
minus 5 5 0 rather 5 times 5 that's 25
and then 5 divided by 5 that's 1 but
notice this we've got one point 0 is
returning a float not a whole number not
an integer why is it doing that well
this is just one of the quirks of Python
3 this is what it does it returns us an
integer when we perform any kind of
division so for the other operators plus
subtract multiply if we're using
integers to begin with we're always
going to get back an integer but whether
you division were always going to get
back a float that's just a way of Python
3 so just watch out for that if you want
to return an integer when you do
division you can do the integer version
of this which is 5 and double forward
slash 5 which is going to return 1 as an
integer okay so this right here this
double forward slash is how we perform
an integer division alright and so what
else can we do with numbers well we can
use the power of we can say 5 to the
power of 5 so that's just double
asterisks that returns 3 1 2 5 cool we
can also work out the modulus and the
modulus is kind of like the remainder of
a division so if I say what is 10
divided by 3 in my primary school or
something like that before we started
doing decimals we'd say well that's 3
remainder 1 right the modulus is the
remainder so how do we work out the
modulus we can say 10% which is the
operator for modulus then 3 what we're
dividing by this is going to give us the
modulus the remainder which is 1 all
right cool so I just want to talk about
one more thing we can do with these
different operators and that is the
order of operation so say for example
we've got this equation 5 plus 5
and then times it by three what is that
going to equal well it's going to equal
to 20 and that's because first of all we
do this operation five times three and
then we do this operation plus five so
that's 15 plus five which is twenty so
why do we do it in this order well it's
because this operated as a high stacking
order if you like within the addition so
what's the stacking order well you might
have n something like this big bus in
school
so this governs the order so first we do
anything in brackets which is the B is
indices which is anything ^ so that
comes next then division then
multiplication then addition then
subtraction okay so in this equation we
don't have any of the first three but we
have this one multiplication so we do
that first then we do the addition all
right so if we wanted to do the addition
first in this case we just have to put
it in brackets because big mass B is
first B's are brackets five plus five
times by three okay I understand this is
probably basic math but I wanted to
throw it out there just in case it was
confusing you in any way shape or form
cool so we can also store these numbers
in variables so I could say something
like this age is equal to I don't know
25 and now this variable age is going to
store the value of 25 so if I call it at
any point when they get returned 25 we
can add to a to could say age plus 5 and
we get 30 but this does not alter the
value of age it just outputs the value
of that equation so if I type age again
it's still 25 so how do we update the
value of 8 what we have to reassign it
we have to say age equals something and
it's going to equal age plus 5 so
currently age is 25 so we're taking 25
plus 5 which is 13 then we're assigning
that to age again so now if I call 8
it's going to be 30 now there's a
shorter way of doing this a shorthand
method and that is by saying age plus
equals something or Allah so I could say
age plus equals 5 that is going to take
age and 5 to it and reassign it to age
okay so now eight should be 35 cool we
can do the same with other other
operators as well so age- equals five
that's going to take five buck off it so
it should be 30 we can also say age
divided equally to so it's going to
divide age by two and reassign it to age
which should be 15 so let's check it
yeah I remember division gives us a
floating-point number which is when we
have point zero at the end cool
so these are other kind of different
things we can do with numbers so I want
to do just a simple example where we
store a few in a few variables into a
simple formula
nothing taxing just so we get used to
working with variables and numbers so
let's work out how much I can say for
month I'll say my wages are include to
whatever 1000 you know pounds are does
and then we'll say bills equal to
hundred a month rent is equal to 500 a
month and we'll say food is equal to no
200 a month
right so I've got wages which are my
incomings main cup and then these three
things which are are my outgoing so I
want to work out how much per month I
could save so we have access to one of
these different variables now and
they've all got a different number
storing them so I could kind of
formulate some kind of formula from them
so I can say savings is equal to so this
is a new variable and created and it's
equal to wages - bills
- rents - food cool so now if I type
savings we should get 100 so now we
create a formula out of these different
variables and we've got 100 bucks so we
can do these kind of things but with
more complex examples which we're going
to see throughout the remainder of this
course so there is our there's your
introduction to numbers in the next
tutorial we're going to take a log add
strings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
