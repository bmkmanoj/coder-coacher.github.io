your very first WebSocket tutorial
alright so what our WebSockets well
basically they're a way to communicate
between a client the browser and a
server and this communication is
bi-directional and that basically means
that data can flow in both ways so we
can flow from the client to the server
and also from the server to the client
now because these WebSockets are always
open that allows for real-time data flow
in our application so this is all really
cool but what does it mean in a real
world example well I want you to imagine
we have this kind of chat application
which is hosted on this server right
here so all these different clients are
under here and different people around
the world in their browser and they all
go to whatever com to request this chat
application in their browser so now that
all viewing it in that browser now so
one person John over here you type
something into this chat and click send
then that message is going to
instantaneously be updated in all of
these different clients around the world
that are viewing that chat as well
that's our chats work right so this is
WebSockets in action but what's going on
well when we first request the chat
application ok in the browser we get
that chat application bug but also at
the same time what we're doing is we're
opening up this WebSocket between the
client and the server so now we have all
of these different clients all of these
different different browsers around the
world which all have their own WebSocket
connection to the server right and that
means that data can flow back and forth
between it in real time because these
are always open these WebSockets so now
when John actually creates a message in
click send
what we're doing is sending that message
down this WebSocket to the server the
server receives it and then says hey
this is a chat message and what to do
with that I'm going to send it down all
these other web sockets which connecting
to these clients down here to each
individual clients so that they can see
that updating message in their chat ok
so the message is going to send up the
WebSocket to the server then the server
sends it down each individual web socket
to all the remaining clients and that's
why they see
this message okay instantaneously so I
want you to take note here this data
transfer is occurring in real time and
we're not using any kind of Ajax request
from each of these different clients to
request any new data from the server
it's all happening without the client
having to make any additional requests
at all so this stuff is really cool and
there's tons of different uses for
WebSockets not just chat rooms and they
include making multiply multiplayer
browser games collaborative code editing
software some kind of live text for
sports on news websites online drawing
canvases real time to do apps etc etc
there's tons of different uses for
WebSockets now in this tutorial we are
going to make a simple chat application
that looks something like this so we
have it open in two different browsers
here we're connecting to the same server
in both instances and I want you to
imagine that instead of these two
browsers on my computer this is two
different computers in two different
parts of the world because it works
exactly the same way so the both
connecting to this server and the
getting this chat application back in
their window which is some kind of
muriel chat now if you've watched enough
of my videos you know I'm a fan of Mario
this is a recurring theme but anyway in
this chat window we have an input for a
handle so that's your name so I'll just
say Luigi and I'm doing the other one as
work a peach okay and we also have an
input for the message so I can type a
chat here so I'll say hey peach notice
this when I'm typing here and getting
this Luigi is typing a message over in
the other client so this is WebSockets
in action pretty cool right
and also when I click send then we get
the updated message right here to say
Luigi has said hey peach and also over
here so we're using WebSockets to send
that data to the server the server then
sends it down to this client and shows
it in real time and we've not made any
kind of requests from this client to the
server at all it's just open and
listening through this WebSocket and
receiving data likewise if I type some
kind of message in this one yellow eg
then we also see this peach is typing a
message over here and click send same
happens we get the message over here
using WebSockets as well as over here
instantaneously really quick in real
time okay so that's what we're going
great in this set of tutorials now I
want to show you a couple of tools I am
going to be used
the first one is Adam a text editor
completely free and completely cool so
you can download that at ndu IO also I'm
going to be using CMD or Commander don't
know how to pronounce it for my
command-line tool again that is your
really free sorry that is really cool
and it's free as well and now before you
start this series you argued any nodejs
installed as well so you can head to
know Joe Gorga to download that just
click on this button right here and
that's going to download it for you walk
through the installation steps and then
to check whether you have node installed
on your computer just open your command
line tool this is commanded which I
showed you a minute ago and just had
again no - V if you've got it installed
it's going to throw about the version
number right there otherwise you want
okay so make sure you have node install
and finally as always I'm going to
provide you with all of the course files
for this series they can be found on my
github repository right here called
WebSockets playlet I'm going to leave
this link down below as well each lesson
corresponds to a different branch so
just select the lesson that you want and
you're going to get the code for that
okay and you can download it all here so
there is your introduction to WebSockets
really hope you enjoyed the rest of this
playlist and please guys if you do like
these videos please please please
remember to hit the like button maybe
you can share them if you're feeling
generous I'm going to see you in the
very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
