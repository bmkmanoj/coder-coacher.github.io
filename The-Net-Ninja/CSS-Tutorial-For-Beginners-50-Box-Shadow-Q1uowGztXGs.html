for beginners lesson 50 and in this
video we're gonna take a look at the box
shadow property Wow alright they swag
back here in the code and I've still got
all of these styles from last time where
we made a button with a cool gradient
and we're gonna add a box shadow onto
that button now what is a box shadow
well in simple terms it gives an element
a shadow so basically what that does is
give it some depth that appears as
though it's coming away from the page
and we can control that shadow to have
different kind of effects now how do we
do this well the first thing we need to
do is come to the element rule here a
button this is what we're styling and we
say we want a box - shadow property and
then we pass various values into this
property now the first two values we
pass through the horizontal and the
vertical position values this is how far
from the element that you want the box
shadow to appear now because this is
just a small button I'm just gonna say
just two pixels for the horizontal and
vertical position okay so that's going
to position it to pixels to the right of
the button and two pixels below the
button we can use - values if we want to
go left and upwards okay but
automatically plus values is going to go
to the right and the bottom now the
third value that we pass through is the
blur radius and the blur radius is
essentially saying how blurry we want
the the Box shadow to be now a low value
is going to be not blurry and a high
value is gonna be very blurry I'm just
gonna say four pixels for this so I'm a
little bit blurry but not much and the
next value we pass through is what's
called the spread and the spread is
essentially saying over what distance do
you want that to be blurred out do you
want it to be blurred out over a large
distance if so how value do you want it
to be spread over a very small distance
if so put a low value and I'm just going
to put two pixels for that as well
because I want a quite a low value now
then the last property that obvious
value that I'm going to supply for this
property is going to be the color of the
drop shadow the Box shadow and we can do
this for your hex code
or RGB or HSL I'm gonna use RGB because
I'm gonna pass through an alpha Channel
RGB a so that I can give it an opacity
as well because I think most shadows are
a little bit transparent so I'm gonna
give it a deep gray color just gonna say
40 comma 40 40 that's gonna be a deep
gray then give it an alpha value of 9.6
that's going to make it a little bit
see-through as well now this is a fairly
new property of CSS
I used to use vendor prefixes for this
some people still do
I've now stopped using those vendor
prefixes because pretty much all of the
browser's now supports it out of the box
so I'm going to save this anyway and I'm
going to view it in a browser so this is
what we have last time is button here
with the hover effect I'm going to
refresh the page and now you can see
this little blurry box shadow here and
that's giving it some depth it's
bringing it away from the page okay so
that's what box shadows are all about
and there's many different things you
can do with them much like the gradient
now much like the gradient properties I
like to come to a generator sometimes if
there's something I want to play around
with it I don't want to keep putting the
values in then save it and refresh you
know I just want to see a preview here
change the values like this and have it
generate the code for me I can do that
at CSS Matic Calm forward slash box
shadow so this is a little nifty say
side that you can use to generate that
code for you that still does put in the
vendor prefixes here you can see the
WebKit one and the Motsinger bomb like I
say I don't use those anymore but feel
free to keep them in if you like so
that's about it for the box shadow if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to comment right down below and
I'll answer all of those otherwise if
