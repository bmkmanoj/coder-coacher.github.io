your twelfth booster floor tutorial and
in this video we're gonna talk about
tool tips now I'm guessing you all know
what a tool tip is but just in case you
don't this is what it looks like hover
over an element and today we get a
little bubble popping up with more
information so that is what we're going
to be building with bootstrap for in
this tutorial and this time around it's
super easy and it uses its header so
we're going to need to include this
tether library right here before we load
in our bootstrap JavaScript right here
okay and jQuery as well because it's
going to rely on these two things so
what we're going to do first of all is
enable the use of tooltips on this page
so the way we do that is by adding in
another script tag down here I'm popping
in some jQuery so I'm going to paste
this in then I'll explain it so all
we've got is a document load function
which is going to fire when the document
loads and then we're targeting any
element with a data toggle as to be
equal to tilt it right then we're using
the tooltip method on though so it
enables those fill tips on our page
that's the only JavaScript we need to do
boo stuff all handles all the rest for
us so super simple the next thing we
need to do is decide where on our page
we want this tool tip to go okay so I
think what I'm going to do is do it
somewhere right up here so if we take a
look at our website so far and this a
little bit where it's describing the net
ninja I want to add a little tooltip on
some of the text so let's do it
around say this to this thing right here
so the first thing we want to do is
surround that with a tag I'm going to
use a span tag copy that and put it
right at the end over there then we need
to add some attributes to this so the
first attribute we want to add is that
data
- toggle attribute data - toggle set it
equal to tooltip so then this jQuery
down here you're going to find it
because it's looking for all elements
with this date - several attribute calls
the tooltip and it's going to use the
tool tip on it all right so it's going
to turn this thing right here now into a
tooltip
what we actually need some text to put
inside that little bubble that tooltip
that pops up how do you do that dead
simple we just add a title attribute
right here and then replace whatever we
want to display in a bubble in this
thing so I'm just missing this is a
tooltip and leave it at that so if I
save it now check it out in a browser
let me just refresh and if I hover over
those words somewhere here now I get
that tooltip let me just zoom in so you
can see that so hover over these words
we get a tooltip pretty cool right but
we don't necessarily know that this is a
tool to just by looking at it it's no
different from the rest of the text
right here so let's just add a class to
this thing so it stands out a little bit
so we'll say class equals and then tip -
info we've seen these kind of things
before this is that blue color that in
for sync all right
so save that and view in a browser now
and this time we can see that it's blue
and it looks a little different so you
might think well okay I'll hover over
this then we get more information about
it so you might see these things are
maybe definitions or words that mean
absolutely nothing to you such as
huffing right there or even links or
other things like next to forms where
you get a little question marks etc okay
so that is how we create a tooltip and
by the way this is using Java Script
which is cool
but I have done a tutorial on a CSS only
tooltip so if you want to much lighter
version of this then check out that I'll
leave the link to that video down below
I want to show you one more thing
actually before I finish up here and
that is going to this thing right here
and adding a data - a placement
attribute onto it so right now if we
take a look at this this is coming up at
the top but what if I want to display
this at the bottom for example well I
can do that by setting this equal to a
bottom saving it and checking it out in
a bloater this time it goes to the
bottom so we can do this with top left
right and bottom by default it goes to
the top alright so there we go that is
how we create a tooltip with
bootstrap so anyway that's about it for
this series like I said it was meant to
be a miniseries offering you a glimpse
of what's available to in boots got fall
and the differences and you can learn
more about what's on offer over on the
bootstrap blog or Doc's the links to
those are going to be down below in the
description so yeah I hope this has
offered you a bit of guidance on your
magical bootstrap journey and I will
actually be doing a bonus lesson at some
point in the future about some of the
different select properties' bootstrap 4
has to offer us as well but anyway until
next time keep on air bootstrapping I
guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
