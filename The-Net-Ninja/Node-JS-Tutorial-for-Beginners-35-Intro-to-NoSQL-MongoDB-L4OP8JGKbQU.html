nodejs tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about no SQL databases and
MongoDB alright so I just wanted to
briefly break from our to do app just to
talk about no SQL databases and in
particular MongoDB because that's what
we're going to use in our to do up so
what is NoSQL database well it's just an
alternative to an SQL database so
instead of this notion of tables with
rows and columns in SQL databases
instead we're going to adopt this idea
of storing documents or if you like
Jason objects which is really cool
because Jason works really well with
JavaScript and therefore also no js' so
in our example when we've created a
to-do up the kind of jason that we can
store is something like this just a
series of objects with our to-do items
and then we can easily access this data
manipulate it and send it back using
MongoDB ok so you can find out more
about MongoDB at MongoDB com and you can
also download a copy to your computer
and run a local version of it as well
however in this tutorial I'm not going
to do that instead I'm going to use a
hosted version which is provided by M
lab so you can find this website at M
lab comm and I'll also leave that link
down below as well so you can see that
using M lab we can create a database
which is stored on the cloud then we can
connect to that database in our code and
we can interact with it so we can add
items delete items update them so it's
really easy to get started with MongoDB
using M lab so what you want to do is
head to this website and then sign up
for a free account I've already done
that so I'm just going to hit a login
and log into my account so I've already
gone ahead and created a database for
you to see and now don't worry I'm going
to walk you through the steps of
creating one from scratch in the next
tutorial when we start to create a
database for our application I just
wanted to show you in this tutorial what
it looks like so I'm going to click on
that and it's going to show me
different collections in this database
so right here says collections and you
can see I've got a collection call to
dues and there's four documents inside
this so let's have a look what's inside
it and there we go so there's four
documents and each one is basically just
a JSON object with this item in it and
you can see each item is just a to-do
item okay pretty cool so we can use em
lab to store our JSON objects and then
we can interact with those JSON objects
in no thas I'm speaking of interacting
with the database to do that in node I'm
going to be using a package called
Mongoose so you can find that on the NPM
registry just type in Mongoose here and
it's going to come a write up and
Mongoose is really good it provides us
with a really clean way of communicating
back and forth with our Mongo database
okay so we're going to be using this and
installing it in the very next tutorial
so there we go that is what no SQL
databases and MongoDB is all about in
the next tutorial
we're going to carry on without to do up
install Mongoose and create a database
to connect with any questions so far
leave those down below otherwise I'll
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
