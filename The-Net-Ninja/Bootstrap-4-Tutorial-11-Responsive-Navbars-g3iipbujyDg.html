your 11th bootstrap 4 tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about and
navbars
okay then so a little boost up would it
be bootstrap if it didn't convict with a
mouse bar component so let's take a look
at how we can create one way that boots
got fall so the first thing we're going
to need to do is create some kind of
surrounding wrapper for the navbar this
can be a give if you want but I'm going
to prefer to use another element because
it's just more semantic so we're we're
going to put this nav is going to be
wrapped at a top up here so I want to
come above the Jumbotron let's scroll
right to the top just after the opening
body tag let's create this at nav
element so now there we go
now this nav element is going to have
any few classes so I'm just going to
chop through these first of all then
we're going to add them in so the first
one is going to be a class of nav bar
this is the main nav bar class that
bootstrap uses to give us the nav bar
style then it's going to have a
cluttered NASCAR - huggable - SM this
tells bootstrap that we're going to want
the nav bar to be a drop-down toggle now
with a toggle button from small screen
sizes and down then we're going to give
it a class of BG - info and that's where
it gets that background color like this
because this is BG - info background
color as well we want it to be the same
blue so that's going to tell bootstrap
to sort that out for us then we're going
to use a class of nav bar inverse to
just change the color of the links so
let's add those in so first of all I
said it was navbar for the overall
styles then it's going to be navbar -
toggle double - SM she says that it's
tolerable for small screens and down
then it's going to be BT enfold
so that means that it's going to get
that blue color and then finally nav bar
inverse and I'll tell you what I'm going
to just delete that one so you can see
the difference first of all and we'll
add it in later
okay so there's our nav saucing now we
need to put some things inside it so
this now if we save it you're probably
not going to see it on the screen but
it's going to stretch all the way across
from left to right because it's not
inside a container however we want the
links and
with inside the navbar to be within this
central column or right here so what do
we need to do we need to add in a
container within this nuf make sense so
let's look please with eight o'clock
equal to container then everything is
going to go inside this class so the
first thing I'm going to do is add in a
button and this is going to act as some
kind of toggle button for small screen
sizes so that it shows and hide the
content right so let's create a button
and then again this needs to have a
class this time it's going to be navbar
- table okay and then we're going to
also have to say data - toggle and
that's going to be equal to collapse
this basically tells bootstrap the
behavior we want this button to take on
it's going to open and close a
collapsible element then we're going to
give this a target what do we want to
open and close what do we want to
collapse
so we'll say data item target I'm going
to set this equal to an ID called nav
bar router made snaps okay so we're not
creating the ID yet but when we do
that's what this button is going to
control so let's close that now and then
inside what we're going to use is a span
class of nav bar oops
equals nav bar - toggler - icon so this
is a bootstrap class which is going to
give us a little icon which looks like a
bergen have three lines on top of each
other right so we're going to see that
in action later on but let's now create
the links or the container and that this
is going to control so we'll say this
now this is have a class of collapse
this is the thing that's going to
collapse right and also navbar -
collapse to associate it with a navbar
so it's not just a collapsible element
anywhere in a page it's a collapsible
Natha right also we need to give it
listing here this ID means math because
that is what this button is going to
that's right so I D of course Main Ave
cool so now this button is going to be
controlling the collapse of this and the
opening of this just on small screens
okay because you've said SM right there
small screens okay cool so now we need
to create the actual links if you like
and to do that we're going to have a
surrounding plus and then the links in
Sagat okay so we'll say deep plus equals
so then this needs a class of nav bar -
nav and that will do so this is the nav
within the nav bar a nice way to
remember it okay and then in here we're
just going to post some links now I'm
just going to copy and paste these in so
you watch me type them all out so I'll
paste them here these are all I'm going
to get a whole page by the way I think
it's lesson 11 brunch so you can just go
ahead and download this if you want so
you'll know if each one of these anchor
tags has a class of nav - item first of
all this is telling bootstrap that this
is an item within the navigation just a
standard class this is used to star them
then it's got a class of nav link as
well again just saying that this is a
link within the navigation this active
class right here is saying that this is
the active all this is where we are so
this is similar to when we created a nav
and we said one of them was active with
the blue pill around it similar kind of
thing as this thing right here this is
the active one this is where we out the
minute okay so we've drawn each one of
those we've all got H ref of just a
pound symbol of the minute but you would
replace this if you have different page
URLs with URLs that you want this link
to go to so we've got home about
training and concept all going
absolutely nowhere cool so this is our
navbar that's all there is to it so ever
save this now and check this out in a
browser we're going to see these links
right here and remember I took off that
inverse class that navbar inverse class
because of what to show you this before
if I place it back in here now navbar -
inverse
save this we're going to see the colors
of this change to white and gray which I
think kind of looks better with this
blue background alright cool so there's
our navigation looks fine for desktop
and if we shrink it now down to a mobile
size you're going to notice this thing
right here this icon is this class right
here this spun right and the whole thing
is this button this element right here
that we're saying is going to control
the toggle or the collapse of this thing
right here so if we click on this button
now then we're going to see that thing
open up and show all of those links and
then if we click on it again it's going
to hide it and it's going to work for
small screen sizes and down and then we
get to medium to screen sizes and
upwards we're going to get these links
right here so there we go guys that is
how we create a simple navbar in
bootstrap there are tons more options we
can use in that bars we can add search
bars in them buttons if you like loads
of different things so what I advise you
to do is go to the bootstrap for Webster
documentation as always the link is down
below and then just go to it nav bar
right here not naps now so what we've
covered in the last tutorial navbar this
time they've got some different options
so you can read all about them here you
can add a brand of you like in the top
left forms like I said different things
and it's really simple to pick up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
