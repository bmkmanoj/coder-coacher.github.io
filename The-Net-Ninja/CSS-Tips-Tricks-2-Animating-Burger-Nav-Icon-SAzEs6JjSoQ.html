CSS tips and tricks tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna show you how to animate
a burger nav icon so unless you've been
living in the dark ages of web design
you're probably going to know what a
burger nav icon looks like something
like this so that when we click it a
little drop-down menu appears or
something like that
now sometimes it's nice to have a snazzy
little animation so that when you do
click this big enough icon it turns into
a cross tada
and then when you click that it turns
back to the big enough icon and that's
the opening and closing of the menu if
you like so that's what I'm going to
show you how to do in this tutorial and
I've uploaded all of the course files
onto this repo right here so I'll leave
the link to that down below or you want
to do is select this second branch right
hit there right here animating burg icon
and then go to clone or download and you
can download the zip file right there
with all the finished files included so
onto the code this consists of three
files we have our index file which is
dead simple I'll walk through that in a
second our script file which again is
seriously simple and walk through that
as well and then the Styles file and I'm
going to start this from scratch in a
minute so the index file it is just a
link to a style sheet which I'm going to
use in a minute right here a link to
jQuery because we're gonna use that in
this script and then a link to my script
as well which is this thing right here
that we're going to do in a second so
we're just linking to those things right
there then in the body tag we have this
div with an ID of burger container and
this burger container is a container for
all of this stuff right here then we
have a div with an ID of burger which is
the icon itself and it contains four
span sites and each span tag represents
one of these lines on here simple right
okay so onto the script it's just a
simple document ready event which then
listens for clicks on this burger
container remember that's the
surrounding element here so that when we
click on that a function is going to
fire which is going to grab that element
this burger container and it's going to
toggle a class of open so that when we
click it it gains the class of open
we click it again it removes the class
of open and that's how we're going to
control the different styles between the
two different states okay makes sense
so the Styles right here we're going to
start from scratch so I'm going to
delete all of these things right here
and save it and we're going to get a
blank canvas on the right so first
things first let's scale the body itself
we're just going to give it a background
of two to two which is a deep charcoal
gray and okay there we go
and by the way this Auto refresh is a
plug-in for atom you can just search for
item plugins live reload something like
that and install one and you'll get the
same thing and the next thing I want to
do is grab the containing element which
is this thing right here this burger
container so I'm going to copy that
and I'm going to paste that down here
it's an ID and then inside here I want
it to be a position of relative and then
we need a margin of 200 pixels from the
top and then auto left and right okay so
now that's going to sit somewhere here
we can't see it yet because it's not
going to height or width or anything but
if I was to say with 100 pixels height
50 pixels and background white then
you're gonna see this in the middle over
here alright so now we know where that
is let's grab those and get rid of those
too
we'll keep the width next I want the
icon itself so I'm going to grab this ID
I'm going to paste this dude in below
and I want to say cursor is gonna be
pointer and I'm also gonna say display
ass block now the reason I've done this
point is so that when you hover over it
you get that little hand and we know we
can click it so next thing we want to do
is start the spun tags within it these
things right here so again what I'm
gonna do is say burger and then span and
then I'm going to give each one a
background of EEE which is like a really
like great I'm gonna display each one as
block I'm gonna give each one a width of
about 100 pixels
I'm gonna give each one a height at 14
pixel so each one of these is gonna be a
thin strip and exaggerating the
dimensions of this so that you can see
on the screen in reality you might do
them a little bit smaller anyway we're
gonna give each one a margin bottom of
10 pixels and that's so they don't talk
to each other from top to bottom and
we're going to give them a position of
relative and we're doing that so that we
can control the top position or right
here and it's gonna be zero for now but
when we come to animate this a little
bit we're going to change this top
position that's why we've added these
two rules right now also going to add in
some transition effects so we're going
to say transition all these in out and
then each one is going to take not 0.4
seconds okay so this is the Bezier
function this controls how its animating
and ease in out basically means that it
kind of starts off slowly then goes fast
and then finishes slowly as well okay
and if you want to know more about
transitions I've got a series on CSS
animations it's all in there anyway
that's our spawn salty now so if we save
this we're going to see those four spans
right there so that is our burger nav in
its original state okay now what we want
to do is control it so that when we
click this and what I'll do is I'll just
show you if I inspect this element when
I click it you're gonna see this thing
right here you get a class of all
current and I'll just zoom in so that
you can see
so I'll click it and this thing right
here gets a class of open so we can
style it differently when it's open okay
so what we want to do is start these
things differently when it's open and
the reason we added this transition
effect is because the different CSS
properties that we're going to style for
when it's open they're going to
transition from one state to another
make sense okay cool so we want to style
each different span element right we
want these two here in the middle to
kind of scoop out the way we want the
bottom want and the top one to form
across so let's control these two first
of all we'll say burger container
and Dan don't open because this is when
it's open then span we're going to use a
pseudo class called enth child and
that's going to grab the second child
the second span tag if you like okay
then i want to copy this and i'm gonna
paste it right below because we want to
grab the third as well because we're
gonna control both of those right here
and inside here I want to say weight is
going to be zero so it's going to
transition from a width of 100 pixels to
zero pixels so we're going to say
opacity is zero so it's also going to
fade out as well and then we're going to
transform in fact we won't do the
transform we'll just let them slide to
the left so that's what's gonna happen
when these are open so I must save it
now this is gonna refresh and if I click
it you can see those two things they get
out the way they animate to the left so
now all we have to do is make these two
form across and the way we're gonna do
that is by grabbing the other two spans
in the stuck so I'm going to grab this
and I'm gonna paste it down below and
I'm gonna say 1 the first one and fall
for the last one and inside here we also
want to control the different properties
and this time what I want to do is
control the orientation or rather the
rotation of them okay so what I'm gonna
do is say transform rotate and it's
going to be 45 degrees like that okay
now if I click Save check out what
happens you go like that let's just
refresh click that and they're both
rotating in the same direction we don't
want that we want this butter want to
rotate that way and the top one we want
to rotate in the opposite way so we need
to use a minus here instead for the top
one so we can't combine these two things
together so I'm gonna have to grab that
one and do a separate one for this so
I'll paste it in and then I'm gonna copy
this dude and paste that in again down
here and I'm gonna change this now to
minus 45 degrees and this
and we're gonna get something like this
so the animating and the rotating in the
right direction now at least okay
let's refresh and you can see that
happening okay cool so what we need to
do now is bring this one down and bring
this one up so that they meet in the
middle and form a cross and that's where
this thing comes into action now we gave
this a position of relative and a top
property of zero to begin with so that
we can animate this to a different top
property in these two things right here
so what we're going to do is say we want
the first one to come down so that's
going to have a top of 36 pixels and
that means it's going to come down from
the top by 36 pixels and we want this
bottom one to go up so we're going to
say for the bottom one top minus 36
pixels okay makes sense because that's
going up so let's save it now and
refresh and if we click on it now we get
that across pretty cool right so there
we go guys that is how you create an
animating burg enough if you like the
