27th of UGS tutorial and in this video I
want us to talk about slots
okay so I've stripped out a lot of the
culture and previous tutorials and I've
just got this rib component right here
up top view with an empty template and
I've also imported another component
called form helper from the components
folder form helper dot view and that's
this thing right here don't worry about
the name of this file so now I'll
explain that later and this just has a
hate one in the template so nothing else
going on in this component but what we
are going to do is register that
component right here saying the name of
this component that we're going to use
in the tag is form - helper and it's
this thing right here we've just
imported okay so I just want to nest
this component form helper in this route
component now so form - helper and let's
just make sure that works if I view in a
browser we can see I am the form helper
which is in this form helper component
so it has successfully nested that okay
cool
so we've seen in previous tutorials that
we can pass data down to these child
components using props right we could
say something like V - bind and then the
title is equal to something that we
defined down here in the data right well
what if we wanted to pass something a
bit more complex such as a HTML template
so we want to have some kind of HTML
down to the child component and then
output that HTML in this child component
somewhere well we can do that not using
props although we could if we pass a
HTML string in here but probably not the
best idea we can pass down a hit to our
template using slots and this is pretty
similar to something known as
transclusion in angular so if you've
used that before then if you're going to
be pretty simple to understand but
anyway we can pass HTML down using slots
and the way we do that is twofold
first of all we define within these tags
within the component tags what HTML we
want to pass down so say for example we
want to pass down a very simple HTML
template with 882 same
I am the slots title and also a
paragraph tag will say I the power of
graph text for the slot okay whatever
and if we save this now do you think
that this is going to be output within
this component right here somewhere
well let's have a look in the browser no
it's not anywhere and that's because
we've not said where we want this slot
to appear within this component all
right so we've placed it within the
component right here where we've nested
it but we've not said within that
component where we want to output that
HTML and to do that we need to use the
slot tag so say for example we want to
output it underneath this h1 we can just
place a slot tag beneath that h1 save
that and then it's going to output
whatever we put here where this slot tag
is okay so let's view this now and we
can see it right there
so just to test let's place this above
the h1 as well make sure it works and
yet now it goes above the hey table cool
so what if we want to output say for
example this above the h1 but this below
the h1 how can we do that what we can do
it using two different slots so we could
have a slot above but also a slots below
now if we save this currently then both
of these things are just going to output
twice because UJS doesn't know which to
place in slot 1 and which to place in
slot 2 so it just places both of the
tags in both so we need a way to say to
view GS well I want the h2 here and we
want the paragraph text here and we can
do that by naming our slots so if I give
this slot a name and I can do that by
saying that the slot is equal to
whatever name I want to give it and
we'll call this the title and then I'll
come down here and give this one a name
as well I've seen slot is equal to text
then save that we can now come over here
and say ok we want the title slot there
and the text slot here and the way we do
that is by giving this an attribute
called name so the slot name is equal to
title in this instance
and the slot name over here is going to
be equal to the attack okay so let's
save that and see if it works okay and
if i refresh then you can see the slot
title goes at the top and the slot text
goes at the bottom cool so that is how
we have multiple slots okay so we can
output different content we place here
in different places in this tag right
here okay using different named slots
okay so if we want to star these slots
what can we do well we can just add
styles as normal down here so I could
say h1 and we'll give it a color of red
save that cool so we can add styles
right here now what if I want to add
some kind of method or dynamic data so
could I instead say for example of this
output some kind of dynamic title well
yeah I can do that but this time we
don't do it in this component on the
data right here we do it in the
component where we kind of initialized
this slot title okay so we can add the
title property right there and say I am
a dynamic slot to the title save that
and we can see update right there okay
now if this was to be defined on the
component which is nested where we
actually see the slots then let's see if
this works save it and now we're not
getting anything whatsoever so even
though this HTML is being passed down
into this component the dynamic data we
output must be defined in this component
right here okay where we use these kind
of template tags so let's place it up
there again and save it and again we get
it working okay so these are just some
simple examples and you might be
thinking well this is pointless
okay so why not just place this stuff
right here instead of between these two
tags why not just place it in here and
save yourself all the work of naming
slots
what we could do that but I'm going to
show you an example now where we can use
slots which is beneficial so imagine
this scenario we create a website with
many different forms on it and we want
to give the front-end developer a way to
easily create these forms based on an
existing template okay
so we want the front-end developer to be
able to specify some form fields a form
header maybe what happens when you click
on submit such as the form controls etc
but we want the general outline in the
structure of these forms to be the same
on each one of them okay well we could
use this idea of slots to do that so
this is all going to be called player as
we approach the end of this tutorial for
now what we're going to do is create
some kind of template for this form in
this component this form helper
component right so the idea is that a
developer would use this component then
add slots into it to pass their own data
into it and that's going to create a
form for them on a website so let's go
ahead and start padding out this form so
let's say we have h1 at the top of the
form which says please fill out our form
ok now this is going to be on the head
of every form page then we're going to
have a form tag and inside here we'll
have a few different sections so we'll
have a section for the form headers with
a div ID equals 4 - header and then
we'll have a section below that for the
form field source a div ID equals form
fields and then below this we'll have
another section which is going to be for
the form controls so say give id equals
form
- controls and then a bottom of that
will maybe have some useful links or
something like that so they give ID
equals youthful links you know things
like about OHS or something like that
anything to do with forms so we'll the
UL inside here to proof up
and if you just going to be a little
list of links so a live tag and a tag
where the H ref doesn't really matter
where theta records go in at the minute
she's just a dummy links or settle into
one I'm just going to copy this dude now
and paste it down below a few times okay
so now we've got this general kind of
structure for our form okay and
basically what we want to do now is be
able to pass in things like a custom
header some custom form fields a custom
form control anything like that into
this whole helper and tada we can do
that using slots okay so say for example
we could have a slot here we could have
a slot with a name equal to form -
header okay doesn't have to be the
service this ID just happens to be so
now we can inject content here from the
parent component and it's going to be
injected right here for the form header
so we can have a custom header in this
form we could do the same thing for this
so let's just copy that and paste it
down below and change this to form
fields we'll give another one for the
form controls and change this as well
for fun controls so now we have kind of
three editable regions on this component
on this form helper and we can pass into
these editable regions from the route
component okay so when a developer now
is creating a form we don't need to
start creating a new form from scratch
all the need to do is call the form
helper right yes and then pass into the
data the custom template that they want
to appear in the different sections of
this component so they could pass in if
they wanted to a form header some form
fields and some form controls okay and
the structure of the form is going to
remain the same in each case so let's
pass some stuffing so the first thing I
want to pass in is a slot for the form
header so I'll say depth and remember we
need to say slot
equals and then the name must match up
to this thing right here form header
because this is where it's going to go
so we'll copy that and paste it in there
and the form header is going to have
inside of it the h3 and it's going to
include all of this stuff so when the
slot goes in it's going to include
everything that's nested within this
slot as well so the h3 can be some kind
of titles and custom title so this the
title of the form and we can have a
paragraph underneath if we wanted to and
like information about the form and then
what we'll do is another slot now for
the form fields so we'll save give
slopped equals form fields oops and then
inside here we could pass in any number
of form fields such as inputs or text
areas that kind of thing I'm just going
to do a couple of imports and there's
going to be an import type of text and
this is going to be for the user name or
something like that so I said place
holder equals name and this is going to
be required okay and then what I'll do
is another one down below and this is
going to be for the password so I'll so
tight equals password and placeholder is
password and that's required as well
okay so now we have these two sections
these two different slots entering into
our form help component in these two
areas so now let's just do the form
controls and this is just going to be a
button we want to pass in a bottom with
a function attached to it so that when
user clicks on this button then
something happens when we submit the
form so we can add that in as well
whether it give
we'll do a gig right here with a slot
equal to form controls and then in fat
here we're just going to do a footing
and this is going to have a click event
attached to it or say V on click is
equal to and don't submit and then we'll
say submit okay so now we've passed all
of these different things into this form
helper we've not had to write out all
that form just the different editable
regions if you like and then this form
helper is going to take all of those
editable regions combine it together in
this form with the structure already
laid out any styles that we need to add
here as well and it's going to output
that for us just going to get rid of
this star right here and save it and
I'll save this one as well let's have a
look in the browser so far and now we
can see the form is made now it doesn't
look great at the minute but we could
also add some styles into this form
health component as well so that no
matter which form we create using this
form helper they're all gonna look the
same ok so we'll add these styles right
down here I'm just going to copy and
paste these from my github repository
and you can get them from lesson 27 the
link is down below so I'm just going to
paste these right in there to save it
and let's review this now cool so now
every time we make a form on our website
it would look something like this and
yet I know the form styles are pretty
crafty as well I just added some basic
ones here just to kind of cut it out a
little bit but the idea is we could have
our own custom styles in this form
helper and then every time we create a
new form this is all we need to do we
don't need to worry about styles we
don't need to worry about the structure
of creating the whole different form all
we need to do is worry about these
different slots these different sensible
regions we're passing in to the form
helper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
