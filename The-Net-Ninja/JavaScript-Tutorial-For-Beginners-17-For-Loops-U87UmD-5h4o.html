you're watching JavaScript for beginners
lesson 17 and in this video we're gonna
take a look at four loops Wow
all right in gang so in the last lesson
I introduced loops to you more
specifically this while loop right here
and in generic terms a loop is meant to
repeat certain parts of color for you so
that you don't have to keep on repeating
yourself in the code itself like down
here multiple times okay so a loop will
check a certain condition for you and
while that condition is true it will
keep on repeating the code for you so
that's the whole idea of loops now in
the last lesson we took a look at this
while loop and that did exactly that a
for it to work when you did these three
components we needed first of all this
variable here where we initialized a
number because it's this variable that
we're checking right here in the
condition okay now in terms of loops
this variable is commonly referred to as
the index variable and that's because it
goes up and up each time around so
that's the first thing we needed the
index variable the second thing we
needed was this condition right here
because wow this is true is the time
where we're going to repeat this code
here and the third thing we needed was
this age incrementer right here so we've
added one to it each time the loop goes
around now if we didn't have this
remember we'd get caught in an infinite
loop and that's because age would never
change
so never increase it so it's always
gonna be less than ten this is always
gonna be true and this is always gonna
execute over and over and over and over
that's gonna crash your computer not a
good thing so we definitely need that
third component in right there where we
add one to the variable each time around
okay so there's those three components
to a loop and in the while loop this is
generally how we set it out we'd have
the variable up here above the loop the
condition within the bracket and then
within the code at the end we'd have
that incrementer now there's an easier
way to do this which I prefer and that's
called a for loop where we specify all
three components within the practice
themselves so all we need to do for that
is get rid of this wild keyword or
replace it with war for not war get rid
of that condition there get rid of the
increment of there
and get rid of the variable okay now
we're going to put all of those three
things within the brackets themselves so
the first thing we need to do is put our
variable our index variable and we're
gonna set that equal to five to begin
with now we don't need to var keyword
here because this is just a variable
locally for this for loop we can skip
that and just put a variable name and
the initial value at the end we just
plus semicolon and then we can put our
second component which is the condition
I remember we said that it was for age
less than 10 so same as the while loop
was saying that while this is true we're
going to continue doing this loop all
right and the third thing we need is the
increment asur say age plus plus and at
the end of here we don't need that
semicolon because that's the last one
that's the last component so again we've
got our index variable initialized our
condition and then our increment at the
end all right so this is exactly the
same as the while loop that we did but
just a little neater and easier on the
eye in my opinion so let's just save
that make sure it does the same thing
here we need this to print out five
times and yet exactly the same print out
five times and then it says here you are
now old with 10 all right so this is the
same as the while loop but just a
different way of writing it now commonly
when you're doing a for loop we wouldn't
start at 5 we'd start at something like
what okay that's a more logical place to
start or even zero we can have in
debt-based it's up to you now
what we would do is maybe loop through a
page and find all the links and for each
link we'd apply some kind of style of
some kind of code that we want to
execute so I'll do that example right
now now you might have noticed in this
window here I've added six links to the
HTML page which is here so just six
simple eight tags and what we're going
to do is loop through the for loop and
we're going to get each one of these
tags so let's go back over to this
javascript funnel now don't worry about
the next bit of code I'm gonna do I'm
going to talk about this later
for now just pay attention to the fold
okay so I'm gonna get all the links and
store them in a variable to do that I'm
going to use the document dot get
elements by tag name which is right here
and then specify that we want all the a
times I put a semicolon right at the end
that's the end of the statement
so they're the links now instead of age
less than ten I want to say first of all
I'm going to set this to I just a
generic variable name it doesn't need to
be age and then I'm going to set this to
I less than links dot length and that
right there is getting all of these
links okay each one of those tags in the
index and the dot length method on here
is going to return a number for me and
that's going to return the number of
links on the page so this is grabbing
all the links then this dot length is
counting those links and giving me a
number now there's six of those links so
this would be the same as putting six
here but because there could be seven it
could be a I could add links in the
future we don't want to set this to six
because when it changes we want it
always to update to the current number
of links so we'll say that oh we'll
change this to I because that's our
initialize a variable there and we
generally use I or J or X or something
like that because it's just a standard
name okay now let's save this and in
fact we'll do something different will
console.log the unless let's think this
whoops this is link number and then
we'll do plus I will change the
initializer to one because that's where
it started so what we're saying is every
time we go around this is link number
one because that's what I will be then
the next time around this is link number
2 etc etc we'll get rid of this in fact
no we'll just change this to all links
now loop all right so let's refresh this
over here and now you can see this is
link number one this is link number two
number three number four number
five and when it gets to link number six
it's no longer less than links top
length so it breaks up the loop and it
says all links now looped it didn't
include dates because six is not less
than six but if we say less than or
equal to then that should solve it
refresh yet now we've looped link number
6 as well all right so I hope that all
makes sense again don't worry about this
bit here I'm going to cover this later I
just wanted to show you how to use a for
loop and how we can specify all these
different components that we need for
loops within one place there I prefer
this to a while loop it did kind of
buffle me at first but once you've done
it a few times you get the hang of it I
just suggest practicing and if you have
any questions obviously just comment
