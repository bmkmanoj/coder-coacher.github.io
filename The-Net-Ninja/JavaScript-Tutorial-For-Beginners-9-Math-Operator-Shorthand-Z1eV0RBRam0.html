watching JavaScript for beginners lesson
9 and in this video we're going to take
a look at the operator shorthand methods
that's coming up Wow okay so just a
quick recap on the last lesson we did I
told you that the five most common
operators of these ones here the
assignment one which is the equal sign
where we just assign a number or a
string to a variable we give it a value
and then these four here which are just
the basic arithmetic ones and that's the
addition subtraction division and
multiplication now there are a few
shorthand methods to assigning values to
variables using these which I want to
show you in this video
all right then guys so this is going to
be a pretty quick video I just want to
show you some of these shorthand methods
which are going to save your time going
forward when you write in JavaScript so
in the previous lesson we've seen we can
declare a variable with keyword var or
something capital R my path equals
tenure so that assigns the value of 10
to my file now if I wanted to add 5 to
that variable you know update the
variable itself I've saved my bar equals
my bar take the current value plus 5
yeah and then if I call my bar again it
should be 15 yeah it's updated that
variable so there is a quicker way to
doing this and the way we do that is by
using the shorthand notation for adding
a number to a variable all we do is say
my bar plus equals 5 ok
and what that there is doing is saying
okay take my bar and then plus equals
means take the original value of my file
what it currently is and add 5 to it all
right so this is exactly the same as
saying this and you can see this bit
here the plus equals as being the same
as this ok so it's just a short way of
writing equals my van plus it's taking
the current value of my bar and adding
this number here to it all right so now
it should be 20 and if we call my bar it
should be twin it exactly the same can
be done for
- so - equals 10 so it's currently 20
should be 10 now if I call my bar
perfect we can do the same with division
so let's try that my bar divide equals 2
so it should be 10 divided by 2 which is
5 let's just call it to make sure there
we go yeah and final it my bar x equals
5 so that should be 5 times 5 which is
25 and yep there we go let's just call
it again to make sure 25 okay so that is
the same as saying my bar equals my plus
5 this is the same as saying my bar
equals my bar minus 10 this is the same
as same my part equals my bar divided by
2 and this is the same as saying my bar
equals my bar times 5 ok so there the
shorthand ways of adding subtracting
dividing or multiplying the variable
that you have and then storing the
result all right now there's a couple of
more things I want to show you and
that's just the incremental and
decremental operators which are just
kind of shorthand ways of adding one or
subtracting one to a variable
alright so we could say something like
this my bar plus Q pause 1 and that's
just going to add 1 to my value so it's
going to be 26 because it's currently 25
so let's just see that in action yeah 26
now instead of writing that there is a
slightly quicker way we can do it we can
say my bar plus plus and that is going
to take my VAR or whichever variable you
have and add it add 1 to it okay just
one so it should be 27 now oh and the
reason that's happened is because of the
order of the pluses okay if I call my
bar now should be 27 yeah but because I
put the pluses after the variable name
what it did was print out my bar first
and then added want of it if I was to do
plus plus my bar then what it will do is
add one before it prints out the result
okay so it should be 28 now there we go
so the order does matter and we'll get
into these later on when we start
looking at loops and whatnot I just
wanted to show you them down so they're
not going to be alien later on so that's
all there is
these are the shorthand methods for
adding subtracting dividing and
multiplying variables if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below otherwise I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
