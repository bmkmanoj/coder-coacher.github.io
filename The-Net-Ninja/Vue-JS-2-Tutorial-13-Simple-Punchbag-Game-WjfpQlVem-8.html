13th vgs tutorial and in this video i'm
going to bring everything together that
we've learnt so far and create a little
points per game okay then so we're at
the stage now where we've kind of
learned a lot of the basics and i want
to bring everything together now that
we've learned and put them together in
one little project it's going to show
you how these kind of things work
together if you like
so we're going to create this minigame
and yeah it's going to be pretty crappy
but nevertheless it's going to shed some
light on how everything works together
okay so the game is going to be a
printable game we're going to have a
picture of a punch bag a couple of
buttons to punch the bag or restart the
game and when you punch it the health is
going to go down until it reaches zero
then it's going to show a burst bag all
right tada that's it
so we have these two images right here
in this image folder bag and bag burst
now you can find those on this repo
right here the mgs playlist I'm going to
leave the link down below you want to
come to brunch lesson 13 and it's in the
images folder right there so you can
download those okay cool so the first
thing I want to do over here is outline
the structure of our HTML template so
I'm going to create a few different
comments to say where everything is
going to go now we're going to have
three elements on this page the picture
of the bag the punch bag then the punch
bag health bar and then finally the game
buttons the controls at the bottom right
so let's create the comments to say
where everything is going to go so bad
image first of all then it wonder Neath
another comment and that is going to be
the bad Gulf and then finally underneath
is going to be the game controls ever
guns so let's start with the bag image
this is going to be a div with an ID
equal to bug and this ID is just so I
can style it up so there we go that is
up I've sorted now that the health bar
this is going to be a div again this
time with an ID equal to five - how and
again for CSS purposes and inside this
I'm going to create another div so the
idea here is this surrounding give right
here is going to be the containment of
the health with a border and this right
here is going to be a block of color
which represents the health which is
going to go down as we punch it okay so
we'll start things up shortly finally
the game controls so we'll say div ID
equals controls and then inside this div
we want to a buttons we want a button
first of all to punch the bag and then
we also need a button to restart the
game not that we ever want to restart
this game because it is going to be
pretty crap anyway so now we have our
two buttons we have our health and we
have a bag and actually if that is the
HTML done if we check this out in the
browser it's going to look like pretty
much nothing at the minute all we see is
easy buttons but now what I want to do
is style these up a little bit so I'm
going to start with the back so that's
ID but and this is going to have a width
of about 200 pixels it's also going to
have a height of 500 pixels and we're
going to give it an margin:0 on top and
bottom left or right is gonna be auto
which is going to centralize this div to
the center of the page now the
background is going to be an image this
is going to be how we show our image of
the back so this is going to be do RL
and inside it in the images folder and
/blog PNG so that is this image right
here so we're going to show that first
of all now we want to centralize this in
this div so I'm looking Center for
position and also we don't want this to
repeat so I'll say no - repeat just to
show it once finally I'm going to give
this a background - size of around 80%
something like that okay cool so now we
save this we're going to see our bag on
the page cool so let's now style up the
bag health so again hash bag health
that's this ID are right here so we're
styling that up now and this time I want
it to have a wick to gain of 200 pixels
it's going to have a border this is
going to be 2 pixels solid and black
which is zero zero zero and then finally
a margin at the top is going to be zero
right it's going to be Auto
bottom is going to be 20 pixels and
so centralizing those button that health
bar again now right now this is just a
black line why is that well because it's
got no height and nothing really is in
it so remember this to give inside it
this is going to represent natural color
block inside of the health so we want to
copy this paste it and then style up the
glue inside it and this time it's going
to have a height of 20 pixels and it's
also going to have a background of
crimson which is sort of like a deeper
red so if we save that now we can see
this health bar inside so as we punch
this health bar is going to go down and
we're going to basically change the
width of this from 100% to 0%
sequentially as we hit the punch board
makes sense okay so finally we want to
stand up these controls
so I'm going to copy that and down here
in CSS also controls this time a width
of 120 pixels and again margin is going
to be zero and also to centralize those
dudes as well also that is looking okay
now now then we need to start adding
some functionality and data to this game
and we're going to do that in our view
instance right here which is pretty
empty at the minute we just have the
element selector which is this thing so
it's controlling this area then we have
an empty data object empty methods
object and an empty computed object
which is these top two for this tutorial
so the first thing I want to do is
create a data property called health
which is going to store the health of
this bag now it's going to start off at
100 which will represent 100 percent
right and it's going to go down
sequentially by 10 as we punch it so
this right here is 100% at the minute
okay the first thing I want to do it in
the message is create a punch method so
this is every time we click this punch
button right here it's going to call
this punch method so this is a function
and then what do we want to happen
inside this function we want to reduce
the health of the bag so we can refer to
this health right here by saying this
dot health and that is equal to 100
right now but we want to say minus
equals
so we're taking off 10 from this health
every time okay makes sense that's what
- equals means it takes off ten of the
current value so next we want to create
another method and this time is going to
be called restart and that is when we
click this restart game so we might get
half way through the health will be down
here we said I don't what I want to
start again I'll click restart and it's
going to take the health back up to 100
so this again it's going to be a
function which inside is going to say at
least not health is now equal to 100
because we want to bring it back to the
beginning we want to restore the health
if you like ok so now what we want to do
is hook up these methods with these two
buttons right here so inside here we can
use Z - Kwan remember to listen to
events and it's going to be a click
event and when we click the punch button
it's going to fire to the punch function
we just created see him down here and V
- on and this is going to be a click
event again and I'm going to set this
equal to restart so now when we click
this if I the punch this recertify is
the restart method ok cool now I want to
create one more data property right here
and that is going to be called angular
and that is going to keep track of
whether the game is ended on up now the
game ends when this helps right here
reaches zero and when it ends I want
this to become a burst bug so we need to
keep track of whether the game is in
play or whether it's ended now at the
start the game is not ended it's only
just started right so this is going to
be false and when we reach zero health
right here we want the game to end so we
want to say ended is true in so how do
we know when the health is zero well
every time we punch it would take off 10
and after we've taken off tenet we can
say now I want to check if the health is
zero or less and I can do that using an
if statement so I think if this top
health is less than or equal to zero
then I want the game to end so I said
this tour ended to refer to this data
property and I'm going to set this equal
to true because
now game has ended right likewise when
we restart the game if the game has been
ended previously we want to reset and D
to false because now a plane again so we
can say this dot ended is equal to false
to make sense okay cool so there's a few
things I want to do in here now and the
first one is regarding this points
button so I only want to show this point
button when the game is in play
hence the game ended property will be
false right so I can show this kind of
conditionally using V - shown and if I
set this equal to a variable which is
either true or false it's going to add a
show or not show so if I set this equal
to ended then what's going to happen if
I save this then punch is not going to
show by default because ended is
currently false we're currently in play
now I want to show this to begin with
and they all only want to hide it sorry
when the game is ended when this right
here is true so I can use an engaging
operator and now when ended is false
this negation operator is going to turn
this whole statement into true it kind
of reverses it all right so when any of
these false it turns this into true when
it ended is true it turns this into
false so to save this now then punch
wall show to begin with but when health
reaches zero then punch won't show
therefore it cannot go to minus health
right make sense
cool so the next thing I want to do is
this health bar right here so as we
punch it and we'll take content of the
health and when a dynamically change the
width of this health bar to kind of
represent its health yeah now we're
going to do that using data binding I'm
going to do it on this give right here
so this is this red thing so we know how
to do that we can use V - bind and we're
going to bind to an earth to the style
attribute and this style attribute is
going to take an object as a parameter
right and we can pass through our
different style properties in here now
the style property we want to change is
the width so I say wait
and that
to be equal to the health right here
that we defined and we can reference
that just by saying
health we're also going to tack on a
percent at the ends of single quotations
not double so that we don't escape out
with the double quotes here do a percent
and now it's going to be whatever health
is plus this percentage right so to
begin with 100 percent but as we click
the punch button this will go to 90 80
70 percent etc so if we save this now
and take a look it would keep punching
then the health goes down pretty cool
but at the minute what happens when we
get to the bottom yeah the punch button
goes because of this thing right here
and the health is it's zero but this bad
it's not destroyed I want to destroy
this back right I want it to be burst
all right so what we need to do is some
more data binding on this bug to lift
now when the game is empty right and
when the game is ended we're going to
apply a class to it which we can style
differently to show that burst image so
again data binding is really - bind to
bind to a particular attribute this time
it's going to be class okay and this is
going to be equal to an object and
remember we can pass through as many
classes here as we like and each class
has got a name so this one is going to
be burst right we want to apply the
burst class when the game has ended
so this expects a boolean right here
true or false
when this boolean is true it's going to
apply this class to the div when this
building is false it's not going to
apply this class to the div so when the
game has ended when ended is true then
we're going to get this burst class
right cool so now if we inspect this
element right here and we keep on
punching you see this bag element when
we get to zero now keep an eye on this
right now
when I click it one more time you get a
class of bursts because the game has now
ended
so now we can style this up differently
so in the CSS letters go to bag and then
paste that in and now bag bursts when it
has a class of burst we want to give it
a different background so we'll copy
these
things right here paste them in and this
time it's going to be bug - birth which
is this other image still back - burst
save it and if we are refresh it right
over here
keep punching it and now we get the best
back one ah cool so there we go there is
your very first little crappy game with
the UJS so hopefully this is kind of
demonstrating how we can bring the
different techniques we've used together
to create something very simple like
this and as we go through future
tutorials we're going to create better
project than this believe me and but I
just wanted to demonstrate what you've
learned so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
