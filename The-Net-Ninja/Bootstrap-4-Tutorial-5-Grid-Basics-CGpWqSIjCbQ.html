your fifth bootstrap 4 tutorial and in
this video I want to talk about the
basics of the bootstrap grid system okay
so the bootstrap grid system has had a
significant upgrade since the last
version and now makes use of flex box
but we're going to get onto all that
later first of all I just want to bring
York to speed on the basics of the grid
system so the grid is split up into rows
going across and then columns going up
and down and the number of columns is 12
so we restricted to 12 columns but the
number of rows can be as many as you
like on your web page so the idea is
that this is content in different rows
on your web page going down the page
okay so for example we can have a role
in our web page which is made up of two
elements for example the picture on the
left and text on the right I've got the
two pictures or two blocks of text and
we want to say to bootstrap what we want
each of these to be six columns in width
so bootstrap then split these up into
equal segments on the grid this is six
columns you can see one two three four
five six and so is this one two three
four five six so we're seeing two bricks
crap we want each element to be six
columns in width or we could have three
elements in a row and we want to say
each of these elements takes up a width
of four columns 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 etc all
the could just have one element which
takes up 12 columns in which all the way
across and there's loads of different
combinations you could have 1 ways 2
columns and then the rest is 10 columns
etc they don't always have to be equal
like this so that's the premise but how
does this all work well this blue strap
we can just apply classes that blue
strap gives us to say how many columns
we want a particular element to take up
and we can also say a what device width
we want them to take off that space so
we're going to take a look now at a few
simple examples ok so I'm back in the
template file and all of them is adding
a div for the class of container so
remember when I was talking about
containers I said that they're the
surrounding element of all our content
and when we use the grid system we have
to put our rows inside a container that
is one of the constraint
of the grid systems so that's why I've
done this so the next thing I want to do
is create a row of content on our page
and the way we do that is by creating an
element with a class a row I'm just
going to use a div but you don't have to
I'm going to say div class equals row so
boom star now knows that this is going
to be a role our grid okay and we can
place elements with inside this row so I
want to place two elements in here again
I'm just going to use divs but you can
use whatever you want and say class
equals we're going to leave that blank
for now and just close up the div and
copy this again and paste the underneath
so now we have two elements inside this
rock now I want each element to take up
six columns in width from the small
screen sizes upwards okay so how do we
do that well the first thing we do when
applying column width to elements is say
call for the class okay then we provide
options we say at what screen size do
you want to apply this I'm going to say
small screen sizes which is SM then I
want to say how many columns of wit I
want this element to be I said six so -
six that's all there is - and what this
says is that okay I want at small screen
sizes and upwards remember bootstrap is
mobile approach first so this is small
screen sizes and upwards I want this to
be six columns in width and we're going
to do exactly the same for this one down
here and then we'll do same in the
actual element so we can see the text on
the screen and if I save this now let's
take a look in the browser you can see
that the tall sm6 over there is on the
left side of the grid and this one is on
the right side of the grid and each one
occupies six columns and widths now
that's quite hard to tell because it's
just text there's no borders around each
element or anything like that so let's
add just a couple of styles to make this
easier to sick now I'm just going to add
a style tag or a style attribute rather
right here this is not great practice so
I don't advise you to do this but I'm
just doing it so it quickly is it so I'm
going to say background is going to be
light blue just so we can see it and
then I'm also going to add style for
these things right here
I'm not going to do them in line because
I'm going to have loads of different
columns or elements that
take up columns I'm gonna just do one
global rule in this tablet right here in
the head so I'm going to say Rho which
is this thing right here then give which
is going to target these things right
here then I'm going to say they are
going to have a padding of 20 pixels top
and bottom 10 pixels left and right and
a border between one pixels thick and
then solid all the way around so we do
have bootstrap utility classes that we
can do this kind of stuff with but
because I'm not covered that I'm just
using these styles here okay so now we
can see them easier on the screen so
this is a small screen size and it's six
columns and wick and I said that
bootstrap is mobile first so this means
that this thing applies six columns of
weight for small screens small screen
sizes and upwards so if we make this
bigger they're always going to be six
columns of width and yet the elements
are getting bigger but it's just because
the screens getting bigger okay there's
still half and half 50% six columns each
so this is the case for all screen sizes
from small and upwards but once we get
to the X to small screen size they
revert and stack on top of each other
that is kind of the responsive nature at
the bootstrap grid which is really cool
okay so they're going to stack for kind
of like mobile devices so that is this
class what if I change this to medium
screen sizes and I say MD which stands
for medium well let's take a look I'll
save that now and if we take a look over
here now you can see how the small
screen size is no longer are they left
to right they're now stacked on top of
each other and that's because I've said
that I only want this up to apply from
medium screen size these orbits make
sense so assuming to get to a medium
screen size this is going to split up
into the columns like so awesome so
let's do a few more examples now I'm
just going to copy this and paste it
down below and this time what we'll do
is give this row a background color of
pink so we can distinguish it from the
other one and I'm also going to create
four elements inside this this time
instead of six colors of wet I want them
each to be on large screens three
columns in width
okay so it's fine for
medium screens but when we get to large
screens or say three times it works so
we'll say call LG for large and then
three okay so we're just adding on
another class here so I'm going to copy
this and paste it down here a couple of
times and then I'm also going to paste
it in the text as well so we can see
what's going on and once we've done that
I just want to save it
let's view this in a browser okay so
this time we're still getting a static
table for small screens because we said
we only want to apply this from medium
screens and upwards and if we make this
larger as soon as it gets to a medium
sized screen they're taking up six
columns in WIC now because the grid is
only twelve columns wide and each of
these are six columns and width then we
have four elements like this stacked on
top of each other and also left to right
because count of four going across
because that would make up twenty four
columns so the first two make up the
first twelve columns and then the next
few make up the second twelve columns so
the stacked on top like that make sense
but as soon as we get to large screens
we say we want them to be three columns
in width so this should all be left to
right so let's go to a large screen and
there we go three columns in width four
elements so let's do one more example so
I'm going to copy this thing again and
paste it down here this time I'm going
to give this a background color of
yellow and then again I want four
elements like so this time let's just
bring the bucks a call so we've not
added any options on yet we've got some
bootstrap what we want to do and again
I'm going to delete this text inside
here as well and this time what I want
to do is show you what happens when we
don't specify any sizes like small or
medium etc okay so imagine I just want
this to be I don't know three columns in
width for all screen devices well I can
just say call 312 312 312 three and have
a copy and paste this and just add them
in the text
to save it view in a browser
then for every screen size this is going
to be three columns in width must
because we didn't specify which device
we wanted it to be for and even on extra
small screens right here where they
normally stack there's still three
columns in width okay so that is the
bootstrap grid system and the idea is
that you put different content in each
one of these elements right here such as
images or text etc it's up to you but
that is the basics of the bootstrap grid
system in the next video what we going
to do is take this one step further and
take a look at some one of the new Flex
properties of this grid system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
