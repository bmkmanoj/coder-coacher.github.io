hey ninjas I'm Shaun from the net ninja
and this is CSS for beginners less than
three default browser styles Wow
now the thing you have to remember about
all browsers is that they have style and
by this I don't mean to wear a trilby
and go around dancing to seventies foot
music I mean that they all apply their
own default browser styling to your HTML
and this could be little things like
margin padding between elements font
sizes underlining links and coloring
them blue that kind of thing so that if
you don't have any CSS apply to your
website or if someone views it without
CSS then they have these kind of default
browser styles to fall back on so they
all have this kind of basic experience
of the website and different browsers
for example Chrome Firefox Internet
Explorer they all apply their own
default styles now there's not much
different between them they all kind of
adhere to the same rules but there may
be slight differences when it comes to
things like font size or padding or
margin so what we're going to do now is
dive back into the net ninja web site
and we're going to have a look at these
default browser styles so here I am back
on the web site and I've got two
browsers open on the left you can see
google chrome and on the right Firefox
and they're both applying default
browser styles here we've stripped out
all our own CSS and this is just the
basic Styles being applied by the
browsers and as you can see if we scroll
down both sets of styles are pretty
similar yeah the baby slight changes
when it comes to things like font size
and margin between the elements but
they're both pretty spot-on they're both
very similar now these default browser
stars what are they well if you look at
the headings there are bold and slightly
larger if you look at the links they are
all underlined and they're blue on this
side the only reason they're purple here
is because that previously clicked them
on chrome if we scroll down to the
bottom
can see the list items here all have
these little bullet points so these are
all the basic styles applied by Chrome
and Firefox and what they're doing is
they're saying well okay I'm looking at
this HTML and just in case the user
doesn't apply their own CSS I'm gonna
give them these default styles so that
if a user comes on to this website they
have this basic website experience now
you might be sitting there thinking why
the hell am I talking about these
default browser Styles if I'm going to
apply my own CSS to this website why do
I need to know this and the reason is
this if you are making your own website
and you apply your own CSS to this
website and down the line you're looking
at some header and you're thinking well
hang on why is this got all this margin
underneath the header I didn't apply it
and that's the default browser Styles
nine times out of ten that's what it's
going to be so you need to be aware of
this and you need to override this in
your CSS you need to explicitly say I
don't want margin on this header okay so
you're always need to be aware of these
default browser styles and the part they
play now this is a subject that sparked
some debate over the last few years and
some people have gone as far as creating
these things called CSS resets now I'm
not going to get into too much detail
about a CSS reset now we're going to do
that in a later video but what I will
say is that in essence all they do is
strip these browsers of their default
styles to different degrees so that you
can have a more blank slate when it
comes to writing your CSS now some
people agree with these some people
don't that's your decision as a
developer at the end of the day I'm not
going to make that choice for you what I
will do is cover those later and go
through the benefits and the
disadvantages of those but for this
lesson I think that's about it your main
takeaway here should be that you
understand these default browser styles
and you're aware of their existence in
the browser so that you know when you
come to write your own CSS that you have
to sometimes override these so that's
all there is for this lesson in the next
lesson we're going to dive into the CSS
itself and look at the syntax if you
have any questions or comments about
this one

videos and I'll see you guys in the next
