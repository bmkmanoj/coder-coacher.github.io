tutorial and in this video I want to
introduce you to your referencing with
wrists okay then so UJS gives us a way
to reach into our template here and grab
an element and then access data about
that element and we can do that using
what's known as a ref so to demonstrate
this I'm going to walk through a couple
of simple examples the first example
involves this input box with a type
equal to text and what I want to do is
if we view this in a browser I want to
get a reference to this element so that
when you user typed in it I can see what
they've tagged in it all right and I can
get all the information about this
element as well so the way we use refs
in UGS is to just give whatever element
we want to reference to an attribute
called ref and set that equal to
whatever name we want to give this
reference this could be Mario or Luigi
I'm just going to give this one a rest
of input okay so now we can access this
element from inside this view instance
right here and get data about it so to
do that what I'm going to do is a simple
button down here and that says to submit
and what I'm going to do is attach the
click event to this so that's Rhian then
click and I'm going to set that equal to
a function now we've not defined this
function yet so let's go and define that
first of all so in app KS in a method
section let's create a function and I'm
going to call this function at read rest
so this is a function and inside here
what we're going to do is access those
refs
so first of all let's link this
opportunity for tchen read refs and how
do we access now the references that we
have in our template well we can do that
by saying this which references this
view instance then we have access to dot
refs and preceded by the dollar sign by
self and that is going to get us a list
of all of our references on the page or
within this scope right here
so if we had multiple different elements
with different refs attached to them it
would get us all of them by using this
so let's just log this to the console
first wall console that log and I'll say
this refs and if we save that now and
previous in the browser if we type
something in here submit then we get
this log to the console and this is an
object and this object is going to have
several key value pairs and the key is
going to be whatever we call our riffs
so right now we have a risk on input
right here okay if we had more we have
more keys down there for different riffs
so if we expand this you can see all the
different information we can access on
this reference on this element and one
of them which I want to demonstrate is
the value down here so if you come down
to V you'll find value right there so
that's this element rather this string
that we tapped into the input box
annaclaire excessive so how do we access
it we say this Refs
then the name of the reference we want
to access data from in this case it's
imports and then the name of the
property from here that we want access
to as well as value so if I save this
and then come over here and say yo and
submit then we get yo log to the console
pretty cool right so now we access the
value property of this element and it's
not just the value property we can
access like say there's all those
different things we can access as well
so what I want to do now is create a
data variable to store this property in
this value right here so this data
project is going to called output and to
begin with let's just set it as your fav
food right so if I save this now and
output this to the Dom all we need to do
is come down here and say P and I'll say
your fav food and then I'm going to say
output like so if I save this now then
we see your face ood is your face week
because that's the value of output but
what I want to do is when a user typed
in here update this
using riffs so I can do that if I go to
a pas in here what I can say is this dot
output is equal to Vince
refs dot input value okay remember
that's the value that we input right
here so now if I type in for example at
an old pickles and press submit now we
get pickles they're pretty cool right so
we're using refs to update values in our
data so it's not just input elements we
can use this on we can use it on pretty
much any element that we want so I do
another quick example here so if I say
give and give this a ref of I don't know
test and close that off there's nothing
in there just an empty give but what I'm
going to do in fact I'll say hello just
put like that some text so now I can
come in here and if we log this time
just to rest save this and click Submit
then we can see we've got two refs now
we've got input and test so inside test
we also have access to all of this
different data so for example I could
get the inner text or in the HTML so
let's just do that
I say console that log this dot rest got
in a text save that and if I click
Submit
I get undefined and that's because I
didn't say which refs
I'm going to access is this time this
reference test so I need to say dot test
dot inner text and now when I click
Submit we get hello okay so that's how
we use refs
to reference our elements on a page and
grab information about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
