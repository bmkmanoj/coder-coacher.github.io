this is CSS for beginners lesson 27 and
in this video we're gonna talk all about
font size that's coming up Wow okay so
so far in this course we've looked at
mainly selectors that is how to target
elements on a HTML document and we've
got our ID selectors we've got our class
selectors we've got our element
selectors among other things like
descendant and child selectors pseudo
classes etc but now we're going to shift
that focus over to the declaration so
what I've been putting properties in the
rules in the past I've been saying to
you you know take no notice of this
we're going to cover it later that's
what we're going to do now and we're
going to start with the font size
property so when we do font size we can
do it in two ways we can give something
an absolute font size or we can give
something a relative font size and the
difference I'm going to explain as we go
back into the code but generally
speaking absolute measurements are in
pixels and relative measurements are in
m/s or percentages so we're going to
take a look at all three of these now
when we jump back into the code ah
okay mean just hurry I'm back in the
code we've got an article HTML page here
and a blank CSS file here so the article
page is h1 a few h2s and some PT action
in the article and we're going to target
all of these different elements so we'll
do our selectors first they are h1 h2
and P so we're going to give these a
font size property and we'll do the
hitch one first now the way we do the
font size property is by simply writing
fonts - sighs okay that's the property
name this is where we control the font
size of that element and then we do our
colon and then we put in a value now
we're going to start with pixels which
is an absolute value and when I say
absolutely I mean we give it a
definitive value and number that's
intrinsic
okay and it doesn't change so we'll say
48 pixels and that's quite a large font
size and by the way this px is done for
pixels and that's quite a large font
because it is a hitch one after all so
we'll make it quite large pick it stand
out and the h2 will give a font size of
32 pixels and then the P will give a
font size of 16 pixels wait she's kind
of like standard font size for general
paragraph text on a web page so we'll
save that and we'll see what it looks
like now within a browser okay so
there's a h1 at the top h2s here and our
paragraph tags so just to check that
this is worked what I'm going to do is
right-click each element and I'm going
to go to inspect element which is going
to open up Google tools here and you can
see my rule in syntax door CSS for the H
ones here font size 48 pixels and if I
hover over the h2 then you can see the
rule font size 32 pixels which we did
and over the p's
font size 16 pixels now then I'm going
to show you something pretty cool if you
look here on h1 you can see another rule
underneath mine and it's in great and it
says here user agent stylesheet now
that's the default style the default
browser Styles being applied that we
talked about in an earlier lesson and we
can see there that it was two M's it's
crossed out because I've overridden it
but if I uncheck this you can see now
it's two M's and it changed size appear
now M's are a relative unit of
measurement and we're going to cover
those now so I'm going to jump back into
the code just to show you what this
means
I'm going to delete these here for now
and to demonstrate this I'm going to use
inheritance now we've covered
inheritance in a previous lesson if
you've not watched that video I'm going
to leave a link to that in the
description below so you can go check
that out
but for the rest of us I'm going to use
inheritance to demonstrate why we'd use
MS and percentages so we know that I can
select the article tag by doing that
just write a simple particle selector
that's going to grab the article types
and then I'm gonna give those a font
size of 16 pixels okay
so then what I'm saying is everything
we're doing the article give a font size
of 16 pixels so the peas are the hata
tubes but what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to override the hitch tube so we know
that H 2 here is inheriting this font
size of 16 pixels but we can override it
already being overridden in the default
browser styles but we're gonna override
it again ourselves and we're going to
say font size is gonna be three M's now
this here ends that's a relative
measurement and what we're saying with
this is that we're saying take the base
font size which is inherited which is 16
pixels and then times that by 3
that's what n was do okay so we're gonna
get this 16 pixels and times it by 3
which is 30 48 pixels okay so I say what
we'll do it by 4 just to make it bigger
and that's going to make it 64 pixels
this this HT - okay so we'll save that
and we'll right click and showing it to
Laura and view it in Chrome and now
these here are 64 pixels
okay that's because they are ms for ms
they're inheriting 16 pixels font size
and then we times it by 4 because this
is a relative unit I was saying we want
the h2 font size to be 4 times as large
as the inherited style makes sense yeah
the same is true for percentages so
we'll do the same with the ptex article
P and we're going to give these a
percentage font size and we'll say what
we say 60% no 50% that's nice and easy
so we're saying again the peas are
automatically inheriting this 16 pixel
font size because we've said everything
the article gives 16 pixels but then
with that inherited style we're
overriding the font size and we're
saying okay take 50% of that size that
we were inherited and display that to
user to the user so we're taking 16
pixels Sampson it by 50% which is 8
pixels and then it should output as that
in the browser which is gonna be pretty
small to be honest get glasses on
everyone yep I can't read a thing there
but take my word for it it's about 8
pixels okay so let's just try one more
we'll say 500 percent so 500 percent is
essentially saying take 16 pixels and
times that by 5 isn't it so that would
be 50 80 pixels roughly
that this is will view it in the browser
one last time yeah freaking huge text
there ok so then about covers it we've
got our pixels which are absolute
absolute sizes they don't change
depending on what they inherit you just
give it a size and that's that and then
we've got our relative measurements
which are ms and if it's 4m you take the
heritage style or the base style and you
times it by four it was four point five
you times with my four point five etc
and then you've got your percentages
which is similar to ms but this time
they work in a percentage format so same
again we're saying terms it by 500%
inherited style and display that font
size okay so hopefully that clears up
how we control the font size in CSS if
you have any additional questions feel

soon as possible otherwise if you enjoy
