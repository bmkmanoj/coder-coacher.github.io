react tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about state okay so in the
last tutorial I said there were two main
ways we can work with data in react
first by using props and also by using
state now we've already had a look at
props where we pass in the properties
here on the component tag and then we
can access those properties within the
component like this now in this video I
want to show you about States and we
don't pass state into the component we
define the state within the component
itself and then we can access the state
properties in that component so let's
get rid of these dudes first of all
we're not going to use them and get rid
of them on the tag as well and I'm also
going to strip out this stuff as well
okay cool so what we do first of all is
define an initial state of the component
when the application starts what is the
state of it okay what data does it have
within it and we do that by using a
method within this component now I said
when we first created this component it
only requires one method and that's this
render method right here so we're going
to create another one now called get
initial state which is going to
initialize the data of the state of this
component so what I like to do when I
use various different methods within a
component is just comment them at the
end just to say what they are so it just
looks a little easier on the eye so I'm
going to say render and we're going to
create the get initial state above that
so get initial state and this is a
function and this function is going to
return an object ok so within this
object is going to be all of our data
our state for this component I'm going
to put a comma net so since I want to
start padding out our to-do list I'm
going to give this a property call to
dues and this is going to be an array
and in this array we'll just pass some
things in some different strings so wash
up then eat some cheese that is very
appropriate always appropriate and then
take a nap
okay cool so that's our property on the
state and we could add various different
properties as well I could say something
like age I don't know twenty-eight and
various other things but for now I just
want to add one property to this object
right here this state object so now we
can access this data on the state of the
component within this render function if
we want to output it to the screen to
the browser so let's do that so I'm
going to give this an ID first of all
and I'm going to give this ID value up
to do - list and then within that I'm
going to just do a quick key tag this is
a quick title the busiest people of the
most ledger okay cool
so let's output this data within a UL
tag and then each piece of this array is
going to be output into an li tag so how
do we access this data on the state
pretty similar to how we did it with the
props so it's curly braces again then
it's this to reference the component
then dot state to reference the state
object and then whatever property we
want to grab so I wanted to do on the
state now I don't want to output the
whole array so I'm just going to say I
want the zeroth element within that
right and then I'm going to copy that
dude and paste it in a couple of times
so we can output each value from the
array so one and two so what we've done
now is initialized our state by using
this method and got some data on that
state which we were then accessed using
this dot state dot the name of the
property on that object and then the
different pockets in that array move
output that now to the browser so if we
see this over here we can see all output
in the browser cool right so you might
be thinking well this state and there's
props so when do I use state and when do
we use props well that is up to you
however you'll find that a lot of people
like to use them in tandem so in a
typical application we might have a lot
of different components and normally
they'd have some kind of tree structure
so we have a comparing parent component
and then within that we might nest other
components children components right so
for example right here we might have
another component which we nest called I
don't know list component or something
like that list component okay and that
is nested within this component so much
like we added this component into the
Dom while adding this child component
into this parent component and we might
pass this component some data right
so we can do that via props so we could
say to dues equals this not State DOT to
dues so on the parent component with
defining our state this is the state of
the whole kind of component right and we
can change the state of it if something
changes in one of these things right
here we can update it on the state and
then we pass information down to all the
nested components via props and we only
pass the data that they need so we might
have various different objects are
various different arrays or properties
on here and we only pass one of them
things to this prop right here to the
list component and that component can
then only access this thing and that
would be immutable we don't change the
props or anything there when we want to
change something we might have some kind
of event which fires back up to the
parent component it changes in here and
then the updated cam property is passed
down via props into the nested component
okay make sense so that's generally how
we would do things in react and it's
going to become a lot more clear as we
go on and create nested components okay
so you'll see this in action later on so
there we go that's your introduction to
States in the next video I'm going to
show you how we can cycle through this
state data a bit more elegantly so until
then don't forget to share subscribe and
like and I'll see you in the very next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
