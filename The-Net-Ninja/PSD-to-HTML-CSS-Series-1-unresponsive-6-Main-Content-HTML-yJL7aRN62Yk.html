PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 6
and in this video I want to walk you
through the main content HTML ah I think
guys so this is where we left off last
time we did the lead banner and we said
we're going to move on to this main
content with the three sections in right
here and that's these three sections one
two three so that's what we're going to
do in this lesson so first section we
need is at the top and although you can
see there's titles at the start of
section two and a title at the start of
section three
there's not one at the start of section
one right but again the html5 section
type kind of expects a heading H tag
right and it's also good for screen
readers because then it kind of presents
it in a logical manner for those so what
I'm going to do is give this a h2 but
I'm going to hide the one in the first
section because it's not there on the
designer okay so this is purely for the
benefit of html5 markup and screen
readers so let's do that
h2 tag then h2 and then I'm just gonna
call this points of sale doesn't really
matter what you call it a minute I mean
obviously if you're doing this for a
real client then you're going to want to
do something that's logical for this
part right here all right then we've got
three elements here and when we get
three elements like this stacked side by
side is quite common in modern websites
I'd like to use a ul and Li tags to
represent those because it's kind of
like a side words list isn't it
alright so let's give that a ul and we
will give them three mi attacks oops
I'll just do one then we'll copy and
paste and within each a line we've got
an image at the top then a title then a
bit of blurb right there so let's do
that image first of all image source
equals and then it's in our images
folder forward slash and it's these
things right here yes one two and three
so I'm going to see s1 will give it an
alt of web design because that's what's
said right here and close though next
thing we need is the tight
so I'm gonna say h3 for this because
it's kind of like a subheading of this
and we'll say web design and finally we
just need some lorem ipsum text to go
right here which is what that is so
let's grab this copy it and paste in
here
cool all right so that's one li it's at
dawn I'm just going to copy this now for
simplicity and paste them in a couple of
times and then we'll just go back and
change these to cs2 and cs3 and we'll
change the alt tags second one is e
comments and we need to change the title
to eat - commerce then SEO and SEO in
the title awesome
all right there so that's the three
images or the three list items right
there what I'm going to do is just give
this section an ID so that we can grab
these UL tags or a lighter on it and
we'll call it points - of sale same is
what this takes to it alright on to the
next section so we'll give this section
an ID - and we'll say clients because
it's what our clients say within the
section we needed that h2 which is what
our clients say and then under here oops
that was pipe in there for some reason
on here we need a an image tag for this
and we need a blockquote tag for this
because it's a quotation we can tell
that from that little image right there
alright so let's do the image first of
all image source equals images under
then it is the which one is it quote
runner cool give it an alts of quote
and then next to that we need this block
bolt tag and we typically use block
ports for quotes things like plane
testimonials things like that so again
I'm just going to copy and paste this
again select all that and paste it
between it and all the kind of aesthetic
things the design we're going to sort
out in the CSS later for example this
thing here will use a background image
property and padding top to sort that
out all right last section that is for
the droppers align I'm just going to say
ID equals contact for this because it's
got a map and it's got all the contact
details right here so that should be
fine so first thing we need
sorry firstly we need a list for this
and then we need an image for that and
then we've got a list of all the social
icons at the bottom so let's do a ul
first of all and then we need an li tag
and each one of these has got a little
icon on the left which we're going to
use padding for so we don't need to put
that image in here we're going to do
that in the CSS so the first one is the
phone number I can't read that so I'm
just gonna do all the five five five
five five five five five five five five
whatever second one is the email address
which is hello
whatever calm and third is the address I
think can't really really bas-relief
studios I think that's what it says then
the fact it goes on to a few different
lines so I'm gonna do this how will I do
this I'm going to use span tags and each
span is going to display this block so
it's got its own line okay
so let's jump over to the next line
we'll do that again span and the next
line is Times Square I think close
develop one more oops
and it is New York awesome okay so
that's that list done now we need this
image so we'll come back below argue
well tag and we'll bring in an image tag
with a source of images forward slash
map and then an alt attribute of map
also so that's the image and then
finally guys we need this little list
right here so I'm gonna do a ul again
and we're going to give these IDs will
say UL ID equals contact methods just so
we can grab them separately in the CSS
and this ID will be social - you know
alright so the first Li I'm just gonna
give a class of what is it is the
Facebook's like in that class of
Facebook and then I'm gonna write in
here and a tag it's gonna go to the
Facebook link for this company and I'm
gonna write Facebook and again this is
for screen readers although there's no
text right here we're going to replace
this with an image in the CSS giving it
a background image I'm doing this for
screen readers because if they view the
page they're not going to see these
images but they will see this text and
so they can jump over to those links
that way we'll hide this in the CSS so
let me copy that and paste it a few
times so what we've got next we've got
Twitter so we'll change the cluster
Twitter and the text to Twitter then
we've got is that Pinterest yep
and the text as well will change that
finally we've got LinkedIn and we'll
change the text also now I think we've
missed out this h2 up here so I'm just
gonna pop that back in h2 and it says
drop us a line and then finally what I
want to do is one more thing all of
these sections we've just done here
these three sections they need to be
contained within that wrapper div to
keep them in the central column right so
I'm gonna go up here I'm gonna make a
div with a class of wrapper and to be
frank guys I should have done this
before but I just forgot so it's going
in now I will paste that down there and
we're just gonna scoot in these three
sections using the tab key once they're
all highlighted and that should be that
okay then guys so that is this lesson
sort if we've done all the structural
HTML now what we're going to do in the
next lesson is dive into the CSS I start
styling this baby up if you have any
