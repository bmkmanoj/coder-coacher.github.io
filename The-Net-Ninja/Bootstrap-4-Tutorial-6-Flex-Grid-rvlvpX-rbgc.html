your sixth bootstrap floor tutorial in
this video I want to focus on the select
properties of the bootstrap for grid
system all right now so in the last
tutorial we made all these different
rolls right here and within those rules
we've had various elements and we use
bootstrap grid classes to say what which
we want those elements to be how many
columns we want each one to take up for
example this one right here coal and d6
saying I want this element right here
to take up six columns in width from a
medium sized screen and upwards so we
can do this but we can also make use of
bootstraps select properties as well so
imagine I wanted these two elements to
be equal width but I don't want to
specify how many columns okay
well I can do that by just removing this
thing right here and I tell you what
let's just get rid of these two rows so
we can just focus on this so now they
both just have a class of coal MD
without saying how many columns in width
I want each element to be so what blue
strut will do is look at this and say
okay I'm going to use my select
properties to automatically work out the
width of these and assign them those
columns so that they're equal on medium
size screens and upwards so let's save
this now and check it out and you can
see if we go to a medium sized screen
then we're going to get these two
elements taking up the same amount of
horizontal space the same amount of
columns of your like now the atomistic
scones each what we've not had to
specify that bootstrap has already
worked it all out for us we just have to
say column D column D and that's going
to make those two elements equal in
width all right so that's a cool little
thing let's try it with a few different
elements so I'm going to copy this and
paste it in and this time let's get rid
of this text will just say column B
column D and I'll tell you what because
I'm so later there's delete those copy
knees again and paste them in right
there okay so if we take a look at this
now it's automatically worked out the
width of those four elements to make
them equal on bigger sized screen so a
minute ago these were six column width
when there only two of them but now
they're three times in which
three times four is 12 so it's
automatically worked it out for us
and then on smaller screens they still
stop because we've said that we want
this to be from medium sized screens
upwards let it go right so what if we
want to determine the width of one of
these but let bootstrap work out the
width of the others so let me show you a
quick example let's take away one of
these elements unless a we want the
middle one right here too because six
columns of width we want that to be for
definite and we won't boot structure
using flexbox system to work out what
the width of these two should be
automatically and we want the width of
these two top and bottom to be equal
bootstrap can do that all we need to do
say how many widths or how many columns
in width this should be this element
bootstrap is automatically going to work
out the width of these two DS right here
so let's save it and check it out so
this time just want to six columns in
width because we've said so right there
and bootstrap has automatically made
these two equal right here so that is
really cool and we can do the same if we
want to make this I don't know eight
columns in width it's going to do the
same thing that is really cool so that's
some of the benefits of the new flex
grid system I also want to show you a
couple more things and to do that I'm
going to create a new row so let's just
copy this and paste it down here I'm
going to get rid of this style right
here we don't need it we want to
distinguish it from this and this time
around what I want to do is say okay
Cole MD - two column D - two and column
D - - and I'm just going to add those on
there so we can see them we know what
they are I can see them - two and - two
so now all of these take up two columns
in width right and if I save this and
not select all save and view in the
browser now we can see each one of those
takes up two columns of width
now that only adds up to six columns
which is why they're only taking up half
of the horizontal space that's fine we
can do that in bootstrap okay that's not
what I wanted to show you what I wanted
to show you is how we can align these
elements to either the left or the right
so say for example I want these three
items to be aligned over here to the
right well I can do that and I do it by
adding your class here to the rope so I
can say
precise content and that sells boots up
look I want to justify these elements
within this row in some direction from
what screen sighs well it's going to be
from medium size screens at which and
it's going to be in the center so if I
save that now check it out in the
browser now we see they aligned in the
center pretty cool right so one of the
things I want to show you is the
ordering of these elements so let's just
put one here because we know that's the
first element two here we know that's
the second element is three here save
that and we can see that one two three
okay now what if I wanted to switch the
order of these four small screens say I
want in this one to be first well I can
do that by adding pluses down here to
these individual elements so I can say
for example down here I'll say flips
first and what that is going to do is
make this the first element okay and
then I can come here and I can stay
flick blast and this is going to make
this the last element so we're
reordering things so one should be last
and two should be first three should be
then in the middle so let's save this
and we can see now two is first three is
in the middle and four one is last
pretty correct so there are some of the
features we can use with the new flexbox
grid system in bootstrap for what I'm
going to do is leave the links and the
documentation for the Flex grid down
below so you can go ahead and check it
out because there's quite a lot more
this is just kind of like an
introduction to the new features
okay then going so this is the
documentation for the bootstrap for grid
system I'm going to leave this link all
right down below and I do advise you to
take a look at this page because there
is a little bit more to the bootstrap
full grid system then I've already
explained in this video it's got a nice
table of content so we know where
everything is so for example if I click
flex order it's going to give us a
little example of how to use it was just
take a look at this in the code so yeah
as definitely would advise you to have a
read through this page and check out the
different options that it provides us
with as a side note we can also use
books
towards flexbox utilities on all the
elements in our document as well it's
not just restricted to the grid system
we can use it on the nav bars for
example so what I'm going to do is a
bonus lesson right at the end of this
series which is going to go into more
detail about how to use flexbox on other
elements and some of the different
properties it allows us to use so stay
tuned for that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
