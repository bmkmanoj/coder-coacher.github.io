for beginners lesson 38 and today we're
going to talk about padding that's
coming up Wow so we've see what margin
is that's the external space around the
element to separate it from other
elements okay now we're going to look at
the padding which is an internal spacing
property so it's within the confines of
the element itself alright guys so I'm
back here in the code and we've got
exactly the same two elements here these
div tags and then we've got the class
here which is going to apply a margin of
30 pixels are padding and 30 pixels and
a border of one pixel which is black all
around the elements so let's open this
up in a browser and take a look at the
padding in more detail it's going to
right-click and inspect the element and
right there the green color is the
padding so that's within the element
itself you've got your border first then
the green and that's 30 pixels on all
sides right so we saw with margin we can
control the top right bottom and left
separately well we can do exactly the
same with the padding so let's just do
that let's say we want a padding of 30
pixels at the top and 20 pixels on the
right and 10 pixels on the bottom and
we'll go up with 5 pixels on the left
let's save that and view it in the
browser again put this in google chrome
and cool now if we inspect the element
all right we can see the green now the
top part of the green is 30 pixels still
the right side is 20 pixels the bottom
is 10 and the left is 5 very little
padding on the left and again you can
see that down here in the dev tools the
padding box here 30 20 10 and 5 so that
works exactly the same way as the margin
now you don't really notice the right
padding here because the content is not
very long but let's just throw that in
let's give it some larger content I'm
just going to copy this here
I'm going to paste it few times okay I
think that should go all the way across
I'll save it and view it in a browser
again all right and now we can see the
padding being applied here on the right
hand side so what else can we do well we
can do the other shot hands as well we
can say we want 30 pixels on the top and
bottom and 20 pixels on the left and
right let's see what that does save it
and view it in a browser yet now you can
see the top and bottom padding's are
greater than the left or right padding's
all right and we can say one last sip 5
pixels what we're seeing here is the
same as with the margin top 30 right 20
bottom 5 and because there's not one
specified for the left is saying okay
well I'll copy the right one which is 20
again so top right and left and bottom
okay so let's just save this in view one
more time in a browser cool there we go
so look so yet we've got here 30 at the
top 20 on the right 5 at the bottom and
20 on the left cool and just like
margins yep just like margins we can
work with percentages also so let's say
we want a padding of 30 pixels on the
top and bottom and then 20% left to
right
okay let's view that in a browser okay
now we've got this big margin left and
right that's 25% of this whole width ok
the content therefore is going to be
about 50% and we've got the top and
bottom of 30 pixels all right so that's
all there is to paddings a little bit
more simple than margin so we don't have
the padding collapse like we do with
margins if you have any questions don't
