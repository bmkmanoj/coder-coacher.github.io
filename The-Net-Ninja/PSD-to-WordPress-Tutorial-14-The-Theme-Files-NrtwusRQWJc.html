PSD to WordPress lesson 14 and in this
video I'm going to give you a tour of
the theme files Wow okay then go so I'm
back here in brackets now and all this
is the code that we made for our
restaurant design and the idea is that
we're going to turn this code into a
fully fledged WordPress theme yeah but
for now what I want to do is give you a
quick tour of the black theme files that
we installed I'll show you what
everything does basically okay so to do
that we're going to go to file open
folder and I'm gonna go to the C Drive
one and then www wp-content themes and
then our theme which is resto select
that folder and it's gonna open up all
the folders and files right here
so before I start WordPress works in a
very modular way and by that I mean it's
got different files for different pages
or even different parts of your template
for example this home page of our
website
our WordPress website which doesn't look
like much for now by the way because of
that blank theme this home page is being
loaded by the index.php file by default
in wordpress okay so if we open this up
index where is it dot PHP right there
this is the file that's loading up this
over here right the home page now if we
scroll down a little bit the first thing
it does is write out this function
called gets header and this is a
wordpress function and what it's doing
is calling a specific template part and
that template part is the header this
one right here headed up PHP so if I
open that up you can see basically it's
just a doctype HTML tag the head tag the
opening body tag with some dynamic
classes added in then we've got all this
stuff right here which is the header and
then the navigation this is our dynamic
content loaded in by WordPress and we'll
go through this a bit more later on so
you ever got enough and then this div
with an ID of content so all of this
right here in the header dot PHP file is
being loaded in whenever this get header
function is called okay so on the index
dot PHP file it's all getting loaded
at the top right there and also on any
other template file such as single or
page which control different pages on
here it's going to get loaded in at the
top so anything in here will pretty much
be at the top of any page on your
website okay by default so that's one
part of the index file then we've got
this div and main tag we've got some
dynamic content here that's loading in
the page title and then we've got this
dynamic content which is called the loop
okay now the loop is a very deep and
important part or aspect of WordPress
it's at the heart of it and I'm not
going to talk too much about it now but
I am going to do that in the next
tutorial probably all you need to know
for now is that this loop is grabbing
the dynamic content that we enter in the
backend and it's bringing it back out
and displaying it on the page here okay
so that's grabbing the content that's
the job of the loop to grab the dynamic
content so that's what it's doing right
there and then underneath here we've got
the closing main then we've got another
WordPress function called get sidebar
and this is calling another template
part and that part is called sidebar PHP
right here so it's just a simple file
which is going to load in some widgets
we've got a dynamic sidebar area and I'm
going to talk about this later on when
we come to looking at widgets you don't
need to know too much about it for now
all you need to know is that that part
in the index file is grabbing this
sidebar dot PHP file and dumping it here
same for the footer get footer is
calling the footer dot PHP grabbing all
of this stuff here and it's putting it
at the bottom of the index file alright
so what else do we have well this is the
front page and it's being loaded by the
index dot PHP file but if we go to a
post hello world and look at this page
this is no longer being controlled by
the index dot PHP file this is being
controlled by this single dot PHP file
it's a post and posts are typically
loaded in by the single dot PHP template
file okay it's similar to the index dot
PHP
PHP filing that it's got the header it's
got the loop right here in the middle
and it's got the sidebar and the footer
the only difference is really that it's
got this part here which is loading in
the comments right to that post so you
can see it's got a function called
comments template and that is grubbing
another template part called comments
PHP which is all this dynamic stuff
right here and we're not going to go too
deeply into it like to say I need to
know is it's grabbing all of this stuff
right here which is dynamically checking
for comments on that particular post and
then loading them in under the post
itself right so we also have template
files for different types of pages so
we've seen one for the post page which
is single dot PHP and then the home page
which is index dot PHP we also have one
for the 404 page so we've saw on types
in a URL like hello worlds which doesn't
exist then they're going to get this 404
page which is controlled by this right
here which again has the header it has
the footer doesn't have the sidebar but
then it's got all this kind of dynamic
content in the middle it's got a search
form it's got the widget area blahdy
blahdy blah a lot of stuff there which
we'll talk about maybe a little bit more
later on we also have the page PHP file
and this is going to control all static
pages on your file
I remember static pages are different
from posts when we took a tour of the
WordPress back-end we have two content
types really we had the posts which was
for blogs or news items and things like
that then we had the static page content
which was for more permanent features on
your website like and about shows page
so things like that would be controlled
by the page PHP file by default in
WordPress so again we've got the header
we got the side by the footer the loop
in the middle or the generic kind of
stuff we've also got the search dot PHP
file which controls the page when
someone searches for something if I put
in hello and search this search results
page is controlled by this file again
we've got the header we've got the
dynamic content in the middle then the
sidebar and the footer and finally I
will show you the archive dot PHP
template file which again
header it's got the sidebar in the
footer and then all this kind of dynamic
content with the loop in the middle
which is putting the content onto the
page and an archive is just for
something like this November 2015 it's
gonna grab all the posts that I posted
in that period in November 2015 okay so
we can also add more template files in
ourselves for specific content pages for
example say we make a page that is
really specific on the website and we
don't want it to have the same template
as all the other pages which is
controlled by this page dot PHP file
right here right we don't want it to
have the same template we can override
that and make a new template file in
here which is going to work just for
that page and we can do one just for the
front page and other things as well so
basically we have a lot of control when
it comes to deciding which template
files are going to be used for our
different pages and the modular fashion
by which WordPress runs makes it really
easy to do so if all of this seems a
little bit overwhelming for now don't
worry guys and we'll be going to step by
step through each part in more detail as
we start making our theme and I'm gonna
start in a very next lesson what I'm
going to explain exactly what this part
of the code the the loop is all about
okay so I'm going to go into detail
about that you have any questions about
this tutorial then please feel free to
drop a comment down below otherwise guys
I'm gonna see you in that very last one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
