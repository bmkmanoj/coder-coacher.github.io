application is to create our welcome
screen component and this welcome screen
is going to be a simple form which asks
the user for their name the enter their
name press Enter that will take them to
the chat component and when they add a
new chat the chat component is going to
know their name because of this welcome
screen so first of all you'll notice
I've already run NPM a run dev down here
which is why we have this local
development server running listening to
port 8 zero eight zero so now if we go
to this address we can see the dummy
application here in the browser cool the
next thing I'd like to do is to install
materialize CSS like we did in the last
chapter so we don't have to get bogged
down with all of our own CSS so I've
gone to materialise CSS comm forward
slash getting - starting dot HTML and
I'm gonna copy the mini 5 CSS library
right here just the top one we don't
need the JavaScript and I'll paste this
inside our index dot HTML file right
here just underneath this meta tag now
we also want Google icons so let's
scroll down here until we see HTML setup
then we want to grab this thing right
here Google icon fonts so if we copy
that and also paste that inside index
dot HTML just above materialised CSS so
if we save that now now we can use these
different utility classes and icons
inside our project cool ok then so now
let's start to create this component I'm
going to cross off the terminal it was
still running the background and inside
components instead of hello world we'll
rename this to welcome so welcome
like so now we've renamed that component
we're going to see this big error over
here and that's because the router file
is looking for the hello world dot view
component and we've just renamed that so
it doesn't exist anymore so let's update
our router file as well so if I just
right click on hello world and go to
change all occurrences I'll change this
to welcome instead so one two three four
now we're loading in the welcome screen
or the Welcome component when a user
goes to just
/so if we save this we should now see
the Welcome component which is still
this thing right here but if we go to
the Welcome component now we can get rid
of all of this dummy HTML we don't need
that anymore
get rid of that we also don't need this
data message and we can rename this to
welcome and finally let's get rid of
this CSS down here I also don't want to
use the scoped keyword right there
either okay so now we have this basic
component for our welcome screen the
first thing we'll do is change this
class right here to welcome and we'll
also add a class of container which is
that utility class from materialise
which brings everything into a central
column now the next thing we'll do is a
div with a class of card that is going
to make a little card on this screen
which is where we'll place our form so
inside this card we want some card
content so again another div with a
class of card - content this time and
we'll also give this another class
called sensor aligned so that's going to
align everything inside this to the
center all right then so inside this div
what would we like to output well we'd
like an h2 saying welcome or something
like that and also a form so let's do
the h2 first of all I'll give this a
class of teal text which is kind of like
a bluey green and then inside that we'll
say welcome underneath the h2 we'll do a
form and we don't need an action but
what we will do is attach an event to
this a submit event so we'll say at
submit we want to prevent the default
action which will refresh the page so
we'll say dot prevent to do that set
that equal to some function we'll call
this function enter chats now we've not
created that function yet we'll do it
after we've done our template so inside
the forum now first of all we want a
label and this label is going to be for
the name so we'll say enter your name
like so and then underneath that we need
an input field which will be of type
next the name of this input field is
going to be named and the v-model is
going to be equal to name
so when a user types into this input
field we want to sync it with a name
property over here on our object so
let's add a name property down there and
to begin with we'll set it to null when
they first land on the screen but as a
user types into this field it's going to
update over here as well okay finally we
need a button for user to click to enter
the chat to submit this form this button
will have a class equal to beat yet I'll
see you til atte class from aterial eyes
and also teal to give it that same color
as this thing over here by the way
whenever we say teal text that does the
text color whenever we just do teal or
the color itself that does the
background color okay that's the
difference between these two teal text
and teal okay so we want to say enter
chat in here so now when a user is
entering in a name into this input field
we're storing it right here when they
click on this button it's gonna fire
this thing over here and to chat prevent
the default action but we need to create
this enter chat method to grab the name
that that user has entered so underneath
data over here let's create that method
we do it in the methods property which
is an object and inside this is going to
be called enter chat this method okay so
in here what do we want to do well
eventually we want to take them to the
chat screen the chat component so
redirect them and we also want to pass
through the name that they've entered
right here which will be stored on this
object but for now all we'll do is
console dot log the name that they've
entered into that field so console dot
log and we'll say this dot name okay so
if we save this now and go to the
browser we should see this welcome
screen now there's a couple of things I
want to do first of all I want to take
off this logo and I also want to neaten
this chat welcome screen up a little bit
as well so first of all let's go to the
component because that's where the logo
is up top view and we can delete that
racket while we're in it let's get rid
of all this style as well we don't need
that okay save that and we should see
the logo disappear cool now we just want
to make this look a bit neater as well
so then let's go down to our style tags
inside the Welcome component down here
and just add in a couple of rules
first of all we'll get the Welcome div
which is a class of welcome this thing
at the very top and what we'd like to do
for this div is give it a max width
first of all or 400 pixels because I did
think it was a little bit wide on the
screen so I'm max with a 400 pixels now
we're also going to push it down from
the top of the window by saying margin
top is 100 pixels will also target the
h2 inside here because I think we just
need to address the text size so whoops
let's just zoom that down again we'll
say welcome h2 and then inside here
we'll give this a font size of 3mm let's
save that and see how it looks so far
okay looking a bit better but I'd like
to add a little margin between the
bottom here and the input field so
finally it will just say welcome button
and then inside here margin is going to
be 30 pixels top and bottom also left
and right okay so save that and this
looks a lot better now so let's just
make sure it works we'll inspect the
element so we can go to the console over
here and play this and if we type in a
name now and press Enter
we should see that logged to the console
which we do cool Mariam so now we have
this welcome screen the next step is to
grab this name right here redirect the
user to a chat component with that name
so we'll address that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
