in the dom tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how to create some
tabbed content Oh killing so we've
nearly completed the functionality of
this mini app but there's just one major
component I want to add and that is some
kind of tabbed content system at the
bottom so couple it ups when you click
on them it shows related content to that
tub so the first thing I want to do is
insert the HTML for this so let's go to
the index file and I'm just going to
paste this in I've copied it from my
repo which you can get so I'll just
quickly go through this we have a div
surrounding the whole thing right here
with an idea of tabbed content then we
have a ul at the top of the class of
tubs each Li represents a tub which you
can click on and then these divs down
here these are content panels each with
a class of panel they represent the
content that is going to show when you
click on a tab so each tab is
represented by each panel makes sense so
the way this is going to work is that
we're going to click on one of these Li
tags now we're going to listen out for
that event when we click on it we're
going to look for this data target
attribute so this is a custom data
target attribute and this right here has
a value of an ID so hash about an hash
contact so when we click this we're
going to grab this value and we're going
to look for this ID in one of the panels
so you can see this panel right here has
an ID of a bounce so the idea is that
when we click on this we want to show
this and we're going to do that by
grabbing this ID looking for this panel
and displaying it is block by default
panels are going to be displayed as none
so they don't show and only active
panels with this class of active will
have a display of block okay so we're
going to click on this find the target
then we'll give it the class of active
and let it display is block make sense
okay then so let's save this I just want
to go to these Styles first of all to
show you these Styles so the Li tags
which represent the tabs themselves just
style to make them look like a little
bottom then the panels have a display of
none by default then when they have a
class of
you've applied to them that displayed is
block right so let's hook up this
functionality now so the first thing I
want to do is grab a reference to both
of the taps and the panels right so two
different variables we need so let's
create a constant first of all called
tabs and set that equal to document dot
query selector
and then we're going to query the tubs
so this is the UL and the next thing we
need is a constant for the panel's and
we'll set that equal to document dot
query selector all this time and we're
going to look for the panels so let's
passing the panel plus so this one right
here is the UL and we're going to attach
an event listener to the UL which is
this thing surrounding the alight acts
now when we click on something the item
we click on is going to be the e dot
target the target element so we can
check whether that tag element is in
fact an Li if we wanted to we could
attach event listeners to both of these
things but instead I'm attaching it to
this and then checking what the target
element that was clicked is if it's an
ally then we're going to do something
okay so let's attach that event so we'll
say tabs don't add event listener and
the event is going to be a click event
and then outside here we're going to do
a function which is going to take in the
event object and inside this function
what do we want to do well first of all
we want to check if the target was the
Li did we click on an li tag so I'll say
if e dot target dot
tag name is equal to Li in capitals and
then we're going to do something right
if we didn't click on an alive we don't
want to do anything but if we did then
what we want to do is grab this thing
right here this data
- target attribute we want to know which
panel we want to show so let's grab that
so I'll say Const
and we'll name this target panel
and said that equal to document dot
query selector and the thing we want a
query is the target attribute right so
we'll say e dot target dot and we're
going to use a property now called data
set so what data set does is look for
Day two attributes so this right here is
a data attribute it's data
- then whatever name we give it we've
called it target so we can use the data
set to find that attribute and then
after data set we say dot whatever name
we've given to this data set I called my
target but if you called yours for
example data - beans then you'd use data
set beans to grab that value all right
so we're querying that now which is
equal to either about or contact like so
we're querying that in the Dom and it's
going to retrieve that panel so that's
the target panel that's the thing that
we want to show anything else we don't
want to show so right now what I want to
do is cycle through every single panel
check if the panel is equal to the
target panel if it is equal to the
target panel then what we want to do is
give it a class of active to say we want
to show that if it's not equal to the
target panel then we're going to remove
that class of active so it doesn't show
make sense
so let's cycle through the panels so
I'll say panels dot for each and I don't
need to turn panels into an array
because this method right here document
dot query select at all returns a node
list remember and that node list we can
use for each one so we'll say for each
and then pass in a function right here
and then for each iteration round we
want to pass in the individual panel so
what we're going to do now is check if
that panel is equal to the target panel
so I'll say if and then in brackets
panel is equal to target panel if that
is the case then we want to apply a
class of activity of the panel so what's
a panel class list add and then we want
to give it a class of active okay if
that's not the case if these two do not
equal each other then we'll need an else
statement so that we can take away that
class
it's also piled up Plus list not remove
and we're going to remove the active
class okay
so just to quickly run through it again
we're grabbing a reference to the tubs
which is the UL then we're grabbing a
reference to all of the panels then
we're attaching a click event listener
to the tabs that you well when we click
it we're finding out of the target that
we clicked the tag name of that target
was an Li if we did click an Li then
what we do is we grab the target panel
by seeing document query selector
passing in a target date to set up
target which is going to be this
attribute right here so either hash
about our hash contact so we grab it a
reference to that target element then it
was cycling through each of the panels
on the page we're checking Eve the panel
through that iteration is indeed the
target panel if it is then we're going
to add a class of active to that panel
if it's not we're going to remove a
class of active of that panel so let's
save it and check it out in a browser
over here so currently by default it's
on a bounce because we have a class
effective already associated with it in
the HTML you can see we give it a class
of active to start so if I go to the
contact tab we can see this content
changes down here if I go back it goes
to about and if we check in the Dom
itself in the code we can see down here
currently this is active if I click on
contact then we remove the class of
active from that div panel and add it to
this one if I go back then we add it to
the about one all right so there we go
that's how we can make a simple tab
system there's more we can do with this
for example we could style up these a
live text based on if they're active or
not etc that's up to you could have a
play around and do that if you like if
you do do anything feel free to share
the link down below and I'll take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
