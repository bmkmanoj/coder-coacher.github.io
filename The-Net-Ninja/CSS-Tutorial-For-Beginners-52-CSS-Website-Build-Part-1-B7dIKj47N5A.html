CSS for beginners at all SN 52 and this
is gonna be part 1 of a CSS website
build Wow
alright so these website build tutorials
are going to be split up into two videos
and to follow along with them to the
full extent you're probably going to
want to download the files I've already
created all right so that's the HTML
files all the image files and the
finished CSS file now I've uploaded them
for you guys here onto github so all you
have to do is come to this address I'll
pop that in the description down below
and then click this download zip button
right here that's going to download the
zip file with all the website files in
it you just unzip that on your computer
and hit presto you have the finished
product now you want to delete all the
CSS in that product from the style.css
file you can and will add it together
otherwise if you just want to follow
along and kind of tweak the design
yourself feel free to do that also it's
up to you but once you've downloaded
that join me back here and we'll start
making and this website Wow so it is
this is the website we're going to build
a nice respectable bike selling website
nothing wrong here and essentially you
can do this with everything I've told
you in this CSS playlist we're not going
to use any advanced features whatsoever
everything I've told you can be utilized
to make a webpage like this how cool is
that so I'm going to show you exactly
how to do that right now in the code
Wow alright class I'm back here in
brackets and what I've done is just put
a vertical or horizontal split on should
I say here so we've got a HTML at the
top and our CSS at the bottom
I've also click this little button here
which gives us a live preview in this
window that's a cool feature of brackets
so as I make changes here it's going to
automatically update over here so we can
see as we go along what is happening so
before we start I'm just going to
increase this font size a little bit so
you guys can see and I'll just quickly
go through the index file which is here
so we've just got a death simple head
with the title of bikes and that we've
linked up the style sheet there Danny
we've got this div ID a rapper
that's enclosing all the content on this
page and that's basically
going to just bring the content into a
middle column of like 980 pixels in
width or something like that
then within that we've got our nav of
main navigation that's all these links
here and you notice as I hover over some
of the elements I'll click some of the
elements it kind of highlights it over
here that's really cool but anyway
that's the main navigation with some Li
tags and some a text in there then we've
got this div ID of Li banner with an
image in it that's just this here then
the section with an idea of shop this is
a html5 element by the way as is this
now they're pretty cool elements just
semantic elements that's all within this
section of shop we've got a our product
image our name price the button and the
star rating and then right down at the
bottom of this page we've just got this
funky image of a bike which is here with
the idea of footer banner and god knows
what that block is there apparently it's
just going to make your bike even more
awesome so yeah that's the website all
right so let's start adding some styles
then now we're going to start with the
body tag because I want to give the body
tag some basic styles that are going to
be inherited throughout the document and
the first one is the font family and I'm
going to say I want everything on this
page to be Arial now we know through
inheritance that because I've give it to
the body that every tag within the body
is going to inherit that style therefore
everything should now be Arial these
links are and this text down here is
cool the next thing I want to do to the
body tag is give it a margin of 0 don't
want it to have a margin you see how a
budget up there to the left so we've
taken that away from it and the third
thing don't want to give to it is just a
background color and we're going to make
it a light gray which is just e te te
now a little trick if you've got six
letters here are numbers that are the
same we can shot on it down to three
that's exactly the same so I'll do that
and then we'll take a wrapper ID which
is just ideal wrapper and then this is
the one that I want to bring into a
central column so I'm going to give it a
width of 980 pixels and then remember
that little technique I showed here
where we st. Martin I want 0 for the top
and bottom and then our
for the left and right that centralizes
it remember that's all in my previous
tutorial on margins go and check it out
if you've not seen it the last thing I'm
going to do is give that a background of
whites which is just FFF so we've done
that and next I want to target this main
navigation section here which is going
to contain all of these links so I'll
just grab that main navigation and then
within that I want to give it a
background of like a really deep
charcoal gray which is gonna be one
eight one eight one eight okay cool you
can see the object on the right and then
I want to give you a padding of ten
pixels just to give it some space all
the way around like that there we go
cool so next we'll grab the UL tag
within the main navigation books and
just scroll down here a bit I'm gonna
say that that UL I want to align all the
text to the right that's gonna bring all
the links now over to this side I'm
gonna say also that I want the
list-style-type oops
it's a B not I remember that's gonna
take away those dots here so if you see
before I add that none you see those
dots there they come standard with list
items I've taken them away with that
prosti there and finally we'll say what
the margin right to be ten pixels just
to give it a bit more space on this side
okay the next thing I want to do is tag
those Li tags within the UL so the main
navigation again and then Li and this
time I want to say will display them in
line block because remember block
elements automatically take up this full
width here that's what they're doing
currently if we display them in line
block we're giving them the best of both
worlds we give this give them those
block level qualities so we can control
the box model properties but we also say
we want them to line up next to each
other
much like inline tax okay so we'll say
display inline
locked and that brings them all up next
to each other and we'll give each one of
those a margin-left 20 pixels let's go
to space them out a little bit
all right cool so now we've done that we
just need to target it let's bring this
down a little bit the egg tags within
those li so main navigation again we'll
say hey and we don't need to go like
this you well ally we don't need to get
really specific because these eight tags
are the only eight tags within the main
navigation so this will do fine and with
these we'll say we want to give those a
color of white which is FFF yet
text-decoration:none
this is going to take away those
underlining underlined rules underneath
feed the a links and then we'll say we
want to text transform and we're going
to make these other cakes and then
finally we'll give them a font size
let's do that properly okay there we go
font size of 14 pixels and in fact one
more thing I'm gonna give those a
padding of six pixels cool so they are
the links at the top of the page now now
I'm gonna do one more thing I'm gonna
skew up here and you see this class here
of Corin that's where we currently are
that's the pain to be robbed because
that's what this current class means now
I want to style this a little bit
differently so what I'm gonna do is make
a rule for that down here I'm gonna say
main navigation Hey and then the
classiest currents are your egg dot
current and that's gonna grab that a tag
with the class classic route and with
this I want to give it a different
background color I want to give it a
background of like that beige color you
saw on the finished product and the hex
code for that is eight f7 for if I could
remember this six C I think yep there we
go cool you can just see up here is
changed
and then let's give that a border-radius
as well let's give it a border radius
it's just a small one
or four pixels makes it look a bit
different alright so there we go guys
that is the head a little bit styled so
that's all I'm going to do for this
lesson believe it or not in the next
lesson I'm going to cover the rest of
this and we'll probably have it done in
five minutes I kid you not
and yeah I'll see you guys then for the
final version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
