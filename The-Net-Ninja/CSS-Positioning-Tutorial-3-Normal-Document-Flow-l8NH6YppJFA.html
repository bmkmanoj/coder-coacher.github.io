CSS positioning lesson 3 and in this
video I want to take a look at the
normal document flow Wow other than
going so the normal document flow is the
flow of elements on a web page how they
are presented before applying any kind
of positioning CSS to them alright so
we're going to have a look at that or
right now by just making some P tags
right here and in fact I've already got
this gangster lorem ipsum website up
it's low resolve NL because this is some
dope stuff and it just kind of proves
that you know down with the boys and
that bad shizzle so I'm gonna paste a
few paragraphs of that down here we've
got three insult I think that is going
to be enough alright so we'll save that
now and you can see those are presented
or right here on the right so already
normal document flow is in action right
you can see that the displaying one on
top of the other and that's how normally
elements are stacked on a web page
that's if they are block level elements
remember inline elements stack from left
to right block on top of the other all
right so now we could apply some little
Styles know positioning Styles by the
way just sort of color styles and that
kind of thing we'll give it a padding of
twenty eight pixels something like that
and then we'll give it a background
color of EEE give it a font family of
Arial and then we'll say the line height
of 1.4 m/s something like that and
that'll do you know you get the idea so
what we'll do now just refresh over here
and you can see this is all displayed
top to bottom and a lot of times guys
this is going to be enough you don't
need to mess around with all these
positional properties like position
relative or absolute or float these left
or flop them right because other times
you're just going to have columns of
content going from the top to the bottom
and I've done this for a lot of websites
where we've got a maybe a wrapper in the
middle keeping everything within that
central column and then just stacking
things one on top of the other and very
rarely sometimes do I need to use all
this
properties alright so before we get
bogged down with them I just want you to
take a look at the card that you're
doing in your web project and just say
to yourself what do I need to start
using all of these positional properties
or can I rely on the normal document
flow which is from top to bottom all
right so this has been a really quick
lesson just to really make you aware of
how elements are stacked on a web page
and that's block level elements by the
way just so you know when you're going
forward when you need to use these
positional properties so don't forget to
subscribe like and share guys and I'm
going to see you in the very next video
we're going to start looking at floating
elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
