bootstrap 3 less than 3 and in this
video we're gonna go over what the
bootstrap grid system is all about wow
that's so bootstrap comes with a 12
column grid system and that's pretty
common across a lot of different
frameworks and web designers now the
idea is that we add content into the
rows and the columns of this grid using
bootstraps inbuilt CSS classes and then
what happens is bootstrap takes care of
a lot of the responsive work for us so
we don't have to worry about making
media queries and controlling the width
of these elements on different devices
okay so for example I could split my
page into a sidebar in the right and a
main content area on the left and the
right sidebar could take up 4 columns
and the left content could take up 8
columns now that's 12 columns in width
in total so that takes up the whole
width of the page so we just say to
bootstrap look we want the sidebar our
four columns and the main content of
eight columns and it takes care of it
for us okay so this is typically what a
grid system looks like from a bird's eye
view so you can see they split up into
vertical columns like this each one of
these boxes here represents one column
in the bootstrap grid system and if you
add them all up you'll know that it
comes to 12 in total so that's 12
columns right now each one of these
going across represents a row in
bootstraps root system and this could be
a row of HTML elements in your web page
for example this could be a row right
here of thumbnail images and you want to
say well each thumbnail should take up
one column of space in the row okay so
that's what bootstrap is doing it's
displaying each thumbnail as one column
in a row or you might have three
slightly larger images that you want to
display as a third in each row so you
want three images in a row
and you want them to take up an equal
space of room so that's why you design
four columns of width for each image in
that room okay so that's what a grid
system is all about and as long as each
row adds up into twelve columns then it
will work perfectly fine alright guys so
I've been working away on the
and I've come up with what I think is
possibly the best design I've ever done
I think you'll agree but basically this
is just something to show you what I
mean by the grid system that bootstrap
uses so what I've done it's two examples
in yet
a sidebar example where on a web page
say we've got the main content here on
the left right and the sidebar on the
right now you'll notice these little
things I've written underneath it says
on large screens
I want the content to be eight columns
wide which is this wide right here so
this is taking all eight columns going
across like that okay and the sidebar
large screens is taking on four columns
so one two three four that's how it
currently looks but I say when it gets
to medium screens like tablets and
whatnot I want it to invert to six
columns wide on the left so slightly
smaller and then six columns wide on the
right so now they're equal in width so
it's getting a bit responsive and then
when it gets the small screens because
we're kind of running out of room screen
real estate what I want to happen is the
content to take up the full width which
is twelve columns wide and the sidebar
to take up to twelve columns in width as
well all right so let's just have a look
at that in action so we're currently on
large screens where this is four columns
wide and this is eight so if we move
down now to medium screens then you're
gonna notice in a second it's gonna jump
there we go now each one is six columns
wide okay which is this one right here
now when we get to small screens like
mobiles and whatnot now each one is
twelve columns in width okay so that's
the way the bootstrap works and I've
done no kind of responsive CSS it at all
all I've done is applied clacks ease to
these containers right here and
bootstrap is taking care of all the
responsive work for me the same goes for
this other example down below this
thumbnail gallery example imagine each
one of these are cool pictures rather
than just gray blobs and currently what
one is for each picture to take up two
columns so the six pictures right and
each one is taking up two columns in
width for desktop so that adds up to
twelve yes six times two but when it
gets down to medium screens like tablets
I've said hey I want this to now occupy
four columns in width each thumbnail
because screen real-estate is run out so
it's going to be a little bit bigger on
fabulous and then as we go down even
further it's going to go to six columns
in width
each thumbnail like that okay so pretty
cool like sake bootstrap is doing all of
the responsive heavy lifting for me all
I'm doing is having classes to these
elements and bootstrap is taking care of
the rest so it's really really cool so
like I say to make use of this grid
system that bootstrap provides us with
and to insert content into the columns
we have to code our page the way that
bootstrap wants us to we can't just cold
any old way and say hey you do the heavy
lifting
now it's not gonna work we have to code
it in a particular way and in order to
do this we have to understand the three
key concepts right the first one its
containers second one is rows and the
third one is columns now we've already
seen rows and columns a little bit but
containers surround the whole section of
row and columns if you want to use the
grid system you have to put it with it
in a container div okay then rows
represent the horizontal line of element
we've already seen those and columns
represent the horizontal space that each
element takes up for example two to four
columns of width or eight columns of
width or six or five whatever you want
it to be okay so they're the three key
components that we're going to look at
over the next three lessons and we're
going to start with containers so we
have any questions about this tutorial
