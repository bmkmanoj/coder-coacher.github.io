to your very first responsive design
tutorial and in this video we're just
going to go over what responsive design
is Wow okay guys so before you dive in
headfirst into one is quite possibly the
best responsive design tutorial out
there at the minute your practical I
want to know a couple of things and the
first thing a bare minimum you need to
know is hates Gmail and CSS so if you
don't know how to code up a website in
HTML and you don't know how to style it
using CSS then you probably want to
brush up your skills in those two areas
first of all now I've got tutorial
playlists on both of those things on
this channel so I'll leave the links to
those down below the second thing you
might want to know is JavaScript and a
bit of jQuery and this is beneficial but
not essential and it's going to be
beneficial for when we start adding
additional functionality for our website
on mobile devices such as a touch
drop-down menu or something like that so
why the hell do we need a responsive
site anyway well people are going to be
viewing websites these days on many
different devices whether that's a phone
or a tablet or the desktop or even a
watch Channel and basically it's our job
as developers to make sure that when
they view that website it's going to be
easy to use and easy on the eye
no matter what device their view and get
on there for we're going to make our
websites responsive and this just means
that the design will respond to the
specification or the width or the height
of the device now responsive design is
not something that should be an
afterthought or some kind of sign order
to your desktop website right it should
be thought about from the very start
now when responsive design first emerged
and people started viewing websites on
mobile phones then a lot of people just
had static desktop websites and they'd
employ someone to come in and say hey
look you need to make this responsive so
it looks good on a mobile phone and
because it's already been coded for a
desktop then a lot of the time we'd have
to Hackett the code to make it look
halfway decent alright so that's why we
don't want it to be an afterthought we
want to start thinking about it from the
start we want to think hey what device
or what devices are our users going to
be looking at this website on okay and
if they're going to be
kinetic from phones or tablets or
anything like that then you need to
think of responsive design from the very
start so that we can plan our content
efficiently with all devices in mind and
we don't have to hack at the code when
we come to make it more responsive ok
and responsive design is very very
important
there's tons of new devices coming out
every day like I say which allow users
to browse and websites so it's no longer
just the norms of you assigning a
desktop look I've got a girlfriend who
uses a phone all the time to watch a few
websites on right she barely ever goes
onto a desktop or a laptop so if she
doesn't like the look of a website on
mobile she said give it a second chance
on desktop so it's very important that
if you want people to view your website
on mobiles then you need to make it look
good people and not forgiving these days
they'll probably give your website 10
seconds and if you can't use it they'll
never come back all right so if you
don't make your website very mobile
friendly you're going to miss out on a
big chunk of viewers viewing your
website or potentially viewing your
website so this is what the playlist is
going to look like first of all we're
going to take a look at an example of a
responsive site so you can see if your
own eyes what it's going to do then
we're going to talk about the tools that
we need to make a responsive site and
they are the meta viewport tag and the
media queries so we're going to go into
those into Soumik depth then we're going
to start building a simple responsive
web site from scratch so we're going to
code up the HTML and CSS and make it
responsive okay then finally we're going
to take a quick look at responsive
images in the future of responsive
images and then finally add some
responsive frameworks and grids alright
guys that's it for this quick
introduction and don't forget to
subscribe share and like and I'll see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
