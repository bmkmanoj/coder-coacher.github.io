PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 8
and in this video I want to show you how
we're gonna style the header Wow Arlen
gangster first things first I just want
to put a horizontal split on this
brackets right here so that I've got the
HTML at the top and the CSS at the
bottom so what I'm going to do to do
that is go to view and I'm going to go
to horizontal split like that and I'm
gonna move the style into the bottom and
the index is in the top so now we've got
the HTML there and the style at the
bottom and as you can see I've just put
a little comment in the bottom of the
reset saying n CSS reset so I know where
their style ends and mine begin so next
thing I'm gonna do is start standing up
listing or with to the right so we're
just going to concentrate on the header
for now and the first thing I want to do
is make that wrapper to make it a
vertical column alright so I'll do that
generally speaking what I normally do is
put the elements that I'm going to use a
lot through the document near the top up
here
all right so we'll target that wrapper
and we'll say it's got a width of 100%
and then a max width of 960 pixels
that's going to make that columns 960
pixels wide at most but then when the
screen goes below 960 pixels it's going
to make it 100% right next thing we want
to do is make it a margin of 0 and auto
and that's going to make that column
kind of sit centrally so if we
fullscreen this now you can see that
central column right down here the image
isn't within that and we'll sort that
out in the next video but for now you
can see everything else is within that
central column cool so next thing we
want to do is concentrate on they head a
bit so we need to give you that kind of
charcoal gray background if we look in
the Photoshop file you can see there
it's got this kind of dark charcoal gray
background and we can grab that from
here the hex code okay and we'll give it
that background so we'll say header
oops
background and that's the hex code and
closed up so that now when we view this
in the browser you can see it's all very
good alright cool so the next thing I
want to do is a little trick that's
gonna stop floats from messing this
thing up in fact I'll come back to this
not show you this in a second all right
so next thing I want to do is style that
logo and we're gonna give this a
background property which is gonna be an
image so we'll say URL and then the URL
of the logo is in the images folder for
slash logo dot PNG alright so now you
can start to see that here now we don't
want it to repeat so we'll specify don't
repeat there as well then the properties
of this is something like high of 70
pixels and a width oops a width of about
280 pixels
cool we're also going to float that to
the left so that the navigation can
scoop up as well I'm going to float that
to the right in a second all right and
so what next we need to do the h2 we
need to hide that so let's say header
now in fact that's within the logo so
we'll say text indent minus 10,000
pixels and that's gonna scoot that way
off the screen over here so no one can
see now cool okay so the next thing we
want to do is grab this navigation right
here and we're gonna float that over to
the right so header nav float right yeah
and also we want to give it a margin top
property about 30 pixels bring it down a
little bit and then we're gonna star the
links themselves so we'll copy this in
fact what we gonna do is jump back up to
this little trick you know like I talked
about this header after a minute ago
this is
what this is gonna do you see how that
kind of charcoal gray backgrounds gone
now
that's because we're using floats and
what happens when we use floats within
an element is that element collapses
alright so now it's seen that element as
a height of zero so it's not showing
that check or background but this is a
cool trick to kind of escape those
floats so that it does show alright we
need to use our header because that's
where the float are then add a pseudo
class of after know we didn't that I'm
gonna say content is nothing but we're
giving it some content it's just an
empty string and then we're going to say
display these content as a block and
then we just say clearly both because
that's how we fix floats we play both
yet or left all right and that's going
to bring this back to normal
cool so the next thing I want to do is
star there's links and they white source
it cooler
FFF text-decoration:none because they're
not underlined and then we'll say
font-family:arial alright now we want to
get rid all of that h2 right there so
I'll say header now h2 I'm gonna give it
a height of 0 so that it takes up no
space whatsoever and then I'm gonna say
text indent minus 10,000 pixels again
security right off the screen so don't
can see it alright so we want these
links to this place side by side not one
sorry not one on top of the other so to
do that we have to grab these allies
right here and float them to the left of
each other so they're all going left to
right so let's get heading out again
li and we're gonna float these to the
left awesome and I want to give them a
margin left of 20 pixels like that and
then we also want to style these things
right here remember these buns these
little green things in between
link's I wanna star though so that the
dead in the center and the green so I'll
say header nav span then I'm gonna make
these green color green now give them a
margin left of 20 pixels cool and then
one more thing they want to do this is
right up against the edge over here so I
want to give it a slight margin to the
right and that would be here the hole
now I'll say margin right I'll just give
it a 10 pixel margin like that scoots it
away a little bit all right then so that
is the head of salty the vacuum over
here and it's by mister full review you
can see now in fact let me just get that
blue box away to click somewhere else
now I'll expand you can see now there is
the header yeah pretty cool and I'll
show you the PSD file let's get rid of
those things let me go zoom in a little
bit and now you can see the header okay
not identical then we use the slightly
different font and it might be a
different shade of green but to be
honest I'm not bothered about this
there's no client at the end of this I'm
just showing you guys how I would make
HTML file and CSS file from PSD so now
you can see this is pretty similar and
yeah we could tweak it and use the
correct fonts etc I'm not going to do
that in this tutorial I'm just going to
show you the general procedure I go
through so now see you for the header if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below I'll
answer any questions otherwise guys
