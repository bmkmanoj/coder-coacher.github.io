PSD to WordPress a lesson 8 and in this
video we're gonna install a server PHP
and my sequel on our computer Wow okay
then go so WordPress is written in PHP
and it also uses a database management
system called my sequel now by default
most home computers don't come installed
with these so we're gonna have to
install them ourselves for WordPress to
run locally on them so we're going to do
that and we're going to also have to
install a server on our computer as well
because PHP is a server-side language
which means it needs a server to run um
so we'll install PHP my sequel under
server on our computer using a stuck
called whump and one just stands for
windows apache my sequel and PHP so
we're gonna do that right now
okay then guys so what you want to do is
head over to one server comm I'll leave
the link in the description down below
and then just click start using one
server now you can download one of two
versions the 32-bit version or the
64-bit version and that depends on what
bit your computer is if you don't know
all you have to do is search for my
computer right click it and go to
properties it's going to tell you under
system type mine's a 64-bit one so I
went ahead and downloaded the 64-bit one
so download whichever one you need and
then what you want to do is just double
click the Installer go along with all
the installation instructions just keep
everything default and then at the end
of it what you want to do is come down
to your system tray and you should see
this little green icon which when you
hover over it says one server now it
should be green which means it's online
and if yours is red it means it's
offline if it's red what I would suggest
first is just going to start our
services or restart all services to see
if it goes green if it doesn't then most
likely another program on your computer
is using the port that one server needs
right and that's port 80 now to test
that what you want to do is go to a
patch here which is the server go to
service and then test port 80 now mine
says here that port 80 is actually used
by server
which is fine so one piece using port 80
if another program is using port 80 on
your computer it's gonna tell you which
program that is here so you'll have to
go into that program mess around with
the settings so that it listens to a
different port so you can use one server
alright so once you've done that head
over to this again click it and go to
restart our services and hopefully guys
it's going to turn green so there's
another couple of things I want to show
you the first thing is this
www.directbynet.com
file with roll-up when we go to our
localhost in our browser right now what
I'll do and by the way you might have
different files here should be three
files by default it doesn't really
matter because we're going to overwrite
them later when we install WordPress but
yet these are the files that going to
get thrown up when we go to the server
address and to do that what we need to
do is go to localhost so this is going
to the root of our directory and it's
getting that index.php file and it's
throwing up this default PHP file that
comes with one now yours might look a
little bit different if you've got a
different version installed don't worry
about that whatsoever because like I
said we're going to override this later
on okay so that's the localhost which is
gonna serve up our files I've shown you
the directory where we're going to store
our files I just want to show you one
more thing which is the PHP myadmin now
this is just a graphical interface for
my sequel okay so it's a lot easier to
manage databases if you're not familiar
with sequel commands or anything like
that just log in you don't need to
password just click go and then this is
the interface for my sequel so we're
going to be using this a little bit
later on when we setup a database for
our WordPress site but for now if you
have any questions whatsoever guys feel
