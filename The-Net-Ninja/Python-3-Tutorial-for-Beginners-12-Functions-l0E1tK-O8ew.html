twelfth Python 3 tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about functions ok
then so now we know the basics all the
data types and control flow what I want
to do is currently set out and go
through something which i think is a
little bit more exciting functions so
what the functions allow us to do well
they basically allow us to create a
block of code which can be used and
called upon whenever we need it later on
in our code so I think the best way to
demonstrate this would be to go through
a couple of examples so we're going to
jump straight in and create our first
function now let's create a function in
Python what you need to do first of all
is say def that stands for define then
we give our function a name I'm going to
call this one Greeks because I'm super
original then we follow it up with a set
of parentheses then have colon then
underneath indented is going to be our
code block so what do we want to do when
this function is called for now I'm
going to keep this really simple and I'm
just going to print something out to the
console I'm going to put out hello world
surprise surprise okay so now we need to
call this function if we want to invoke
its functionality the way we do that is
by saying greet the function name and
then add it on parenthesis at the end
these parentheses say we want to invoke
that function so if we save it now and
run the file is called functions dot py
we see hello world printed out to the
console and the cool thing is now that
we've defined this function we can call
upon it as many times as we want so if I
truly want you I could print this out as
many times as I wanted you so we get it
5 times now awesome all right so that's
well and good but what if I want to
maybe pass some data into the fortune
well I can do that so I'm going to get
rid of these dudes and I'll get rid of
this print statement as well now if we
wanted to pass data into the function we
can specify the data or the parameters
that we want to pass through into the
function or right here so say I want to
pass through a name and also the time of
day well I'm going to specify a
parameter called name and also a time
parameter now we can have as many
parameters in here as you want exam a
third and fourth etc let's just keep it
simple for now and have two parameters
so these parameters are basically
variables which we pass into the
function when we call it which we can
then access within this function so now
if I wanted to I could output something
to the console using print and I could
use a formatted string and output these
variables so first of all made and then
time but I mean this makes no sense just
to output the variable so instead what
we'll do is we'll say good time name and
basically that means if they pass in a
variable for time which is like morning
and they name which is shown it will say
good morning Sean and then we'll say
hope you are well ok so now we have our
Greek function and we can call it down
here and passing it these two parameters
so the name is gonna be shot and at the
time is going to be morning so let's
save that and run it again now we get
good morning Sean hope you are well so
we've substituted in these variables
into this string so we can output them
we've accessed these parameters that
we've passed in and when we call it
awesome right ok let's make this a
little more interactive I'm going to ask
the user for their name and the time of
day so name variable is equal to input
and then we're going to ask the user
enter your name and then underneath that
time is going to equal to input enter
the time of day and then we're going to
pass these two variables that the stored
in them and time in here name and time
so by the way these two variables here
don't need to be called the same as
these things I could have call this x
and y and passing x and y here the only
thing that matters is the order we have
to put in a name first then the time
because that's the order would be fine
here in the function so we're passing
these two variables in to this function
so whatever you use input is going to
get output right here
so let's run it and find out enter your
name Sean and to the time of day night
so good night Sean hope you are well
perfect
so we've created now this function which
is a bit more interactive if you like
but I want to show you something what
happens if we don't pass in any
parameters even though we're expecting
something right here
well I'm going to save this I'll clear
the console and run the file again
enter your name Sean time of day night
and we get an error because we're
calling this function greet but we're
not passing anything in and it says
right here greet is missing two required
positional arguments name and time so we
have to pass those in the comment needs
out for a minute because we're ugly
users yet and what I want to do now is
show you how you can get around this
error so we can use what's known as
default parameters so in case the user
or whoever is calling this function does
not pass in any variables any parameters
a name at a time we can set these to be
a default parameter just for that
instance so we'll set this equal to
first of all a name will say array and
then the time can be mine so I'll save
this again and one again
and this time we get good morning value
hope you're well so even though we're
calling this function without passing
through any parameters it's still
running perfectly using these parameters
as the default so that's how we get
around that
so if we do pass anything in here for
example Sean and afternoon
these will overwrite these things and we
can see that if we run a file so we get
Sean and afternoon so when we pass stuff
through it overrides them all the way it
defaults to these things now what if we
want to just pass one thing through well
we could say name equals Sean and we're
saying here we're passing through the
name but we're not passing through the
time and the name is equal to Sean
so if I save that and run it again then
we get good morning Sean hope you're
well so it's defaulting to marnet but
sean is replacing the name awesome so
there's a couple of basic examples now I
want to go through something which maybe
is a little more practical now I want to
create a function which is going to
calculate the area of a circle so let's
define this function first of all we'll
define it and call it area and set that
to calculate the area so how do you
calculate the area of a circle well it's
just going to be PI R squared so three
point one four two times radius times
radius now obviously what we need to do
is pass this radius into this function
as a
ramit because we're going to need it to
calculate it right here now what we
could do is print this like so and it's
going to print that calculation
so now let's call it will call area
we're going to pass in a radius of five
so let's clear the console a game and
run this function zui file now we get
the area of the circle output to the
console seventy eight point five five so
this is working cool again what if we
want to give the user some interactivity
we'll ask for the radius so so radius
equals input and then insightly will say
enter a radius cut out type in a minute
all right save that and now what we want
to do is turn this into an integer
because when a user input something it's
stored in variable remember it's stored
as a string and we're working the
numbers here we want to perform some
calculations so we're going to turn this
into an integer lexer and then we're
going to call the area function again
but this time passing the radius that
the user entered so let's run this enter
a radius five and we still get that
seventy eight point five five awesome
okay so now what if I want to also
calculate the volume and let's just say
we have the circle which we've
calculated the area we want to calculate
the volume of a cylinder now the
equation for that is the area of the
circle times the length of the cylinder
so again let's just ask the user for the
length first of all so we'll say length
is equal to int we need to typecast this
again input and then enter a length okay
so let's save that now and define our
volume function so I'll say def the
vault per volume and that's going to
take in an area and it's also going to
take in a length because it needs to
multiply the area by the length so down
here what we're going to do is print
area times length
okay so now we have our volume function
set up we also have our area function
set up now how is this going to work
well first of all what we're doing is
we're working out the area now all
that's doing is printing to the console
but really what we want to do is use
that result inside this function because
we pass in the area right here so
instead of printing what we can do is
return a value and the way we return a
value is by using the return keyword and
then this now will be returned okay so
when we call this function we're
returning the results of this so really
what we want to do is store that return
we want to store it in a variable I'm
going to call it area equals or rather
area calc is equal to the area function
okay so now we have this calculation of
the area so we can call atom volume
function you can say vault and then
passing the area so that's fairly
account and also we want to passing
their length which the user inputs so
we'll copy that game and paste it in and
there as well so let's run this so far
and hope that it works
so we'll say a radius of service also a
length of eight and now we get this back
for the volume awesome so this is
working now I want to show you one more
thing we can pass functions into
functions as a parameter if you like so
for example instead of storing this in a
variable and passing it in here what I
could do is instead just place this
directly in here like this and we can
delete that then we're eliminating a
little bit of code and this is still
going to do exactly the same thing and I
proved that so functions dot P white
enter radius seven again and eight and
now we still get the same result
all right so there we go guys that is
your introduction to functions we're
going to be using them heavily as we go
along so don't worry if you don't
understand them 100% oh sure we are
going to be using them much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
