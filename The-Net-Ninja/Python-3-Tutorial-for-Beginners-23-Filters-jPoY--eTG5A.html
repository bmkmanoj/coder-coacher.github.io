23rd Python 3 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about filters so
filters give us an easier way to take
your collection and filter out some of
the values based on a function result
and this gives us a new filter
collection so what do I mean by this
well imagine you had a conveyor belt and
you also had a list of numbers and you
put this list of numbers all the numbers
within it on this conveyor belt and on
this conveyor belt these individual
items these numbers they run through a
function and this function performs some
kind of test on each item on each number
in this list and if this test returns
true then that number is going to remain
in this filtered list if that test on
the number of returns false then it's
going to get that number and discarded
it's going to filter it out and it won't
remain in the filtered list
so in essence with filtering numbers out
of this original list into the new
filtered list make sense cool let's go
through an example so what I'm going to
do is set up a list of grades and let's
say I got an A and I also got B and I
also got an F oh dear
and I've got to see some else and then I
go an another F and maybe I don't know
another 8 ok so I've got these great now
really I don't want to be showing my X
to my parents or my friends I want to
filter these F out of these grades right
I want to tamper with them and make them
look better than they actually are so
the way we're going to do this is by
using the filter method and filter is
very similar in its setup to map in that
we have the filter method and then we
have some kind of testing function all
right tests each individual item and
then the grades themselves the list
right so each one of the items in the
grade list is passed through this
testing function and this testing
function is go return true or false for
every grade is passed through it and if
the grade passes the test and it returns
true then that's going to stay in the
new for
to the list if it doesn't pass the test
and it returns false this function then
it's going to be filtered out of the
list so obviously I want to return true
for everything except F and I want to
return false
for F so it gets filtered out so let's
then define this function this filter
function so we'll say yes it's going to
be called removed underscore fails so
each time around we're passing the grade
in so we want to return true or false
now we want to return true if it's not
an F makes sense and false if it isn't
it so we're going to say returned and
then we're going to grade is not equal
to F all right so this means that it's
not equal to so if Grady's a for example
grade is not equal to F this whole
statement will return true because
that's right a is not equal to F same
for B same for C etc but if this grade
is F then F not equal to F is false
because F is equal to F so then this is
going to return false and it's going to
return false right here therefore F will
get filtered out but everything else is
going remain make sense so now we need
to pass this testing function which is
called remove fails into this filter so
let's paste it right in there and then
also we need to typecast this into a
list so first of all I'll print it as is
and show you so I'm going to print the
result of this save it I'm going to run
Python then it is called filters dot py
and you can see we get a filter object
back now we want a list we want a new
list not a filter object so I'm going to
typecast this into a list and surround
the whole filter method with parentheses
so that when this file again and now we
get that new list with the F filtered
out pretty cool right so there are other
ways of doing this we don't have to use
this filter method right here so I'm
going to show you as normal the way to
do it using a for loop and also how to
do even comprehension so using a for
loop
first of all we're going to create a new
list called filters underscore grades
this can be equal to this empty list at
the minute okay now we need to loop
through the original grade so I'm going
to use this for loop so it's hid for
grade in grades and then in here I'm
going to check if the grade is not equal
to F against or say if grade is not
equal to F so for example if it's a or B
or C then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to append whatever grade were on
to the filtered grades so I say filtered
now in capitals filtered on the scroll
grades
dr. tends and then whatever grade we're
currently iterating through so that is
going to append this to this thing right
here but it is F then it's not going to
append it makes sense cool so now let's
just print filtered grades to see this
works okay save that and run the file
and still it works but I think you'll
agree that this right here is a lot
easier to write takes less lines of code
than all of this right here so that's
how we do it using a for loop anyway I'm
also going to show you how to do it
using a comprehension so let's just
cover all that junk out and use a
comprehension again I'm going to print
the result of this and then inside we
have our comprehension so how is this
going to work well first of all we want
to output the grade right that's what
we're outputting each time around as the
first thing we do in a comprehension
then we say what would cycling through
and it's going to be full grade in
grades and also we want to attach an if
statement at the end because if grade is
not equal to F that's when we add it in
right so we'll say if grade is not equal
to F so we're only adding the grade in
when this thing is true so when grade is
not equal to F make sense by the way if
you need a refresher on these it's about
three tutorials but just go and check it
out this is comprehension so let's run
this again
you see we get exactly the same result
so all of these three thing is doing
pretty much the same thing but I quite
like this filter method because again
it's not many characters and it's just
easy to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
