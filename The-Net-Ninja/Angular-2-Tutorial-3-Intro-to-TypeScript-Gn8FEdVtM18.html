third angular2 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to give you a very quick
introduction to typescript alright so as
I've already mentioned in a previous
tutorial we are going to be using
typescript to write our applications in
this series so as such a thought it best
to give you a very quick primer of
typescript or at least of a couple of
the areas we're going to be using more
often when it comes to typescript so all
it is is a superset of JavaScript and in
that sense it is a very similar to
writing JavaScript with just a few
additional extras thrown in and a couple
of those which we're going to look at
are types and classes although it does
have more as well so when we're working
with regular JavaScript we can declare a
variable like this my var equals a
string and then later on in the program
we could say my var equals 25 now a
number now in typescript we cannot do
that we cannot change the type of a
variable if we declare a variable my bar
equals a string and it is off type
string then we cannot later then assign
a number to that same variable this is
not allowed okay now when we declare a
variable we can also declare the type of
that variable in typescript as well we
don't have to but we often do for
example if we want to declare a variable
which is a string we could say the
variable name colon then string which is
the type and then set it equal to a
value same for a number just colon
number equal to 20 and say for a boolean
and any other type as well we also have
this any type which basically means this
variable we don't know what it's going
to be yet it can be any type so in the
future we could say equal to a number if
we wanted and if we want to set it to an
array we just say colon then the type in
that array for example number then the
empty brackets like that or it could be
string empty square brackets another
edition in typescript which we are going
to use a fair amount in this tutorial
series our classes and classes are very
simple it's just like setting up an
object in JavaScript we could have a
class which is car and then we give that
class properties such as this one wheels
which is a non
we're typing right here and that's equal
to four and we can also give it
functions or methods in this case it's
called drive and it just logs the
carriage driving to the console so then
we can create a new car by declaring a
variable my car and setting it equal to
the car type we're typing right here
because this is now a type and setting
it equal to a new car instance we can
also use constructor functions in
classes when we're passing in data to
the class so for example we want to make
a new instance of this car class and we
want each car to have a different speed
so we can pass that speed into the
parentheses when we create a new car
then it's taken in this constructor
function within the car you can see
right here is taking a variable miles
per hour and that's a type number that's
what it's expecting which is what we're
passing it right here then we're seeing
this top speed equals miles per hour
whatever we passed in here so then we've
already declared speed up here to be of
type number so this variable or this
property on this instance of the car
will be assigned this 70 value okay okay
so there we go that is your whirlwind
tour of typescript and I know I've only
kind of scratched the surface here but
really you do not need to know much more
when we're making these applications in
angular 2 at least to begin with and
anything else that we do do in
typescript that's not the same as
JavaScript I will point out on go
through it as well
so any questions feel free to leave
those down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial where we're going to take a
look at the core files that we created
earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
