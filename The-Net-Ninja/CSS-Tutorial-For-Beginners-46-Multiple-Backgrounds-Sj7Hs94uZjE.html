CSS for beginners lesson 46 and in this
video we're gonna take a look at
multiple backgrounds Wow okay then gang
so we're here in the code and a little
bit of changed since the last lesson
I've taken up all the content and
replaced it with this single div here
that's got an idea of bunin I've got a
rule for that banner here and I've given
it a background color of gray a width of
100% under height of 300 pixels these
comments here are just a couple of links
to pictures I'm going to use in this
video so before we do anything in the
code I want to show you what this
currently looks like in the browser and
there it is just a simple gray
background on that banner so we're going
to look at using multiple images for the
background image property and the way we
do this is by simply saying background
image as normal and then we supply two
values here we do it exactly the same we
say URL and then we pass in a value
close our parentheses then we do a comma
very important and we do URL again and
we pass in our second image in those
parentheses then we close all off with a
semicolon
so that's two immunities now two
background images and I just want to
talk about a couple of things here the
first thing is this comma here that's
very important okay can't stress that I
know if you don't use that then it's not
going to work at all it's a comment
illuminated list it has to go after
every image except the last one the
second thing is the image order matters
the one that comes first is going to be
at the top of the stack the one that
comes last is going to be at the bottom
of the stack so this is going to display
this top one over the bottom one okay so
we've done our images there the next
thing I want to do in fact first of all
will view this in the browser let's
refresh here and there we go we've got
this background image here this kind of
cold in the background and we've got
this net ninja logo repeating on and on
okay that's too much we're gonna make
some edits to this you can see here also
this little bit here is where the
background image this code is repeating
itself okay so we need to sort this out
so we'll jump back to the code and we'll
start apply some different properties to
this the first thing I want to do is get
rid of those multiple repetitions of the
images so we're going to say background
repeat' I will say no-repeat comma
no-repeat what's in here is this one
this value before the comet applies to
the first image this value applies to
the second image and we're separating
them again with Dada a comet okay very
important however because they're both
no repeat these values are both the same
we don't necessarily need this comet so
I can take that out and we don't need
the second value that one value if
there's no other values there will apply
to both of these image images rather so
look at our background repeat' property
next we're going to say background
position and the first one I want to
Center so I'm just gonna write center
that's going to Center it vertically
oops
no it's going to Center it vertically
and horizontally then I've done my
comment and then the second image I want
to place in the top left if I can spell
there we go that's the Banat the
background button
so we've centered our image on the
foreground and we've put our background
image on the top left now I'm going to
say background sally's and the logo the
first one I want to give it a width of
300 pixels I'm going to put a comma and
then I'm going to say 100% for this
other image here and that's because I
want to take up the full width of that
gray background
all right there so let's save that and
view this in a browser refresh here cool
that is just what I wanted so we've got
this background image here of the code
now which is full width doesn't repeat
then this logo in the middle centrally
aligned doesn't repeat and
300 pixels in width perfect so that
they're the friends is how we use
multiple background images if you have
any questions about this feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those otherwise if you enjoyed these
