very first of ux tutorial okay and so if
you're learning of UX and guessing you
already know the basics of view jealous
otherwise this course is pretty
pointless if I'm honest if not don't
worry a good whole playlist on / UJS for
beginners so if you want to check out
that first of all feel free to do so the
link is popping out right about now on
your screen then come back here to learn
of UX so then what is of UX well
basically it's a library we can use with
UJS which is going to help us with state
management within our applications so
what state exactly well you can think of
state as the data you use in your
applications
so I guess state management is just how
we manage that data so what few x is
going to do is help us to manage our
state our data within applications more
effectively especially when it comes to
large applications with a lot of shared
data so it allows us to do this by
creating a centralized data store which
we can store all of our data in which
can then be accessed by all components
in the app so this central store is
sometimes known as a single source of
truth within the application so we have
our store with all the shared data in it
and we have our components which can
access that data as well so let's just
go back to a standard of UJS application
and how this looks without using view x
so we could have some kind of to-do
application right and we've got a route
review file right here route component
then we've got two different components
nested within that a dashboard view and
a to-do list view right and then beneath
those we have more child components the
latest - duze which is gonna be shown in
the dashboard and also a section to add
a new to do within the to-do list that's
a component as well so say we're storing
the data up here all the different to do
items on this route component then if
these two components this one right here
which shows it and this one right here
which shows the data if they both want
to use that data what we need to do is
pass that data down as props to the
different components down the chain
where we need it right
and then we can access the data within
those components now if we want to
change this data we're going to add a
to-do for example what we're going to do
is fire n events from this component
which fires up the chain to this
component then to this component which
is going to listen out further events
it's going to change the data then it's
going to pass the updated data back down
as props to the components which need it
so this looks a little long-winded but
for small applications it's not so but
but essentially what we're doing is make
it really hard for children components
to communicate with each other right
because I have to go this long-winded
way around so view X kind of takes that
away from us
we don't need to do that anymore because
we have this central store so in a view
X application is going to look something
like this we have one central store of
data right here which is storing the
to-do items and it can be accessed by
any component directly which needs it
right does it have to be passed down as
props through component chains it can be
accessed directly using what's known as
guesses we'll take a look at those later
up then if we want to make a change to
the data for example from this component
we can fire off some kind of action
which is to perform a mutation to the
data then as soon as the data has been
mutated ie changed then it's going to
update in whichever component is using
it so all shared data is going to go
inside this central store and it can be
updated by different components when it
needs to be via mutations and then
updated in any component which uses it
so this is a much easier way to kind of
share and distribute data in the
application that's not to say we can't
store data outside of this central store
we can do if there was just data that
was used in this component and nowhere
else we can still define it right here
and use it that but any shared data
which is used between components we
generally pop in the store like this we
have one central location for all of the
data and that is the crux of view X so
before we start writing any code
whatsoever I want to show you just two
tools I'm going to be using in this
series the first one is a
text editor called Adam which is my
favorite text editor at the minute it's
really cool free and it can customize
the hell out of it you can find it at
i/o and download it by pressing this
button right here so hopefully you'll do
that the second one is commander or CMD
R you can find that at CMD er net again
the link is going to be down below this
is a command line tool which is in my
opinion better than the Windows one it
also comes along with get bundled into
it as well so feel free to download that
as well now of course because I'm super
brilliant I am going to be providing you
with all of the course files for every
single lesson in this series so you can
find that in the view X play list on my
github account and if you want to for
example see the code on lesson 5 just
select the lesson 5 brunch right here
and you're going to see that code right
here alright so what I want to do now is
set up a basic view j/s application and
to do that we're going to use the view
CLI so I'm going to leave these links
down below as well this is the
repository for the view CLI project now
to install this on your computer it's
dead simple all you want to do is open
up your console hopefully commander and
type this in right here NPM install - G
view CLI and by the way to do this
you're going to need NPM installed as
well which means you have to head to
know James dogs to download that ok
also has rather complex it's really not
in fact I'll show you now so you want to
go to node.js org and then you can see a
big green download button right here you
can download this one all this one what
that's going to do is install the NPM
node package manager for you as well and
that is what we're going to use to
install this view CLI all right so you
want to do NPM install - gee meaning
we're installing it globally view CLI so
that's going to install the view CLI
which is going to enable us to create a
fresh view project using this command
line interface right here alright so I'm
going to do that right now okay so once
you've installed the view CLI using NPM
we can then use the view CLR to create a
new view project so the way we're going
to do that is by first of all navigating
to the die
you want to create this project game so
my intention documents my websites then
recording now to create this new view
project using the view CLI all we need
to do is save you then in it to
initialize a new project then we need to
give this a project template now I'm
going to use the word pipe - simple one
there's different templates as well you
can find those on the view CLI
repository if you want to read more
about them then we need to say the name
of this project I'm going to call this a
view X - playlist now if I press ENTER
this is probably going to say this
directory already exists because I've
created an empty folder called view X
playlist and continue yet that's fine so
this is going to download the template
now and then when it's done it's going
to ask you a series of questions about
this project so first of all the project
name that's fine
project description yet that's fine as
well the email address you SAS I don't
want to in this case and it's going to
generate that for you this project and
we can see all of these files now have
appeared on the left inside this
directory which is cool right
so to get started it says first of all
we have to CD into this directory CD
just stands for change directory so
we'll say CD and then going to the view
X - playlist directory then we need to
run npm install and what that's going to
do is install all the dependencies for
this protest so if we have a look in
package Jason you can see down here we
have these different dependencies view
and all these different get dependencies
so what npm install is going to do is
install all of these dependencies for us
so let us run up npm install and i'm
going to see you on the other side okay
so once all of that is installed the
final thing we need to do is say npm run
dev and that's got a release application
in development mode then hopefully it's
going to load up your application in a
browser for you which looks something
like this at the minute so this is the
default application we've installed now
we've created using the view CLI and if
we just go back to the code we can see
that code or that component rather
that's been loaded in in the
view so this is the code right here that
is generating this view for us
right here okay so now we're in a good
place to start our old custom view
application in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
