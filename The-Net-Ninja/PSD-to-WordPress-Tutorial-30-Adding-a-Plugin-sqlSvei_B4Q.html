watching PSD to WordPress less than 30
and in this video we're going to add a
plug-in to our WordPress installation
Wow alright then so what is a plug-in
well a plug-in is just a package of code
that someone else has written somewhere
some other developer and we can use that
code we can install that plug-in into
our WordPress setup and then we can take
advantage of its extra functionality all
right so say for example we want to
build some kind of gallery on our
WordPress setup so that users can come
into the backend of WordPress and add
images to the gallery instead of writing
all that code ourself in the HTML and
PHP theme files instead we could just go
out there find a plug-in that does it
for us then install it okay that's how
easy is so to install plugins and see
what plugins are available I have to do
is go to plugins and then comes add new
these are the two that come with
WordPress already installed but got to
add new and then whatever plug-in you
want you to search it right here you can
also see the popular or recommended or
favorites
I'm just for the search for gallery and
press ENTER and now you're gonna see
tons of different gallery plugins come
up like that okay if you click on one of
them then you're gonna see a bit of
information about that plug-in a
description installation process
screenshots FAQ all that jazz plus a
rating as well this one looks pretty
good because it's got like 4.5 so that's
really cool if you want to install it
you just click install now I'm not going
to install the gallery plug-in on this
tutorial I want to install a contact
form so that people can make a
reservation for this restaurant all
right so I'm gonna search for contact
form and it's going to be contact form 7
because this is what I've used in the
past and quite like it well I actually
never go up contact form 7 click on it
gives you a bit of information and then
we can just install now this is probably
going to take like a minute to do all it
does is install or download the zip file
then unpacks it and installs it then you
have to activate it yourself by clicking
this link
then intention to the plugins page where
you can see we now have contact form 7
alright cool so if we wanted to go into
the settings of this we just click
settings and it's going to give you a
few different links to documentation and
other helpful things what is still for
us is automatically set up the first
contact form so we can go and check that
out if you want we'll click on that and
what we'll do is just change the title
to reservation form because that's what
this is gonna be useful all right and
down here is where we put the different
fields or elements in that font so
currently we've got the name we've got
the email subject message and then the
send button now I don't really think we
need a subject or message field so we
don't delete those two but I am gonna
insert one new field area and that's
going to be the date field so all these
different buttons here are gonna insert
the different fields on your form for
you
dead easily so I'll click date we'll
call this reservation date we don't need
the default value that will do insert
tag ok date reservation date I'm going
to pop that between P tags like the rest
of the elements in this form go
difficult a couple of others
ok so then all we have to do is click
Save and then you'll see at the top
copy this shortcode and paste it into
your post page or text widget content
this thing right here so what we need to
do is right click and copy go into our
pages and then it's a reservations then
right here we're just going to paste in
that short code and save it and that's
gonna go out grab that farm for us that
we just set up and display on this page
so if i refresh this reservations page
over here now you're gonna see that farm
so it can fill everything out
choose a date night date picker that
it's done for us here and then click
send and we can set up additional
options so that when users click that
send button different things happen so
let's go into plugins again
and go to settings of contact form 7
which by the way is here it's just
installed this new link on the sidebar
so we could just click contact and then
if we click on reservation form go to
mail this is where we control who it
goes to
so this is the email address it goes to
and so I click send this is the font
from field the subject any additional
headers Matthews body so we can
customize all of this plus here custom
messages so when it was sent
successfully these custom message is
going to show on the website plus lots
of other different things that we can
customize as well additional settings
here we just click Save when we're all
done and voila
everything is taken care of that is how
easy creating a contact form on
WordPress is instead of creating all
that code all that kind of validation
that jazz we don't even worry about it
we just install plug-in and we're ready
to go dead simple it's also good because
your users I'm probably not going to be
the most technical people otherwise they
would have made the website himself so
it's good for them as well they can go
and edit the form if they need to
without getting in touch with you and
saying look can you make changes to the
website so it's good for clients and you
as well really cool so like I said tons
of plugins file pretty much anything you
want like if you wanted a stripper to
strip on your website every time a user
clicks a button there's probably a
plugin for it somewhere
anything you want probably you're gonna
find it so yeah make use of them if you
have any questions about this whatsoever
feel free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the next
