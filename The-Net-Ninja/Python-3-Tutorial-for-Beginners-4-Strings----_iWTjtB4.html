your fourth place in the three tutorial
and in this video we're going to talk
about strings alright then so we're
taking a look at numbers now it's time
for the second data type which is
strings so what are strings basically
they're just a sequence of characters so
a sentence or word and we store them in
an ax double quotes or single quotes so
for example double quotes hello this is
a string and we can do this in single
quotes as well that is the things during
these are essentially the same thing
right except if we start in single we
have to end in single if we're starting
double we have to end in double so what
if we wanted to type a sentence like
he's a madman well let's try this in
single quotes he's a mad man okay now we
get Eric and that's because of this
apostrophe in he's so this thing right
here is closing the string we open it
there we close it here so the string is
just he and then we've got these random
letters afterwards that title doesn't
know what to do it because they fall
outside of the string so we get an error
how do we get around something like this
where we can just add them into double
quotes instead so we could say he's a
madman
in double quotes now we don't get an
error because this single apostrophe is
not cancelling out this thing right here
we're not ending this string because if
you start in double you have to end in
double right so that's one way around
the other way around is to escape a
certain character we can escape this
character to say to Python we don't want
this to cancel the strand we want this
to be in the string so single quotes any
key then we do a backslash this is how
we escape a character the character we
want to escape comes after that which is
the apostrophe then we just carry out as
normal he's a mad mad close the string
now it's fine okay now we get that
string okay so I said basically strings
are just a sequence of characters a list
of characters if you like and we can
access the different characters in that
string based on the position that we
want so for example positions 3 right
the third elements in the string in
hello it would be else right now here's
the thing in pasted we always starts at
0 so the first one right here
not position one is position zero then
it's one then two three four that's just
the way we work with things in Python so
if I wanted to get the first element in
here in the string let's store one in a
variable first of all we'll say greet
equals hello right so there's the string
and we're storing it in this variable
now if I wanted to get the first letter
in this drink I could say greet then we
use square brackets notation now if you
use JavaScript in the past this is a bit
like a racing taxi if we want to get a
certain element out of an array title is
quite similar in that respect so if I
want to get the first element remember
it's zero based so the first one is in
position 0 2 then I click enter and get
the H if I want to get the next one I
could say sweets one right and we get
the eat etc now I can also work
backwards so if I want to start here
then I can use - so this is - 1 - 2 - 3
- 4 - 5 so if I say greet and then minus
1 then again all or greet - 5 and I
should get the first one which is H cool
so - works backwards and then we start
from 0 to go forwards now we can also
slice strings how do we slice them and
what a slice mean well slice basically
means we want to slice up into different
sections and we want to take one certain
slice out of this drink so say I want to
slice this string so that I just get
help without the elbow at the end so
what I can do is say greet then the
square brackets again now to slice
something I give it a start point and an
end point so we want to start at the
zero and that's inclusive of 0 and then
we say : to say where we want to go to
and we want to go up to 3 which is this
character right here but we don't
include that one okay we'll just go to
up to position 3 so 0 1 2 3 7l but we
don't include that in the slides so
Python does not include this third
position this one is inclusive the start
point
this one is non inclusive so enter we
get help ok so we could also do this
from the back we could say something
like greet and then we could say oops
Square
- one - I don't know - what's that going
to do well it gets us an empty string so
we can't go from - right here - one and
go forwards around right but what we can
do is something like this we can say
greet and we can say - 2 - 1 and this is
going to get us these two things right
here so the position - element which is
this 0 1 2 and then minus 1 is the okk
so it goes up to manage 1 but not
inclusive of it and we get Double L all
right so we can use all different ways
to kind of slice a string but this does
not change the actual original variable
okay if we want to change it same as
numbers we have to reassign it so I
could say greet is equal to greet and
then slice it say from 0 to 3 and that
will change it now or otherwise if we
just use greet and slice on itself then
it doesn't change it okay let's change
this back now to equal hello
okay now let's do another string I'm
just going to call this STR - and I'm
going to call this dudes now what if we
want to add two strings together well
this is called concatenated and I do it
use the plus sign so I can say something
like this greet plus STR - and we're
going to get hello boots right so is
taking this string and attached it to
this drink so this will comes after
because this is after in the equation
now there's no space because you've got
no spaces in add a string but we could
attach some kind of space if we wanted
to we could contaminate that - we can
say Greeks plus and then a string which
is just a space then plus STR - as well
then we get space in between okay let's
do something else let's have a look at
multiplication now you might think
that's just a math what we can also
multiply strings which sounds a little
bit weird at first but basically what
this does is just kind of repeat the
string so if I say something like greet
times three that is going to take that
string and repeat it three times next to
each other
greet
and five can do it five times etc
alright alright there's so that's the
basics of strings now let's have a look
at some of the methods the strings have
remember everything is an object in
Python strings are an object and they
have methods so say we make I don't know
a new sentence or in fact let's just
stick with this green for now say I want
to turn it into uppercase we can use a
method from the string object to do that
we can say greet and the way we use a
string method is by saying dots right so
any string method we can use on a string
by saying the string and then dots what
the method name is called and the method
is called popper so we invoke that with
the parentheses and what this is going
to do is turn that string into uppercase
again it's not going to affect the
actual original variable that's still at
lowercase okay so we have to reassign if
we want to do that so Greek equals greet
dot upper that is going to reassign it
and turn it into upper case
cool what I was going to do we can split
a string so let's create a new string
called cheeses and these are going to be
my favorite cheese's REE cheddar in fact
cheddar is not one of my favorite
cheese's but whatever Stilton is a good
one anyway there's three cheese's right
so just a list of those in a string now
say we want to split the string up into
its individual elements and say we want
to split wherever there's a comment we
can use a method called split on the
string so I could say cheese's dot split
and where do we want to split that we've
cut an argument into say where we want
to split the string into individual
elements we want to do it every time
there's a comment so now we get our each
other still turn in some kind of list
now if not seeing lists just yet but
this is what the split method does it
will see list later on so there's a
couple of different methods and there's
tons of different methods out there for
strings it will be impossible to cover
them all in this tutorial but we are
going to be using different ones as we
go through this series as well one more
thing I want to show you is how to find
out the length of a string how many
elements are in it or characters ring so
Greeks right here that is hello
currently and we can see this five
letters in it book if this was a huge
string and we wanted to know how many
letters were in it we could say so
like greet or rather first of all Lent
which is just a standard function in
Python
then we pass in the string as an
argument so greet and that gives us five
so that tells us the length of that
string how many characters are in okay
so there we go that is strings in a
nutshell like I said we're going to use
in them much more as we go along and
create programs out of them but they're
for now that will do us in the next
tutorial what I'm going to do is move on
to the next data type which is lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
