tutorial and in this video we're gonna
take a look at URLs and views alright so
before we jump into the code and just
start coding I want to talk about how
URLs and views are gonna work in Django
so imagine we're in a browser and we go
to a website and make a request to the
forward slash about URL okay so we
expect to see maybe an about page return
to us in the browser so we send that
request and the job of the URLs dot py
file in Django and we saw that briefly
in the last tutorial is to look at this
request URL and then decide which
function to fire in our jungle code
within the views dot py file okay so say
for example we go to fold slash about
the URLs dot py file is going to look at
this URL and say okay I want to fight a
function inside this file reviews dot py
called about and that function can be
called whatever you want but it makes
sense that this call may be about okay
and inside that function we can control
what happens when a user visits this URL
so ideally what we're going to do is
send back some kind of response to the
browser so inside that about function
inside the views file what we do is say
okay send a HTML template or some kind
of response to the browser send that
along for them to see and that's how
this triangle kind of works that's the
the crooks of URLs of views inside
Django so now we know basically how it
works let's go into the code and start
creating some URLs and views all right
there so the first thing you might have
noticed is that we have this dude just
chilling out inside our jungle optic
folder over here now this is
automatically generated by Django
you don't need to worry about it it
essentially just speeds up our
application when we're running it and
you don't need to delete it just leave
it as is for now okay so I said what
we're going to do is start configuring
our URLs dot py file and also our views
dot py file now we can see the URLs file
right here but there's no views file in
sight so we'll come to that in a minute
and now let's pop in here and
all these yellow stuff at the top that
is just some comments by Django to tell
you how to use this file but since I'm
going to show you let's just delete it
all to make it look a little neater cool
and the first thing you'll notice is
that Django has imported two things up
here URL and admin this URL we need to
create URLs down here we'll use that in
a second an admin is used in this
callback function right here so Django
when you first start creating a project
already sets up this URL for you okay
the admin section Django comes shipped
with an admin section which we'll look
at later and has created a URL for that
which is just forward slash admin
alright so what we want to do now is
create two more URLs one for the about
page for example and also one for the
home page so how do we do that well all
we need to do is come underneath it and
say URL and we're going to do pretty
much exactly the same as this thing here
we have two parameters first of all we
have a raw string and that's what the R
is for and this is going to describe
what the URL is right and this says
right here go to /add min this carrier
is a part of rejects or regular
expressions and it just means that this
has to come at the very start of the
string it can't be something like
forward slash blardy blardy blar admin
right it has to be at the start of the
string admin so it has to be forward
slash admin that's what this thing means
right occasionally you'll see a dollar
sign somewhere here at the end and that
means that this has to be the end of the
string okay it can't be admin blardy
blardy blar it has to be admin so this
right here is known as a regular
expression you don't need to know too
much about regular expressions to
survive in Django but we are going to
look at them a little deeper as we go
along when we start to construct more
complex URLs right and I'll talk about
it a bit more as we go along for now I
need to know is that this caret means
the start of a string and the dollar
sign means the end of a string okay so
what we want to do is create an about
page so the first parameter is a raw
string so we'll say R then inside the
string we want it to be current because
we want it to begin with about and then
forward slash
that will put a dollar sign at the end
which means this has to be the lust of
the or rather the end of the string as
well right so it has to be just forward
slash about rather than about four slash
something else right so the second
parameter right here is going to be a
function now we're going to come back to
this in a minute because we don't have
our view stop py file setup for now what
we're gonna do is just another URL which
is gonna represent our homepage so
inside here again a raw string this time
we want it to be the home page now when
we go to a home page it's normally just
whatever you know calm and that's it
just forward slash right so we don't
have anything after here so how do we do
that in jungle how do we create this
regular expression or string to denote
that we want to look out for just
forward slash just the home page alright
or it doesn't even have to be just
forward slash it's just calm sometimes
right well the way we do that is just by
saying carrot and then dollar sign with
nothing in between it meaning this is
the start this is the end there's
nothing in between right so this is
gonna look out for just calm right
whatever calm or whatever calm forward
slash so that's how we create a URL for
the home page and again let's do a comma
and then right here will do a callback
function much like we have here which is
going to point to a function inside our
views file right for the home page so
let's say you were asked configured the
next thing we want to do is go into our
views file now we don't have that at the
minute so let's create one I'll
right-click over here and I'm going to
call this views py so that is in this
Django notic folder next to the URLs now
right so inside this views file is where
we create the functions which will fire
when a user visits a certain URL so the
first thing I want to do is import
something right and that's going to be
from Django dots HTTP I'm going to
import the HTTP which
Bunce module this is gonna allow us to
send a response to the user right so
when they request a page we're going to
send them something but all right so now
we've got that let's define a couple of
functions we need two functions we need
a function which is gonna fire when a
user visits this URL and a function
which is gonna fire up when the user
visits this URL right so let's do the
about one first of all I'm gonna say
death which is defining a Python
function and this is going to be called
about again you can call this whatever
you want and calling this about because
it makes sense that visit in the about
URL we want to fire a function therefore
called about write an inside this
function we take a parameter called
request and that is the request object
if you like the the thing that's given
to us inside this function when a user
visits that about URL okay it has
information about the request that was
made now all we want to do when someone
visits this URL forward slash about is
send back a simple HTTP response right
for now we're not going to send back a
page or HTML template we're just going
to send back a simple text HTTP response
and we'll look at templates later so the
way we do that is by saying first of all
return or returning something out of
this function and it's gonna be a hate
TTP response which we imported up here
right and then inside this HTTP response
will send through a string and this is
going to be about okay so we have that
function now for the about page so we
can hook it up inside our URL file - how
do we do that exactly well the first
thing we need to do is import this views
file right into this file because we're
going to reference it so I'll say from
dots I'm gonna say from dot that means
from the current directory that you're
in so views WI is in the same directory
as URLs dot py so we're grabbing from
the same directory and we're importing
from that directory views right which is
this file right here
so we've imported that file now and
therefore we can reference the functions
inside this file so I can reference this
about function right here
so I can say in here well the callback
function I wanna fire when someone goes
to /y about is gonna be views which is
this file we've just imported dot about
which is the name of the function we
created right here so this function is
gonna fire when someone visits this
route of this URL okay
make sense let's do the same thing for
the home page I'm gonna create above
this a new function called home and this
function again is gonna take in fact I
call it home page this function is going
to take the request object again and
inside the function we also want to
return an HTTP response so say return
HTTP response and then inside we're
gonna send a string again and this can
just be homepage all right so now again
let's save this and hook this up to our
on page URL so this time we want to save
use dots home page to find that function
when someone visits just forward slash
right so let's pop a comma on the end of
that save this save the views file and
let's run this so we'll go to our
command line tool and we'll say Python
manage py run server remember this is
how we spin up a local server for our
project and how we can view it in the
browser we want to go to this address
right here which is localhost 127.0.0.1
you can type localhost instead of that
port 8000 so I've already gone to there
inside this browser I'm going to click
enter just to see this and we get the
home page rank so we've gone to just
forward slash and we get the home page
awesome now if we go to forward slash
about then we get about sent back to us
alright so this is really cool what
we're doing right here is we're looking
at the URLs when they're sent when they
requested in Django in this file right
here right and we see that okay someone
sent for the about URL therefore I want
to find this about function in the views
file so these functions
and we send back a HTTP response saying
about makes sense same for the home page
when some visits just /or just calm then
we send back the views that home page
function which is going to return this
HTTP response right here sending the
text home page so there we go my friends
you've successfully created now two URLs
and a views file which is controlling
the output of data to the browser all
right so that's a good start so now we
know how to do this in the next video
what we're going to do is take it one
step further and have a look at HTML
templates and how we send those to the
browser's instead of just text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
