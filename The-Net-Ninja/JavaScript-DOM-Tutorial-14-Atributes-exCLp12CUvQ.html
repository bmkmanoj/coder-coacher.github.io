fourteenth JavaScript and the Dom
tutorial and in this video I'm going to
show you how to change attributes using
javascript okay then so in this tutorial
I just want to talk about attributes a
little bit how you can reach into the
Dom and how you can read attributes such
as the class or ID or H ref attributes
how we can change those attributes how
we can check if an element has an
attribute or how we can remove
attributes now I'm not going to be
working in the text editor over here
because we don't really need this
functionality in our application but I'm
just going to go through a few examples
so you understand it in the console so
already I've grabbed a reference to this
book over here which is the name of the
wind' document dot query selector li
first child so if I type in book now
we're gonna see this element it's a span
tag right with class of name and name of
the wing in the middle so this right
here is a class attribute now what if we
want to check in JavaScript the class or
something or the attribute of something
rather so what we can do is say book
which is the element dot get attribute
and then inside here and by the way this
is TT
inside here we need to pass through what
attribute we want to check now we want
to check the class attribute so I'll
pass it in as a string and if I click
enter does give it to a name so now I'm
reaching in and I'm grabbing this value
right here of this attribute if I wanted
to check the href attribute I just type
in href here now this is obviously not
going to work because this doesn't have
a href attribute it's not an anchor tag
but that would work if it did so that's
how you reach in and grab an attribute
now what if we want to change it what if
we want to change this to I don't know
name two or something it doesn't really
matter now instead of get attribute what
we want to say is set attribute then the
attribute that we want to set which is
class that's the first argument here
then it takes another argument which is
what we want to change this attribute to
the value of it and this is just going
to be called name too
alright so if we click enter now then we
say book just to list that we can see
now it's
got a class of name too so suppose this
is another way of changing the class of
an element like I showed you in the last
tutorial but this is more generic this
is to change any attribute on the page
so that's how we reach in and grab
attributes and that's also how we change
the attributes now say for example we
wanted to check if something has a
certain attribute now it doesn't have to
be of a particular value we just want to
check that it has for example a class
attribute well we could say book dot has
attribute and then inside here and it's
just 1s there we've just passed through
the attribute name we want to check that
it has so I want to check if this has an
attribute of class and that's true it
does have an attribute of class we could
change this to H ref which it doesn't
have and then we get false so we can
check if an element has an attribute as
well using this method and then act
accordingly depending on whether it does
or whether it doesn't okay the last
thing I want to show you is how to
remove an attribute so I can say book
dot remove attribute and this is going
to be the class attribute so if I click
that then it's gonna say note because
I've again a little spelling error so
remove class remove attribute class now
that's removed it and I can check that
by saying book and we can see now it
does not have that class attribute so
again if I wanted to I could set the
attribute I could say book set attribute
to give it back this is going to be the
class attribute and then it's going to
have a class name of names so now if I
type in book again we can see it has
that class of name again
so this was a really short video just to
show you that we can actually go in and
edit the attributes of HTML elements
read them delete them etc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
