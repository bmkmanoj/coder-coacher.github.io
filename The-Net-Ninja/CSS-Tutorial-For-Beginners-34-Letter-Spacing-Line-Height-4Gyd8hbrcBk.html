watching CSS beginners lesson 34 and
today we're going to talk about let
spacing and line height that's coming up
Wow okay so before we dive in the cold I
want to go through what letter spacing
is and what life is and what words
basement is so if you're coming from a
graphic design background or Photoshop
you're probably familiar with these
things they call something a little bit
different I think but either way you're
probably familiar with concepts now
let's face in is simply the spaces
between letters you can control that so
you can make the font look a little
stretched if you like or kind of
condensed and crammed together so that
is the letter spacing in graphic design
it's more commonly referred to as
tracking the word spacing down below is
the same concept but it's the space
between words instead of letters the
line height is the vertical height or
the physical space between lines in a
paragraph so imagine these are full
sentences yeah full kind of width and in
a within one paragraph and that height
there between each line would be the
line spacing all right so now we know
that let's jump into the code and play
around with them Wow
all right guys so here we are back in
the code and you can probably see I did
this style tag here with just a few
different styles in don't pay attention
to that I've just added those in to make
the site look a little bit more pretty
so that's the only reason for that down
below here we've got some dummy text and
this is actually really cool it's from a
site called Samuel L Lipson which comes
up with this samuel l.jackson type
double text it's an alternative lorem
ipsum so you can check that out it's
really cool so now what we're going to
do we're going to grab all the peas with
that piece of let go we're going to look
at those properties and we'll start by
just giving the font a font size of 12
pixels right and we'll give it a letter
spacing first of all now this property
is dead simple it's just letter -
spacing if you can spell like me and
we've got here in Harriet we've seen
what that does just inherits the parent
elements left to spacing property and
we've got normal to default leave us
with a normal letter spacing so we can
add our own letter spacing and we can do
this using pixels but we can also use
the relative measurements which
and percentages much like we can with
the font size now they work a little bit
differently when it comes to letter
spacing word spacing and line height the
aims and percentages so I'm going to go
through that in a minute just to begin
with we're going to use pixels and I'm
going to say what the hell ten pixels
all right so let's save this now and
view this bad boy in a browser all right
that looks absolutely cool doesn't it I
mean if you can read that then kudos
because I ain't gonna clear what it says
so that is letter spacing in action yet
we've done it a little bit too much
there but if you wanted to stretch by
just a couple of pixels that would
probably be the better thing to do okay
by the way this is that CSS that I did
it's giving it a great background and
just the central colon looks a lot
better don't you think cool anyway
that is the letter spacing let's just
reduce this a little bit to about two
pixels because that is a lot more easier
on the eye view this in a browser again
and there you go that looks better
doesn't it I mean now the letters are a
little bit further spaced they've got a
little bit more room to breathe but it's
not illegible alright so that is what
letter spacing is all about now let's
look at the word spacing property again
we'll go up to 12 pixels between the
words we'll start on an extreme level
and view this in a browser again okay
yep there again it's a little bit too
much but you can see this 12 pixels now
between each word there okay so let's
just reduce this and we'll go down to 2
pixels again yeah see what that does for
us so dog barking away in the background
okay cool that's a bit better and so
yeah we can pad out the words and the
letters using letter spacing and word
spacing now the line height is something
slightly differently something slightly
different sorry that is the vertical
space so let's give that a go and again
it's just like - height property and
we'll give that 12 pixels again
that is my lucky number today view this
in the browser now then that doesn't
look very big does it 12 pixels there's
not 12 pixels of space between those
what's going on well let's just try this
let's try increasing this - I don't know
24 pixels and view this in the browser
again right that's more like it now
we've got this space here bull again it
doesn't look like 24 pixels so what's
going on well my friends this is what's
going on the font size itself is 12
pixels
okay so when we specified a line spacing
of 12 pixels on line height of 12 pixels
rather and that is the vertical height
of that line okay it's 12 pixels we're
not specifying the gap in between the
lines we're specifying the height of the
whole line so now this whole thing here
is 12 pixels if I do 0 pixels check out
what happens I'll put this up in a
browser again see that it all kind of
goes on top of each other all right and
that's because the line is zero pixels
in height so is having no space
whatsoever to breathe vertically okay so
because the font is 12 pixels it's
taking all 12 pixels in height that line
automatically now if we add a live
height of 12 pixels it's not doing
anything to it because the font size is
already 12 pixels you follow me right
now if we double that to 24 pixels we're
saying okay well you've got 12 pixels
for the font height and an additional 12
pixels for the space in between that
makes perfect sense yeah all right cool
so I said we could use m's all right now
let's look at the letter spacing first
of all I'm going to say two M's now in
the font size case I said that the MS
would inherit the parent elements font
size and then times it by two in this
case yeah that's not the case here we
don't inherit from say the body tags
that you know the parent elements
let's facing because it might not have
one associate to it what we do is we
inherit these 12 pixels that we've
specified specified as the font size for
the P tag and then we change that by two
so that is the equivalent of st. 24
pixels so whatever this is here the font
size we times it by two or if it's three
M's then we times it by three so that
then will be 36 pixels less facing okay
now it's normally good practice to do to
do something like you know not point one
or not point two because you don't want
the letter spacing to be that fire
planet so let's just check out first of
all this when it looks like in a browser
this in chrome and there you go you know
that's not point two is it yeah that's
not point two and it look pretty cool so
that is how m's work with letter spacing
and it's exactly the same with words
face it let's just get rid of this and
do a word spacing so we'll view this in
the browser in Chrome yep that was cool
and yes it guys with Lion height it's
exactly the same however in this case
you don't want not point two M's because
remember that's going to cause the font
to kind of overlap on each other we want
at least one it because one n will be 12
pixels yeah one times 12 and we need at
least 12 pixels in height for the font
size of 12 pixels so ideally we want to
make these over what maybe 1.5 to see
something like this or even more
depending on you know your designs
so let's view this in the browser one
last time cool very nice so we've got
now a little bit of space in between
these lines it's quite readable except
for the fact that the font size is
really small put apart from that the
spacing looks pretty cool all right guys
that about covers it for letter spacing
word spacing and on line height if you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
to ask them below and I'll answer all of
those are soon as you can otherwise if
