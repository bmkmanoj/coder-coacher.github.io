eighth mongodb for beginners tutorial
and in this video I'm gonna talk about a
tool called Robo Mungo which gives us a
visual representation of our data in
MongoDB all rather than gang so in the
last few tutorials what we've been doing
is creating an instance of our Mario
character then we've got that character
and we saved it to MongoDB okay but
we're just kind of taking mangu C's word
for at the minute
we don't have any kind of visual
representation of that data in a
database or a collection anywhere which
is kind of assuming that mangos has done
its job correctly and yet it's out there
somewhere being stored in MongoDB I
always like to see the data so I'm going
to show you a tool which i think is
really useful called Robo Mongo which
allows us to see all of our data in the
database so I'm going to point you in
the direction of the rubble mangled
website which is a robot Mongo org I'll
leave the link down below and this is a
free tool so you can just hit this
download button right here it's gonna
give you two options either in installer
or an executive or file I've got the
second option but you can choose
whichever one you want doesn't really
matter once you've downloaded it and
installed it just hit up the icon it's
this little rocket right here now you
might not see this new connection thing
if you don't just click create then you
can rename new connection if you want
I've not done that leave this the same
and leave this the same click Save then
you will see this doing right here so
click connect and then now this is going
to show us our different databases
ignore this project one that was just
something I created a while ago this
thing right here this tester if that was
pretty familiar and if we look back to
our code in the connection J's file
you'll see right here we're connected to
the database using this connection
string and right here we gave it a
database name called tester root now
when we first run this test a root
didn't actually exist so Mongo said hey
why not I'll create this so that's what
it did it created that database forest
and thereafter it just connected to that
database so this thing right here this
tester ooh is actually just that
database okay so we can expand this and
then we can see our collections
in here and remember we made a Mario
tartar collection which is right here
this refers to this thing right here
where he said Mongoose dot model Mario
Kart now notice what's happened in we've
said Mario Kart that is singular
Mongoose kind of assumes we're going to
have multiple instances of this model in
this collection so very cleverly it
plural eise's it
Mario cars pretty cool so that's our
collection and okay there's four things
to make even though we only saved one
thing so what is going on here well
first thing you'll notice is that they
all have an object ID this is a unique
key specific just to that one record so
these are all different yeah so they've
all got a unique key let's expand one of
them and see what it is
so ID that is the idea again the name
Mario okay then this V thing I'm not
going to talk about that just yet okay
what's the second one
okay name Mario that's a bit weird
yep third one Mario and uh yeah fourth
Mario what the hell is going on is those
for Mario's you would know I'd just say
but it won't
well actually we didn't just save it
once how many times have we gone into
this command line tool and I ran NPM run
test quite a few so every time we do
that what is happening is this Mario
character right here we're creating a
new version of this character and we're
saving that new version of the character
to the database doesn't matter that it's
got the same name doesn't matter at all
because Mongoose assigns a unique key a
unique ID to each time we create an
instance of that model so every time I
create one is getting a different unique
key and that's all that matters it's
saving those dudes to the database every
time with that unique key even though
the names are the same just think about
it if you had a list of users more than
likely you're gonna have a user with the
same first name right so it doesn't
matter that things have the first name
the same on any other property the same
what matters is that Mongoose gives this
a unique key and every time we create
one of these it's got its own unique key
and when we save it it's got its own
place in the database which is why we've
run it must have run it four times
therefore we see four records in the
database
okay so then this is Robo manga so as we
start to save more data or delete data
we're going to be able to see it now in
robot manga so this is not compulsory
this is just recommended I really like
to see my data as I play around with it
I think it's going to help you too so
first things first I want to clean up
this database because if we keep on
saving new records that's going to cause
some problems later on when we come to
retrieve records whose name is Marriott
for example because it's going to bring
back a whole load of them so I'm going
to show you a trick we can do to clean
up the database in the very next
tutorial I'll see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
