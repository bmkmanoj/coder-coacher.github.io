24th of UGS tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about events so in
the last tutorial we saw that if we
passed a reference type as a prop down
to a child component then if we edited
that prop in the child component it
would indirectly edit the original data
source because we're just passing down a
reference there for whichever other
components also took that data as a prop
is also going to get updated we saw them
however the opposite was true for
primitive types if we pass down a
primitive type such as a strings like
this title if we edit that title in here
it's not going to change this thing
right here therefore it's not going to
update any other component either okay
it's only going to update the title in
this component so what if we want to
kind of duplicate that behavior of these
reference types so that if we update in
one component then it updates it in
another component well we can kind of
get around it by using events so what we
can do is in this component say have a
button to change the title and then when
we change that times when we click the
button we can omit an event from this
component and this event goes upwards it
fires up to the parent component okay
and this component can be set up to
listen out for when this event is
emitted so that when it is emitted it
can react to it and the reaction could
be that it's going to change the data
the title variable stored on this
component we're changing the state of
this component and when a component
changes its state or its data it kind of
rear Enders the template to update it so
when it does that it's passing down the
new title data as props to these
components again therefore it's going to
update in every component it passes that
title down too so we're kind of
duplicating that behavior of reference
types on primitive types using events
and that's not all events can be useful
but that's one good example and that's
the example I'm going to show you now
okay so in the head of component
currently we have this title which is
output and
title is being received as a prop from
this root component right here we define
it and it's passed through to the header
and also the footer as a prop now if you
click on this h1 currently it's set up
to this fluent change title and down
here in this function we're changing the
title to view widgets but when we click
on this in all the updates currently in
this component it doesn't update this
title right here what we want it to
update that instead we want you down
here instead of changing it locally
emits and events and that events is
going to fire upwards be listened to by
this component then when it reacts to
that event to change this title right
here on this root component therefore
re-rendering this stuff right here and
passing down the updated title property
as a prop to both of these different
components therefore updating in the
header and the footer makes sense that's
what we're going to do so this is still
fine we still want to fire this function
when we click on here because we still
want to change the title but instead of
just changing it locally we're going to
emit an event how on earth do we do that
well we say this to refer to this
component first of all then we can fire
off an event by saying dollar sign emits
this will emit an event okay now we want
to say what do we want to call this
event well I just want to call this
event changed title okay and we're going
to listen to this event in the root
component in a minute we also can pass
through some data which we can take when
we listen to the event so in this case
it's going to be what do we want to
change the title to so this data we want
to pass with the event is going to be
the second parameter so it's just going
to be a string and we're going to change
it to review Wizards okay so we're
changing from view ninjas to view
Wizards so right now when we click on
this this h1 it's firing this function
in this function receives this referring
to this component dot emit so we're
emitting events and we're firing the
upwards the event is called change title
and the data we're sending with the
events is this string view Wizards this
is what we want to change the title to
so we can now listen for
this event in the route component I'm
going to copy that there and I'm going
to go to the root component and how can
we listen to this event well it's just
like listening for a click event we can
do exactly the same thing and that is
use V on so this event is going to be
firing from this so we can therefore say
V - on on this component and then the
event name now it's called
change title right because that's what
we defined the event to be called right
there I'm just going to save this and
whether this happens when that event is
emitted this thing listens for it and it
can fire a function of its own so we're
going to fight a function that calls
updates title which is going to be
defined down here okay now we can also
take through listing as parameter right
because we pass some data to it and we
can retrieve that by passing through
here dollar sign events and that is the
event data so down here let us define
that method so underneath the data will
say methods this is an object and we
want update title because this is the
method right here which is going to fire
when this event emits okay so in this
method including a function and we want
to update the title so we'll say this
title and set it equal to this thing
right here view Wizards which we sent
along and we received in this event
parameter right here so all we need to
do to access this is come down here and
pass in a parameter right here it
doesn't have to be called event it can
be called whatever you want I'll call it
updated title right and this thing right
here is going to pass through into this
yeah and they can say updated title
because this thing now is equal to
whatever we pass through here so we're
updating this title which is currently
this - this thing right here which we've
passed through it so if I save that now
check this out in a browser if I click
on this then it's going to change them
both
at the top and the bottom to view wizard
I'll just zoom in so you can see change
in both so I'll refresh currently view
ninjas in both click on this and now
it's view Wizards and that's because
we've emitted that event sign it up to
literal component we've listened for
that event and we've reacted to it we've
changed the title property right here to
whatever we pass through on this event
and because this has changed because the
states or data has changed in this
component we re running or re-rendering
this stuff right here which is passing
the updated title to both of these
components right here
therefore updating both of them okay so
that is events in a nutshell we're going
to be using them much much more as we go
along so don't worry if you don't 100%
understand them just at the minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
