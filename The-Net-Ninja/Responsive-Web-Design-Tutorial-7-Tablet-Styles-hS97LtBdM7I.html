your seventh responsive design tutorial
and in this video we're going to start
standing up our website for tablets Wow
alright then so this is the HTML
template that we're going to stand up
for tablets and mobile so currently I've
got open developer tools and I'm just
going to use this to make the screen
smaller and decide what I want to do my
first break point and that point will be
when it starts to look a little bit
squashed etc okay so at the minute it's
about 100 sorry 1180 pixels in width
this viewport and it's still looking
alright nothing is looking to squash I'm
just going to carry on and see when it
starts to look squashed this is at about
950 it does everything look alright yeah
everything's looking alright still so
let's go a little bit further we'll go
down to about 760 something like that
and now things are starting to look a
little bit squashed it's still looking
alright but these things here start to
look a little bit small and squash
together as are these things down here
and we're running out of room up in the
menu now we're currently at about 700
and something pixels about 700 60s or
something around there so I'm just going
to stick with this one round here 768
pixels and that's where I'll do my
breakpoint which is going to target you
know the kind of smaller tablet so an
iPad might be a little bit bigger than
this so it's going to see a view similar
to this something like this which is
still okay for an iPad but those tablets
that are a little bit smaller that are
600 or 700 68 pixels in width are less
we're going to make some different
styles for those iPads so let's get to
about that break point which is
somewhere there and start adding some
new styles so the first thing I want to
do is bring this navigation on to a new
line under here so we've got the whole
width and we're not competing for space
with this logo over here and I'm going
to centralize this logo above it that's
just going to give these links a little
bit more room for the tablets so what I
want to do first of all is find out
which rules are controlling the styles
and it's this now if we want to bring
down to the next line so you can see
currently in the sky
well it's this rule right here and it's
flowing into the right so I'm going to
copy that rule and I'm going to come
down to our break point right there I'm
going to paste it in and I'm going to
override that float and I'm going to say
float not okay so now it's no longer
floating over to the right now
oops that's in capitals let's get rid of
those float numb okay but we still want
to bring it down to the next line so to
do that I'm going to clear this float
here because this is floating to the
left that we need to clear that to bring
it down to the next line so let's clear
left just like that and then let's give
it a width of 100% just to be sure that
it's taking up the whole room okay so
now we need to get rid of some of this
space right here and that's I think is a
combination of a few things it will be
the UL here so we need to get rid of
that margin so we'll do that first of
all we'll say head enough paste that
again ul and we'll take that margin away
from it and we'll also take the padding
away from it as well okay cool
next thing we want to do is take away
some of the margin from the logo and
centralize it so let's find out what
rule is controlling that it's this one
right here h1 logo and we can see
currently it's floating to the left and
we don't want that and we'll also take
away some of that orange margin if you
look on the design you can see that
orange margin will take away some of
that as well so let's go to the style
and come down here this is within our
break point again and we'll paste that
rule in and this time what I'm going to
do is say margin now I want it to be 10
pixels at the top then I want to come in
an auto margin left and right so we're
going to centralize it in a minute and
then we're going to give it a margin of
0 to the bottom we need to get rid of
that float currently floated left we
want to get rid of that and say float
nod and then now it will move into the
middle alright that's looking a bit
better and I also want to centralize
these things because currently they're
all kind of to the left so I want to
make them full span across the whole
width of the page
so to do that what I will do is get the
Li tags within this ul and then I will
float them all left still we don't
really need to do that because they're
already being floated left so I'll just
get rid of that will give them a margin
of 10 pixels to the top and bottom but
nothing to the left and right then
there's five of them one two three four
five so 100% divided by five is 20% so
I'm going to give them each a width on
20% like that and then what I'm going to
do to take away the padding if there
isn't a just to be sure and I'm going to
align the text and text a line to the
center just to make them look a little
bit better that's better they've got
more room now and as we go a little bit
smaller they're not going to be
competing with the logo for room cool
all right there so that is the top part
pretty much done now this still looks
alright the butter and these look okay
here but these look a little bit squash
so I'm just going to change the width of
those so we'll remind ourselves of the
rule in place it's this featured Li and
they've all got a width of 23% to being
flaunted left so we just need to
increase this width to double what it is
basically and so we'll take that they've
got a 1% margin left there right so we
can move them all 248 picture percent in
width and they'll still have room for
that one percent margin left or right so
let's pop that down here and say with 48
percent and that should make them twice
as big that's a bit better now you can
see a little bit clearer on your tablet
what these things are so that will do
for that and as we get smaller you can
see that's still pretty good for these
kind of sizes alright next let's jog
down to this footer and these are start
to look a little bit squash so we're
going to do the same thing for those
we're going to make two columns on each
row so these two here going to jump to
the bottom so let's find out the style
currently controlling this these you
ELLs right here you see the foot it um
so I'll grab that
rule go back to the sources and come
under here and currently those footer
you ELLs are 23% in width again we can
do the same thing with these we can make
them with 48% it's going to bring two
for each one and then just before that
I'm going to say text align the center
give them a bit more breathing room all
right and that we're friends will pretty
much do for this first breakpoint that's
looking all right for tablets okay
everything still got quite a little bit
of room you've got more room up here
these are bigger these have got more
room down here and yeah so let's have a
look if we bring this back up to the
desktop view first of all okay
everything's good for desktop then as we
get smaller smaller and smaller and
smaller when we hit this break point 7 6
8 pixels which is around about now
everything changes this changes up here
these changes down here and these change
down here so that is the break point so
that is tablets sorted in the next video
what we're going to do is move on to
mobiles and do another breakpoint for
things round about this width down here
because things start to look squashed
again and we're also going to make at
some point a mobile drop-down menu so
unless you guys in the next video if you
enjoyed this so far don't forget to
subscribe to catch all the updates and
I'll see you in the next one
