third atma script 6 2011 we r going to
talk about the late keyword Wow alright
then so atma script 6 gives us an
elective play around with and what that
does is basically allow us to create a
variable with lexical scope or local
scope within a code block if you like so
to demonstrate this I'll go through a
couple of examples first thing I want to
do is just create a simple variable as
we normally would and I'll call this X
I'm just gonna set our equal to 10 then
down here I'm going to log the value of
x to the console so I'll say console dot
log X and if we save this and refresh
now you can expect just 10 in the
console which would get cool now what
I'm going to do is a simple even
statement and within here I'm going to
check if X is over 5 which it is right
so it's going to execute this code block
right here then inside here what I'm
gonna do is really declare this variable
var x equals 5 right and then I'm going
to say so what we should expect now is
to see first of all X is declared and
it's equal to 10 then this will execute
because X is greater than 5 and we're
redefining X within this code block
right here to be 5 so we should expect 5
to be logged out right a save and
refresh and we get up cool so let's now
change the fact equal to the let keyword
save that and refresh this time it's 10
so this has not taken effect outside of
the if statement so this is what means
would create an electrical scope if you
like on this variable so this change
right here is only applied within this
code block we're saying let X equal 5
within the code block right and if we
log X inside the code block I'll say
console dot log I'll say inside then
concatenate X I'm just gonna come down
here and say outside and concatenate X
again just so we don't mix them up press
save now refresh and you can see inside
the code the code blah
X is 5 and outside the code block X is
10 so this let keyword right here is not
overriding this global variable it just
has a local of lexical scope within this
code block that's what the let keyword
lets us do okay so let's just work
through one more example you can see on
the right here I've got these Li tags
and if we go to the index file you'll
see this UL then for Li tags each with
zero one two and three inside it so what
I want to do is grab all of these Li
tags and store them in a variable I'll
do that I'll call a variable items and
I'll set it equal to document don't get
elements by tag name and the tag name I
want is Li so that's going to get all of
those Li tags and store them in an array
called items yet now what I want to do
is loop through those items and attach a
click event each Li tag so to do that
I'm going to create a for loop and this
is how we normally do it right I'm gonna
say for VAR x equals zero to begin with
for as long as X is less than items dot
length then what I want to do is add X
sorry X add 1 to X each time around okay
so each time around I want to attach a
click event to one of these items so to
do that I need to grab the current item
in the array so that's just items then a
value of X because that starts at 0 so
item 0 will grab in the first one and
each time around its adding 1 so it's
going to get each one in turn and then
add click events each one so when this
is clicked I'm going to do a little
function which is going to log to the
console the value of x alright so I'll
say console dot log X now what did you
expect it you'd think that every time we
click on one of these it's going to log
either 0 1 2 or 3 to the console that's
what you'd think right because each time
around X is incremented by 1 so let's
save that
I'll refresh and when I click the third
one I get 4 I'm gonna click the first
one I get 4 again you can see it's
doubled up by that to whichever one I
click I get 4 now why is this the reason
is because when we're declaring this
variable right here
to initialize it we're making a global
variable because remember the VAR
keyword ignores this code block and we
saw that in the previous example I
showed you okay so we're creating a
variable which is global in scope and I
can demonstrate that by logging console
if we can spell it that log logging X to
the console outside here so if I save
and refresh you're going to see for in
the console straight away without
clicking anything and that's because X
is incremented each time around in this
for loop and the final result of it is X
so then by the time it gets here x
equals 4 alright so what's happening is
we're attaching these click events right
here to each item yeah and when we come
to log this value of x to the console
when we click it by that time we have a
global variable X which is the value of
4 so it's finding that global variable
and it's just out put it into the screen
and it's 4 right so how do we get around
this this is where we can use the let
keyword instead of the VAR keyword
because now this is not going to create
a global variable the let keyword
creates a variable with lexical scope
inside this code block right so X is
only valid in here and I can also
demonstrate that by logging X to the
console down here on sort of log X and
now if we save and refresh we're gonna
see X is not defined okay so it's not
creating that global X variable right
here just a local one within this code
block so now when we save and refresh
when we click one of these I'll click
the first one we get 0
this one one and so forth so now we get
what we expect so the reason is is
because when we're clicking on one of
these now when we come to log X to the
console it's not finding that global
variable which is now 4 because of all
these kind of loops of this for loop
it's now finding the variable X at which
point this event was attached ok because
it's only valid within this global earth
within this local kind of code block so
that's how the let keyword works it just
creates a variable with
local scope or lexical scope within a
code block whereas the VAR keyword
ignores this kind of code block okay so
if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to leave those down below
otherwise guys don't forget to share
