towards the end of this tutorial series
but before we start styling this up I
want to show you one more little bit of
functionality because right now if we go
to the home page without articles being
there then we're still getting this
really crappy homepage at the minute and
this isn't very good not a good first
impression so ideally what I'd like to
do is for this URL to take us or showers
of this content right so we need to
change our route URLs and they're
studying this junga notic folder right
here so let's close this down and open
up this URLs file right here so at the
minute you can see that this thing right
here this route URL is taking us to this
homepage view which is returning if we
open up views this thing right here this
homepage dot HTML that we made right at
the start of this series now we don't
want to do this anymore instead what we
want to do is show this page right here
this article list page so to do that how
are we going to approach this well you
might think that we go into the views
over here and instead we render the
other template for this thing but
actually we don't need to do that
instead what we can do is just change
this thing right here so that it doesn't
use this home page view but instead uses
a view from our articles app which is
this thing right here the article list
right so that when someone goes to
forward slash nothing or just a route
URL it fires this view right here does
that make sense
so how are we going to fire that view
well first of all we need to import it
so we do that by saying from then
articles which is the articles app right
here and we want to import the views
from that up now there's a problem here
because we're already importing views
right here from the current directory
these things now we can't do both like
that because that will confuse Django it
won't know which view is which right so
what we can say is import as article
views
so now we're importing the views but in
this file we're naming that article
underscore view so that it doesn't get
confused with this thing up here so now
we can say instead of used at home page
when you go to this URL this route 1
right here
instead we want article underscore views
and that's dot article and I think it's
list yep article list now let's also
give this URL a name which is going to
be equal to home so let's save that and
now I want to set it up so that when you
click on this it takes you to the home
page but instead of that first of all
let's just check that this has worked so
we're going to the root domain right
here just forward slash press enter and
it takes us here so now this is the home
page as well awesome now when we click
on this instead of it going to fold
slash articles let's just take it back
to the home page because it does the
same thing now
so in our base template or our base
layout right there this is where we have
the h1 the logo and it's going to
articles list at the minute but instead
of that we can just type in home because
that is what we called this URL or right
here so now it's going to fire this
thing which fires at the same view and
sends us the same template so let's save
it and make sure this works I go to a
different page first of all then click
on the logo and it takes us to the home
page awesome so there we go
dead quick just one last little bit of
functionality I wanted to show you
before we go ahead in the next tutorial
and start styling this application up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
