your 18th bootstrap 3 tutorial and in
this video we're gonna take a look at
some more navbar classes
Wow
alright then guys so just when you
thought you couldn't possibly remember
any more classes to do with navigations
I'm gonna throw some more yes so I hope
you'll go decent memory or some patience
the first one I want to show you is the
navbar head up okay so on a website
typically if we just make this larger in
the navigation sometimes you have like a
logo or at least a title over here or
maybe up here wherever you want right
now to do that what we do is use a
navbar header so we'll just make a
simple div you give it a class of nav
bar head up alright and then we didn't
that I'm gonna do an anchor tag picture
F equals forward slash index dot HTML
and I'm gonna give this a class of nav
bar parameter
like that okay so the reason I've done
an a tag right there is because normally
when we have a logo or some kind of
title in the header here it would
normally go to the index page or the
homepage when you click it right so
that's why we add an anchor tag right
there and then we give it a class of nav
bar brand and it's not bad brand because
normally it's some kind of branding of
the company like a logo ok so there's
just two classes there you need to
remember nav bar header for the div and
then nav bar brand for the the a tag so
I'm just gonna put in some text here I'm
just gonna pour awesome training very
original
I know that let's do that all in
capitals let's make it really cool
awesome training now that is awesome
alright so now when we look at that that
is the kind of link to the homepage and
if we wanted we could put an image there
like a logo instead okay so that's the
navbar header now I want to also show
you how we can add buttons to the
navigation so you know like on some
websites you get those buttons
on the right over here which say
something like register or login or
something well we can add those two so
what I'm gonna do is just come
underneath this UL and I'm gonna do a
button tag like that I'm gonna give it a
class of BTN that's that kind of default
Plus that would give it all buttons and
I'm gonna give it button default as well
just to give it that default styling and
then the last one I want to do is give
it a class of nav bar - button and then
within here I'm just gonna say register
like that okay so if we view this here
now you can see it's got a button and we
can actually float that all the way over
to the right and to do that what we do
is give it another class oops there
which is enough bark - all right and
that's gonna float it all the way over
to the right so review in a full screen
it'll look something like that and yet
as we get down to smaller screens it
does look a bit ugly but what we can
always do is use our own style that CSS
file or something like that to override
these bootstrap styles or we can style
it a little bit differently this just
kind of gives us the foundations for a
quick responsive website okay so we can
have a couple of buttons if we like
we'll do one for register and one for
login and what I'll do is change this
default to I don't know primary just so
they look a little bit different and
save that and now we have two buttons
and again we could use our own styles to
give these some margin etc in fact you
know I'll just do that now what I'll do
is go to the register one and I'll do
style equals margin left 10 pixels you
don't want to do this normally guys you
want to do everything in your CSS sheet
if possible and now we've got a login
button and the register boy pretty cool
yeah all right so that is about all the
classes I'm gonna give you for these nav
bars but in the next tutorial we are
going to look at what happens when we
make our screen
smaller so for mobile things like that
you can see it kind of stacks one on top
of the other there but what we want to
do is make a nice kind of mobile drop
down menu so we're going to take a look
at that in the next tutorial
any questions for you're free to ask
those down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share like and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
