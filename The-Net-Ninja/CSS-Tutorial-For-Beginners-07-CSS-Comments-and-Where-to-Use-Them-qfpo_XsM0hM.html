hey troopers what's going on I'm Sean
from the net ninja and this is CSS for
beginners lesson seven CSS comments Wow
so before we go any further with this
course I just wanted to go through
comments and how we use comments in CSS
now they can be used for a variety of
things that can be used to make notes
for yourself so you remember to add
certain styles that can be used to split
your CSS file up into logical areas
loads of different things and basically
it's a way of adding text to a CSS file
without the browser looking at that text
and doing anything with it so it's not
going to screw up your page okay so the
syntax of a comment is pretty simple all
we do is put a forward slash then we put
this asterisk sign to open a comment and
you can see now everything is grayed out
here and this is being construed as a
comment by the CSS file now to close the
comment we do an Asterix again and
forward slash again and you can see if
things come back in color here because
we've closed the comment up here and
this is no longer within it so we could
say here style oops or P tags and then
below here is where we're going to do
all our P tags so we could have another
one header P give this a rule and we'll
make this font size I don't know 24
pixels and then basically we've just
said all P tags are here now here we
could say I don't know to open a comment
style all header tags and close the
comment and then we'll do h1 font size
is I don't know
44 pixels so basically what I've done
here is I've used comments to segment my
CSS file so that's one use of comments
now you just have to be careful that you
always end your comments here because if
you don't then all your CSS below it
until we find this ending comment is
going to be
excluded and it's not going to be
rendered this way in the browser so you
need to be really careful you always put
this Asterix at the end so another use
for the comment is to comment out
segments of rules say for example that
you no longer want the header P here to
be rendered in a higher font size you
could temporarily comment that out by
opening our comment and then closing it
oops that will no longer apply in the
browser so you can have various
different rules in between here and you
want to disable them for an unspecified
amount of time but when you want to
re-enable them again just come here
delete your comments and voila it's back
again and it's not going to be ignored
anymore another example of where we use
comments is at the start of a CSS file a
lot of people like to put their personal
details at the top so I do this
oops and I'm just going to put a lot of
Asterix it makes like a border and and
one again one again do a space and then
I'll do something my author Shaun take a
the net ninja I don't know course no
date date will do date so another date
thinks the third of June 15 and you know
you get the point anyway you can put
your details here and then at the very
end close the comment off
so all these Asterix here they're just
kind of being used to make a border at
the top at the bottom and the side and
we've gone on to multiple lines by doing
different specifications in here the
author and the day it sets you can put
whatever you want in there and then
finally we've closed the comment off at
the end with the forward buck slash not
the five back slash that makes no sense
the forward slash so yeah I mean there's
a variety of different ways we can use
comments I just wanted to show you them
now in case they use them in the future
or so you can use them in your staff
she's gone along so you can organize
them a bit better obviously if you have
any questions about this feel free to
comment below and I'll answer all of
those otherwise I'll see you guys in the
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
