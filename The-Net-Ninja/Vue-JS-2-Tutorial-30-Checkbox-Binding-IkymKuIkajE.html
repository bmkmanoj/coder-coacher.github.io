UJS tutorial and in this video we're
going to take a look at check box
bindings okay so in the last tutorial we
went ahead and started our blog by
creating this component add blog which
is a form to add a new blog post and we
had a look at this v model where we
could bind to input fields now that's
cool but I want to take this one step
further now and add some check boxes
right here
say for example we want to pick a
category of this blog post and we want
to select one or maybe more check boxes
so I want to show you how we can bind
two check boxes so that when we click a
checkbox that's stored in some kind of
property and we can keep track of that
so what we'll do is add a new section
underneath this text area for the check
boxes right so we'll do a little divot
first of all with an ID equal to check
boxes and then inside that we need to
create a series of different check boxes
for the categories of the blog so I'll
do a label first of all for each check
box so what the first one is going to be
for ninjas and I'm going to do all the
labels first of all so then I can just
do the check boxes afterwards so I'll
copy and paste up four times and then
the second category is going to be
wizard the third one is going to be
lore'l and the last one is going to be
teased okay these are some random
categories but I don't care we just want
some important alpha T of type checkbox'
so type can cause check box I'm having a
spelling kind of a problem at the minute
whereby I just can't spell words so do
bear with me anyway the value for this
one is going to be equal to something or
other we'll fill that in in a minute and
we're also going to attach a V model to
this as well I'm going to talk about
this in a minute for now I'm just going
to copy and paste this a few times down
here so we've got four check boxes like
so
okay then now how is this going to work
basically what we're doing is a touching
a V model property to each one of these
individual check boxes right so does
this need to be a different view model
for each one for example ninjas wizards
and then something else and then
something else well no that's not the
way this works and this is where ujf
starts its from a little bit magic
because it takes care of a lot of things
for us behind the scenes so all we need
to do is passing one the v-model
into these things right here so that all
the same and we're going to store this
on a property called categories on the
blob object remember we have the blog
object stored on this thing down here so
we could add another thing in that
object called categories and because we
could add one option for the blog or
even two categories for the blog there
could be a list of thing right so this
makes sense if we have an array for the
categories right
and we're storing which imports we want
to store in this array so let's do that
for now and then let's add blog
categories to the v-model
so now what we're doing is attaching at
these check boxes to this category's
property on the blog object right which
is stored down here as an array so what
the UGS now is going to do for us is
when we click this check box and it's
checked it's going to add whatever the
value of this is here to that array
awesome right so now for example I could
do ninjas here and then down below here
I could do this one which is a wizards
then I could do Mario and finally T's
okay so if we click this import so it's
checked it's going to add this to be
irate if we also click this it's going
to add this to the array if we unclick
this is going to take away this from the
array so now we can store which
categories are checked in this array and
they're going to be stored as strings so
that is pretty awesome review jess is
taking a care of a lot of the kind of
background work forward here so let us
just have a look first of all how this
is in a browser
I want to refresh so I can first it
helps if we saved then it refresh now we
have these input boxes but I just want
to make them look a little bit better so
just a couple of lines of CSS are needed
and they're also on the github
repository I'm just going to type these
in because it's only a couple of rules
so
first of all checkboxes this is the ID
we use the buffer the div containing all
the checkboxes input so each one of the
input fields each one of the checkboxes
we're going to display as inline - block
and then also give them a margin I've
been at write of 10 petals cool one more
checkbox is label we want to stand up
the labels as well so they're not left
out and we're just going to display
those as in line block - so while that
this should look a bit better next to
each other like so okay cool so now
we've done that what about outputting
these to the preview area because right
now if I click this and I click this
there's no way to see that this date has
been added yet it has been added to this
array but we can't see that there's no
physical way of seeing it and I want to
see it in this preview section so now
we've added them let's output them here
in the preview section so I'm going to
come under block its content and do ap
same blog categories come on and then
underneath here I'm going to do with ul
and each Li in this UL is going to
output whichever categories Berean so if
it's wizards and cheese like over here
then they'll be a life of wizards and
MLI for teas right now I can't hard code
those because I don't know what's been
added at the time we need to dynamically
output these so if we have an array of
data and we want to output that array of
data we want to cycle through it what
can we use yep we can use v4 to cycle
through data that's in a previous
tutorial to get back to that if you've
forgotten about it but essentially we
can just say 3 - 4 is equal to then we
can say category and making this name up
right here it's just singular for
categories because this is called
categories right so category in
categories this is going to cycle
through that array and then we can
output the category or right here except
it's blog categories right because it's
stored on this blog object so now I can
output the category right here each time
around so it's given us this each time
it cycles through and we
output that item right there so if I
save this now then we can see blood
categories right here and if I start to
add different categories it's going to
add them to this property categories on
the blog object we're cycling through
them and it's going to output each one
right here okay if I unselect them it's
going to take them off the array
therefore we don't see them on the page
so there we go that is how we bind to
checkboxes and in the next video we're
going to do some more data binding this
time it's going to be on select boxes
I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
