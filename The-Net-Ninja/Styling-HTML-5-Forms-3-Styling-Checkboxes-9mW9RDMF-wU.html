html5 form styling tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at
those checkboxes okay so this is the
form so far and in the last tutorial we
start up these radio buttons right here
to show our own custom imagery now I
want to do something similar for these
checkboxes right here so I'm going to
use the same image and it's this check
stock PNG which is an image sprite and
this time I want these two images at the
bottom so we're gonna do something
similar but we're just gonna change the
class here is basically the selectors
rather and the position of those images
so let's come under here checkbox styles
and the first thing I want to do is grab
the input with the type of checkbox so
if we go to the HTML you can see these
three things here they all have an input
type of checkbox these things so again
we can't really style these as they are
so we're going to have to hide them
again and show our own imagery instead
so let's go to the CSS and do that first
of all the same input then use an
attribute to select it to say type
equals checkbox cool and we're going to
do exactly the same as a bolt we're
going to say opacity is zero the width
is going to be zero also and the margin
is also going to be zero so let's save
that and now we shouldn't see those
checkboxes and now I've got the same
problem we don't know what we're
checking here what's checked and what is
not checked
so let's style up the labels again so
this time what I want to do in fact I'll
just grab this thing right here gonna
copy it and paste it down here we'll
just change the names because I'm super
lazy so the first one is label for wet
which is this and you can see I've
labeled I've named these labels right
here so you can see web Photoshop and
Madonna okay so label for web then it's
label for Photoshop and then we have one
more so I'll just copy that dude and
paste it in again and it's gonna be
Madonna okay so the first thing again I
want to do is say display
in line - block then I'm gonna give it a
margin bottom or about 10 pixels then
I'm gonna give it a padding at left of
twenty six pixels as well to make room
for that image so let's save that to see
how it's looking so far cool okay is
there I want to give it that background
image so I'll say background I'm gonna
URL and it's the same image so that's in
the image folder /h X dot PNG and no
probably Pete so let's save that now we
see those images and we just need to
change the background position of them
so there's an empty checkbox is the
empty squares if you like so to do that
I'm gonna say background - position and
this time it's going to be 0 and then
minus 98 pixels for the y-coordinate
that's going to scoot the image right
and obviously getting a bottom of the
image so let's save that cool there and
again you can see the bottom of these
check boxes add cut off so we need to
change the line height of these labels
so it gives it a little bit more room so
I'll say line height let's send it again
- 24 pixels save that and now we can see
those check boxes cool now finally I'm
going to say cursor it is pointer just
so we get that and when we hover over
them awesome
so same again if we're clicking means we
still can't see that the checked so we
need to again look for the checked state
of these inputs and we can do that again
using the checked pseudo class all right
there so we're going to look for these
checked input so we're gonna grab this
again and I'm gonna paste this dude down
here now we're going to look for the
labels which are next to these input
fields so we're going to say input then
colon then checked that's the pseudo
class to check for in a checked input
field then we're going to paste these
labels after them using the adjacent
selector which is a plus so now this is
looking for the label which comes after
a checked
input field alright so if that exists
it's going to style it differently so
I'm going to paste this dude a couple of
times down here so we've got one for
each one and change the
to photoshop and this one to Madonna and
then we're going to stir those up again
as well so what do we want to do we want
to change the background position of
these things and we'll change that from
minus 98 of minus 65 pixels so that's
kind of coming down a little bit and now
we can see those checked things right
here cool right and also we want to set
the text to be read just like above as
well when it is checked so we'll say
color and then the color was let's just
grab it from up here because I can't
remember it okay there it is and paste
it in save that and now we have that red
color as well when a field is checked
awesome and this is working still as
well so there we go that is how we stand
up checkboxes and those radio buttons
start to look a lot better now this form
kind of matches the theme of the website
if you like in the next tutorial what
we're gonna do is carry on and stand up
this field set right here and the input
boxes in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
