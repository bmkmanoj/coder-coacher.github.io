more thing before we move on and start
to create that farm validation in the
second hour for this series and that is
how to much alternate characters or
words and we do that using the pipe
symbol like a sow so it's a straight
line going down and you might have seen
a double pipe symbol in JavaScript
meaning or well a single pipe in regular
expressions means all as well so say for
example we wanted to match either P or
we do a pipe T this here will match
either P or T so if I do a P it's gonna
match if I do a t it's gonna match if we
do any other character it's not going to
match okay so what if I wanted to match
either player or tire well what would
you think we can't just do why are ye
here because this is saying well much
either P or tire it's not saying much
PRT then I err if I do player this will
not work it just matches this P at the
start however if I do tire then it does
work and the T on its own doesn't work
because like I said we're not matching
PRT or matching P or tire okay so what
if I wanted to do something like this or
if I wanted to for example much either
pyre or tire well this is going to match
either of those two words so if I change
this to pyre then that's going to match
as well but a simpler way to do this
since why our East stays the same on
both sides
is to enclose the or in a set of
parenthesis so if we do P then pipe then
T we're saying okay well this should
match either PRT then after this yr e so
pyre now matches but also it's higher or
much okay so what these parenthesis do
right here is say to the regular
expression look I want you to evaluate
this part right here as a separate
entity if you like treat it as its own
mini regular expression then the next
off carry on evaluating okay so that's
how we can do something like this and
again if we wanted to you know
much maybe three things we can do
something like that so we could say
in here pets I don't know toy I'm into
another pipe symbol crazy then get rid
of yr8 I'll do a space first of all then
rub it so now this is get a match either
pet space rabbit toy space rub it or
crazy space rub it okay
so let's try that pet rub it
this gets a match toy rub it and let's
put the global flag on here so we can
match each one this gets a match I'm
finally crazy rabbit if we spell it
correctly
also it gets a match but if we do
anything else like I don't know hello
rabbits
this is not gonna match let's just bring
something in from our previous tutorials
let's try adding on a question mark
after this set of parentheses right here
so what we're saying now is everything
inside these parentheses when you
evaluate that separately
whatever's in there is gonna be optional
it can appear either 0 or 1 times so if
we take away all this stuff here
then space rabbit will also get a match
because all of this stuff here is now
optional the space isn't optional but
this stuff within it is optional okay so
that's how we use these type symbols to
say look I want to match one thing or
another and that's how we also use
parentheses to evaluate certain parts of
our regular expressions separately
before we move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
