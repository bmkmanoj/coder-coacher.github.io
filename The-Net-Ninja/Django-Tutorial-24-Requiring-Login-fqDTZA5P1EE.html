24th a django tutorial and in this video
i'm gonna show you how to protect pages
that require login okay then so our
application is now starting to take
pretty good shape we can now sign up to
the application log in and log out now
the whole idea of authentication is so a
user can sign in and then view pages
that a person who's not signed in
couldn't write we're authenticating the
user so they can do additional things so
say for example a user can add articles
to this list now we only want users who
are logged in and authenticated to be
able to view that page where a user can
add an article so I guess you could say
that login is required for that page
right we don't want normal users to go
okay I want to add an article and view
that form to add a new article we need
them to be logged in to do that we need
to authenticate them and require their
login so how can we do that how can we
protect certain pages to require login
before user sees them pretty simply so
what we'll do in this tutorial is create
a template for a user to add a new
article then we'll protect that page
we'll say if you want to view this page
you need to be logged in right so first
of all let's create inside the articles
over here a URL to create a new article
so we need to do this above this one
right here the slug one because if we
add this for example URL and then
rostering current and then create or
something like that say that's the the
URL create and if we add that below this
URL and we type in okay so go to
articles forward slash create then it's
going to look at this one first of all
and think that that creates after
articles is actually the slug and it's
going to try and find an article with
that slug and show us the article detail
page right so we don't want to do that
we want to put the
URL before the slug once so it reaches
this first of all and fires this URL
when we type and create make sense okay
cool so forward slash after that and
then dollar sign and then outside of
this the second parameter is going to be
the view function that we want to fire
so views and then we'll call this
article underscore create we've not
created that yet we'll do it in a second
the name of this URL is going to be
create okay cool so now we've created
that URL we can create the view now so
let's close this off we'll close these
as well and open up our views inside the
articles app and underneath here we'll
create a new function now and this is
going to be called article create so def
article underscore create it takes the
request object first of all and inside
we just want to return a render of a
template the creation template so we'll
return a render and inside the request
object is always first then the template
now that's going to be inside the
articles folder forward slash and we'll
call this article understood underscore
create HTML all right
so when we go to forward slash articles
forward slash create this function will
fire and return this template to us so
we need to go inside the articles folder
first of all inside templates and then
create an article create template so new
file article underscore create dot HTML
cool so what is this template get a lot
like well eventually it's going to be a
form so a user can add their own title
their own slug upload upload their own
image and add their own body content but
for now for the sake of this tutorial I
just wanted to create a very very simple
template just a h2 something like that
so first of all inside here we're going
to extend from the base layout so we
need our template tags first of all and
then we say extends
and that is single quotes bass
underscore layout HTML then we need to
block down here so template tags again
and block is going to be called content
and we need to end the block as well and
block cool now the content like I said
keep it very simple to begin with a div
and I'll give this a class of create -
article we'll use that to style it up
later on and then a h2 inside this which
will say create an awesome new article
alright cool
so if we go to forward slash create now
this function should fire and return
that template let's try it forward slash
create enter and we get create an
awesome new article now even though I'm
logged out right now I can still go to
this create page which eventually will
have a create form on it now I don't
want that I want to protect this page so
the only people that are logged in can
view it and if we're not logged in then
we'll redirect them to the login page or
something like that
how do we do that dead simply all we
need to do is add a decorator to the top
of this function and a decorator
basically just extends the function it
adds additional functionality to it but
first of all we need to import that
decorator so we'll do that at the top
will say from Django dot contrib dots
off dots decorators import and it's
called login underscore required and by
the way if you want to learn more about
decorators and go over them in quite a
lot of depth in my Python 3 for
beginners course so feel free to check
that out the link is going to be down
below so now we've imported that we can
use the decorator on top of this
function and the way we use a decorator
is by using an @ symbol first of all
then the name of the decorator login
underscore required
parentheses at the end now this is
protecting this view right so
if it users not logged in when this view
function is fired then it's going to say
hey actually you need to be logged in
for this to work now what I said was if
you're not logged in and we try to
access this I want to redirect them to
the login page to say you need to be
logged in basically so we can supply
that in here we can say what the login
underscore your where L is so Django is
going to say hey this requires login
the login URL is here I'm going to
supply it to you so please redirect this
user if they're not logged in to that
URL so that they can login so the login
URL is going to be forward slash
accounts forward slash a login forward
slash so they're going to redirect us to
their if we're not logged in so fingers
crossed and hope this works let's go
back or refresh over here now I'm going
to make sure i'm logged out to begin
with then i'll try to go to create and
because i'm not logged in it's not
letting me see that page it's
redirecting me instead to the login page
which is awesome now there's one problem
with this if i then go to login it's
redirecting me back to the article
listing page really if i'm redirected
from the create page to the login page
after i've logged in and liked it to
redirect to the create page again now
it's not just as simple as saying well
okay if that's the functionality one go
to your accounts views over here and
instead of redirecting them to article
listings right here and right here
redirect them to the create URL well
it's not that simple because what if i
just go directly to forward slash
accounts /login without trying to add a
new article it makes no sense that if i
then login it redirects me to the create
article screen because I'm not trying to
access that in the first place so we
need a way for Django to recognize where
we've come from when we've tried to add
a new article and then when we log in
redirect us to that page where we
originally came from and there is a way
we can do this which I'm going to show
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
