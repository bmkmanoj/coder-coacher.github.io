regular expressions that have special
meanings and these are known as meta
characters now there's way too many meta
characters for me to explain each one in
this video but what I will do is explain
some of the more common ones then leave
a link down below to a list of the rest
of them so you can check them out
in your own time so first of all
backslash D this will match any digit
character and it's the same as writing a
zero to nine range inside a character
set these are going to do pretty much
the same thing so this is the first
metacharacter i wanted to show you next
is backslash w and this will match any
word character now this can be a bit
confusing when you first start out
because if someone said word character
to me I'd automatically think well that
must be letters A to Z but it can also
include numbers and underscores so
backslash W this meta character matches
lowercase letters uppercase letters zero
to nine and underscores next is
backslash S and this will match a
whitespace character such as a space or
a tub and then finally backslash T this
will match a tab character only now
notice this in front of each of these
letters DW s and T there is a backslash
okay this is what escapes the normal
behavior of those letters and turns them
into a meta character with special
abilities all right so if you imagine we
have a regular expression if we were to
place a D in that regular expression
then that would match by default the
literal character D okay if we place a
backslash in front of that D then it
escapes the normal behavior of the D and
turns it into a meta character and now
this match is any digit character the
same is true for each of these letters W
would match the literal character W in a
regular expression but place a backslash
before it and it becomes a meta
character which will match any word
character all right then so let's try
out a few of these meta characters so
first of all I want to try out backslash
D and remember if you're unsure as to
what something means over here in the
reject pattern then you can always
look in the explanation and it's gonna
say exactly what it does
I remember back slash deep matches any
digit character from 0 to 9 so if I type
in 0 it works 5 works
8 it works and 9 that also works we get
matches on all of those so that's pretty
straightforward
ok next backslash W and remember this is
any word character and it says exactly
what it matches over here so first of
all let's try a V Werks
capital a capital B they work letters
and numbers remember so 0 that works 6
we get a match 9 we get a match and
finally underscores as well that gets a
match but if we try something like an @
symbol this is not included in this
thing right here so that doesn't match
ok
and finally I'll show you backslash s
which is any whitespace character so if
I do a space and get a match if I do a
tab I get a match as well ok so let's
try a little combination of each one of
these in one regular expression so if I
start off with backslash d I'm saying I
want the first character to be a digit a
number from 0 to 9 then if I do
backslash S I'm saying I want the second
counter to be some kind of whitespace
then if I do backslash W I'm saying I
want the third character to be any word
character so the first one is a digit
let's do one then it's a white space for
the second one right here
then it's any word character so I'll do
em and now we get a match okay so this
regular expression is matching this kind
of pattern and it could be something
like v sub P and that will get a match
even though these two things are very
different they both match in this
regular expression a digit first then
some kind of white space then a word
character both of these match in that
pattern okay so let's do something a
little bit more complex and bring in
some of the things we learned in the
previous tutorials so we'll say after
the D here we'll open our curly braces
and put a 3 in there and remember this
means I want the thing before it to
repeat 3
so I'm saying I want the first three
characters of the patent to be digit so
three numbers okay then after the S I'm
just gonna leave that in fact we just
want one whitespace then after the W
I'll do a five in curly braces meaning I
want to end this expression in a five
letter word or it could be words and
numbers anything that's a word character
okay so let's try this out first of all
we need three digits so one two three
that's fine
then a single whitespace could be a
space or a tablets with you then I'll do
a five letter word so I'll do ninja now
we get a match okay let's do a different
example nine eight seven then a tab and
then hello that also matches cool but if
we were to do two white spaces we don't
get a match right here because we're
saying we only want right here to have
one whitespace likewise we could add in
a number this matches over here but if
we were to add a letter at the start
then this is not going to much because
we've seen the first three characters
has to be a digit and we only have two
and then a letter okay so I hope this
all makes sense and I hope you're
beginning to see beyond the gobbledygook
when you look at something like this and
you can begin to understand of what
exactly these different meta characters
mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
