CSS grid tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how to create a
responsive layout using CSS grid and
grid areas so in the last video I showed
you how we could use these grid areas to
give each different element inside our
grid a name so these things down here
we're given each one of these a grid
area name then we can use the grid
template areas property on the grid
itself to distribute these different
grid areas on to the web page inside the
grid right so each different line here
is a different row and each of these is
in a different column right so we're
distributing this content onto the grid
and that is awesome in itself but the
real power comes into play where we want
to make a responsive design so say for
example I want this to be the desktop
display right so the positioned in these
areas on the grid on the desktop but
somewhere else on a mobile we can do
that really simply so first of all I
want to encompass this in a media query
which is going to tag it screens that
are wider than say 760 pixels so we're
going to target things like desktops and
laptops here right so let's wrap it in a
media query first of all we'll say that
media and it's gonna be screen and the
mucks hive or rather min - width is
going to be 760 pixels right so the
minimum width of the browser has to be
760 pixels for this to take effect now
let's save this and view it in a browser
so right now this is less than 760
pixels which is why we're not getting
this layout right here the minimum width
of the viewport has to be 760 pixels so
as we get larger 760 pixels is switches
to this layout otherwise right here is
stacking its default behavior right so
we don't want it to stack on smaller
screens we want to create some kind of
tablet or mobile layout if you like
which is slightly different then this
layout for the desktop so the way we're
going to do that is by just creating
this thing all over again so I'm going
to copy
instead of writing it all out again and
paste it right above here okay so this
is gonna be the default display for
mobiles but when it reaches a minimum
width of 760 pixels it's gonna apply
this display instead make sense okay
cool so what do we want to do on a
mobile well first of all what we want to
do is have the header all the way across
at the top so that's not going to change
then you know what I want the footer to
appear underneath the header because
there's going to be some information
about how to contact us and stuff like
that that's important so one not to go
just as a thin strip underneath the the
header on mobile displays so instead of
all this junk I'm gonna say footer
footer footer and footer and if I save
this now we're not getting anything
great at the minute because now we've
got the footer at the bottom and the top
and that doesn't really make sense so if
you do something like this it's gonna
look like junk on your screen okay you
need to distribute it properly so that
it's not all in two separate places
because it can't stretch from this row
to this row and place this in between so
we need to get rid of this for now
because we don't want it at the bottom
as well so if we save it now we can see
that the footer now is there underneath
the header right so now what do we want
to do we've got the header and we've got
the footer what do we want underneath it
well I'm going to put the main all the
way across like so and then underneath
this I want another row which is going
to be the main as well so I'll say main
main main main so the main is spreading
across two rows next to each other so
it's okay when you've got the main
across two different rows are or the
green areas across two different rows
when they're next to each other just not
when they're apart okay so we have the
main after the footer after that I want
to enter in the aside so I'll say aside
aside that's going to be on the left of
the screen on the right we're gonna have
the nav so now that nav on the right
then we're gonna have the section right
at the bottom now the last thing we need
to do is add on that semicolon don't
forget that otherwise it might not
display as you intend to so now we can
see this display where we have the
header then the footer
the main than the aside the nav section
it matches up to this display right here
this kind of template right so that's
for small screens like so but when we
get to seven hundred and sixty pixels
it's gonna switch into this layout right
here so how awesome is that and how
simple is it to rearrange content
depending on your screen size if we
didn't use CSS grid for this we'd
probably have to either double up on the
footer so create it twice in the HTML
then display one for the desktop and one
for the mobile so they're in different
places but that's not very semantic it's
just extra unneeded content or we'd have
to do some jiggery-pokery or you some
JavaScript to move the element dependent
on the screen size and again that's not
really a good choice it feels kind of
hacky and I don't like doing that this
however just makes it really really easy
to do it we can rearrange elements so so
simply dependent on the screen size okay
so there we go that's how we can use
grid areas for different display sizes
and that concludes this series so I
really hope you've learned a little bit
at least about CSS grid and I hope you
see the benefits of it one more thing
that well mention at the time of
recording this it's not fully supported
in Internet Explorer or edge but what I
will do is leave a link to a support
grid which is going to show you browser
support for CSS grid at your time of
watching so if you're unsure whether to
use a note you can click on this link
check out the support and then make your
decision but to be honest I'm going to
start using it pretty soon I hope you've
enjoyed this if you do like these videos
