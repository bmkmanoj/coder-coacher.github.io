lesson in CSS for beginners and in this
lesson we're gonna take what we've
learned so far to do with font styling
and we're gonna stand up some links
that's coming up Wow okay so the first
thing we need to do is pop a link tag in
this document and we're just going to do
it underneath this header div so
remember to do that it's just an anchor
tag and then we'll give it any old age
reference for now it doesn't really
matter and this is a link can be the
text then we'll close that brackets to
be gone we don't need it twice and we'll
save that and in fact what we're gonna
do is just copy that and paste it a
couple of times so we've got a few links
now all right there so let's target
these links all we need to do is do it
simple a selector and we're going to use
some of the properties we've learnt
already in previous videos but before we
do that I want to show you what these
links currently look like use them the
default browser styles so I'm gonna get
this open up in a browser and there you
have three links and there are blue and
underlined so you know it's pretty
obvious to me and probably you that
these are all links that's the aim
people know that they should click on
them now so we're gonna apply some of
our own styling because we might have a
website where the blue underlined links
don't fit in and we want to do something
different with them so the first thing
we're going to do is add a color
property and we're just going to choose
a groovy color from one of these so
which one do I like buildable do I love
it
crimson I quite like that all right so
we'll give that a crimson color what
should we do next
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do is take
off the text-decoration:underline don't
really like that it's too predictable
so I'm gonna give this a non value and
then we'll give it a font-weight:bold
now because it's not underlined maybe
people won't understand that it's meant
to be clicked and they might just assume
I'm trying to make this word stand out
for some reason but I think the fact
that it says this is a link can gives it
away so we can get away with it in this
case so we've done at a
Styles here let's just view it in a
browser see what it's looking like cool
so now they are all this crimson color
there's no one to line and due to the
fact that it says this is a link it's
pretty obvious it's a link so that's
cool
now what we'd normally do when we do a
stat for a link is give it a hover
effect as well so that when someone
hovers over it
they know it's a link or they know the
hovering over that link and it just
looks cool anyway doesn't it so let's do
the hover pseudo-class so remember we do
our pseudo classes by specifying is a
pseudo class with the colon and then we
just read the hover keyword and then
we're gonna give it a color just look
for another cool color yeah what we got
let's go for dark my chair now that
looks pretty cool and then we're gonna
give it a text-decoration:underline and
you know what we're gonna give it a
background color
I know we've not technically done a
background color yet but let's give it
one anyway let's go with this aquamarine
this is just gonna look absolutely
awesome guys if you need links designing
you know where to come
let's get this open up in a browser all
right so the rock crimson underwear no
one to learn in yeah BAM that is pretty
awesome it looks like a website I made
when I first learnt CSS it's not really
awesome it's terrible but you get the
point you know you can add all of these
properties and where's our sin sighs God
you can get some pretty cool-looking
links or buttons and we're gonna cover a
little bit more to do with buttons later
on you know things like padding and
margin but for now that should get you
started with making some cool links of
your own if you have any comments or
questions leave those below otherwise if
