regular expressions are so useful in web
development let's start out by trying a
few simple ones ourselves so to do this
I'll be using an online tool called
regex 101.com
the link is going to be down below and
the first thing you want to do is make
sure that you have JavaScript selected
as the flavor down here because this is
what we'll be using to create our form
validation later on the next thing I
want you to do is click on this flag
over here and make sure that this global
flag is deselected and it doesn't have
that tick right there I don't want that
to affect us to begin with but it will
explain exactly what this flag is and
what it can do for us later on so in a
nutshell this website will allow us to
create regular expressions and test them
against some text to see if we get a
match for example we could right up here
where we write our regular expressions a
regex for an email address and then down
below we can write an email address to
see if it passes the regex
okay so instead of starting with an
email address let's start with something
more simple I'm going to create a
regular expression which looks for the
word ninja in this text down below and
yeah regular expressions don't have to
be super complicated strings or
seemingly random characters they can
also be very simple and focused like
this one so first of all before I type
anything notice the forward slash at the
start and the forward slash at the end
this is how we format regular
expressions they're always contained
within these two forward slashes and
then the pattern goes in between them so
like I said I just want to look for the
word ninja in the text down below so my
regular expression is literally going to
be ninja that's how simple it is and you
can see an explanation of this regex
over here it says ninja matches the
characters ninja literally
case-sensitive so now if I type in ninja
down here then you can see it highlights
and we get one match and that much
information is down here it's a full
match so it passes this regex
okay now
what happens if I type something after
this so if I type in Wow Wow
something like that we still get a match
and this is because in our regex we're
not saying that this string right here
has to be ninja and only ninja we're
just saying that it must find ninja
somewhere in this text and it does so
what if we type instead of this ninja
then ninja again well we don't get a
second match we still only get one match
and that's because this regex pattern
right here is looking for the first
instance of this ninja word that it
finds in the text and just returning
that one match the first one it comes
across however if we go to our flag icon
again and click on a global then what
it's going to do is look for more than
one match so no matter how many times we
type in ninja is going to match them all
so this is what this G does over here
this thing right here is known as a flag
and there's different flags you see all
these different ones here and they all
do different things this g1 after the
final forward slash is saying hey I want
this search if you like to be global I
want to find all the matches in the text
and not just the first one that you come
across so another test let's see if we
type a capital n now we don't get a
match and that's because remember this
is case sensitive okay now another flag
that we can use is this I flag called
insensitive and basically that means
that when we're looking for matches we
want this to be case insensitive and now
we have that flag activated it's finding
this match it's no longer disregarding
it okay it now matches regardless of
whether it's a capital and it could be
all in capital two if you want or you
know a mixture it doesn't really matter
okay it's now case insensitive so
there's two little flags that we can use
as well to enhance our regular
expression if you like and don't worry
if you think I'm moving too quickly for
now we're going to be going over this
many many times as we go forward through
the series so anyway now we have the
basics of regex under control let's move
on in the next lesson and do something a
little bit more taxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
