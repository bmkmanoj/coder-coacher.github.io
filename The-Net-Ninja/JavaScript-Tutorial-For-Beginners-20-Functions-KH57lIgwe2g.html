JavaScript for beginners lesson 20 and
in this video we're going to take a
first look at functions Wow alright so
first things first what the hell is a
function well when you write lots of
code when you get better at JavaScript
it's going to get bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger right and pretty soon
it's going to get messy you don't know
which code is where you know which parts
of the code are performing which actions
etc hard to update now this is where
functions step in essentially functions
group logical sections of code together
so that you can call that section of
code whenever you want to alright and it
will perform those actions for you for
example we could have a function that
works out the average of some numbers
for you and returns the answer or you
could have a function which goes on to
your web page finds all the links and
perform some kind of animation on them
ok so we can have all different kinds of
functions which group our code together
in logical sections and then we call
those functions later on when we want to
run that code make sense yeah okay so
let's write one now the first thing we
need to do is specify that we're going
to write a function and to do that we
have to write the keyword function and
that's saying hey whatever is coming up
now is a function next thing we need to
do is write a name for this function and
the same naming rules apply to functions
as the variable naming rules okay so we
can have numbers letters Dom sign on the
scores we can't have a number at the
beginning but the rest we can do I'm
going to call this get average all right
so that's the name of my function next
thing we need to do is write some
parentheses now these parentheses can be
empty however if we're passing variables
or values into this function for example
I will be doing in this get average
function because I'm going to be passing
it in some values to work out the
average from then we specify those
variables those local variables in these
brackets so I'll just call these a and B
okay and then we can use a and B within
the foot
the next thing I've done just now is
write these curly braces and this is the
code block this is where we're going to
write the code that is executed every
time we call this function all right so
to work out the average is pretty simple
well first of all create a variable
called average and this is what it's
going to store the the number average
know what color average and we'll say is
a plus B we'll put those in parentheses
because we want that addition to be
worked out first and then divide it by
two okay
dead simple all it's doing is taking
this variable here adding it to this
variable and then dividing it by two
then storing the result in this variable
called average that we've created all
right and what we'll do is console.log
average so whatever we work out being
stored in this variable then we're going
to log that variable to the console all
right but that's not going to run on its
own for this code to run we have to call
it and the way to call it is by just
writing the function name so it's called
get average and it's actually popped up
here in intellisense because it
recognizes that we've already created
its function so I'll just click there
and then we have to write the curl of
not the curly braces the parentheses to
call it and then put our semicolon at
the end because this is a statement
where you're as in statements with
semicolons remember now if this function
didn't take any values if it was like
that then this would be fine but because
it does take values it takes two values
a and B then we have to specify those
here now I want to get the average of I
don't know seven and twelve okay so
that's the way I pass them through the
first one when we call get average is
going to be assigned to a and the second
number is going to be assigned to B so
this is going to be seven a this is
going to be 12 so 7 plus 12 is 19
divided by 2 is going to be nine point
five that's the average right so we're
going to log that to the console so
let's save this now and run it in a
browser and now we can see is log in
this nine point five the answer to the
console alright so what happens if we
don't give these well let's give it a
whirl we'll save that and refresh it and
now we get this ma n which we've seen
before
and it's saying the result is not a
number because these are not going to be
numbers because we've not passed them
into here and so the outcome is not
going to be a number either so we have
to pass these variables in what happens
if we pass three seven eight and nine
let's work that out save that and
refresh now it still gives us an answer
which is seven point five and if we
times that by two that's fifteen so it
must have taken in these two numbers
because seven plus eight is 15 so
essentially when you're passing in
additional numbers anything additional
at the end is ignored okay seven will be
assigned to a eight will be assigned to
be but this nine because it's not needed
is going to be ignored all right then so
that is how we write functions and now
this might look a little bit similar to
some other things we've done in the past
I'll just refresh your memory if we
write alert hello this is the same
format this here is a built-in function
of JavaScript so we're calling that
function and then we're passing in a
value of hello okay because the alert
function might look something like this
function alert string that will be the
variable name and then it's going to do
some code here which is going to make a
pop-up appear on your webpage which is
going to print out this string okay so
it's the same as all the inbuilt
functions that you see in JavaScript
right now functions can also return a
value this value here is being stored in
a variable and then we just log in that
value to the console right now if we
wanted to store this value here in an
external variable let's get rid of this
name
let's say for example VAR my result
equals get average then we'd have to
return a value
okay so we'll return average so what's
happening here is we're saying okay we
want a new variable comment my result
I'm going to set that variable to equal
whatever the result of this is okay
whatever the return value of this is so
we're going to call this function it's
going to passing these two numbers a and
B work out the average of them it's
going to log the average to the console
but then it's also going to return this
average variable so this average
variable is being returned here and it's
going to set the number to be equal to
my result okay
so then when we call my result let's
just console that log and we'll say the
average is and then we'll concatenate my
result that is going to print out to the
console the result of this all right so
let's save it and refresh over here yep
the average is 7.5 so it's returned the
value here stored that in my result and
then with console we've logged that to
the console right here alright so then
what if we want to pass in more values
well we can pass it in as many as we
want we could say b c d e f etc etc okay
and we could give those in here we could
say 9 10 11 and 12 let's just save that
and it will still work out the average
oops this is a hundred here we meant to
do 11 save it and refresh after we saved
it
oh that's why a plus B plus C plus D
plus E Plus F ok and we want to divide
it now by one two three four five six
cuz that would be the average let's
refresh and now we get an average over
nine point five alright then guys so
that is the functions in a nutshell if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to comment down below I know this
is quite a complex concept up
first so yeah ask ahead otherwise if you
enjoy these videos please like share
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we going to look at the
variable scope I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
