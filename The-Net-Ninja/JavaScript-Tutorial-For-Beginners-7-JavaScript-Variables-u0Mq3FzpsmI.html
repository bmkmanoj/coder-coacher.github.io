JavaScript for beginners lesson 7 and in
this video we're going to take a look at
variables that's coming up
okay so JavaScript can do some really
cool things and one of those things is
this an image gallery that zooms in when
you click on the image crosses off zooms
in crosses off swipes to the side really
cool and you're going to end up making
programs like this in JavaScript but to
do that you're going to have to learn
the core essentials and at the heart of
that is the JavaScript variable so we're
going to spend this lesson talking in
depth about JavaScript variables so I've
just got this simple HTML page that I
made and I've got the console open here
in google dev tools and we're just going
to go through the variables in this
console now you're going to be working
with them a lot in JavaScript like I say
they're at the heart of every program
you will make and the key to variables
is that we use them to store information
ok now this could be the x or y
coordinate of an element on your page
for example this is maybe like 20 pixels
from the top and 5 from the left
something like that you could store
those violent values in a variable or it
could be the customers name when they
enter that into a form field you want to
store that in a variable and give them
some kind of personalized welcome
message later on or it could even be a
special value such as true or false
which have billions in JavaScript and
we'll talk about those later on in
different videos so how do we define
variables well we define variables with
the keyword there oops
there there we go there got there
eventually and then after that we put
down our variable name now a variable
name can contain letters numbers
underscores or the pound sign and it can
be whatever you want but they mustn't
start with a number okay so you could
have something like this my variable but
you couldn't have something like this
what my variable you could have my
variable 1 if you like or my variable
underscore what so you can have any
combination of those things you
make but just don't start it with a
number you can't do that okay and
typically when I write my variables what
I do is use camel cakes and that means I
always start with a lowercase letter for
the first word
so my there are lowercase and then for
the beginning of every subsequent word
I'll use a capital letter so variable
with capital v my variable let's just
put my name's Seann capital s that's how
I would write my variables because you
can clearly see each word within that
variable and then we simply end it with
D semicolon and that defines your
variable okay now that variable holds no
information that the the miniport is
allocated a an area of memory in the
program so you can give that information
okay
so later on you could say well okay it's
undefined in the minute that's why it's
returned undefined we've not given it a
value but I could say okay well my
variable Shawn set that equal to ten and
then close it off with a semicolon
remember every statement ends with a
semicolon so now I'm setting that
variable equal to a number okay and then
it returns ten it tells me what that
variable is equal to and so that's how
we define variables and give them values
now we can do that all in one line if we
wanted to we could save there I'll do a
different one my there too I'll call
this and we'll say this equals hello and
this is a string and strings in
JavaScript are contained within quotes
and there could be double quotes or
single quotes I use double quotes and
then we end the statement with a
semicolon so now we've specified that we
want the variable name to be my there
too and we've assigned it of value all
in the same statement we don't have to
do two separate statements like this we
can do it all in one all right so that's
typically what I would do and then we
can call that variable later on my there
too and see what it's equal to and it
gives us back hello okay so that's
what's stored in mine there too now so
when we specify a variable like that
it's undefined
until we give it value and then when we
give it a value it becomes that value
now we can change the value as many
times as we want
say my ver 2 and equals hello again so
now I'm changing the value of that vowel
that variable and it updates that so if
I call again my there too then it's
going to give me the updated value all
right so we can change the value on
variables as we go along in the program
we can also change the type right a by
type I mean whether it's in number
whether it's a string like this here or
whether it's a boolean which is true or
false or an array or an object will go
into all the different types later on
but just know that you can change the
types of variables so I could say well
now I want my there to to be equal to 5
okay
and that is a number so now it's going
to give me about 5 so it was a string
now it's a number all right now although
you can do this in JavaScript I don't
like doing it and I would advise you not
to do it as well because it gets a
little confusing now I like to name my
variables in a logical way so I might
say their customer age equals I don't
know 32 yet 32 years old now if I put
customer age and get that back it's
gonna give me 32 now I'm not going to go
giving that customer age variable a
string like Susan or mark you know the
name of the customer I'm always going to
keep it as a number and that's why I
always like to keep the type the same
JavaScript will let you change the type
unlike all the programming languages
which don't however I always like to
keep the type the same and this is
what's known as dynamic types javascript
has dynamic types because they can
change all right now in other
programming languages you have to
specify the type of variable when you
initialize it so whereas we say my 3
equals I don't know 40 yeah
we're not saying well hey this is a
number whereas in other programming
languages we might have to do something
like this instead of writing there we'd
say int and my there 3 equals
faulty okay now this would be a
different programming language not
JavaScript we're specifying that this is
an integer okay it's not just any old
variable it's an integer in JavaScript
we don't have to do that everything
status which is the keyword there over
and then your variable and it can be a
string a number an object a boolean
anything you want it to be okay so that
is what's called a weakly typed language
and that's what javascript is it's
weakly typed because we don't have to
specify the exact type of the variable
whether it's a number string or anything
else when we initialize it so I think
that just about covers variables from a
bird's eye perspective and we're going
to go into detail about all the
different types of variables and what we
can do with them later in this playlist
but for now that gives you like a
general overview of what they are the
takeaway points are that we initialize
variables with the VAR keyword and we
can set them to empower you in the same
statement much like this thing here and
the second takeaway point is that they
can contain and the names of the
variables can contain letters numbers
underscores i but the can't start with a
number okay third takeaway point is try
to have a specific naming convention
like camelcase here and so they all look
the same and it's not confusing
I prefer to do something like that I
recommend you do two and fourth takeaway
point you can change the type of
variables however not necessarily a good
thing I don't like to do it recommend
you don't do it too and the last
takeaway point is we don't have to
specify the type of the variable when we
initialize it okay so that's all it is
for variables at the moment like say
we'll go forward and cover them some
more in later lessons if you have any
questions for now feel free to comment
down below I'll answer all of those
