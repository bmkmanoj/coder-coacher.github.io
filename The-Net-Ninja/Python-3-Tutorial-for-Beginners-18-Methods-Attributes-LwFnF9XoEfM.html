18th paisa 3 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about methods and
attributes all right there so we've
created this class of planet and so far
we've looked at these attributes right
here so that when we create an instance
of this planet we give it these
attributes and also this method right
here orbit which when we create an
instance of this class it gets this
orbit method as well now these two
things here this method and these
attributes they are known as instance
attributes and instance methods right
meaning they're unique to the instance
for example these are instance
attributes because they're different for
each instance make sense
Haase has a name of Hoth whereas Naboo
has a name of Naboo they are specific to
each individual instance right and also
this print out differently for each
individual instance because we're
inputting this dynamic data so wherever
we basically see this self injected into
a method down here then it's an instance
method and also anything defined within
this init function right here this is an
instant attribute now there's different
types of attributes and methods not just
instance ones for example we can apply
class level attributes to this and the
way we do that is by coming outside of
this init function just a bit maybe
and defining our attribute right here
for example we could say something like
shape is equal to round and we do that
there because all planets are round
right so it's not going to be unique to
each individual instance this attribute
because all planets share the same shape
so it makes sense to apply a class level
attribute if you have something like
this that is not peculiar to an instance
but the same for all instances okay so
we can apply class level attributes like
that and we can then access this
attribute on for example Hoth and
instance class or we can access it this
way as well I'm just going to come down
here and say prints
and then I'm going to use the planet
class and then dots shade okay so I'm
not using an instance of this class this
is the class itself because we can use
this duck-shaped property on it because
it's a class level attribute okay so if
I save that I'm just going to run this
file now and now we see round and the
same is going to be true if I say Naboo
okay so in instance they have access to
these attributes as well so let's just
make sure it's still the same cool we
still get round okay sport if I try to
access any of the other attributes on
the class itself for example planets dot
Maine okay I'm trying to access this
thing right here so I'll save it and run
this again then you'll see I get an
error
it says object planet has no attribute
name because these like I said our
instance attributes they're only applied
to individual instances where we create
a new planet okay so that's the
difference between instance attributes
and class level attributes now we can
also have class methods as well so where
is this is an instance method we can
also define class methods as well so the
way we do that is by first of all doing
a little decorator and we'll learn more
about decorators later on so don't worry
too much about this for now and we say
class method and this says that the
function underneath here is a class
method so again this is going to be a
method which is common to all planets
and it's not going to be different for
each individual clear planet so for
example I'll say def Collins so this is
the name of the function and then inside
here it takes an attribute CLS which
refers to this class the planet class
right so it has access to this class
whereas this one has access to the
individual instance self this method
right here has access to the actual
class therefore things like this it has
access to class level attributes so
we're going to define this class method
called comments and underneath all I'm
going to do is return a string so I'll
say return
and this is going to be a formative
string so f first then inside this will
say all planets are and then we're going
to pop in a variable and it could be
listing right here so what we can say
you see LS dot shape so this CL s right
here is passed in it refers to the class
itself and we can say dot shape which is
a class level attribute within that
class okay so we can access those Christ
attributes right there from this CLS so
we'll say because of gravity so all
planets are the shape round because of
gravity so now if I try and use this
method outside and in fact what I'm
going to do is just clean this up a
little bit going to take off off and
some of this stuff as well will just
create the boom and then what we're
going to do is save planet dot and we
can say Commons right because again this
is a class method so it's accessible
from yet to a class as well so I'll save
this let's run it will save Python
classes and it says all planets are
round because of gravity so this class
method is accessible on the class and
instances of the class so I'll say naboo
columns and try that and again we get
all planets around because of gravity
and again this class the planet if we
say planets dots orbit which is an
instance method and try and run this
let's just clear the console triangle
this now then we're going to get an
error because again this is an instance
method so it cannot access this method
right here on the class itself it has to
be from the instance but it can access
class methods make sense ok cool I want
to show you one more thing and that is
static methods so first of all again we
need a decorator and this time it's
called static method ok now again don't
worry too much about what this decorated
does josiya I'm going to talk about
decorators in a future tutorial and then
it will all fall into place just know
for now that this is another type of
method
can attach to these prices and a static
method is basically a method which
doesn't have access to self and it
doesn't have access to the class itself
so anything we find as a class level
attribute as well
it only has access to the parameters
that we pass into it individually so
quick example let's come under here and
I'm going to define a function called
spin and inside here what we'll do is
passing a speed per writer right and
it's going to have a default value as
well just in case we don't pass in a
value it's going to default back to this
one so we'll say 2,000 miles per hour
okay so that's the default of this
variable this parameter so over here I'm
going to return a string return and it's
a formatted string and inside this
string I'm going to say the planets
spins loops and spins at and then we're
going to say the speed right here so the
planet spins and spins at whatever this
is so 2,000 miles per hour okay so now
if we say planet dot spin will this work
well let's find out if I run this file
then we see this method right here
static methods can be used on the class
itself because we get this the planet
spins and spins at 2000 miles per hour
but we don't get access to the class or
self in here only what we pass in right
here so I could passing a speed override
this thing right here which I'm going to
do I'm going to say the planet spins and
spins and this needs to be tapped by the
way and I'll just put a very high speed
so now this should overwrite this thing
right here so that it says the planet
spins and spins at a very high speed so
if we save this and run it again then we
see the planet spins and spins at a very
high speed and again this is accessible
not only on the class itself but also on
the instance
ok so we'll say in the boondocks spin
and this should work as well the planet
spins and spins at a very high speed so
there we go we've got instincts are to
be
available on the instance only we have
class level attributes available on the
instance and class we also have class
methods right here available on the
instance and the class itself and the
static methods we still take anything
except the parameters we pass it
explicitly and they again are accessible
on the instance and the class itself so
it's a lot to digest understand but as
we start to use this more and more it's
going to become more and more
transparent to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
