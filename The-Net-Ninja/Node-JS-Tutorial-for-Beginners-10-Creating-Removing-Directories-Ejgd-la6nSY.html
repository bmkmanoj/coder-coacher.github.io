tenth nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to go ahead and create and
remove directories alright guys so in
the last tutorial what we did was we
read these files and we wrote these
files now in this tutorial what I want
to do is show you how we can create and
remove directories but before we do that
I want to show you one more thing that
we can do with these files and that is
how to delete them so the way we delete
them is again by using this FS module
and we can use a method called unlink so
I can say FS dot unlink and then we pass
through the name of the file we want to
delete now because I'm sitting in the
same directory as these files I can just
pass in the file name which is going to
be right meek txt so if I save this now
and run it through node by saying node
app then this should go ahead and delete
that right knee file which you did cool
but be careful because if I run this
again then I'm going to get an error and
it says right here no such file or
directory and that's because we've
already deleted this file so it's trying
to delete it again even though it
doesn't exist so just be careful that if
you're using this method that the fire
you're trying to delete actually exists
otherwise you will get this error ok
cool so we've delete the file now let's
move on to creating directories and
there's two ways of doing this
synchronously or asynchronously so again
I'm going to go through the synchronous
versions first of all then we'll take a
look at the asynchronous versions later
on so let's create a directory so we'll
use the FS module and the way we create
a directory is by saying MK dir which
stands for make directory and then we
say sync this is asynchronous method
like I said node is very explicit in its
method names so what we need to pass
through here is the directory name that
we want to create now I'm just going to
call this directory stuff so if I save
this now and say node app this is going
to rub through node and go ahead and
create that directory and we can see a
pop up rather stuff cool so then how do
we delete that
trees well we just replaced m'kay with
our n which stands for remove and I'm
going to remove this stuff Directorate
so let's save it I will run this again
through know it by saying node up and
now you'll notice that stuff directory
has been removed so this is how we do it
synchronously and remember that's going
to block up the code so ideally we want
to work asynchronously where we can so
let's change these into asynchronous
methods and the way we do that is just
by removing the sync word from it now
I'm going to go ahead and make a
directory and Kay asynchronously now
remember when we use asynchronous
methods we should use a callback
function to do something once this
action has been completed and we can
pass that callback function through here
as the second parameter and then we'll
do something once it's created this
directory now what I want to do is go
ahead and read this read read up file
readme.txt file rather so I'll say FS
don't read file we did this in the last
tutorial and the file we want to read is
read me txt now remember we need to say
the utf-8 encoding and then we fire a
callback function once this is complete
as well so it's error first in the
parameters and then it's the data we
retrieve so first of all first of all
we're making this directory stuff then
when it's complete we're reading this
file here and we're getting the data so
we can fire this callback function when
it's finished reading the file and pass
the data through which I then want to do
which I then want to pass through into a
new file and create a file in the stuff
directory so I'm going to say FS right
file this time and this is going to
write a file in this directory and again
we learnt this in the last tutorial so I
can say it's in the dot forward slash
stuff directory then the file name is
going to be write me txt and what I want
to write to this file is the data that
we receive right here that we read
so let's go ahead and save this and run
it through note by saying no app and now
you're going to notice it first of all
creates this directory then it reads
this file and then it's going to create
this right move txt file and the
contents is in it cool so this is now an
asynchronous way to create a directory
and do other stuff in between so let's
go ahead and delete this directory now
so say FS are M dir and then we're going
to remove this directory stuff now if I
run this what do you think will happen
is it just going to go ahead and remove
this stuff directory and whatever's
inside it well let's give it a whirl
node app and you'll notice an error and
the error is saying the directory is not
empty so we can't remove a directory
without it being empty so we need to get
rid of this thing first of all I'll
remember I showed you before we can say
FS or link to remove a particular file
and it's in the dot forward slash stuff
directory then it write me dot txt and
we're going to remove that file and then
we can pass in a callback function as
the second parameter or right here and
then once we've removed that file we can
go ahead and remove the directory so
let's save that and run it through node
one more time node app and it goes ahead
removes the file first of all and then
the stuff folder disappears as well that
was just Adam catching up all right
that's why we still saw it on the left
but when I clicked on it it disappeared
so that is how we remove a directory
using the async method as well cool so
now we've seen how to remove files
create directories and remove
directories and the questions leave
those down below otherwise guys I'll see
you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
