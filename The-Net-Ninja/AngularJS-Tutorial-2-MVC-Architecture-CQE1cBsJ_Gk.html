second angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about MVC
architecture Wow okay there's so
angularjs uses MVC architecture in its
approach to creating web applications
now MVC architecture is just a
programming methodology which aims to
split our application up into three core
components and that is models views and
controllers and then these three
components combine to form our
application okay so the model you can
just think of as a data and that can be
JSON data or data data from a database
in angularjs whatever the data we use is
just called the model for example if we
ever see a list of users stored in a
user's object in JavaScript the model
would be the users okay or the model
could be something as small as a numeric
value which stores the age of a person
something like that either way the model
is just the data that we work with in
angularjs now to show the data to users
in a web browsers we use views and that
is just the V in MVC so in angularjs a
view is just a kind of HTML template
which represents a certain view or state
in your application for example we might
have a view which displays a list of
active users on your website now we can
insert a model data into our views by
what's called using what's called
expressions in angularjs and we'll talk
about expressions later on but
essentially they look something like
this so we've got an HTML tag and then
within that HTML tag we can do use these
curly braces to pop our data within it
and that's going to dynamically show the
data to your user okay now finally to
see in MVC stands for controllers and
this is where we literally control the
functionality of our views
it's the JavaScript that controls the
interaction between our models which is
the data and I've used kind of let the
bridge between them which allows data to
pass between them okay so controllers
can react to actions on a page such as
clicking a button and then decide what
to do in response to that click for
example go
going out to a model grabbing data and
then putting it back into view they'll
add the glue that holds everything
together in your application and we can
have different controllers for different
areas in our application for example a
registration controller for registering
users or a contact controller to process
contact form data that kind of thing
okay now here's a quick example using
the MVC approach a user clicks on a show
users button on a view on your website
the user controller then recognizes that
book click event and performs a function
this function communicates with the
users model and retrieves all of the
user data which is then accessible to
the view so it passes that data back
into the view which then displays it to
the end-user via an expression which is
those curly braces so the whole kind of
events the user is just clicking the
button and the data showing but behind
the scenes the controller is sorting
everything out grabbing the data from
the model and inserting it into the view
okay so finally you might hear MVC being
referred to as mvw in angularjs which is
just a little bit more flexible in this
approach and it just stands for Model
View whatever instead of Model View
controller but the underlying principle
is exactly the same it's just a
separation of concerns sort of
separating our data our models from the
views and using the controller to kind
of interact between them okay so that's
your kind of brief overview of MVC
architecture I think it's all we need to
know to get started in the code and if
you have any questions whatsoever
they'll feel free to pop those down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
share subscribe to the like I'm going to
see you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
