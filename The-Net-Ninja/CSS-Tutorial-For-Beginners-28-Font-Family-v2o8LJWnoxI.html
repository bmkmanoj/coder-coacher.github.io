this is CSS beginners lesson 28 and
today we're gonna take a look at the
font family that's coming up ha RI
ninjas so I'm back in the HTML file this
article HTML file on the left and a
blank CSS file on the right and we're
going to take a look at this family
property so to do that I'm going to
target these h2s and peas within the
article and we're going to do all within
one rule so we'll say article h2 and
article P we're going to stir these so
the font family first of all what is a
font family well that's the font style
that you give to certain elements and
that could be Arial could be Helvetica
Comic Sans impact whatever font you want
to give to it now how do we do this
wealthy property name is simply font -
family so we just write that first and
then we can specify a font name and I'm
going to give this a font of Arial I
want all the peas and all the Haiti twos
within the article type to be Arial okay
so I'll save this and then a few words
in a browser just to make sure it's
worked get this in chrome and cool there
we go guys they are all Arial so what's
going on here well I'm not embedding the
font file into the browser what I'm
doing is I'm saying to the CSS file look
I want these to be Arial these tags that
are specified so when the user loads
this on their computer I want you to
search their computer for Ariel if they
have Ariel installed think great we can
display this text as Ariel on the web
page if they don't have a real installed
then what's gonna happen is it's gonna
fall back to the users default browser
font and this could be Times New Roman
or something else okay so we don't
always want that we don't want them to
fall back onto some generic font style
that we don't think will go with the
design of our web page okay so how can
we overcome this well one such way is by
creating what's called a font family
stack and this is where we specify a
multitude of font families so that if
one font is not installed and it can
fall back on another that we specify and
another
we specify and you can have as many
families font families within this stack
as you like
so the way we do this is by putting our
font the first font that we want first
so we'd say we want these to be Arial
okay and then we put a comment and we
say if these if anyone's not installed
then we want these tags to be albe etiqa
and if Helvetica is not installed then
we want these tags to be just a standard
sans-serif font
whichever sounds so fun you have on your
computer just give me that because
that's going to look fairly similar okay
so that there is a font stack and you
can see it's comedy illuminated
so we're saying the most important one
is aerial if you don't have that try the
Helvetica if they don't have that can be
any census area that they've got
installed on their computer okay so if I
view this again then nothing really
should happen because I do have Arial
installed on my computer and yeah
nothing happens but if I didn't have
Arial install let's just create a fun
okay let's call this totally awesome fun
believe me guys that's not a real fun
you might think it is but it's not
alright
and we'll view this in a browser again
and hopefully they should fall back on
Helvetica which it does and they look
very similar and but trust me that guy's
is Helvetica and if I don't have our
Vertica installed then we'll just pork
ham font then it's gonna fall back on
any old sans-serif which to be honest I
think maybe Helvetica anyway so this may
not change yeah that was very similar so
it's falling back on my standard
sans-serif font which maybe Helvetica it
looks very similar either way so what if
we wanted it to be serif we can just
take off this let's just make sure this
is working so we don't have these two
fonts here and we'll open this in a
browser Google Chrome just to make sure
this has worked and yeah now it's
sans-serif which is by the look of it it
sounds new roman' okay so that is the
font step in action and this is what we
do is probably 90 percent of the time to
kind of combat though
those cases where a user doesn't have a
font installed now there are other ways
we can combat it we can use what's
called the ATS front face declaration
that's a little bit more advanced so I'm
not going to cover that and so maybe
towards the end of this course and we
can also use base64 encoding and I'm not
going to cover that till the end of the
course as well but we generally use
those when we have more specific fonts
that we'd want to use that with we know
that a user won't have installed on
their computer so I'll get to that later
in the course but for now if you have
any questions about this way with this
method whatsoever feel free feel free to
drop a few comments below I'll answer
all of those questions as soon as I can
