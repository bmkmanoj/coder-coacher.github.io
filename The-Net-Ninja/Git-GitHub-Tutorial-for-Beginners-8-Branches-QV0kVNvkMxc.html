eighth get and ghetto tutorial and in
this video we're going to start creating
brunches okay then so branches are a
massive part of git and probably one of
the better features of git as well
now so far we've only been working on
one branch and that is the master branch
right here I remember when we create a
new repository what we're doing is we're
creating this master branch as well and
when we've been making commits we've
been committing only to this master
branch right here like that
okay now generally speaking this master
branch is going to represent the stable
version of your code and normally it's
going to be the code which is released
or published now for that reason we
don't really want to try out new
features on new code on this master
branch just in case it messes the code
up what we really want to do if we want
to add a new feature to our application
is create some kind of isolated
environment right to try out this new
feature and if we like it we can merge
this new feature into the master branch
and that is what branching is all about
so say we have some kind of a new
feature that we want to test out instead
of adding more commits on to this master
branch to test it out what we do is we
make a new branch which is an isolated
environment to test this code out so
what we're doing here when we make this
branch is we're kind of copying the
state of the code that it seemed right
here this stable version and we're
copying it kind of down here onto this
branch to begin with then we can work in
this code in this branch make commits
test things out okay then if we're happy
with this new feature it's all stable we
can merge it back into the master branch
and that's called a merge commit so now
this master branch is updated with that
new feature but if everything goes wrong
in this branch you've tested things out
and it messes the code up or doesn't
work what we can do is just delete that
branch and it's not going to affect this
master branch this is still stable it's
not been touched at all so that's why we
use branches and one of the cool thing
about branches is if we have two
developers working on the same project
at the same time doing two different new
features what we could do is one of us
make a branch to work on one feature one
of them make a branch to work on the
other feature we can both work on these
in the road branches at the same time
then when each one of them's happen they
can merge back into the master branch so
allows us to work on different features
at the same time which is really cool
okay so I'm back in the GIMP one
repository and we're just at the very
start of this repository as it was when
we first started so there's just one
commit so far and I can see that if I
type git log - one line we can see just
this one commit which is the added index
and style files so the index file and
the start file
and you can see that what on the master
branch right here this is one cool thing
about commander over here is it says
what branch to run and the fact that
it's white here means that we've not got
any changes that are not committed but
if I make a change over here and save it
then if I just say I don't I'll get
status just to update this thing over
here what you're going to see is this
master over here is now red and that
tells me that I've got changing over
here that are not committed so let's
just change this to something I don't
know different a word at least whew save
it and what I'm going to do is just
commit this so I'll say git add then git
commit and and I'll just put added index
title okay so now we've got two commits
right we've got the first one and this
one so I'll say git log one-line justice
Eidos okay to commit now say I want to
work on some kind of new feature I'm not
going to start working on this muster
branch just in case it messes up the
code right so instead what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a new branch
so how do we do that well all we do is
we say git branch and then the name of
the branch so I'm just going to call
this feature - what okay
and now it's created this new branch and
if I want to see this branch I can say
get brunch and then - a that's going to
show me all the branches now you can see
this branch right here feature one and
also master now mustika green they've
got the test weakness asterisk next to
it this means I'm on this branch this
Asterix right so if I want to be on this
branch because I won't work on this new
feature I need to check out that branch
much like we checked out the commit we
can check out a branch to kind of be on
it okay the way we do that is by saying
get
checkout and then the branch name which
is feature - one so it says now switched
to branch feature one and if I do get
branch - a again then we're going to see
that we're now on a feature one cool so
now we can start working on this new
feature so say for example I just want
to add in a JavaScript file which is
called feature - one guess and inside
here I'm just going to do a console that
log and it's going to say I don't know
feature one it doesn't really matter
could be anything this it's just a
JavaScript feature right so then now if
I do get status we're going to see that
we've changed this file we've added it
and what I want to do is commit to this
file now I want to commit to sorry I
want to commit to this branch now I want
to commit this file to the branch so I'm
going to add it first of all so the
staging area gets added and then that's
going to add it we can see that doing
git status so now it's green okay now we
want to commit it and want to say git
commit and and added new feature file
right so now what we're doing is we're
working on this new branch we're
creating this new feature right but it's
isolated it's away from the master
branch and we've not changed that at all
and I can demonstrate that I can check
out the master branch again I can switch
back to it and to do that we just say
git checkout mustered right I'm not
switching back to the master branch now
and you'll notice that that javascript
file is gone so while I'm on this master
branch I'm not actually editing anything
right this is remaining stable it's only
when we're on the feature 1 branch that
we can see all of the code that we're
creating and testing out so let's go
back to it get check out feature 1 and
you'll see it reappear on the left you
can see it repair now yeah over here
cool so there we go we've created a
branch and we started work on it now
what if things go wrong and we just want
to delete that branch well we can delete
it first of all I'm going to go back to
master git checkout muster so we're no
longer on this feature branch then we're
going to delete this creature branch
and the way we do that is by saying get
and then branch then - D Fedele and then
the branch name which is feature - what
okay
oops I've spelled Burroughs wrong let's
just correct that and it says here we've
got an error and he says the branch
feature one is not fully merged if you
sure you want a volunteer on git branch
Capital D then feature one so basically
the lowercase D is only ever going to
work
once we've merged the branch I'm going
to show you how in modes branches later
but for now let's just use capital deep
sourcing gets branch capital B and then
the name of the branch which is C cheer
- up one now that is going to delete it
deleted branch feature one if I try now
git branch - a it's only going to show
as the master okay
so we've created a branch and we've
deleted it and now I want to show you
working on two branches at the same time
so remember to create a branch we can
say git branch and then the branch name
but then we have to check out the branch
I want to show you a quicker way to do
this instead what you can do is you can
say git checkout and then - B - say
we're making a new branch and the branch
name so I'm going to call this feature
egg right so what that does is it
creates a branch and it checks it out as
well so we don't have to perform those
two sets steps separately cool so what
on this new branch now I'm going to get
rid of this JavaScript file we're going
to create a new one and that is gonna be
called feature - AJ yes and let's just
say console that log feature a save it
okay so now we want to commit this or
say git add then get to commit and we'll
say added feature a file ok so now we're
working on this branch doing feature a
let's just now imagine we're person B
somewhere working on feature B so we'll
say git checkout
master and we don't see that code right
we don't think the feature they're
working on and what we want to do is
actually work on our own feature and we
can do that we can say git checkout - B
for new branch then the branch name
feature - B
and I could create a file over here in
file and call this feature
- bjs and inside here what's a console
dot logged and it's going to be feature
if we can spark really feature be save
that now when I commit it on to this
branch or say gets add to add it to the
staging then get commit and and the
message which is added feature see file
ok so now we've got these two branches
going on at the same time person one
working on feature a person - working on
feature B and neither one of them is
affecting the master branch and we can
see that by seeing get check out mustard
okay so now we know like a that file
over here of either of the features
because the master is remaining on touch
we've got two separate branches going
off from the master working on their own
kind of features and only when they're
happy are we going to merge them back
into the master and if we'd say git
branch - a we're going to see all of
these different branches we can see what
on the master but currently we've got
these two branches feature a and feature
be going ok so when they're finished
they can merge them back in to the
master branch and that's what I'm going
to show you how to do in the very next
