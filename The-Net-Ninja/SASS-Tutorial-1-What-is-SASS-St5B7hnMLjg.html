first SAS tutorial Wow okay so what is
sus exactly SAS is basically just an
extension to CSS and it can help us
write more flexible styles and the way
we do that is by using things like
variables functions conditional
statements etc so with all these new
tools available to us in SAS you'll find
yourself being able to write styles that
are much easier to do in SAS than normal
CSS it also lets us split up our files
into modules making it much easier to
keep on top of CSS for larger projects
so for example we could have a module
for a reset a module fossil-based out a
module for some grid styles etc and then
at the end would just run all of those
together to make one core file now when
we write in SAS browsers and not going
to understand our code it is not CSS
we're writing in its SAS which is
completely different even though it
looks quite similar okay so what we need
to do is take that sass once we finished
it and translate it into CSS so that a
browser can understand it and display
those Styles on a web page a final
excess is written in Ruby so depending
on how you're going to be using sass you
may need to install Ruby on your
computer and I'll show you where you can
download that or later on ok there so in
this playlist what we're going to be
doing is making up a simple website like
this that you can see only right and
we're going to be making that using sass
only ok so I've already gone ahead and
created the core files that we're going
to need such as this index.html file and
some base styles right here in the reset
so I'm going to upload these to github
and you can download those and you can
start where I'm starting then so you
don't need to do all of the reset styles
and the HTML that we're going to start
with and then we're going to work
through creating some sass files in this
folder right here the s CSS folder now
what we're going for is these four files
right here these are going to be the
final files that we create so I'm going
to include those on the github
repository as well so you can kind of
meander through those if you like as
well so like I say you can get all
those files from my github repository
the sass playlist one I'm going to leave
a link to this page down below in the
description so you can go here and
download the files by clicking this
download zip for a button right there
and one more thing I am going to be
using a team to write all my coding for
this playlist it's a really cool free
text editor all you need to do is go to
attend a oh I'll leave that link down
below as well and click download windows
installer and finally before you start
this playlist there's a couple of things
you probably should know first sass is
very much like a programming language
like I said we can use things like
variables functions if statements etc so
you should be comfortable with these
programming fundamentals before you
start this playlist essentially and the
next thing you need to know is CSS
because at the end of the day that's
what we're trying to create a CSS folder
file using sass so I've got playlist on
JavaScript if you want to check out
their programming fundamentals in that
and I've also got a CSS playlist as well
if you want to check that out I'll leave
the links to both of those down below
otherwise guys I'm going to see you in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
