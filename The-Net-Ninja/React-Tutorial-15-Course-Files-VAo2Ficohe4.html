hack tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how to use the course
files that are prepped for you okay so
being a true Gentile prepped a load of
course files that you can work along
with for this series
they were my github repo right here
called a react playlist I'll leave the
link to this down below it is private at
the minute but I promise you when this
video goes live it is going to be public
so there's two ways you can do this you
can either download the files by going
to clone or download then downloading a
zip or you can install git and check out
whichever branch you want for whichever
lesson you're working on and if you
click this thing right here where it
says branch then you can see all the
different lessons right here have their
own branch so each branch corresponds to
the starting point of the code over that
lesson so we're going to use this branch
in a minute so what you want to do is
install git to do that go to get - SCM
comm and click this button right here it
takes about one minute to install then
when you've done that come back to the
repo click clone or download and get
this you are right here by copying it to
the clipboard click that button alright
we're going to use that in a second to
clone this thing right here this
repository so once you've done that open
up your favorite command line tool and
navigate to the directory you want to
clone that repository to mines in
YouTube sites now to navigate in the
command line just use CD now some for
change directory du/dr go up a level now
it's gone up to my websites then do CD
space and your directory name to go down
a level into that directory so I'll go
back into YouTube sites okay so now this
is where I'm going to clone that
repository now I've got git installed so
once that's done you can say git clone
and then paste in the repository or
right there
then click enter that's going to go out
grab the files from this repo and create
a local version of that repository on
your computer in this directory okay
so let's check out that directory I'm
going to open them up right click over
here or rather click alt get file add
project folder then I want to go into
YouTube sites and
check out this react playlist is now
there so we don't open this folder and
you can see all of those files that were
on a github account and now peer now
this is the master branch and the master
branch refers to the end files when this
whole series is complete we want to work
with the lesson1 branch so to do that
open up a terminal you can either use
this one right here or I've got a
terminal loaded into atom as well this
is called platform I all terminal
it's a package for atoms I'll just
install that if you want to and I'm in
the react playlist directory right here
that's important and what we're going to
do is check out lesson 1 so to do that I
say git checkout lesson - 1 and that's
going to update the files on the left to
represent the files at the start of
lesson 1 ok so whatever lesson you want
to check out just do this command git
checkout then the lesson so right now
you can see this is just a source folder
which only has this one file in it the
index dot HTML and this is seriously
simple nothing in it much at the minute
ok so click that off we've also got a
git ignore file that's just telling it
to ignore any files which is in the node
modules folder which we'll see later and
also the distribution folder which we'll
see later and finally I readme file read
through that if you want ok anyway that
is the base file setup and this is how
we're going to be working along with it
files as we go along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
