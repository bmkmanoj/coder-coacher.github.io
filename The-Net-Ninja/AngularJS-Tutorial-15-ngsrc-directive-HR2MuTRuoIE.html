Thank You largesse tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about energy
source Wow okay then guys so I've
decided that what I want to do is place
a little thumbnail image before each
ninja name right here in the list now to
do that I'm going to have to go into the
data and edit it so the angularjs knows
where to find the image for each ninja
now to do that we're going to have to
pass in through here a path to each
ninja right and you'll see that I've got
a head and created an image folder right
here in the content and within there
I've got four images one for each ninja
so I'm going to create this property on
each ninja object so that we can pass
through the path to that ninja okay so
they're in the content folder and then
it's image and then this first one is
Yoshi dot PNG okay so I'll just grab
that dude now and paste it down below
right here and then this one is crystal
and then the next one is are you and
then finally is Shawn okay so now we
have the path to each image associated
with each ninja now we just need to
output this image in the view so let's
save this and go back to the index and I
want to output it just before the ninja
name which is that huge three and I'm
going to write an image tag and within
the source attribute we want to output
this data right here the path to the
image which is on the filmic property
okay so all we need to write is ninja
dot thought okay because remember each
time we output a ninja we're using this
ninja object by saying ninja in ninjas
okay so ninja dot Thor needs to be been
an expression like that and then
hopefully this should work but before we
save I just want to add a couple of
styles because I'm not already done this
in the the CSS right there the only
thing I want to do is I'd imagine first
of all which is minus 12 at the top and
it's gonna be 10 pixels on the right and
zero zero bottom unless
I also want to float this to the left
and give it a width of about 50 pixels
okay so let's save that and take a look
and there we go guys there are our
thumbnails pretty sweet right and you
might think nothing is actually wrong
with this and you're right until we go
into the console and we see this error
right here fail to load so we're getting
four for error when the browser goes out
and tries to retrieve this image now
what the hell is that image well these
things right here this little bit of
code represent these curly braces here
and ninja thumb is the name of this
property right here that we're trying to
inject into the expression so the
browser is actually trying to load this
image it thinks this right here is the
source of the image and it's going out
to try and find that image before
angular gets a chance to inject this
property right here dynamically okay so
we don't want that we don't want errors
in our code so let's try and get rid of
that and the way we do it is by using
the directive ng source
okay so that directive will then wait
until angular injects this path
dynamically and then it will go out and
try and find the image so it's not going
to try and find this ninja dot thumb
anywhere because angular waits until
that is replaced with the string okay
which we specify right here so when we
save this now and view it in any browser
you'll see that the console no longer
throws the error so that is why we use
ng source guys now I want to do one more
thing on this image tag and that is use
the ng-show directive okay because we
only want this to show up when we have
an image associated with it remember
when we add a new image here we've not
given it an image field so each image
below this won't have an image
associated with it so we don't want this
image to be inserted if we don't have an
image associated with it so let's do the
ng show equals and then we'll just set
it to ninja dot thumb all right so now
what will happen is it will look for
this property on the object that we add
and if it's available if it has that
property then it will show the image if
it doesn't have that property this will
return as false and it won't show that
image so that will work Carelli now so
let's save let's just make sure in the
console we don't have any errors which I
don't think we will and then we'll go
ahead and add in a new ninja we'll call
it David which is just an awesome name
for it ninja would give you a red belt
and the hourly rate is going to be 10 so
we'll add that to the list we get no
errors here whatsoever and everything
still looks ok all right so that my
friends is energy source if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to wear
throw a comment down below otherwise
guys don't forget to subscribe share and
all that jazz and I'll see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
