lesson on becoming an OAuth ninja or
right there now before we start I want
to make one thing clear this is not a
beginner series I would expect you to at
the very least know how to create a
simple Express app on nodejs and a
little bit of MongoDB knowledge would go
a long way as well so I've done
playlists on both of these things so if
you want to brush up your knowledge
first of all I'll leave the links to
both of those down below and they're
going to be popping out on your screen
right about now for the rest of us what
is wealth well it stands for open
authorization and it's just one approach
to authenticating users inside your
application and it allows users to log
into your app using third-party services
such as Facebook Google or github
something like that so when you see a
website using these kinds of buttons
right here you can be pretty sure it's
using oauth2 what tor to authenticate
users so when we click one of these
buttons on a website we're basically
signing up on logging into that website
using one of our social profiles if we
have one and we hand control of the
signing process over to these
third-party services Google or Facebook
or something like that and this is good
for a couple of reasons first reason is
one less thing for us to worry about as
a developer it frees up time for us to
focus on the cool bits of our website or
application and also it's one less thing
for the user to worry about as well they
don't have to fill in any kind of forms
to sign up to your website they just
have to click a button and accept that
they're gonna sign through Google or
Facebook or something like that
and then the signed up to your
application as well so it makes it
really easy for users and we're not
putting them off with all these
different forms and it means that a user
could just have one or two central
online identities through Facebook all
get hot ball Google+ or whatever social
web sites they use and they can use
those to log in in other applications so
in simple terms this is what's happening
when a user signs into a website or an
app using OAuth first of all they land
on our website and then they want to
sign up or login so we find the signing
with Google or the signing with Facebook
button right there and they click on up
then they're going to be redirected to
Google servers to a consent screen and
this is Google basically telling the
user that our application our website
over here wants to access their profile
so that they can sign up to our
application with their profile ok and
it's going to say to user what
information that this website or web app
would like to access so for example the
profile info or the email address so
when a user clicks allow right here
we're basically telling Google ok this
website can use our profile information
to sign up to this website ok I'm
allowing up so it's the users choice and
the great thing is we can see exactly
what the application is going to be
using from our profile and it was too
much then we can deny access and we can
find another way to log in so when a
user clicks allow it's going to redirect
them back to our website and essentially
it logged them into our website using
their social credentials then what we
can do on our website is create a
profile for them based on this profile
over here and we can store a version of
their profile in our own database which
is really cool so this is a very very
simplistic and bird's-eye view of the
whole procedure but we'll be diving much
much deeper throughout the course and
we'll be creating the whole process from
scratch using a library called passport
yes and this is going to simplify the
amount of code that we have to write and
it handles a lot of the interaction
between our application and the third
pie service like Google ok so all of
this interaction right here is handled
by passports yes we'd have to worry too
much about it we just kind of insert
passport at different sections in our
application and that's going to take
care of the rest for us so I'm going to
show you how to do all of this from
absolute scratch now as always because
I'm so frickin awesome I provided you
with all of the course files for this
series so you'll find those on the Arth
playlist right here on my github this
link is gonna be right down below in the
description so each lesson is gonna have
a different branch so for example if you
want to check out the code to do with
lesson 10 you just select the
lesson 10 branch right here and you can
browse or download that code right here
or you can just clone the whole thing to
your desktop okay so two more things I
want to show you that is the text editor
I'm going to be using that is Atem
completely free and very cool and also
CMD R or commander still don't know how
to pronounce that and this is a consult
emulator for Windows you don't need this
I just prefer using this rather than the
default Windows command prompt okay so
there we go there is your whirlwind tour
into off in the very next tutorial we're
going to dive right in and see how a
warth works and if my friends you like

I'm going to see you in the very next
