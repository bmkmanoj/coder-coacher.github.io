sick flexbox tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about flex basis ah
okay then guys so as you can see right
now I've stripped out all of those flex
grow and flex shrink properties and I've
just reverted back to these basic styles
whereby we've got a minimum width of 200
pixels on each one of these elements
right here and they're all going to wrap
when there's not enough room in this
role for those 200 pixel elements
because we have this flex wrap property
applied to the Flex container so I'll
just demonstrate that quickly round
about this point where there's not
enough room for each of these to be 200
pixels then it's going to wrap to the
next line okay so in this video I want
to talk about Flex basis and the Flex
basis is pretty similar to minimum width
right there in that it defines a
starting width of each of our elements
so instead of minimum width we could
write flex - basis and say 200 pixels
and all of those elements are going to
start at the width of 200 pixels so this
is going to be pretty much the same and
it's going to behave the same when it
comes to wrapping them and I can
demonstrate that when it gets to the
point where no longer these three
elements can fit in a line where the 200
pixels in width then they're going to
wrap to the next line and by the way the
reason they're not growing into this
available space is because we've not
applied that flex grub property to them
so I want to show you that we can apply
different flex basis properties to each
of these items so let's just get it from
there and come down to the first one I'm
going to apply a 100 pixel flex basis to
that the second one is going to be 200
and the third one will say 300 so now
they all have different starting
position not positions different
starting widths all right and we could
apply a flex grow to all of them and
they're all going to grow at the same
rate to fill up the available space but
because they have different flex basis
properties then they're going to be
different widths because they all
started at a different width yet they're
all growing at the same rate but because
they all started at a different width
they're all going to end up at a
different width makes sense
okay so there's one subtle difference I
want to show you
between flex bases and minimum width so
let's come up here and apply a min width
to each one of those boxes of 500 pixels
okay this is fine so when we shrink the
browser and by the way the reason
they're all wrapping like this is
because there's not enough room 4 to 500
pixels and elements in this browser size
if we go like this
the probably still won't be because the
wrapper is 9600 let's change this to
1200 then this should go side-by-side at
some point perfect okay but as we shrink
then when it gets to below 500 pixels
what's going to happen is you're going
to start to see that scroll bar at the
bottom of the browser right here and we
have to scroll to see all of the element
and that's because each one of these
elements is saying well know you've
applied a minimum width to me of 500
pixels and guide it down if I'm going to
go smaller than that so they're not
doing and they're going to force you to
scroll to the side to see them whereas
if we apply a flex basis of 500 pixels
instead when we shrink the browser to
below 500 pixels in width they're not
going to force you to view that they're
just going to shrink as normal flex
items would so that's why more often
than not I would use Flex basis instead
okay so we've seen flex basis flex grow
and flex shrink and all of those
properties can be combined into one
property like a shorthand notation and
that property is just called flex okay
and the first number in this property is
going to represent the Flex grow so I'll
set that to 1 the second number is going
to be the Flex shrink so we'll set that
to zero and the third number is going to
be the Flex basis so I'll set that to
200 pixels like that and this is still
going to wrap around 200 pixels there
okay so that's an easier way to do it
and probably I think the recommended way
to do it so I'd do that instead of
defining all three separately and a lot
of the times what you're going to see is
just something like this flex is one
and what that's going to do is say okay
well the growth is one the shrink is one
and it's going to set the Flex basis to
0 by default okay so that's what that
means so if you have any questions about
this whatsoever guys feel free to leave
a comment down below otherwise I'll see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
