your seventh react tutorial and in this
video I'm going to talk about how it can
nest components alright so in previous
tutorials I've said that we can nest
components within other components
so typically we might have a parent
component in this case it's going to be
our to do component this is going to
wrap the entire to do list okay and then
we might nest components within it for
example for each item that we output we
might want a little bit more
functionality so we could create a
component for each item and then we
output that component separately for
each one and we nest it right here in
this component make sense so that's what
we're going to do in this tutorial we're
going to nest and a to do item component
so first of all I'm going to delete this
stuff right here because instead of
outputting an ally we want to output a
separate component right so let's get
rid of that and we're going to return
instead a new component so we start down
here where we have a component we output
it in a tag like this so this is what
we're going to do right here as well so
this component is going to be called a
to-do item so what's a to-do item like
that
okay now that there's a couple of things
we actually have to do with this
component and the first thing is we have
to pass it some data so we want to pass
it the actual to-do list item each time
whether that's wash up eat some cheese
etc we want to pass that to the new
components so that we can do something
with it in that component when we come
to create it so I'm going to pass it
this item as a prop and I'm going to set
this equal to item which is this thing
right here in the map function okay the
second thing I need to do is give this a
key property now this is react specific
because when we map out this array we're
going to output this nested component
not just once but several times once for
each different item in the array okay so
since we're output in this component
several times and we'll see how we do it
in a minute
we need to give each component that we
output a key so that react knows or it's
got an identifier on that component okay
so we're going to set that key equal to
the index right here so each component
now has its own unique key when its
output all right so now that's the
component right there so that's what
we're outputting here but we're not
creating this component so if we run
this right now we're just going to get a
bunch of errors and it's not going to
work so let's go ahead and create this
component so that when we reference it
here react knows what to do in order to
grab that component and insert it right
here so let's come under there and say
create to-do item component and we're
going to make it very much like we made
this one so we'll save that and call
this to-do item set it equal to react
dot create plus and then in here we have
that object and inside the object we
have the render property which is a
function and then inside the function
we're going to return our HTML all right
cool so what do we want the HTML to be
for each one of these different items
well it's in a ul so we want it to begin
with an li tag right because every time
we output this component is going to be
inserted within this UL tag so we want
the parent can put a parent tag to be an
mi makes sense then inside that what I
will say is a div I'm going to give this
a class now when we're giving items a
class in JSX we can't just say class
equals because class is a reserved
keyword in JavaScript we have to say
class name like that in camel case okay
so this is going to have a class of to
do - item and then we live that div I'm
going to give it a spun this is going to
have a class name
pull to item - name now what we want to
do is output the data for that to-do
item now we passed it through as a prop
right here so we can access that on the
props of this component and we now to do
that it's just the curly braces then
it's miss to reference this component
dot props and then whatever property is
passed to us now we can access the item
by saying dot item like so so this dot
props to item and that is going to
output this item to the browser so if we
save this now and check it out in a
browser then this should work so it's
output each one of these things right
here and if we go to the react tab and
just zoom this up so we can see what's
going on okay
so I'm just going to increase the size
of this so you can see and this is our
parent component that's a do component
which is this thing right here yeah and
without putting this component as a
child within it so let's open that up
and you can see that we have all of this
code here first of all then when we come
to - duze it's grabbing it from here
which is outputting these child or
children components and you can see
these children components be an output
right here each one of them has a unique
key which we supply so that react knows
which component is what we're also
passing through some props to each
component and you can see those they're
props which is item wash-up item eats
and cheese etc and if we expand these
things you can see the code within it
which is from this component right here
so without putting this stuff in every
to do component make sense and that
component there or those components
those four instances of those components
are being rendered within this so their
children proponents of this okay so that
my friends is how we nest components and
pass data to components so don't forget
to share subscribe and like and I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial where we're going to take this
one step further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
