ninth angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're gonna talk about controllers
Wow okay then guys so in the last
tutorial what we did is make this module
right here and we give it a name of my
ninja app and then we set to angular hey
look we want this module to control all
the functionality within the application
and to do that we assigned this
directive here ng app equal to the value
of this module okay so now this module
is controlling all this functionality
however what we didn't do because I
forgot to do it was linked up to this
app J s so this currently would it work
so let's do that now we'll say script
source equals and then we'll just right
click this over here and get the project
path and paste it right in there
okay so now that it's linked up now it
recognizes this module okay so the next
thing we want to do is work on
controller so we already know that this
module is going to contain all of our
code and it's going to be built up of
controllers factory services etc so
we'll just take a look at controllers
today now a controller essentially
controls our application data and
different controllers are used to
control different parts of the app so
for example we could have a controller
which controls the registration process
of the application or a controller which
controls the contact form of an
application okay so let's create a
controller and the way we do that is
just by referencing this variable first
of all my ninja up and they same dot
controller and then we need to give this
controller a name so let's call it ninja
controller and this is a typical naming
convention in angular it's always
something then controller okay or a
variation of controller and we always
use camel case as well so the next thing
we want to do is pass in a function and
then within this function is where other
magic is going to happen so in here is
going to be all the code which controls
this section of the web page are of the
web web application but we don't
currently have that section
top in the application view so let's do
that now let's come over here and what
you tell me all this stuff right here
and we'll also get rid of that data
we're not going to be using that anymore
and we're going to do a simple div type
and then apply a directive to it called
ng controller and then within this we
put the controller name which is this
ninja controller so we'll copy that and
paste it right in here and now guys
within these two divs right here on this
one div is where our ninja controller is
going to control this is kind of like
the scope of its power all right so we
can now pass data between this
controller this section here on the
application and this controller alright
and to pass data between the two we need
to use something called the scope object
in angular now the scope is essentially
like the binding part between the HTML
view and this JavaScript controller and
it's available to both of them so we can
apply our model or our data as well as
functions if we need them to the scope
object here in the controller and then
all of that will be accessible to us in
the HTML view so when we're thinking of
MVC we've got our view in HTML then
we've got a control here in the
JavaScript and we have our model or our
data on the scope which is passed
between the view and a controller okay
but to use the scope within this
controller we need to pass it into the
function because it is a dependency okay
we're depending on the scope and we'll
talk about dependency a little bit more
later but for now you just have to pass
this through then we can use it in this
controller so let's do a simple example
will say scope dot message equals and
then we'll set that equal to hey y'all
something like that all right and then
we'll click Save and then right about
here what we're gonna do is just come in
and we'll say P and then we're gonna
output that message and we just need to
port message we don't need to raise
scope top message because scope is
implied it's implied that we're just
grabbing those objects or variables or
properties off the scope okay
so let's save this bye-bye now and check
out what happens in the browser we get
that message
okay so we've passed that message we've
set it here on the scope
and we've passed that message through to
this section right here in the control
in the ninja controller area and we've
output it by just using this expression
in the same message if we try to use
this outside of that area then this
wouldn't work okay
it only recognizes that message inside
this controller okay because this is the
only area that scope applies this is the
scope essentially of that controller
okay
so let's add some data let's say scope
dot ninjas equals an array and then
we'll say Yoshi crystal Ryu and of
course shot all right
so now we have our ninjas and that's our
scope ninja so let's go into the HTML
and we're going to do that ng-repeat
directive against all say you well and
then we need an li tag and then within
this Li tag we need our energy repeat
directive which is just going to loop
through all of our array data and we'll
say ninjas oh sorry ninja in ninjas okay
so ninjas is the name of this variable
right here on the scope okay so that's
why we're putting it there and remember
this can be anything if you need to
refresh on ng-repeat just hit the back
button go back a couple of lessons and
then what we're gonna do is just output
this ninja so let's save that and now
we're going to see oops I put ninjas
that's why they're coming out as a race
just the injure and now we're gonna see
each one of these output the same as
before but now it looks a lot nicer in
this cold we're using the controller to
give us this data which is much better
practice than just putting the data on
ng in it and that controller is passing
through this data on the scope object
which we have access to within this
section here
okay because we've said that this
section is controlled by the ninja
controller so there's one more thing I
quickly want to talk about and that is
this thing right here this dependency so
we're passing theater discovery as a
dependency in this controller and that's
because we're depending on the scope
right we need it now this is fine fought
to protect this variable from
minification then we need to do this a
slightly different way and basically
what I mean by that is when we start to
minify javascript files in angularjs
this doesn't always work we sometimes
need to protect the variable names so
the way we do that is by passing the
function and any dependencies through an
array after the controller name so we do
our square bracket open and we'll put
our square bracket end at the end of the
function okay because it's going to
control it's got a hold rather the
dependencies and the function and then
we define our dependencies in quotation
marks like that so I'm going to say
scope is one of them and then I do a
comma and then the last one is always
generate the function right there if we
add all the dependencies they'd go on
like that with in here so dependency you
know so we make a list of them like that
and the function would normally be the
last one but as well as putting them
there we do have to put them in the
brackets as well right here so we do you
know the other for the other
dependencies right there whatever we put
there would be there okay so that is the
best way I think of doing the
dependencies but you'd have to do it for
this tutorial if you don't like I'm just
going to keep it that way for now
because of these best practice okay so
we're gonna save that and everything
should still work and there we go guys
that is controllers for you we're going
to take a look at in more depth at
controllers as we go through this this
play lace ball
if you've got any questions for now for
your free to leave those down below
otherwise guys don't forget to share
subscribe and all that stuff and I'll
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
