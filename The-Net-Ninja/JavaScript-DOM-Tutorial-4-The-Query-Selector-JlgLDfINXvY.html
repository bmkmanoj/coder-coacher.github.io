fourth JavaScript and the dawn tutorial
and in this video we're going to talk
about the query selector all right then
so from here on it I'm going to start
using the text editor to create our
JavaScript rather than write it all in
the console over here purely because as
our script gets larger it's going to be
easier to maintain inside this file than
it is in the console so of completely
wipe this clean we've got an empty file
in Apps GS at the minute also I've got
this index file open which is going to
be our hex tml that we're going to query
in a minute so the query selector this
is probably the easiest way to query an
element from the DOM and it's very
similar to how jQuery works so if you've
ever used jQuery before it looks
something like this a dollar sign first
of all then in parentheses we pass
through a CSS selector for the elements
that we want to grub so for example if
we want to grab this element right here
this div with an ID of wrapper all we do
is pass through the hash for the ID and
then a wrapper so that there is going to
go out and grab that wrapper element and
return it to us now in vanilla
javascript is a very similar but instead
of this dollar sign right here what we
do is we say document and we use a
method on the document object called
query selector let me go so yeah there's
a few more characters but it does pretty
much exactly the same thing and that's
going to go out and grab this wrapper
element and return it to us so let's
store this in a variable or constant
rather and we'll call this wrap set it
equal to this document queries like the
wrapper call Swiss grab that element and
it's storing that in this variable right
here let's log that to the console so
I'll say console the log and we're going
to log out the wrap
variable I never say this we can see
this is log to the console cool so now
we've gone out and we've grabbed that
element really simple so say we want to
get a bit more technical with this we
want to grab something which is not as
straightforward as this say for example
we want to grab this element right here
so if we inspect this then we can see
that this is a spun it has the class of
name it's an li tag it's also the second
child within the UL so we can use that
and it's also inside this book list so
let's grab this I'm going to grab the
book list ID first of all and I'm going
to change this wrapper to book list oops
inside that we want to grab an Li but
remember not just any Li the second
child and we can do that using a pseudo
class so : then empty - child in
brackets - so we want the second child
then we want the class of name which is
a span tag so this is going to go out
and grab that element now and instead of
calling it wrap I'm going to call it W M
F Wise Man's Fear because that's what we
want right there so let's log this to
the console save it and refresh over
here and then we can see we get that
element right there cool so we can pass
through any valid CSS selector right
here to grab any element we want and if
you need a refresher on CSS I've got two
CSS for beginners tutorial series on
this channel the link is down below okay
cool
so say we want to grab more than one
element saying we want to grab some kind
of collection of elements like we have
done in the previous tutorial so I might
want to grab every single spun tag right
not just one of them but every single
one of them so how would we do that well
first of all I'm going to comment this
dude out so it's not log to the console
and then I'm going to come underneath
and I'm going to say it with our books
is equal to document got query selector
to query the Dom and then inside I'm
going to pass through book
list then we want an li tag within that
and then any name plus within that
because every span has that class of
name so if we inspect the element we can
see that this span has a class of name
this class has a span of name this one
does etc so we're grabbing all of those
elements everything with a class of name
that's inside and Li inside the book
list so let's log this to the console
and it's books
save that okay let's see what happens
over here and we only get one of them
the very top one name of the wind so why
is that well when we use this method
right here the query selector this is
only ever going to return one single
element to us it doesn't return multiple
ones so when there's multiple ones in a
webpage is going to grab the first wait
finds a return that to us hmm
we don't want that we want all of them
now all we need to do is make one quick
little tweak today so I'm going to
comment this out for a second then I'm
going to grab this copy it and paste it
down here and we don't need to declare
the variable keyword again because we've
already declared this variable we're
just changing it here and this time
we're going to set it equal to document
query selector all so whereas this one
only returns one element query selector
query selector all is going to return a
collection of elements all right so now
this is going to grab every element with
a class of name inside and li inside the
book list so if we log this books
variable to the console now console but
log books save it now we see this
collection of elements right here pretty
cool so we can use these two different
methods to either grab one element or
several elements and even if you use a
selector in query select all and there's
only one of those elements on a page
it's still going to return it in
collection form in square brackets like
this so for example if I change this
again to Rutter there's only one wrap on
the page and I'm going to save it we can
see we still get that one element inside
the square brackets okay so it's still
returning it in some kind of collection
let's undo that now I want to show you
how we can cycle through this collection
of books very similar to how we did it
in the previous tutorial we're going to
have to turn this books thing right here
into an array to use for each on it or
we could use a for loop I prefer the
array method using for each so I'm going
to say array got from then in brackets
books because we want to create an array
from this variable then when it's an
array we can use the for each
method on it passed through a function
and inside the function we can pass
through the book parameter which is
going to be the book that it's iterating
through at that moment in time then we
can log this to the console so I say
console dot log the book and this should
all work so let's save this now and
refresh over here and now we can see
each of these is logged to the console
or voila
so that we've got my friends that is in
really simple way to query the job using
these two different methods query
selected for what element query selector
all for multiple elements so now we know
a few different ways to query it on
in the next tutorial what I'm going to
do is move on and show you how we can
actually start to change the content and
the HTML on the web page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
