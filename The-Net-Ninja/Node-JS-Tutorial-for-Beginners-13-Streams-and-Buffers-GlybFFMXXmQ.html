thirteenth nodejs tutorial and in this
video i'm going to talk about streams
and buffers okay now before I talk about
buffers and streams I've got this true
story I want to tell you so there is
this guy who lived in the woods and one
day he came across this huge null Jay s
candy rock so he decides hey I'm going
to move this big rock to my house so I
can feed it to my kids now this guy is
pretty strong but even he knows that it
would take him an absolute lifetime to
drag the whole thing at once to his
house it'd be moving it really slowly
and you know his kid's going to get
pretty impatient because well they're
greedy cells but he has this light bulb
moment and he figures out how he can
easily transfer all of the rock back to
his house quickly so the week before he
just happened to build a tram later so
he puts it to good use and sets it up
between this huge candy rock and his
house and he figures if he hacks away at
the rock with a pick and gathers small
heap of candy at a time into a cardboard
box then empty that cardboard box onto a
travel later it will all get to his
house
bit by bit and the best part is the kids
can start eating the rock as soon as the
first heap arrives they don't have to
wait for the whole lot to be transferred
at first so what the hell does a man in
a forest cutting a giant candy rock have
to do with streams and buffers well this
story actually has a lot of similarities
to the way that buffers and the strings
work so first of all what is a buffer a
buffer is just a temporary storage spot
for a chunk of data that's being
transferred from one place to another so
if we have a large amount of data we
want to move from point A to point B
then we can move it a little bit at a
time by gathering a small amount of it
in a buffer and then moving it on so
with transferring small chunks of data
at a time so it looks something like
this we have all of the data here and
you can compare this to that can be rock
in the story and we want to get all of
this day
different point A to B but instead of
waiting for all of that data to be
stored in memory what we do is we
transfer a little bit at a time and we
fill up this buffer okay which is a
temporary storage spot for that data the
buffer collects a small chunk of data
and then when the buffer is full the
data can be passed on and processed okay
so we know what a buffer is but what is
a stream in an extreme is pretty much
that it's just a stream of data that
flows over time from one place to
another so we'd have some kind of data
source over here and we're transferring
that to the claim and the data flows
down this stream into the buffer right
which collects a small chunk of data
together then when the buffer is full it
passes that chunk of data down the
stream to be processed and sent to the
client so you've probably heard about
streaming movies online and this is
buffers and streams in action we have
the movie which is all the data we need
to transfer since you want to watch it
all but we don't wait for all of that
movie data to be sent in one go before
watching it we just wait for these
chunks of data to be sent or to arrive
and then we can press play on the movie
and we generally say that we're waiting
for the movie - Buffy wrapper buffer
right so you can see the benefit of this
whole idea of streams and buffers right
there we can start consuming data even
before it's all arrived we don't have to
gather all of the data in memory first
and then consume it we can do it bit by
bit so why am I telling you all this
what on earth is he got to do with no
chairs well we can create streams to
read and write files in OTS which
because of the way streams and buffers
work can increase the performance of
your application and that's also true
when we're dealing with requests on our
node server and we're sending data back
to the client to be consumed so this all
ties in together so now we know how
streams and buffers were
we're going to go ahead in the next
tutorial and we're going to create some
streams and see how they work in nodejs
I'll see you guys it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
