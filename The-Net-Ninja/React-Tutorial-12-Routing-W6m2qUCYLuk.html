twelfth react tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk about routing with
react alright then so far in this
tutorial our application consists only
of this one view or one page if you like
but we might have several different
pages that we want to show to the user
now how do we control the routes of
those different components or pages well
we can use routing on the front end in
react and yet I know you can do this on
the server as well but a lot of the time
we'd like to do this on the front end
and so we can do that now react router
is not automatically installed with
react we have to install that separately
for us to use it so we're going to do
that first of all so I've got the
console right here and I'm going to say
NPM install react - router and then I'm
going to save this to my death
dependency so that's going to go ahead
and install react router for you okay
cool so once that's installed we can now
use it in our project and react router
gives us two components to work with the
router component which keeps the URL in
sync with the UI of the application and
the route component which is going to
match our route to the app components ok
so I'm going to show you how all of this
works but we need to first import those
two things as a bare minimum into this
project so this time around I'm going to
use EF 2015 to do this so I'll say
import and then in curly braces we're
going to say what we're going to import
and that is the router and also route
component and we're going to get that
from react - or router
okay so now we've imported those and we
can use them inside this project now the
way I like to set up my routes is by
creating a new reactor class so I'm
going to say var and I'm going to call
this up and I'm going to set it equal to
react create class and then inside that
we know we need the render method so
let's open that up and we'll say a
render
and that's equal to a function which is
going to return something so in our
previous components we've returned this
JSX which is like HTML now we're going
to do something similar in here but the
JSX that we're going to return is going
to be our routes okay so the way we
structure this is by first of all saying
router like so and then inside the
router tags we're going to insert our
individual routes like this
okay so inside these tags we can attach
attributes to say how we want them to
work for example how we want each route
to render a different component so if I
want to route which matches the path of
just forward slash I can say route path
is equal to curly braces then in quotes
forward slash and that's going to find
that path and now I want to match it up
to a component so I can say component is
equal to whatever component I would a
render when this path is specified so I
want this component to render right here
so I'm going to grab that and paste it
in there so now whenever we go to
forward slash it's going to show this
component okay and it might not show it
just yet we've not fully set this up but
the principle is that now I want to add
on another route I want to add on a
route for the about view so what I've
done is I've already created this about
J s file right here and inside this is
just a dead simple reactive component so
I've required react I've called this
component about created a class and it's
just returning this HTT right here then
I've exported this at the bottom so in
the index file now I'm just going to
require that I'm going to say well about
is equal to require and this is going to
be dot forward slash about like so so
now we can use that component in here as
well so I want to set up a route for the
about component I'm going to copy that
dude and paste it all right down below
and say forward slash about for the path
and the component that it's going to
render is going to be that
out component okay so there we go
there's two routes set up now now we
need to do a couple more things before
this works the first thing we need to do
is actually render this component
because right now this is just kind of
sitting there doing nothing at all yeah
we've set it up but it's not doing
anything to our application okay because
the only thing that's being rendered to
the browser is this component this to do
component and we do that at the bottom
of the file right here we say react Dom
dot render the to do component in this
ID right here so instead of rendering
that I'm going to render the app
component which is the thing we just
created right here okay up so if we save
that now then this still won't fully
work and you see that we vanished over
there it's not working okay that's
because there's one more thing we need
to do we need to go to the package.json
file right here well there's two things
we need to do and the first thing we're
going to do is come to this build script
okay and we're going to specify a little
flag right here and this flag is going
to be - - then history API fallback so
when we type in a route here it's going
to look on the server for that route and
if that route can't be found then it's
going to fall back to the index page for
the 404 page of your light so it's going
to serve up that index file which is
listing right here okay so this is where
our app component is now getting
rendered because we specified that right
here at the bottom up right down it's
rendering in this ID okay so when we hit
a 404 for example forward slash about
that doesn't exist we hit that 404 it's
going to return this index file to us
okay and then react is going to pick up
that route that files slash about and
it's going to render the about component
right here in this ID makes sense
okay so we've saved that and by the way
after you've added this to your package
JSON file you might want to rerun this
build scripts I'll just say NPM start if
you've set it up exactly like I have so
once that is done there's one
think I want to do let's head it back
over to the index J's file now I'm going
to import one more thing from here and
that is the browser history API so I'm
going to say browser history and this is
what we use to keep track of the forward
and back buttons okay so if we go to
file / about them forward slash we can
go further backwards and forwards on
these arrows and that's going to
remember the state forests if you like
of the application so I've imported that
right here and we're going to use that
in this router tag so I'm going to say
router history is equal to the browser
history that we just imported and you
could use hash history of you like
instead where you have a little hash
symbol in your URL I don't like that I
like cleaner URLs so we've got a browser
history in this case so I'm going to
save that now and I'm going to check
this out in a browser so forward slash
okay that's just given us this subdue
component cool forward slash about is
now giving us that about component okay
that is really cool so now all we need
to do is add our routes inside this
class right here and react is going to
take care of all the rest for us how
cool is that
so there we go guys that is routing
action in the next tutorial I'm going to
take this one step further and just show
you how we can link to different routes
within the application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
