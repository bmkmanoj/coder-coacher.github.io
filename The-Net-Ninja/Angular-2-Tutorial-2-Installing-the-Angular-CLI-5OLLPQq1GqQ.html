second angular 2 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
install the angular CLI on our computer
okay so for this series I'm going to use
the angular CLI which is a command line
interface for angular 2 and it basically
opens up a load of angular commands that
we can use in the command prompt to
create new projects and generate the
core file setup to spin up a local
server create new components as well as
loads of other things as well now you
don't have to use the angular CLI to
create angular 2 projects however it is
much easier to do so and it can be quite
a pain to get started with angular 2 if
we don't now it requires the node
package manager to install the angular
CLI so we need node on our computer in
order to do that so to install nodejs
all you want to do is head over to
node.js org and click this button right
here to download the version recommended
for most users so once you hit that it's
going to download on your computer
follow the installation instructions
just keep everything the same and it's
going to install node on your computer
but once that's finished just to make
sure it has installed what you want to
do is hit the start button and open up a
command prompt by typing CMD and go
right here and open that and then just
type in note - V and that's going to
spin back the version of node that
you've got on your computer now I've got
6.2 you don't need that you can just
download for point four point seven that
is absolutely fine okay so now we have
node on our computer we can use the node
package manager because it installed
that as well and we use the node package
manager to install all the packages on
our computer and one such package is the
angular CLI so the way we install that
now is by typing NPM which stands for
node package manager install and then
we're going to install this globally so
I'll say - gee that's what that means so
it installs it on the entire computer
and not just in one project and then the
package name which is angular - see
alive so just do that click enter then
this is going to go ahead and install
the angular CLI on your computer now
depending I'll quit your computer is
it's going to take maybe two or three
minutes to do this mine is really slow
at the minute so I'm just going to cut
here and I'll see you when it's done
okay cool so that is finally installed
and now we can use the angular CLI to
interact with our projects and the way
we do that is by first saying ng and
then whatever command we want to run but
I'm not going to do that just yet what
I'm going to do first of all is navigate
to a directory where I want to create a
angular 2 project
so I've already copied that to my
clipboard I'm just going to paste it in
right here but first of all you need to
write CD that's done for change
directory and then whatever directory
you want to go in for example documents
or something like that I can say I've
already pasted the path to the directory
I want to go to so I'm going to paste
that in right here so you can see it's
in YouTube sites angular 2 playlist so
at the minute that is just an empty
directory and I've also opened that
directory in item right here and as you
can see there's absolutely nothing in it
whatsoever yet but what we're going to
do now is generate an angular 2 project
in this directory so if we go to the
command prompt to get to do that what we
want to do is run an angular command and
remember I said that's ng and then the
commands you want to run so this time
around when we want to create a new
project what we need to do is say new
and then the name of our project so I'm
just going to call this project ninja -
directory hit enter and that's going to
go ahead and install or rather create
this project on your computer and set up
all the base files for you alright cool
so now that's going to head and created
a new project for us
in this directory right here and if I go
to Adam you can see in this directory we
now have the ninja directory project ok
so it's gone ahead and created all these
files for us and folders now this might
look a bit overwhelming at first but
don't worry I'm going to go through what
everything does and in actual fact we're
not going to need most all of these
files and folders we're only going to be
working in this source folder right here
this is where our application code is
going to go the rest is kind of like
configuration and the output files and
I'll walk you through them later on
anyway so for now all you need to
remember is how we created a new angular
application using the angular CLI and we
did that by saying ng
and then new and then the name of our
application and we did it in this
directory where we wanted to create that
application okay so that's installed
this basic project for us now and if we
want to view this project in a browser
then what we're going to need to do is
spin up a server and the angular CLI can
let us do that as well so the first
thing we want to do is navigate into our
new project directory which is this
thing right here so again we're going to
say CD and then ninja - directory and
that's going to go into this directory
then I'm going to say NG serve and this
is going to serve up a server and it's
going to show this application in it so
this might just take a second assume all
right so that's split up a local server
for us and it is serving on this address
right here localhost and you can see
pour 4200 so if we navigate to that
dress on our computer now it's going to
show us this project that it created for
us this base project so let's go to a
browser and let's go to that address
localhost 4200 and if we click enter
it's going to load the application just
takes a second and there we go app works
so this is just a really bog-standard
basic application that we've installed
kind of like a bootstrap application if
you like and we can go ahead and create
our own application on top of it so
that's how we install the angular CLI
and that's how we use it to create a new
project in the next tutorial what I'm
going to do is just give you a quick
primer on typescript before we dive in
to this code and explain what everything
does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
