js' tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about pipes alright so
what did we do in the last tutorial we
created this read stream and we created
this write stream and we read data using
this read stream from this file then we
listen down for those data events
whenever we received a chunk of data
from the read stream then we wrote that
chunk of data to the write stream so
this act of reading data from a read
stream then transferring that data to
the write stream is quite common in
nodejs and because it's quite common
they've given us a more elegant approach
to handle this and that's by using
what's known as pipes
ok so currently we're receiving data
down the stream we're filling up a
buffer when that's full it sends on a
chunk of data and we're manually
listening out for this data event when
we receive a chunk of data then we get
that chunk of data and we manually write
it to a write stream and send it
somewhere else so it's all quite manual
this process now a pipe can help us do
exactly the same thing take data from a
read stream and then pipe it into a
write stream so again we have our data
coming down the street fills up a buffer
and it sends a chunk of data route but
instead of manually listening for that
on data event when we receive a chunk of
data the pipe just automatically does
that for us
and then it pipes it to the stream the
write stream that we want to send it to
so we don't have to manually listen for
data events and we don't have to
manually write to a write stream it
takes care of all that for us so how do
we do this in the code well we still
need to create a read stream to read
data from and we still need to create a
write stream because that's where we're
going to write the data the change is in
this bit here where we're manually
listening for data events and writing to
the stream so we'll take off all that
there and instead on this readable
stream we can use a method called pipe
and we can only use this method not in
capitals
unreadable streams because we're piping
from a readable stream to a writable
stream that's the whole act so we can't
pipe from a writable stream because we
can't read from that it has to be from a
readable screen so we're piping that
into this writable stream right here
so that's doing exactly the same thing
all of that code we wrote before is
doing the same thing as this we're
listening to data coming down this
stream and then we're piping it into the
right stream so this is going to work
exactly the same and if I save this and
go to node up then it's going to run and
it's going to do the same thing it's
going to send all the data to here and
what I'll do is just delete this file so
we can see it again because I think I
already had that there so we'll save it
node app and then we see it so it's done
exactly the same thing cool so what I
want to do now is return to this server
that we created a few tutorials back
because we're going to use this idea of
piping from a readable string to a
writable stream to send data to a user
so the last time we created the server
we sent back some plain text and the
plain text was this thing right here hey
meters so what if we want to send back
the contents of this readme text file
then we're not going to copy and paste
it all in here because that's going to
make our code a mess so what we can do
is we can read from the file then we can
write to this a writable stream right
here this response and send it to the
data so we can either do that using the
method where we listen for data events
or we can just use this method right
here so what I'm going to do is take all
of this cut it and then I'm going to
paste it inside here okay now currently
what we're doing is we're reading from
this read stream and we're sending it to
this rag stream now we don't want to
send it to here there's no point in that
we
I send it to the user to the claim we
want to send it to this response stream
right here because this response object
is a writable stream which we can write
data to so I'm going to get rid of this
because we don't need that right stream
and instead of piping it to my right
stream now we just pipe it to the
response so now we can get rid of that
response to end we don't need that
anymore that does exactly the same thing
it ends the response it sends data down
the stream to the claim so let's save
that and let's run it by saying node app
and this is going to listen to the
server you see here we have this console
dot log message we're now listening to
port 3000 so let's go to the browser and
go to port 3000 and notice we get all of
that lorem ipsum text back and there's a
lot of it so what we've done now is
we've sent this data in a stream which
is much better for performance than
reading the whole file as a whole and
then sending it on so just to quickly
recap we've created a server here we've
got the request object and the response
object as well and this response object
is a writable stream so we can write to
it then we've done this little console
dot log message right here and we've
written our response headers by saying
right head 200 because everything's ok
that's the status then the content type
is text slash plain because that's what
we're reading we're reading plain text
from this then we're creating a restream
which goes out uses the FS module to
create a read stream and reads the
contents of this file right there and we
specified the utf-8 character encoding
so we're getting back in the characters
that we expect from a text file then
we've taken that read stream and we've
piped it into the response stream and
that's doing all of the heavy lifting
for us listening to that data event and
whenever we get data streaming it to the
user
bit by bit so they receive data quicker
ok so this is how we use pipes and how
we use them to say
information to writable streams now in
the next tutorial we're going to go
ahead and start sending the user or the
client some HTML instead of simple text
so I've you have any questions so far
feel free to leave those down below
otherwise don't forget to share
subscribe and like guys and then I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
