16th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about views
and routing Wow or other Dokes so in our
applications so far we just have one
single view right it's this thing right
here the list of ninjas but when our
application gets a bit bigger it's going
to typically have different views for
example some kind of home view then this
list view there may be a contact view
and about view that kind of thing
now I already said in a previous
tutorial that angularjs is primarily
used for single page applications that
means when we click on a link it doesn't
go to another page exactly it just
requests a different view and then that
view is placed in the content area right
here so it's all going to become clearer
as we go through this example what I'm
going to do is they're going to make
this into a view file and I'm going to
make this into a view file then we're
going to set up our routing so that when
we click on one of these links it
requests the appropriate view and
injects it into the content over here ok
so the way this works is we're going to
grab this content right here which
represents this for you I'm just going
to cut that I'm going to leave the
header in because that's going to stay
on the top of every page but then what
I'm going to do is come over here and
create a new folder called views and
we're going to store all our views in
there so let's create a new file and
this one is going to be called and we'll
call this directory dot HTML because
this is going to be the directory on the
list of ninjas and then I'm just going
to pop that right in there I'm going to
create a new view view and this is going
to be called hole to HTML and for now
we'll just put in an h1 and we'll say
homepage won't fill out that content a
little bit more later on so we've
created our two views now one for the
home content and one for the list ninjas
content now what we need to do is tell
angular where to insert these views on
this index file ok so what we're going
to do is just insert it here underneath
the header where the content was
previously now to tell you
where to insert it we're going to need
to use a directive and the directive is
called ng-view now this can be a tag
directive or you can apply it as an
attribute now I'm going to use an
attribute because I'm going to put it on
a main tag like that because this is
going to be the main content of whatever
view we're on so I'll say main then the
directive which is ng - view and then
just close that off and now when we
request a view angularjs is going to
know where to put that view okay so
we're going to set up our routes in a
minute so the angular recognizes when we
go to a particular URL for example
forward slash directory angular will
know to go out it will get the direct
review grab the contents of that and
then it knows where to dump it it's
going to dump it within these tags where
we specify this ng-view directive okay
so now let's go ahead and sort out our
routing and we do that in the config now
before we get into doing the routing we
need to inject a dependency into this
module right here okay now when we
create this module I said we use these
square brackets right here to put our
dependencies in now when it comes to
routing we need to inject a dependency
because the routing library is a
completely separate library it's not
automatically bundled in with the core
angularjs file right here it's not in
this one
now I've already gone ahead and
downloaded angular route min-gi so I'm
going to link to that in a second and
I'm going to pop that dependency in here
but if you want to go download it all
you need to do is click this download
angularjs one go to browse additional
modules and you'll find it down here
somewhere there you go and give a route
dot min so go ahead and download that
pop it into this folder right here and
then we're going to link to it and
inject it right here so before we do
anything let's link to it up here all
you need to do is put it right under
your angularjs file so just probably
script out there linking to this file
then we can save it and go ahead and
inject the dependency right here now the
dependency is called ng route so when
you pop that in there it knows we're
going to be using this file right here
this route library okay and we need to
explicitly put it into a module so that
we can use the functionality of ng route
in our config method and that's what
we're going to do now okay so remember I
said the config method was a method
which fires a load of code before your
application runs so any kind of code or
configuration that you need to run
before your application starts we put
into the config method so we're going to
put all of our routing stuff into the
config method because we want to set all
that all for anything starts so that it
recognizes a URL that a user goes to
okay all right then so let's create that
config method so we'll just say manage
your app which is this variable right
here the module so my ninja app config
and then what we're going to do is pass
through the dependencies first of all
and I'm going to do it the same way as I
did over here where we pass through the
dependencies in an array to protect them
from minification okay so we don't need
to give config a name or if you like we
did the controller we just need to pass
through the dependencies and the
function all right so the dependency
that we want is called route provider
okay so we're not putting in ng route
here that's the name of this kind of
module that we use in but because we
inserted that module right here as a
dependency it allows us to pass through
this route provider object this ramp
provided object is part of this ng route
module okay so this is what we're going
to pass through this object and this
object is going to let us set up all
these different routes so now we pass
through that let's pass our function
through and again we have to pass it
through here as well this object like we
did with the scope down there so let's
pass in route provider again and then
let's go ahead and set up our routes
okay cool okay then so the first thing
we need to do is say a route provider
we're going to use that object and we're
going to say dot when now I'm going to
put this on the next line
to keep it nice and kind of tired
because we're going to use this a couple
of times and this when method we need to
pass through a couple of things the
first thing we need to pass through is
the URL so saying when a user visitors
visit a particular URL do something okay
so the URL is going to be a forward
slash home so when they view that we're
going to do something and the second
parameter we need to pass to do is an
object and this object is going to take
contain some different properties okay
now the property I want to use is
template URL okay
so this is the view we're going to
specify where it can find the view for
when a user visits forward slash hole so
the view can be found in the view folder
/o HTML alright so when someone visits
forward slash hole angular is going to
know that the template URL is that this
path views home it's going to grab that
right there and it's going to dump it
into the view section here okay so
that's all we need to do for that one
then we want to do another one so dot
went like that fact I put that on the
next line dot went and then we're going
to pass through the same kind of things
this time is going to be forward slash
directory which is going to be the list
of ninjas we're going to pass through
that object with some options in it and
the first thing is going to be the
template URL again which will be abused
I forgot my s on there so views and then
forward slash directory dot HTML so this
is the view for the directory right
there we're going to pass through
another property here and this is going
to be the controller okay so when we
visit this directory
we're telling which for you were telling
angular which view we want to use and
also which control that we want to use
for this directory okay I'll show you
what we can do in a second with that so
controller and it's going to be this
controller right here this ninja
controller
because that's going to be controlling
the functionality of this view right
okay so we've done our two wins for
those two pages now we're going to use a
method called otherwise and we're going
to pass through an object and we're
saying okay so if you visit any other
page whatsoever that's not one of these
then we're going to redirect to and put
in /home so any of the URL that a user
visits is going to redirect to this URL
right here and it's going to grab this
view okay perfect
so that's our routing setup right there
we just need to do a couple more things
and you can already see that we're
grabbing /home here is grabbing this
whole view and it's inserting it already
okay
so that's because we just visited any
page like that and because it wasn't
home it wasn't directory it redirected
to hole and it grabbed that view okay
cool so one more thing we need to do and
that is to go into the directs we got
HTML file and I'm going to remove this
controller this ninja controller ok so
let's get rid of the closing div as well
and the reason I can do that is because
I've told angularjs right here that for
this content it's going to be controlled
by the ninja controller so now it knows
that this is all going to be controlled
by that ninja controller and we can use
all of those scope objects right here
and functions in that view without
putting the ninja controller div right
here okay so it's just another way of
telling angular that this content right
here is going to be controlled by the
ninja controller it's just a little bit
better it D blocks the HTML a bit more
ok so now we've done that if we go to
forward slash director Rick we're going
to see the directory right here and if
we go to hole we're going to see hole
and you might notice this little hash
right here this is just the way that
angularjs works with routing and we can
get rid of it and we're going to cover
that later in the clean URLs but for now
just kind of accept that this is the way
that angle
jazz works it uses this kind of hash
symbol to create its routes right and
that's how we link to different pages
because right now this is linking to
nothing less ninjas doesn't link
anywhere home doesn't link anywhere so
let's go into the header and all we need
to do is go to hash for whole font slash
home yeah and then for this one we just
say hash forward slash director it like
that okay so now when we click list
ninjas it's going to go to the directory
to this URL
when we click home it's going to go to
this page like that so that's our
routing pretty much set up and like I
say we have to put the hash in the H ref
attributes right there then a forward
slash for this to work that's just the
way that angular works okay and then
when we specify the routes in our config
we don't put that hashing okay this is
after the hash so there we go guys that
is routing and how we create views if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
