second Atmos group sixth tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
constants ah okay they're going so as
you can see I've gone ahead and created
this really simple HTML file it's called
indexed or HTML and all I've done is
link up this script in the head script
j/s which is a right over here nothing
else in the body so in this script I've
just got a window dot onload event which
is going to find this function where all
the magic happens now on the right I've
got open Google Chrome Canary
because remember canary support a lot of
es6 features so that's what I've been
working with and I've got the console
open because we're going to log a lot of
data to the console okay then so es6
gives us the Const keyword and a Const
is just a value which cannot be changed
it's a read on a variable and the way we
declare one is by simply saying Const
and then the name of your constant I'm
going to call this PI and set it equal
to a value 3.14 to okay so let's just
log that to the console let's see what
it does if i refresh now we get that
value in the console cool now what
happens if we try and change it let's
give it a whirl I'll say pi equals 10
save that refresh and we get this error
assignment to constant variable and
that's just basically telling us that we
cannot assign a new value to this
constant because it's a constant right
we don't want to change it and even if
we try to read eclair it using the Const
keyword this still won't work this time
we get an error scene identify a PI has
already been declared so we can't really
Claire constants either cool so that is
a constant what I want to do now is just
a simple example using a constant so to
do that I'm going to create a function
which is going to calculate the area of
a circle for us so I'll say function
calc area this is going to take in a
value called R which stands for radius
and then in here we're going to log to
the console this radius so first I'll
say the area is then I'll can
having that with pi and the formula for
calculating the area of a circle is just
PI R squared right so I'll just do PI
times R times R ok cool so that is our
function now we just need to call it so
I'll say cowl area and we need to pass
in a value for R which are say 5 save
that and refresh over here and now it
says the area is seventy eight point
five five cool so that works now what if
we try and change the value of pi in
here well let's just try and reassign it
first of all almost eight ten and save
that and we still get that error but we
can read eclair it in here we can say
Const pi equals ten and that will work
if we refresh now we get a different
value so we're creating a local version
of this constant if we console.log PI
outside of the function like nuts then
it's still going to give us 3.14 to
because it's using this global version
of the constant but in here
we can read Eclair it and override this
value by giving her a local scope okay
so there we go guys
that is constants for you if you have
any questions feel free to leave those
down below otherwise I'll see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
