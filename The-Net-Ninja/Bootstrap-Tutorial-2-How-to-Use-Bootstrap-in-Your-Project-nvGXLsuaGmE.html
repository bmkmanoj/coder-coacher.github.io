bootstrap 3 lesson 2 and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can use
bootstrap in our project Wow so as you
can see I've got over to get bootstrap
calm this is the bootstrap website and
what I'm going to do is just click this
download bootstrap button right here now
there's a few options when it comes to
using bootstrap in our projects and the
most simple way is to use the CDN link
provided right here now CDN just stands
for content delivery network which means
that bootstrap themselves they host the
file somewhere and we just link to that
ok so that is the easiest version or the
easiest way to load in bootstrap to our
projects but we can also download the
files directly and put them in our
folder structure then link to those
local versions that way we can work
offline this way we have to work online
so we can access these links right here
or there's a couple of Advanced Options
where we can download the whole source
code and also we can go to this
customize link right at the top and we
can build our old and bootstrap kanna
package and we can basically just tell
bootstrap what we want in this package
so these are all the different kind of
components and CSS things and JavaScript
components that come with bootstrap
anything we don't want so say for
example we don't want the carousel we
don't want to tilt it we don't want
these now sore breadcrumbs or anything
like that
we cannot want to tick what we don't
want and then we can also edit the the
base styles and the the typography that
kind of thing and then we can download
that bootstrap file of those bootstrap
files rather okay so then we'll only
kind of downloading the file size that
we need and not extra information that
we don't need so for the sake of this
tutorial series what I'm going to do is
just use the CDN because like I say it's
the quickest and most simple way so I'm
going to just click copy right here and
then I'm going to head over to brackets
which is the text editor I'm going to
use for this playlist now you can see I
just create a folder called bootstrap
and in it is just this single file
index.html now just a few things in here
just a basic kind of template with the
doctype HTML head tag and then in the
head just a title then we've got this
meta tag of viewport and is set to the
device width
and it's got an initial scale of 1 now
if you want to know more about the
viewport check out my responsive website
tutorial playlist I'll leave the link
down below but essentially what this is
doing is just overriding the default
viewport on mobile devices so that we
can use responsive styles because
otherwise we just have a large viewport
which is going to squash our website on
mobile devices so that's necessary this
thing right here for creating mobile
websites now let me just pop this code
we just pasted sorry we just copied from
the bootstrap website and you can see
we've got 3 files right here we've got
the compiled and minified CSS and this
is the core CSS that bootstrap uses for
things like the grid system so we're
going to need this so what I'm going to
do is pop this right in the head just
under the viewport like that and that
will do the second file right here is an
optional theme and basically this just
includes styles which are going to alter
things like the typography colors or cut
any kind of sugar that goes on top
basically now for most of this tutorial
series I'm not going to use it I might
look at themes later but for now I'm not
going to use it because we're just going
to focus on the core functionality of
bootstrap now this final file is the
minified javascript file which is going
to control all the functionalities such
as using things like modal's or
carousels that kind of thing so what
we'll do is grab that so we're going to
need it we're going to paste it right at
the bottom of the body tag right there
like that ok now there's one more thing
we need to do and that is to include a
link to jQuery in this document because
bootstrap has a dependency on jQuery it
needs in the document in order to
function properly so let's head over to
the jQuery CDN site that's just at coach
jQuery comm and what I'm going to do is
just get jQuery 1 I'm going to paste
that down into the body and I'm going to
put it right above loops in a script tag
of course I'm going to put it right
above the bootstrap one and the reason
I'm doing that is because bootstrap like
I say has a dependence
on jQuery okay so this needs to come
first then the bootstrap file alright so
that is pretty much it what I'm going to
do is just save that then and then I'm
going to click this little lightning
bulb that's going to bring up a live
preview for me just to make sure that
everything is working just take a little
while this little thing but there we go
so you want to learn bootstrap hope and
if we inspect the element I'm just going
to open up the Google console you can
see it failed to load this resource
that's fine but no other errors so we
are ready to start using bootstrap in
our document so we'll get started with
that in a very next tutorial I'll see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
