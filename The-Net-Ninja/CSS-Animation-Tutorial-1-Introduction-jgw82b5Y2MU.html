animations lesson one Wow boobs so what
is a CSS animation well basically a CSS
animation makes it really easy to
animate web elements on your website
without the need to use JavaScript or
jQuery a lot of the time so it's just
pure CSS and that's really cool early
speeds the whole thing up a lot and the
great thing is it's super easy to master
once you get the hang of it yeah there's
a little bit of new syntax involved and
you're going to have to learn that but
once you get used to that syntax and
learn how to create these animations
it's just really simple to create some
cool looking effects on your website so
I'm going to introduce CSS animations to
you by creating this nifty little mario
cat scene right here but then we are
going to move on to some more kind of
practical web
examples such as this one adding an item
to your basket and also going through a
pop-up animation just a nice little way
to add a pop up to your website as well
as a couple of other things as well all
right so here's a pretty full list of
what we are going to be covering first
of all we're going to take a look at
transforms and transitions just keep it
easy to begin with then I'm going to
introduce keyframes which are like the
powerhouse of animations of where we
control them and then we're going to
move on to the animation basics using
that mariokart example I showed you a
minute ago and then finally we're going
to look at some practical examples that
we can use on the web there's also a
couple of things you should probably
know before you start this playlist the
first one is CSS that is a dead cert you
need to know what you're doing in CSS
because after all we're controlling
these animations using CSS right the
second one is HTML again we're going to
be controlling HTML elements they're the
things they're going to be animating on
the page so it's probably going to be a
good idea if you know a little bit of
that as well and our third layer jQuery
is not absolutely essential but we might
start using it just to add a little bit
of interactivity to the pages such as
click events and that kind of thing
alright so if you don't know any of this
I've got playlists on all of these three
things on this channel right here I'll
leave the links to those down below so
you can check those out first of all and
then come back okay so just a couple
more things
before we get started the first one is
this my github page I've uploaded all
the kind of core base files for this
playlist to a repository on github so
you can come in download those by
clicking the download zip button and
then they can kind of work along with me
through those examples I'll leave the
link to this page down below
secondly I'm going to be using brackets
to make these files I'll go through
these examples rather so if you want to
download the same text editor you can do
it's absolutely free brackets dot IO
just press this button down here and
yeah I'll leave the link to that down
below also and finally before we get
started I just wanted to quickly mention
browser support for animations because
although it is pretty well supported in
most one of browsers you can see there's
a lot of green around here there are a
couple of issues with Internet Explorer
older versions and other things as well
around here so it's probably worth
taking a look at before you start using
CSS animations on your live web sites
but I'm going to be using Google Chrome
for this tutorial playlist and
everything is pretty well supported in
that so we shouldn't have any issues
whatsoever okay so that is your will
wind introduction to CSS animations I
hope you enjoy this playlist if you have
any questions feel free to leave those
down below don't forget to share guys
subscribe and like and I'll see you in a
very nice tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
