PSD to WordPress lesson 21 and in this
video we're going to go over the page
dot PHP template Wow alright then guys
so in the last tutorial we went over the
front page dot PHP template we created
that for our front page now this is only
going to be the template for the very
front page for any of the content page
on the website by default it's gonna
fall back on this page dot PHP template
right here okay
so when I say any other page if I just
bring up WordPress back-end area let's
go into the pages WordPress back-end
area that sounds a little bit dirty all
those pages there if we see all those
these are the other pages on your
website so we've only got one of them in
its sample page but if we have loads of
others then they would all be the pages
right on your website and when we view
those pages in a browser WordPress is
gonna fall back on this page dot PHP
template and for those pages let's just
take a look at this picture again I
showed you this picture a couple of
lessons back
it's the template hierarchy so these are
our singular pages we've got other posts
which is like blogs or pages so I'm
talking about pages right a static page
so when we create those static pages
it's gonna look for a page template now
it's not the front page it's just a
default template right not a custom one
so the first file it's gonna look for is
the page - slug so if we've called it
about it's gonna look for page - about
dot PHP now we've not created anything
like that in our theme folder so the
next thing it's gonna do is look up page
- ID of the page
we've not created one of those either
alright so then it falls back on this
page PHP template so that is the
template currently that our theme is
going to load up whenever it sees a
static page on our website ok so let's
take a look at what that currently looks
like the page there we go page dot PHP
and first thing your does is get the
header like pretty much any other
template then we've got this opening div
and main tag which is on nearly every
template as well and then what we're
doing is doing this
lupa part they say well we have the post
so if there's some content basically get
a template part and it's within the
template plants folder content so it's
in here template parts and it's asking
for the content template part and it's
also specifying this other variable
called page so that means we want this
one content - page row so it's calling
that template and whatever is in this
PHP file is going to get dumped here
right so let's have a look in that file
and this is basically a lot of dynamic
stuff that WordPress is inserting into
the page now the stuff it's inserting
ease let's bring up this go to the page
the first thing is the ID of the page so
it's just gonna output that there
alright and if this was say idea of one
or two then it's just going to be page
one on page two or something like that
okay then the class of the post or the
page then it's gonna grab the title and
the title is just this thing right here
then it's going to grab the content
which is all this stuff here and it's
going to output that and then it's gonna
do this little function called WP link
pages that's just the pagination for
your page or your post or whatever and
then at the bottom it's got this little
empty footer with the Edit post link and
that edit post link if we view this in a
browser lets view the page that any post
link is outputting this thing right here
okay so if I click this if I'm logged in
you can see I've got this little I've
been marked bar at the top if I am
logged in and a view this page and get
this little quick link here so if I
click Edit it's gonna take me to this
page so I can quickly edit the post
right you don't see this if you're not
logged in this edit thing so if I log
out and then you'll I go to the sample
page again this time I don't see that
edit link right so it's all there for
people that are logged in so they can
quickly go and edit that link so that's
what that does and then as we come down
we've got the end of the footer and the
end of this article tag right here that
the whole thing is contained in so
that's what this little Content page
template part does it just grabs all of
content from the page and it don't sit
in this page dot PHP template right here
okay some good all that and then below
that it's doing a little bit more PHP
and this is to display the comments on
the pace so it's saying if the comments
are open if we've allowed comments for
that particular page then we get those
comments and we display them by using
this template part right here and that
is in comments PHP and all this stuff
right here we can change if we want we
can change the div classes or the IDS or
how it's outputting the different things
right here but for this tutorial I'm not
going to do that you know I think it
looks prettier out as it is and yeah we
can change the styles later on to make
it look a bit different but it's
grabbing all the information that we
need for comments so that's pretty cool
so we're not going to edit that so after
the comments closes all the PHP and the
main and a div tag then it's grabbing
the footer and the sidebar yeah so let's
just have a quick look how it seems at
the moment in a browser so it looks
something like this now first of all
we've got the header that's fine and
we've got a photo that's fine as well
this content right here it needs to be
pulled in so it's within that central
column right and to do that remember we
need that class of wrapper applying to
all this stuff and then this right here
this is the sidebar and I don't want the
sidebar showing on static pages I'm just
gonna show this sidebar on posts like a
blog stuff on news okay not for and
about what page or anything like that so
let's make those edits right now the
first thing I want to do is get this div
with a class of a wrapper and I'll paste
it in here like that and we'll end the
div right about here and what I'm gonna
do is also give this an ID and the ID is
going to be page content and the reason
of delight is because if I want to style
something in particular on how pages
lock then I'm going to use this ID and
this is going to identify that we use
him the page template and I can use this
to target elements within here okay just
specific to pages so that's why I've
done that let's get rid of the sidebar
also
go on that and save it and we'll go back
and have another look how this looks
right no okay what I want to do is login
that's looking better by the way already
I want to login and I want to style this
thing right here with the edit linking
so let's just go to WP admin and login
and then we'll go through that page
again sample page okay cool that's now
here so if I right click that and
inspect the element we'll just edit it
over here in the console we can see that
we want to change this I want to give it
a little bit of padding and I want to
change the background color also so
currently it's loading in these styles
so what I override that for this entry
footer so I grab that class copy it and
I'm just gonna click this link to show
me where this footer is in the CSS and
I've below it and I'll take footer dots
and then the class are just grabbed so
we can override some of these rules and
the padding is gonna be 10 pixels all
the way around that looks a little
neater and I'm also gonna give it a
background of a light gray now as I do
that the Edit link pretty much
disappears so let's change the link
color also I'm gonna copy this paste it
underneath I'll say 8 and we're gonna
change the link color so we'll say color
3 3 3 that's not doing anything so I
think there's another rule overriding
it's somewhere down here yeah we could
rewrite our rules I'm just gonna put in
Portland for now just so it overrides
that and now we can see and that looks
better to me
so I'm gonna grab all of that CSS and
I'm gonna dump it back in this theme
all right we'll come down to the bottom
of this CSS if I would just grab it all
because we covered it all or pasted it
online save it and then oops refresh
over here and cool it's all updated all
right there so that is the page dot PHP
template so it's so whenever we have a
new page now we're going to have this
header at the top the footer at the
bottom this nice little edit link and
then all the content in the middle
pretty cool right
all right there so that is it for this
tutorial in the next one what we're
going to do is go ahead and style the
post page template which is the single
dot PHP one so until then guys see if
