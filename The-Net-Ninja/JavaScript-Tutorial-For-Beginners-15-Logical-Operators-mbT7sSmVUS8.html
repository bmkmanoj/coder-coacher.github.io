JavaScript for beginners lesson 15 and
in this video we're going to take a look
at logical operators ah
alright then class so what we've done so
far is take a look at these if
statements where we check a set
condition if that condition is true we
execute some code and we can add L steps
on air or else if statements and then
we've looked at comparison operators
which are these things here you know
greater less equal to or greater equal
to a less double equals triple equals
and then the negation operators as well
okay so now what we're going to do is
take a look at the logical operators
which is the operators we use to check
whether multiple conditions are true
okay
so I'll give an example let's just
delete all of this here save and then
I'm going to create a variable called my
age and then set it to 25 and what I'm
going to do is create one of those
package holidays where unless you're 18
to 30 you ain't coming we don't want old
fogies and obviously no one less than 18
because you can't drink and we're going
to go partying alright so I'm going to
check that these people are under at 30
or under an equals 30 and over or at
least 18 okay so let's do active
statement first of all and we'll say my
age need to be over or equal to 18 okay
that's the minimum requirement so that
we evaluate to true correctly and we do
our code block here however we also
require them to be 30 or under and this
is where the logical operators come into
play now we're going to use the double
ampersand operates here and that stands
for and okay so we'll write another
condition here which is my age is less
than or equal to 30 so we've got two
conditions we've got this first one here
which is my age has to be equal to or
over 18 and then the second condition
which is my age has to be less than or
equal to 30 and this and logical
operator here is saying that both of
these conditions that and this have to
be met for this whole expression to
evaluate to true okay now luckily this
age is 25 so yippee I'm going on holiday
so let's document
that to the let's write that to the
document so document we got right and
then we'll say you can come you cool
dude yep really cool so let's save that
and then we'll do an else statement and
say document dot write you ain't coming
all right so let's save that and refresh
over here there we go you can come you
cool dude but let's change this to 15
now you'll notice that this condition
will not be met this will will but this
one won't I remember when we use the and
operator both of these conditions have
to be met for this to evaluate to true
so hopefully now this will be false and
then it will go down to the else
statement where we'll write out this so
I save and refresh you ain't coming and
the same should be said for anything
over 30 and let's refresh yep you ain't
coming so that's how we use the and
logical operator now we can tackle this
from a different viewpoint by using the
or operator so let's delete that there
and this time I'm going to say my age
has to be less than 18 okay and then the
or operator is the double pipes on my
keyboard might be different on yours is
towards the bottom left it's the shift
key and the backslash icon so you get
those pipes there and this stands for
all two pipes and the other condition is
gonna be my age is over 30 so what we're
saying there is that my age must be
under 18 all my age must be over 30 so
only one of these conditions has to be
true for this whole expression to be
true okay now if either of these
conditions are true we don't want to
display this message because if they're
under 18 we can't calm and if they're
over 32 count calm so let's just swap
these around let's paste this one in
here and then get rid of this and paste
this one or right here so and 35 which
means I'm over 30 so this is true which
means that the whole thing is true
because it only takes one condition
to be true so let's save that and
refresh now go still you ain't coming if
I do this 225 now I'm not under 18 so
this is false
okay and I'm not over 30 so this is
false so none of these are true so then
that whole thing will be false so then
it will go down to the else hopefully my
save and try yep you can come you could
dude and file it let's try 15 and then
we'll refresh and you ain't coming and
it's not just two conditions we can have
we can have multiple conditions we can
have a third one if we want it to and
let's say my age for some reason we
don't want to let 25 year old school so
if that was the case and I change this
to 25 then okay I'm not under 18 I'm not
over 30 but I am 25 so that means I
can't come there we go you ain't coming
but if it changes to 26 then hopefully I
can come yeah cool I think um so that is
the logical operators in a nutshell guys
if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to comment down below I'm
going to answer all of those as soon as
possible
