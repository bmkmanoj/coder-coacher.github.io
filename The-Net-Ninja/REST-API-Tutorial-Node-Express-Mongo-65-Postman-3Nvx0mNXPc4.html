API tutorial and in this video I'm going
to introduce you to postman which is
some nifty software to help us test our
API around ok again so in the last
tutorial we created these different
route handlers using the Express router
so we're going to handle our setup form
and get request to /ik ninjas a post
request put request and a delete request
to these different endpoints and right
here
I remember forward slash API goes in
front of each one of these because in
our index file we said apt use and we're
using those routes for anything which
starts with /ap on okay so then how the
hell do we test out these different
routes here these different handlers
make sure they're all working correctly
because we don't have a front end to
this application making requests and we
certainly don't have a third-party app
or a mobile app or something like that
making requests to these different
handlers right here so what are we going
to do
well yet we could test out this get
request handler by cycling the endpoint
into a browser because remember a
browser users get requests by default so
we're going to get this response in a
browser however these ones here the post
put and delete we're going to have a
much harder time with because we can't
do that via a browser okay we have to do
that via code typically from another
application or a front-end so the
situation is this we have our API on the
left over here we have Express app
running in no js' with our different
route handlers set up listening waiting
for requests to them we also have
MongoDB or running in the background but
we've not really touched this yet so
don't worry about it for now so yeah
there is one of these themes over here
on the right are going to be making
requests to this API right and there are
front-end the mobile app or another
website so another website for example
could make a get request to this end
point and this API this app is going to
look at it and say okay I've set up a
handler for this get request and I'm
going to run this code and handle it all
this could be a pot request or a post
request or something like that ok so
this is going to handle whichever
comes along however since we don't have
any of these things on the right of the
minute we need to kind of simulate these
requests to make sure the behavior as we
would expect enter onto the same post
map which you can get at get post magnet
comment you some really cool free
software which is going to help us test
out our different route handlers by
simulating these different requests post
delete and get so you can download this
by clicking one of these buttons here
depending on your operating system you
may have to sign up but once you do you
can open this by going right here which
looks a little complex at first but
don't be put off because it's really
simple so we have our different request
type on the left here get post put and
delete or what we need we love now then
right here we can put in our endpoint
our URL we can also add parameters query
parameters that is with a key and value
pair I remember query parameters are
those things at the end of an endpoint
or URL where it has a question mark then
a variable name such as name equals the
value of that so for example question
mark
name equals Yoshi all right so there
query parameters we can add those onto
which we'll take a look at later on and
we can also add in custom headers and
body not for a get request but if we've
got a post we can add the body right
here so we can send data to the API as
well so we're definitely going to take a
look at that later on so now I just want
to make simple requests to each of our
four handlers so one get one post one
updates and wand delete right I say
update I mean put this one right here so
let's take a look at our different
handlers so remember we're going to
forward slash Minges but with forward
slash api in front of it and this a get
request and for this one is the same
forward slash ninjas and in each example
we're just getting a simple object back
with a property of type inside which is
telling us the type of request we are
made so get post put and delete we'll
take a look at these two in a minute but
let's give these to you first of all so
if we open up postman we want to start
with the get request so first of all
we're going to localhost I remember this
is at port 4,000 that were listening for
forward slash API forward slash link
so we're making a get request in this
end point and we should get that object
back so let's press send and sure enough
we get that object back cool this is
working let's try the post request this
stays the same because it's the same URL
we're going to look for / ninjas so
let's send again this time we get post
back as the type cool so those two are
definitely working ok so we want to try
out now the put and delete requests
right here so notice this third part at
the end which we added on to the route
and this is a variable a parameter if
you like and it can be anything it comes
after /ik ninjas and it could be Yoshi
it could be whatever it could be some
random string right but whatever it is
that is fine what's going to happen is
when it reaches this route handler
nodejs and express is going to take
whatever the user types into this
request okay and it's going to pop it on
to the request object right there so we
can access it so say for example this is
some unique ID of a ninja then it's
going to pop it onto this request object
we can access it down here grab that ID
query the database and find that ninja
we're not going to be doing that now
we're going to be doing that later on
but for now I just want to test out this
route so all we need to do is put
something after ninja is going to say
forward slash something else okay
because this is the route for the pot
and this is the route for the billionth
request so let's do that
so fold slash API for slash images for
slash something I'll say your click for
now so if I send this we want to change
this to put first of all send it now we
get put back and if I do the same for
delete we should get delete back ok cool
now check this out if I don't add this
on if I take that off and still try to
make a delete request to this route then
this is not going to work it says cannot
delete false lash API forward slash it
ninjas we don't have a delete request or
handler rather set up for this request
to this endpoint there has to be
something after it as specified in our
route handle is right here this has to
exist ok so that all works
sessional our four different route
handlers using postman and that's really
how simple it is we are going to be
using this more as we go deeper into
this course to add different parameters
and the body data right here
so that is postman in a nutshell it's
really cool I really hope you enjoy this
video and you can put this to good use
when you're creating your own api's or
one more thing if this is not working
then you might want to check out your
console right here to make sure you've
said node amount index to make sure your
application is actually up and running
otherwise you won't get any response
down here so as I say no to mount index
on node index and then you should be hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
