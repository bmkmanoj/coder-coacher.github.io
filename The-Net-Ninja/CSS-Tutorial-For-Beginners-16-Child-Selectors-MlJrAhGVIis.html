yo guys what's going on this is CSS
beginners lesson 16 and today we're
gonna look at child selectors that's
coming up Wow
so once again we're back at this room V
diagram and I'm just gonna keep this
pretty brief because we've already
explained this but last time we said
that all of these here were descendants
of the body tag now children are
slightly different we take into account
how many levels deep children go so what
we would say is that this gives out here
and this h1 those tags in yellow are
children of the body tag and this h1 is
a grandchild it's not a direct child of
the body tag it's still a descendant but
it's not a child of the body tag so
that's the difference okay now we know
that we're gonna look at creating some
CSS rules taken into account children in
the HTML file okay so I'm back here
again and I've got exactly the same HTML
file totally stripped out the syntax
door CSS so we start with a blank slate
again now last time we looked at our
descendants and we did a rule like X we
said main content that's the parent and
P so go get all these P tags and give
them a color of red so that right there
my friends is gonna style all of these P
talk to this one and these two here
because they're all descendants of this
main content ID which is great but say
we don't want that say we just want to
style these in a particular way we don't
want all the descendants to be styled
the same way just the direct children
that's where the child Combinator that's
what it's called comes into play I'm
going to show you that in a second but
remember these two here are direct
children of this div because they're
only one level deep this one here is not
a direct child of this because it's two
levels deep it's in here this div and
then in here so it's more of a
grandchild so we can't use the child
Combinator to style this in relation to
this but we can use it to start these
because they're direct children so how
do we do that well simple all you need
to do is come between your main content
you'll pay and we do the angle bracket
forward like a little arrow that's
saying that you want all the direct
children that are P tax that's called
the child Combinator that right here the
child Combinator and we use it to select
direct children so now instead of
styling all of these P tags this one
this one and this one this is saying
just get me the directions which are P
tags of the main content and that's just
these two here so let's just save that
and make sure we've got everything right
by reviewing this in a browser and yet
there we go so it's just the top two P
tags here that have been styled read
according to our child Combinator
selector and this one here which is
still a descendant what dot and direct
child remains black that's perfect so
now we know what child Combinator's her
and how we use them winning CSS rules to
just grab direct children so it's
another tool for your CSS selector
