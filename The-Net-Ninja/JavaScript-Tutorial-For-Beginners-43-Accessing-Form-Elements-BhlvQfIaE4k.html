JavaScript for beginners a lesson 43 and
in this video I want to talk about forms
in JavaScript Wow alright then guys as
you can see I've made a really simple
form here in the HTML which is over here
in the browser and this is a form with
an ID of my fault I've also given it a
name of my form
and within that we've got some different
inputs each with a name attribute okay
we've also got a select with a name
attribute too
now in this tutorial I want to show you
how we can grab hold of those elements
from JavaScript and once we've grabbed
all of them I want to show you the
different properties and methods we have
access to on them all right so we could
always go in and grab this form using
the ID with the document dot get element
by ID method but there is another way to
get these form elements and that is by
using the document dot forms object so
if we wanted to grab this form all we do
is say document dot forms and then dot
the name of your form which is right
here so I'll type my fault and that is
going to return to me my form just like
get element by ID would if I entered
this ID all right so what I would
normally do is store this in a variable
so that if I ever wanted to access the
properties or any elements from this
form all you ever have to do is write
the variable name so we'll do that we'll
same var my form equals and then we'll
copy this and paste it and now if I call
my form it will return to me
this element exactly the same as this
cool so likewise we can access each
element from inside the form by using my
for now dot and then the name of the
element that we want so let's return
back this one right here which is an
input tag with the name of name press
ENTER and that returns this input right
here you can see it highlighted up there
okay now I have access to the properties
on that input so I could say my form
name
value and that is going to return an
empty string at the minute but if I put
in here ninja and do the same again now
it will return the string ninja okay
cool
I can access the value of other elements
as well I've selected blue right there
so now if we say my form dot it's called
color dot value this should be turned
blue yep it does awesome now that I want
to show you a couple of methods that we
have access to also and the first one I
want to show you is the on focus method
now something is on focus when you click
on it generally speaking in a form so if
I click on this input right here you can
see the blue line around it that kind of
signifies that this is focused so that
is on focus and that's considered an
event in JavaScript and we can run
functions or do things when this event
happens likewise if I click this one
this one is now on focus and this one is
now considered blurred because we've not
focused it anymore we've kind of gone
away from it all right so let's do a on
focus event for this input all we do is
say my form dot name because that's the
name of this input right here and then
we'd say dots on focus equals a function
and then within this function we're
going to give this element a border a
thick blue border or a thick pink border
let's do that make it nice a moment will
say my for name and then we're gonna
access the style and then we'll say
border equals four pixels solid and pink
all right let's do that and then when we
click this now you can see that pink
border inside awesome now if I click on
here this is still pink this border I
don't want that to happen I want it so
that when you click away and this is no
longer in focus in other words it's
blurred then this border should go away
now there's another event called on blur
which
can do this alright so let's do that
let's say get that function right back
there by the way I just press the up key
to get the most recent thing that I've
entered which I did there and then I'll
change this to on blurb and then I'll
say this to be not press ENTER and then
this time I'll make it in focus then
I'll click away and then it's taken off
the border completely awesome so there
is one other method I will show you and
that's on the form itself right here
this element okay and it is the on
submit method so that normally happens
when we click the submit button right
there and what would normally happen is
it would communicate with the server and
on this server it would do some kind of
validation and then bring back a result
but you can kind of interrupt that
process by using the on submit event and
you could do something like client-side
validation where you just check that all
the input fields have been entered
correctly awesome it has been entered
where it should be now I'm not going to
go through that in this lesson I'm gonna
save that for the next lesson and we'll
go through a simple form validation then
in the meantime if you have any
questions about this for your free to

you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
