jQuery for beginners lesson 5 and in
this video I want to talk about jQuery
selectors Wow
all right then class so as you can see
I've got my HTML file open right at the
top here index dot HTML and at the
bottom I've got this script GS file that
we linked up in one of the first
tutorial videos the way I've got this
horizontal split is by going to view and
then go into horizontal split alright so
we get the index at the top and the
script at the bottom now
selectors what our selectors well
selectors are basically used to grab
content from a web page and they're made
using what is essentially a CSS syntax
so if you know CSS and how to grab
elements from a web page then you're in
a really good position to grab content
from a web page using jQuery also
alright now for example I could say
something like this dollar sign because
we're using the jQuery statement and
then within the brackets we're going to
specify which element we want to go
after now I'm just gonna say we want
this lead banner and using a CSS
selector we would say hash lead - ballot
which is exactly the same as what we do
in jQuery ok so that there would return
towards that element in a jQuery wrapper
so that we can do further things to it
we can manipulate it further if need be
with jQuery for example we could change
the CSS or animate it using one of
jQuery methods right now if we wanted to
go for all the P tags within elite
banner we just had a peon like that as a
reward in a CSS selector and that's
going to return to us the jQuery array
of all those P tags and we can
manipulate those further alright so that
is the crux of how we select content
using jQuery so like I said if you know
CSS this is going to be really simple
now this ain't going to be a lesson on
CSS selectors if you want to learn more
about CSS and how you target content use
it so like this and I'll leave a link to
that CSS for beginners play this down
but I'll go and check that out I go into
those extensively in that playlist so
for that what I want to do is just give
you a few examples so down here in the
code I've commented out some previous
statements that I've made the first one
right here is
targeting elements it's targeting the
Haiti threes okay and if changing the
CSS to have a border of three pixels
solid and blue so what I'm gonna do is
just uncomment this right now and see
what it does on the right when we click
Save okay now you can see blue borders
around all the H threes on the page and
it appears that these are the only H
threes there alright so this is a jQuery
method this CSS dot CSS that we've used
on that jQuery array that's been
returned to us the array of all those
h3s okay so we've changed the board on
all of them at once
now the second one I've done is a class
selector which like CSS we can select
classes and I'm going to uncomment this
it's the wrapper class which you've seen
a few times in this index dot HTML we've
got it there we've got it down here
somewhere and then another time down
here so three in total I'm going to
uncomment that and see what it does on
the right press save and now guys you
can see we've got a wrapper at the top
right here which is collapsed but never
mind that we've got this wrapper right
here keeping the banner content within
the confines of this central column and
then finally we've got this wrapper here
which is containing all the main content
perfect all right and lastly I'm going
to show you this ID selector again much
like CSS we can target IDs and it's just
hash clients or pound clients whatever
you want to call this little symbol here
and that section is down here somewhere
there we go section ID equals clients so
it's this middle bit here so if i
uncomment this you should give it a
yellow border save that and there we go
you can see the yellow border now right
here around this client section alright
so that is how we reach into our
document using jQuery and grab those
elements and then once we've grabbed
those elements we can start manipulating
them with the jQuery methods and
properties all right so that's enough
for this lesson
just keeping it nice and simple I want
to show you the basics for now and if we
want we could take this one step further
we could use something called filters
which are a bit like suitable
since ESS we're going to take a closer
look at those in a very next tutorial
okay so that's all for now if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share like and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
