tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about route links okay then so
in the last tutorial we went ahead and
set up these two routes right here one
for forward slash and one for forward
slash about so if we go to each one of
these then it's gonna render either the
to-do component all this about component
as well now so far we've only covered
the case whereby the user types this
address into the address bar what if a
user wants to link from within the
application
for example in a navigation bar well in
some cases you can't just use anchor
tags you could pop an anchor tag right
here to forward slash about but in this
tutorial I want to show you a little
trick which is especially useful if
you're using hash history instead of
browsing history but sometimes you might
want to use this instead of anchor tags
as well so we're going to import one
more thing from the reactor or router to
do this and this is called link okay so
now we can use something called a link
tag within this document to link to
different views or different components
if you like within the application so
let's do that let's go down here to this
component where it's returning this JSX
and down here I'm going to pop a little
link tag so we just say a link and then
we want to say where we want to link it
to so I'll say link to equals curly
braces then in quotes forward slash
about so this is gonna be a link to this
about component and this right here must
match what you've placed on your route
path right there okay so this is a link
to this route and inside here we can
have our text for this link so let's say
about save this and then let's check it
out in a browser if we go to the home
page we can see that link right there
and if we click it then it takes us to
this view right here this component
pretty cool so let's add one more link
and pop that in our about component and
instead of popping it above it
in fact we'll pop it above it but
remember in react we must return a one
element right here as a
parent elements so right now this
wouldn't work so I have to do something
like so did and then underneath will
close that give off and just scoot these
two dudes in if I save and now this will
work on the about page no it doesn't and
that's because we've not imported this
link thing right here so we'll say
imports then it's all in front and it's
gonna be from react I phoned a router so
now if we save this and check it out and
the browser fingers crossed
yep it's there but it says about so
let's change these two forward slash and
say hold save that and check it out once
more and now we have this home link
which takes us to the to do component
and the about link which takes us to the
about component so there we go guys that
is routing and how we can link to
different routes from within the
component and that is pretty much our
application finished</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
