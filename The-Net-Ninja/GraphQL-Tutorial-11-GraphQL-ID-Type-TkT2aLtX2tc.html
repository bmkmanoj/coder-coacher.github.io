want to take a quick sidestep to talk
about this property right here the ID
because at the minute we're saying that
this must be of type graph QL string now
this is fine and if we make a query from
the front end
we're always passing through the ID is a
string that's absolutely fine and if we
look at the root query type we can see
that when we make this query we're
passing through a string right here this
is what graph QL wants from us so this
is going to work but if we take away the
quotations here and just pass through
one without the quotations then this is
not going to work it says expected type
string found one so we're no longer
passing a string here we're passing an
integer I guess so
this is fine like I said if you want to
work this way with strings as your ID
there's no problem you just need to make
sure that you'll always pass through
this as a string right here however if
you want to be a bit more flexible we
can use a type in graph QL called a
graph QL ID so I'm gonna show you how to
use this type now first of all I'm gonna
meet in this up a little bit so we don't
go off the screen grabbing stuff and
then I'm gonna get graph QL ID from this
graph QL module right here so down here
instead of the ID being of type graph Q
our string now I'm gonna change it to
graph QL ID and also not just there but
here as well where we're saying we want
the ID property inside the query so
we're saying now this type must be of
graph QL ID not necessarily just a
string so if I save that now and come
back over here I'm gonna delete all this
junk from the top and press Enter now if
we look at this root query type over
here we're saying the query can be made
and the ID must be an ID type not
necessarily a string now if I was to
make this query again with a string then
this still works passing this string
through here is absolutely fine but if I
was to take this off and pass through
one without the quotations now and try
this
it still works alright so it works with
or without a string that's cool
now you might be thinking if this is off
type ID now right here okay then it's
not a string anymore so how can we use
the ID to find a book because all of the
IDs inside this object in this array
they are all strings so how can we use a
type ID to find a book when the ID is a
string well in JavaScript there's no
type of ID right and when we get the ID
on this thing right here then it becomes
a string for us to use inside the result
function and I can demonstrate that so
I'm just going to console dot log type
off and then oops we don't want this to
be in capitals so let's do that again
console dot log and then type off and we
want to log the type of args the ID so
if I save this now I'm gonna refresh
over here and make a query
now even though I'm passing in something
that without quotations when I press
play and go over to the console here we
can see that we get string logged as the
type of this argh store ID so even
though we're saying that this is of type
graph QL ID that is just for graph QL
benefit and querying when it comes to us
using it down here it's of type string
so we have no issue finding a book with
that ID right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
