CSS beginners lesson 15 and today we're
gonna take a look at descendant
selectors that's coming up okay so
before we dive into the CSS I want to
take a quick look at what descendants
are in relation to HTML so to do that
I've got this nifty diagram once again
here which I'm really brought up for
some reason and essentially this is just
a very simple HTML structure you've got
your body tag at the top and below then
you've got a div tag nested within that
under h1 tag and then you've got this h1
tag in pink nested within this div tag
so what are descendants well essentially
because all of these tags here this pink
one included nested however many levels
deep within this body tag we would call
those descendants of the body tag okay
and this h1 here is a descendant of the
div tag and the body tag okay they're
all descendants of the body tag so you
can kind of look at this a bit like a
family tree you know where you've got
the father the mother the children the
grandchildren that kind of thing so it's
a pretty simple concept and we're going
to use this concept in creating some CSS
selectors right now ok guys so I'm back
here in the code and I've not added much
to it just this div tag here which is
called sub content and that's nested
within the main content and then within
that a preppy tag okay
so just going back to that idea of
descendents again basically we're just
going to take a look at this section
today and we could say that all these
terms here are descendants of this main
content div because they're all nested
however many levels deep within this div
okay and this one here would be a
descendant of this as well
it's a descendant of this but it's also
a descendant of this because it's nested
within it so how does this help us in
CSS well say for example we wanted to
style some P tax okay but we didn't want
to star them all we just wanted to style
these ones here these three because
there are nested within the main concept
we want them to be styled within a
specific way not this one here so how do
we do that well that's where we used
descendant selectors and to do a
descendant selector first of all we
write the parent element on the parent
ID on the parent class that's our first
section of the selector so in this case
it's main content simple yet so let's
put that first so we're going after the
ID of main content and then what we do
is pop a space okay and then whatever we
put after this will be what we target or
the descendant of that element there so
we want the P tags
so we'll say P and then open our curly
braces and then we can write our
declaration so this is saying to the CSS
okay go and get the main content div
that's the parent because that's first
in the chain in the selector okay that
comes first we've got a space it's a
signify that we want a new element or
class or ID within this containing
Gellerman and we're saying that we want
the peas so we say more on our peas
within main content does that make sense
okay so we'll just give these a simple
style of read and then we'll save this
and view it in a browser I'll put this
up in chrome and there we go so these
are the P tags that are in that main
content div and this is the P tag that's
not so that's not been styled read
because it's not a descendant of that
main content so let's take this one
level further we can have as many
descendants in the changes we want now I
mentioned before we have this P tag here
now this is a descendant of main content
so it is getting styled by this but say
we only wanted to style this one and not
these well what we could do is we could
just write sub content P
and that would do the trick as well
because this P here is a descendant of
sub content so that would do the trick
or we can take the descendant selectors
as many levels deep as we want we could
do something like this and make it
really specific okay
main content that's the overall parent
element then we're saying we want the
descendant element within that of sub
content so it's going out and grabbing
that because that's the descendant of
this and then within that we want the
descendant of the P tag okay does that
make sense so parent child grandchild
essentially that's what's going on here
and we can take it as many levels deep
as we want you know if we had all the
dudes in here other IDs or classes we
could take it further and further and
further and it's not a great idea to get
really specific because then you'll find
it really hard to override these styles
in the future because remember when we
talked about that point system it's
going to top up all these different
points and it's gonna be hard to
override and you might find yourself
using that important declaration when
you don't really need to so you don't
need to make them too specific
the trick is make them only as specific
as they need to be so in this case we
didn't need to do this main concept
because this will do the trick
I was just illustrating a point that we
can go as many levels deep as we like so
that about covers it for this lesson
it's a pretty simple topic if you have
any questions about descendant selectors
whatsoever you can comment below and I'm
going to answer all of those otherwise
I'm gonna see you in the next movie
