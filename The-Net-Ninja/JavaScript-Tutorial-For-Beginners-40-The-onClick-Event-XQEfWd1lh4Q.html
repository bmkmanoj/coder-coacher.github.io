JavaScript for beginners lesson 40 and
in this video I want to show you an
example of the on click event Wow
alright gang so as you can see I've
created this simple web page on the
right and all it is is a content box
with some paragraph tags in it and a
button at the bottom saying show more so
what I want to do in this lesson is show
you how to create an event that is going
to expand this box when you click this
button and then when the box is expanded
when you click the button again it's
going to shrink it back to this size so
before we start writing any JavaScript
code let me just quickly go through the
HTML and CSS I've written for this CSS
is linked up right here in the head
that's there we'll go through that in a
second then in the body we've got this
deal with an ID of content that's this
thing right there and inside that it's
just a few paragraph tags nothing fancy
underneath that we've got the egg tag
with an idea of show more that's this
button right here and then finally we've
just got our script tag there with the
test j/s script linked up so absolutely
nothing fancy here dead simple HTML and
the CSS is pretty simple just a few
styles for the body and the content box
right there to get it looking nice and
neat then some for the bottom to make it
blue and central etc the cool parts are
listing right here and these rules right
here so currently as it stands this
Content ID box right here has a max
height of 270 pixels right that's this
height right here and I've said that the
overflow should be hidden so anything in
this box that is beyond that 270 pixel
threshold right there is going to get
hidden that's why this box is only 270
pixels high even though the paragraph
tags would potentially go on down here
all right right down here when that
content box has a class of open applied
to it then the max height will expand to
1000 pixels which is somewhere down here
so all this content down here that's
currently hidden will show and the cool
part guys is this we've set up our
transitions right here and
here so that when that height does
expand and shrink then it's gonna do it
smoothly that's really cool
so that is the CSS in a nutshell not
going to go into any more detail about
that right here if you want to learn
more about CSS I've got a whole playlist
on that go and check that out for the
rest of us we're going to jump into this
test gif file and start coding up this
functionality alright then guys so first
things first we need to grab these two
elements the content box and the button
and we need to store those in two
separate variables so we'll do that
right here we'll create a new variable
call that content and set it equal to
document dot get element by ID and the
ID we want is content so we'll store
that one in a variable the second one is
going to be called button and we'll say
that is equal to document dot get
element by ID again and this time the
button has an ID of show more so that
there my friends is our two variables
storing these two elements cool next
thing we need to do is attach an event
to this button right here so we'll do
that by saying button dot on click
because that's the event we want to
listen for and then we'll say that's
equal to a function and within that
function is where we're going to control
this animation behavior of this box
expanding alright so within here
basically we want to check if this box
is already open then we want to shrink
it if this box is not already open then
we want to expand it when the button is
clicked right simple enough so we can do
that using an if statement tool say if
and then content dot plus name equals
open then within here what we want to do
is shrink the box so currently what I'm
saying here guys is that when you click
that button do this function and then
first thing we're doing is an if
statement to check if the content class
name is open right so if this has a
class of open it means it's already open
and expanded down here then if that's
the case we need to shrink the box back
up when this
bones clicked otherwise else we need to
expand the box right expand the box so
to expand the box all we need to do is
give this a class of open because in the
style when this has a class of open the
max height is 1000 pixels and it will
transition down to that's height that
the Pete paragraphs take up all right so
let's give that a class of open will say
content the plus name equals open so
we've given that a class name of open so
that this expands down here now if it's
already open we want to shrink it so we
can take away that class name and then
the content box will revert back to this
max height of 270 pixels and everything
overflowing is hidden so it will zoom
back up here so let's take that class
name away will say content class name
equals nothing like that an empty string
okay there so there's one more thing we
need to do and that is change the text
of this button when it's down here
because if this content box is already
expanded and showing more we don't want
the button to say show more anymore we
want it to say show less right so we'll
do that right here so we'll say when we
expand the box we also want to change
the text of this button so we'll say
button that's this element right here
that we've stored there and we'll say in
a HTML equals show less cool and then we
need exactly the same for when we click
the button to gain we want to change it
back to show more when it closes again
right save that and that there my
friends should do the trick so let me
just refresh this page right now click
the button show more it's going to zoom
down there show the rest of the
paragraph tags show less zoom back up
show more sure let's pretty cool right
so just to run through it again one more
time
and we've stored these two in two
separate variables content and button
then we've applied the on click event to
the button right there we've said that
when this is clicked fire this function
and this function says if the content
box right here has a class name of open
then we're going to shrink the box and
if it doesn't have that Platinum of open
which it doesn't currently then we're
going to expand the box now to expand
the box we're just giving it that plus
name of open and in the styles when it's
given that class name of open it's going
to expand the maximum height and do it
smoothly via these transitions and then
it's going to change the button HTML to
show less that's why we get this text
change there otherwise when it's open as
it currently is when I click it again
it's going to take away that class name
so that it reverts back to 270 pixels
mucked height and it's going to change
that button in a HTML again to show more
which changes right there all right and
