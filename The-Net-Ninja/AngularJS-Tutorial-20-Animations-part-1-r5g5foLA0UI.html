20th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
animations Wow okay the dudes so this is
our application and yeah it's pretty
cool it's got some nice functionality
attached to it such as adding new ninjas
deleting them
we've got a couple of views there but
it's lacking some kind of slickness
there's no animations between any kind
of states so for example when we go to a
new view it just kind of goes pop and
there's the new view there's no
animation between the two views and
likewise when we delete one of these
it's just kind of go pop and when we add
one it does the same kind of thing it
just kind of pops into existence so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
this application to the next level of
Awesomeness and we're going to use ng
animate to install some kind of
animation effects into this project now
the animation effects don't come as
standard with the angular core library
so we're going to have to download a
separate module a separate file and then
load that into our application directly
in order to use it so what you want to
do is head over to the angularjs website
right there then click this top button
right there
download angularjs and you want to go to
this browse additional modules link
that's going to come up with all the
different external modules we can load
in so we've already done this for
angular route in the past now we're
going to do with angular animate so you
want to right click this one right here
angular animate minjae s and just save
that us and then save it in your library
folder right here now you can see I've
already done that
angular animate minjae s is right there
then in the index dot HTML file I've
linked up to that file right there you
can see under angular routes I've got
angular animate Minjae s ok cool so
there's one more thing we need to do if
we're going to use this within our
project and that is insert this animate
module as a dependency in our project so
the way we do that is by going to our
module right here remember this module
holds all of our project code so we need
to insert the dependency into this
module much like we did with ng routes
so let's go ahead and put a comma and
then add
new dependency this one's gone ng
animates save that then now we can use
all of this cool functionality within
our project so what does ng animate do
for us well at its most basic level it
gives us some classes to play around
with so that we can control the
animations of elements as they enter and
leave our application for example we
could control the enter and leave states
of these ninjas so when they leave when
we click this cross we can control the
animations because it gives us classes
when those elements leave to do that ok
likewise when the enter BIOS adding
something here we can also animate views
when we go to a different view like that
ok so to explain this and I want to go
through an example so I'm going to go
here to the angular documentation and
this is just the ng animate module it's
going to talk about middle leave this
link down below because this is a really
good kind of in-depth documentation
about it and it's got some cool examples
also and I'm going to scroll down to
this bit CSS based animations now right
here it gives us the classes that we can
use so these are the classes for
elements entering get application to
control the animation there and these
are the classes for elements leaving the
application so right now I'm just going
to grab these ones and I'm going to copy
them and I will explain this as I go
along
now going to the Stars dot CSS right
there and right at the bottom I've got
this separate comment right there for
animations where we're going to dump or
all of our animation CSS ok so to
explain these classes I've done a little
diagram okay and basically you see right
here ignore this fade class for now by
the way but we have these classes right
here ng enter and then down here we have
ng enter dots ng enter active right so
just go into the diagram when an element
first enters our application we have an
animation start point when it first
starts to enter and then an animation
end point when it's finished entering ok
so the animation takes place between
here so at the start point when we first
click for example add new ninja that's
the start point of the animation and
we're giving this class ng enter ok so
at the start
first starts to enter the application
that element has this class then as it
animates it goes through the animations
and when it reaches the end of the
animation it has this ng enter active
class as well as well as this ng active
classical has both of them at the end
point right there okay so now we've got
these two classes we can control the
animation from one state to the next
okay and the way we do that is by using
these things right here first of all
this transition effect in CSS and
basically this is just saying a lot okay
for all of the different types of
transitions whether that's opacity or
the position on a page or whatever we
use it's going to take 0.5 seconds to do
the whole of the animation and that's
0.5 seconds to get from here this down
point to the end point okay it's going
to be a linear animation and it's going
to affect all different types of
animations like so whether that's for or
passes here or the position on a page or
whatever you want it to be okay
then we're saying okay well this is the
class we get at the start of the
animation so at that point I want the
opacity to be zero so for example when
we first add a ninja I want the opacity
of that new ninja when it first comes on
to the page to be zero right then at the
end of the animation
this class is applied so at that point I
want the audacity of that ninja to be
one second so after 0.5 seconds I want
the audacity the opacity to be 1 all
right so that's what it does it starts
at 0 at this point then it reaches the
end point right here and goes from 0 to
1 in this time all right now this dot
fade is just a class that we don't have
in our application so we can get rid of
that and by the way we add both classes
they're just for and more specific rules
so it overrides this one if it was just
this one which we could do but it might
not override it depending on where we
have it in the CSS so it's good just to
keep them both it so if we go to our
index dot HTML what I'm going to do is
animate the view so that when we go to
one view to the next
then it kind of phase the viewing rather
than just drawing pop and appears so you
can see right here this main tag has the
engine view directive this is where the
views are being loaded in so this is the
element that we want to animate every
time we load in a new view so to do that
all we need to do is come down here and
we need to go oops we need to go main ng
enter okay and that's going to give that
main tag all these properties when it
first starts to enter example when we
load in a new view then down here we
want main dot ng enter tour ng enter
active this is the endpoint of the
animation so by the time it's finished
animating we wanted to have an opacity
of one so it's fading in from zero
opacity to one okay so let's save that
now and just try switching between the
different views so now we've got that
cool little fade effect right there okay
much better than just popping it so
that's pretty cool so let's take this
one step further and let's add in some
animations to these things right here so
when we add in a new ninja instead of it
just pop in there I want it to do
something a little more slick all right
so to do that we need to target these
things these Li tags so let's find them
in the court during the directory dot
HTML view and they're right here so what
I do is I put an ID on this ul right
here called ninja - list and then we use
that in the CSS to grab these Li tags so
let's go back to the stars or CSS and
down here let's say ninja - list then Li
because we want the Li tags within it
dot ng and so when we first add a new Li
tag here ie
when we add a new ninja these are the
properties we want to apply to it okay
and first of all I'm going to say
transition which like we did with this
one above and we'll have the transition
time to be not point five seconds we'll
call it linear that can be eased by the
way if you prefer and all again as well
okay
in fact now what I'm going to do for
this one is give it a not point to
transition just make it a little bit
quicker alright so the next thing we
want to do is say it has an appositive
of
zero to begin with so it's not going to
be visible when we first start to fade
it in alright
then I'm going to go down here I'm going
to copy this I'm going to paste it down
here and then I'm going to add in the
extra class that we need with you which
is ng - enter - active so that's when
it's finished the animation that's the
end point of the animation and this time
we want the opacity to be one like that
we can get rid of this because it's
already defined on that element right
here so let's save that and now if we
add in a new ninja let's call Emilio
give him a red belt and then a rate of
25 now just watch the animation fades in
it looks a little bit better but I'm
still not happy with it I want to do
something else okay so I'm also going to
use the transform property not that one
on this one transform and I'm going to
give it a translate value on the y-axis
of 30 pixels and basically what that
means is to begin with when it first
starts I want it to be you know further
down by 30 pixels okay then it should
normally be and then what we're going to
do is we're going to bring it up as it
fades in so we'll come down here and
we'll say trans fall and then it's
translate Y and then it's going to be
zero so it's going to be in the right
position when it ends so let's save that
now and this time we'll add in another
one we'll call him or rayon and then it
can be a blue belt and it can be 25 now
check this add to list it kind of zooms
up a little bit
it starts from just below 30 pixels
below then it brings it back up to zero
as well as fading in that's because of
this thing right here the opacity and
the translate okay pretty cool yet so
that's for adding new ninjas but still
when we delete them you just kind of go
poof off the screen now I want to make
that a little bit better too so we can
add in the ng leave classes so as well
as the enter classes we have the ng
leave ones and that controls the
animation for elements leaving so let's
just copy the
for now like that and paste them down
here and wherever you see enter and you
leave instead so ng enter there and
there and finally there okay cool
so this time when it leaves to begin the
animation before it fully leaves we want
it to have an opacity of one because
it's just begun the opacity of the
animation right and then we want to fade
it out from one to zero when it finishes
the animation cool now I don't want to
use this translate why think a little
anymore I don't want it to go down or up
even and I want to translate it X so it
kind of sweeps off to the left so let's
do that we'll say translate X and to
begin with is going to have no kind of
transformation no translation and then
at the end we'll do minus 100 percent so
it's coming right off the page to the
left okay so let's do that and click
Save and hopefully now when we delete a
ninja oops
I think the wrong way this should be X
save that now when we delete a ninja
swipes off the page like that okay
pretty cool yet and if we refresh we'll
get all those things just back the
reason it doesn't go beyond this thing
here is because if I search for the
content class you can see right here
I've given an overflow of hidden so this
grey box has a class of content and it's
got an overflow of hidden that's why
when it reaches the edge here it's
disappearing which is cool if I got rid
of that save that and click off now you
can see the go right off the page but it
doesn't look quite as cool this isn't
quite right so I had I added in this
class or this property right here this
overflow hidden and now when you reach
the end of the box
they hide so pretty cool yet so that is
the animation in angular I am going to
go into more detail these more cool
things in the next tutorial this is just
part one so make sure you watch that as
well but yeah that's kind of like the
basics of your life just makes our
application look a bit cooler so have a
try yourself play around with those
classes and see what you can do and I'll
see you in the very next
