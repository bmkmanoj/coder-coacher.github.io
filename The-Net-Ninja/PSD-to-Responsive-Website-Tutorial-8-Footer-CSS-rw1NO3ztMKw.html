Tito responsive website tutorial and in
this video we're gonna start up the
footer
whoa I think guys so this is where we
are up to so far it's looking pretty
swanky we've got all our head of stuff
sorted and the main content so now we
just need to style up this stuff in the
footer down below before we do anything
let's just take a quick look at the PSD
to see what we need to do so it's got
this dark grey background I'm not gonna
do this texture it's got at the back
just to save time it's got a little bit
of a border at the top and then each of
these is 25 Peaks sorry about 25% in
width and it's got this little copyright
message at the bottom so let's jump back
into the code and start making some
styles so the first thing you want to do
is just grab the foot itself so footer
and then what I'm gonna do is give this
a deep charcoal grey background so
background 20 20 20 something like that
oops
20 20 20 cool that will do okay then
I want to give me some padding I'm gonna
say 30 pixels top and bottom zero left
and right then the border top remember
was about I don't know 10 pixels in
thickness and it's like an even darker
charcoal gray source a border top 10
pixels to solid and then we'll say about
what five on five on five something like
that that will do all right there so now
it's style up these things down here
first of all let's style up the hedge
force so we'll go to footer h4 and then
while do is say margin:0 and then core
oops color 555 and then I'll say text
runs for uppercase like that and then
finally about font size of 18 pixels
just a little bit bigger that will do
alright so now let's target the you ELLs
in the photo or say footer you out
like that we're gonna flow each one to
the left and that's collapsed the footer
height remember we'll do that trick in a
minute to clear the floats and but now
we'll say width is going to be 25% so
exactly a quarter and then what I'm
gonna do is say list-style-type:none
alright so now let's clear the floats
and to do that what I'm going to say is
footer after footer after and then it's
going to be content empty display block
and then play both remember this is the
technique I showed you in the earlier
tutorial okay and then what I want to do
is tag these allies right here so put it
Li like that then the color is gonna be
about AAA
make it a little bit lighter then the
width is going to be 80% and then what
I'll do is say margin 20 pixels and zero
left and right then font size is gonna
be 14 pixels line height 1.6 and alright
so that just spaces you out a little bit
I'll give it a width of 80% so it
doesn't go to the end of the UL so then
it spaces it out from the next one okay
so let's do now the Twitter little icon
so if we take a look at the PSD you know
it's these little Twitter icons for next
to these Li tag so let's sort that out
what we need to do is say footer Li dot
T W which stands for tweet remember it
gave them those classes in the HTML and
then we'll say padding left is gonna be
about 20 pixels like that and then the
background there's gonna be a URL and
it's going to be in the images folder
forward slash tweets is what we saved it
as dot PNG we want it no-repeat so it
doesn't look like that hideous mess of
birds like that and then we'll say to
the
and six pixels from the top and that
looks about right to me alright so
that's pretty cool
we don't need to do anything else for
those tweets now then let's do this
little copyright bit at the bottom so
it's got an idea of copyright D
surrounding div and then what we'll do
with in here is say clear:both to bring
it down to the bottom and then we're
going to give it a padding top of about
30 pixels and then we're going to give
it a margin top as well
margin top of 30 pixels and notice that
did absolutely nothing okay and that's
because of these floats right here so
what we need to do is float this as well
so we remain in that kind of float flow
and then we can have that margin because
these are not properly playing
alternatively what we could do is pop an
empty div in between the last one of
these and this and then have that clear
the floats but what we're gonna do is
just float this to the left
instead and now we get that margin okay
but what we do need to do then is give
it a width of 100% like that okay so now
we can give it that border top which is
two pixels roughly if it was solid and
we'll say three three three and then
let's take a look at that now we can see
that boredom right there will also
change the color of this to about $9.99
that will do
font size a little bit smaller I think
14 pixels should do it and I think guys
that should be just about it so let's
take a look now at this website there we
go that's the footed dot all the content
done and the header and whatnot done so
I did say that the staff at this place
guys that things were not going to be
pixel perfect and they're not okay this
text might be a little bit different
this might be spaced out a little bit
different there might be more padding
and margin but the whole idea of this
playlist is to show you how I can take a
PSD and do a quick responsive prototype
then we can do all the little nitti bits
later or if you want to kind of do those
yourself you can if I was working for a
client here I'd be a little bit more
careful and supply all the padding and
margin as the designer wanted it okay
but this is just to teach you
to make a responsive cannon mock-up or
prototype so that's it for the desktop
stance now what I've done that in about
I don't know 40 minutes something like
that
so it does it take too long and then
what we're gonna do over the next couple
of lessons is start making some
responsive design so it looks good on
tablets and on mobile because at the
minute if we inspect an element just so
we can change the viewport size if we
zoom this over to the left yeah it looks
alright for a while but then after a
little bit you can see here this just
looks really squashed and if I was
viewing this on the tablet I don't think
it would be a great experience
experience these don't look very good at
the top again very squashed and when we
get to mobile I mean that's just
ridiculous
I would not visit this website again if
I saw that on mobile so there we go well
that's what we're gonna do in the next
couple of lessons first we'll do tablet
and then mobile if you have any
questions so far feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'll see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
