last five minutes making mutations here
from graphical to add the different
books to our books collection on MongoDB
so now we have these five right here
much like we had before and we also
still have these three authors right so
now we have all of this data stored in
our different collections on MongoDB
what we can do is return to our resolve
functions which were responsible for
grabbing the data remember previously we
use the local arrays to grab the data
now we're going to update those result
functions to interact with our two
collections in MongoDB the book and the
author so we're going to use these two
models right here and we're gonna grab
the data from there instead right so
what I'm going to do in this tutorial is
just go from top to bottom in this file
and update the resolve functions
wherever we find them so then the first
one is this it's on the book type and we
said whenever someone makes a rig query
for a book then they can also request
the author as well and we use this
resolve function to go and grab that
author the author of that book right so
this is what we did before underscore
defined authors and then any author with
an idea which much the parent/daughter
ID so this time again we're gonna return
something but instead of using
underscore on the local array instead
we're going to use the author model
right here
remember this author model is how we
interact with the author collection so
let's copy that and paste it there and
we can use a method called find by ID
now this is going to go out and it's
going to look in the author collection
and it's gonna find a record with
whatever ID we pass in here so if I pass
in some kind of weird ID it's going to
look in our collection our author
collection for a record with this ID now
obviously this ID doesn't exist but
because we have access to the parent I
am right here remember the parent refers
to the original query of the book we can
pass in parents dots author ID so we're
looking in the author collection for any
book or any record which has an ID equal
to this thing right here makes sense
right cool
so that's all there is to it that so I'm
not going to test each one as we go
along here because it'll take way too
long instead I'm going to go down update
them all then we'll test some stuff out
from the front end so the next one is
this ortho type right here so the result
function is going to go out and get a
list of books associated with the author
again previously we used underscores
then dot filter to grab the books this
time what we're going to do is use the
book model source a return and then book
then we're going to use a method called
find and what this is going to do is
look for all records in the book
collection based on certain criteria and
this criteria is going to be placed
inside this object now what do we want
to find books based on well we want the
author ID of that book to equal the ID
of whatever the parent is right here of
the author makes sense much like we did
right here so in here we'll say we want
the author ID property to equal parent
dot ID that's the ID of the author sweet
so we've done two of them now okay let's
move on to our roots queries down here
and the first one is going to be this
and it's for a particular book so
they're going to pass through an
argument which has an ID property and we
need to find a book based on that ID so
we know how to do this we can just
return book dots find by ID so again
it's going to look in the book
collection for a particular book and we
want to pass through args no ID so the
ID that the user sent along with the
query cool all right let's move on to
the next one this time it's for the
author so this is gonna look very
similar again return this time author
dot find by ID will pass in args the ID
again
alright and then this one is for all
books now how do we search our
collection for all books well really
simply we can just say return book dot
find like so and pass through an empty
object and when we use the find method
without passing through any criteria
inside this object it's going to return
all of them to us right because they all
match so that's how we return all books
and then finally the author
so return author dots find and then
inside an empty object like so all right
so we've updated all of those resolved
fortunes now we don't need to do these
because we did those in the last
tutorial our tutorial before so now
we're ready to save this and test it out
in the front end so let's go to
graphical we don't want a mutation
anymore instead let's first of all ask
for all the books so open your curly
braces then we use the books query and
from the books we want the name and we
want the genre okay let's try that and
it works cool we get an array with all
of those different books okay so let's
say we also want the author of each book
and from each author we want the name
and the age okay let's play that cool
and we get the books and the author of
each book as well okay so this is
working now let's try getting all the
authors to begin with and from the
authors we want the name and the age
press play cool this is working and now
from each also we also want to get a
list of books so we'll say we want the
name of each book that that author is
done as well so play that and we get the
books associated with each author as
well awesome this is brilliant
okay let's do a couple more examples
we'll say we want a single book this
time with an ID property equal to three
and we want the name of that book and we
also want the genre of the book and
finally we want the author of the book
on the name of that author right so
let's press play and we don't get
anything with an ID of three and
obviously that's because we changed the
IDS we no longer have ID of three the
IDS are these things right here so let's
just grab this big ID and place that in
here instead
okay let's press play now now we get
that book the color of magic the genre
and the author now if we wanted to nest
things further we could do we could say
we want the books of the author so all
the other books that it's written and
say we want the name of each book so
press play and we get that property as
well this is awesome everything seems to
be working we'll do one final query
which is going to be for a single author
the ID of this author will just grab
from here we'll say Brandon Sanderson
and we'll paste this dude over here and
from this author we want the name and we
want the age property oops
think the indentation is a little bit
off the age property and we also want a
list of books by the author and the name
of each book so let's give this a whirl
and this works as well sweet so there we
go my friends now we've updated all of
our resolve functions to interact
instead with our MongoDB instance and
our different collections using our book
model and our author model so I want to
show you one more thing server-side in
the next tutorial but after that what
we're going to be doing is adding a
front-end as well using react</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
