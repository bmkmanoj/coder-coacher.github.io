JavaScript and the Dom tutorial and in
this video I'm going to introduce you to
Dom events and show you how to remove
content from the Dom all right then so
now you know how to reach into the Dom
to grab elements how to traverse the Dom
and also how to edit the content a
little as well so now I want to shift
our focus over to events and by events I
mean all of the juicy stuff that happens
inside the browser itself such as click
events or key press events when we enter
something into an input fuel or submit
events when we submit a form all that
kind of stuff so I guess the question is
how do we react to these events when
they occur and the answer is pretty
simple we add event listeners to the
different elements that we want to
listen to events on for example if I
want to listen to events on this title
right here for example click events then
I would attach an event listener to this
element to listen for those click events
we also create a callback function which
will fire when that event occurs so when
a user clicks on this element so let's
do that let's add an event listener to
this hate to right here so first of all
we need to query the dog to grub that
it's in the book list ID so let me copy
that dude and then say VAR h 2 is equal
to document not query a select all and
then inside here we need to pass through
first of all this ID and then h2 within
it ok so now we have a handle on this h2
and we want to add an event listener to
it to listen for those click events so
the way we do that is by saying the
element which you stored then add event
listener and the event we want to fire
or rather listen for is a click event ok
so that's the first parameter in this
method the method name is add event
listener and the first parameter is the
click event this could be whatever you
want like submit or key press or another
event now there's a lot of different
types of events and far too many for me
to cover but I'm gonna leave this link
down below so you can check out all the
different kind of events you can react
to we're going to react to click events
now the
second parameter of this add
eventlistener function is a callback
function and this function is what it's
going to fire when this event happens on
a page so when someone clicks on this
element this is going to be listening
for those clicks and it's gonna fire
this callback function to react to it
now this callback function automatically
takes through a parameter the event
parameter and we can pass that here and
you can call it what you want and just
call in e so I'm going to now console
log E and then target now target is a
property on the event object and there's
many other properties as well and it's
going to tell us which element was
clicked what is the target of the event
I'm also going to log to the console
just the event object itself so it can
browse through it so I'll say console
log and then e ok let's enter that
through and now we've added this event
listener of click to this Haiti tube so
if we click it first of all we get the
HT tube then we get the event and we can
take a look down here and there's all of
these different properties on this
object so we could see for example
decline X in the client Y this is the
position inside the browser of my mouse
when I clicked it we can also see down
here the the shift key was not pressed
ok is false that's because I wasn't
holding the shift key when I clicked it
but we could for example hold the shift
key shift key and click it and this will
be true and I'll demonstrate that
I'll hold the shift key click and this
time if I expand this and go down to
shift key you can see it's true so we
can react to these different kind of
events in different ways for example I
could check that when an event occurs if
the shift key was held down by saying e
shift key right and compress that in an
if statement if it's true and we'll do
something if it's not true we'll do
something else so we're reacting
differently if the shift key is pressed
or not when we click an element so we
also have the target which we logged it
to the console as well and sauce element
plus loads of other things as well which
you can browse through so that's the
basics of attaching these event
listeners to elements and reacting to
these different events now we are going
to react to different events as we go
through this series but I just want to
jump to the
javascript file over here is and create
some more event listeners okay so what I
want to do now is create event listeners
on these delete buttons right here all
four of them so I'm gonna have to query
the Dom to grab all four of these first
of all and they're all inside these Li
tags and they all have a class of delete
right so let us query the doll for those
things I'm gonna say VAR buttons is
equal to and it's document dots a query
selector and this time all because we
want all of the buttons and then we're
going to pass through the path to them
or the CSS selector rather so that in
the book - list then it's anything with
the class of the elite so now we have a
reference to all of those inside this
variable now that what I want to do is
cycle through that collection and attach
an event listener to each one we can't
just say this bTW and s to add event
listener we can't do that because this
is a collection of elements not just one
single one we have to loop through them
individually and add an event listener
to each one so the way we do that is by
turning this first of all into an array
so we can use for each on it so I'll say
array dot from then are passing the
buttons and then what I'll do is say for
each and fight a function inside here
and each time around we're going to take
the button that we're iterating through
at the time then inside what I want to
do is attach an event listener to each
button so I'll say button got add event
listener it's going to be a click event
and then we're going to fire back a
callback function when this event occurs
on each button pass through the event
object and inside we can react to it so
what do we want to do when this button
is clicked well we want to remove the Li
tag right this one clicks this delete
button I want to remove the Li tag that
that delete button is in because we're
deleting that name that book right so
the first thing we need to do is
navigate upwards to the parent element
to grab that li so let's do that first
of all I'm going to create a new
constant and that is going to be equal
to
a rather cold ally and then that's gonna
be equal to each target first of all so
it's going to grab the exact button that
we click whether that's the first second
third or fourth then it's gonna get the
parent element okay so we're gonna grab
the Li which is associated with
whichever button we click the parent
element yeah so now we have ahold of
that Li so what do we want to do now we
want to delete that Li so the way we
delete something in JavaScript is by
saying first of all the parent dot
remove child and then whatever child we
want to remove so we want to remove this
thing right here so that's why I'm
passing it in this is the child we want
to remove but we need to get the parent
first of all so how are we going to get
that well all we need to say is Li dot
parent node dot remove child right so
first of all getting the parent node of
this Li which is the UL then what we're
doing is we're saying okay from this ul
I want to remove a child and the child I
want to remove is this ally which we
created right here so if we save this
now and go over to the browser we can
see if we delete something that it is
removed from the page so now we've
successfully reacted to that click event
navigate it opted on to the Li and
deleted it from the UL which is pretty
cool right okay in this tutorial I want
to show you one more thing and that is
the prevent default method on the event
object so say for example we want to
react to some kind of events on an
anchor tag a link well let's just add in
a link first of all over here doesn't
really need to be anywhere specific href
is equal to http the net ninja'd call it
UK and then we'll just say something
like click here close that off save it
and let's view this in a browser okay so
there is the anchor tag and if we click
it then it's going to go to my website
however
what we want to do is click it do
something else and prevent the browser
from navigating to the website prevent
its default behavior if you like because
the default behavior of an anchor tag is
to go to website which ever it's linking
to right so what I want to do first of
all is come over to a pas and attach an
event listener to this link so I'm going
to say Const link is equal to document
dot query selector first of all then
inside the query selector we want to
pass through the page - banner hey
because it's inside the page banner
right here so now we have a reference to
that we want to attach an event listener
so let's say link dot add event listener
and then we're going to attach a click
event first of all and then after that
we're going to use a callback function
which is going to fire went this event
occurs pass through the event object
then what I'm going to do is say a e dot
prevent default and this method right
here on the event object is going to
prevent the default action from
occurring which in this case is
navigating to the other website right so
now we can also say console log and
inside here I'll say navigation - and
then close out of this string then a
comma and I'll say e dot target and then
text content or rather if we edit the
text content this will work better so
the net injure so we're getting that
target is this then the text content is
this so what we're saying here is
navigation to the net ninja and then
we'll output another string what's
prevented okay so let's
save this now I'll review it over here
in a browser if I click on this no
longer do I go to the external web site
and I get this log to the console
instead pretty cool right so that's how
we attach events to different elements
and listen for those events and that's
how we prevent the default behavior we
are going to be looking at events a lot
more as we go through this series this
is just scratching the surface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
