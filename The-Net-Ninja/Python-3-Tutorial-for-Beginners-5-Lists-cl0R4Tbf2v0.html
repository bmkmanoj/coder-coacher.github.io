part in the tweet tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about lists
okay then so another tutorial we saw the
first instance of the third type I want
to talk about which are lists so we said
something like this we had a string a
variable and we set it equal to
something in this case I'm just going to
set it equal to hello there dudes
whatever it doesn't matter what it is
now if we wanted to split this up into a
list we'd say STR dot split that's the
method named parentheses and inside the
parentheses we say where we want to
split the string now we want to split it
up every time there's a space so that it
splits into three individual words in a
list so we pass the space into the
string right here as an argument and
click enter then we get that list back
with the three individual words in it so
this list is just a collection of items
and that's all lists are in tight of a
collection of other variables so there
could be strings numbers or other data
types so they have this square bracket
notation around them okay so they're
very much like arrays in JavaScript if
you've ever seen that before
so let's make a new list we'll make a
Fibonacci sequence self fib 1 is equal
and then square bracket notation to say
this is an array then we'll place the
sequence in here so it's 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
okay
that will do so now we have this
Fibonacci sequence um akin sack filled
one to return occurs in that list cool
so if we want to access a particular
element in this list we can do the same
thing that we did with strings we can
use the square bracket notation to get
back a particular index from this list
so again it starts at 0 this is the 0
index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc so say I want
this one well it would be 0 1 2 so I can
say fit 1 and then 2 and we get back
that too
ok same again type at 6:51 and then 5
and we get back the 8th alright we can
also work back puts and looks like we
did with strings we can say fifth one
and then pass through a minus or say
minus 1 that should get us a 13 because
we're starting at the end with a minus
and if we say fib 1 and then
- three that should give us this 5
because we gone back three from hand
okay cool so that's how we access the
different elements inside this list now
how do we slice the list remember we
could slice strings using the square
bracket notation as well and we can do
the same thing with at lists so a safe
one and we want to slice this let's say
from the zero in depth at the start so
that's inclusive of this and then call
one to say up to something and we'll say
the fourth index but it's not inclusive
all of that fall so we'll be going 0 1 2
3 up to the four but not including this
sort of slice this bit off it so we
should get those first elements there in
that list cool all right then so what
else can we do with these lists well
life strings we can concatenate them as
well so let's make a second one we'll
say sleep two is equal to the next lot
of numbers in the sequence this
Fibonacci sequence which is 21 34 and
then 55 cool so now if we add these two
together what's going to happen well
let's find out fib 1 plus fib 2 yep
they've joined them together into one
giant list cool so that's how we
concatenate lists as well and it's
preserved the artists of the first list
is first up to 13 and then the second
one is second right cool so that's how
we concatenate lists we can also change
the values of this list if we wanted to
and I say something like this so fib 1
is still this one right here say I want
to change the value of this first one I
could say fib 1 the 0 in that is equal
to 9
okay now the tax is one that's going to
have changed that to 9 let's change it
back v 1 0 is equal to 1 okay let's just
make sure it's work fit 1 cool alright
so that's how we change the values as
well we can also append values to lists
if we wanted so first of all let's just
create a new list our safe it equals
third one plus fib 2 which were the two
different sequences the different lists
that we had so now the types fib
we've got this long one now if I wanted
to add the next one to this sequence
which is going to be 89 then what I can
do is I can take this
lift right there and I can say dot and
I'm going to use a method called append
and what this is going to do is take an
argument which is the next one I want to
add on to this list so the next number
in the sequence is 89 so I'm going to
append that to this list so now have a
tight fit we can see that 89 has been
added up cool so if we want to remove
that last one we can say fit and then
another method pop now we don't need to
pass an argument in here or anything
between the brackets because it's just
going to take off the last one which is
89 and we get that back it returns 89
killers and now if I type the fit we can
see 89 is no longer on it okay so I'm
just going to show you a couple of
different ways we can remove elements
from erasers well I'm going to add that
one back on I'm going to say step dot
append and then 89 okay so say now I
want to remove a particular element from
this list right say I want to remove the
89 so let's just say fifth one we can
see the 89 oaks not fit one fits we can
see the 89 is at the end so I can say
fifth don't remove and then I can say
which elements I want to remove okay now
it can be any one of these I could pass
through 813 89 in a pass through 89 is
going to remove the 89 so I can say fit
and we can see that it's now gone well
there's a problem with this let's just
add this on again append and then 89 and
then what I'm going to do is also append
89 against all same fib attend 89 so now
we should have 289 s at the end so the
two of them one two now say I want to
remove the 89 from this list well okay
we've seen fib remove and then we can
say 89 okay but let's see what happens
at that fib and it's only removed one of
them and what happens is it removes the
first instance of that number that it
comes across it doesn't remove both of
them okay so you just have to be careful
with that we can also use something like
this we can say del for delete and this
is a method particular just to this list
right here we're not saying
list and then dot del this is just a
general function so we're going to
delete something now and now we need to
say what we want to delete from the
argument is going to be the list itself
which is called fib and then in square
brackets we can say which element we
want to remove right so zero index
remember zero one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten say we want to
remove the 10th we can type that in and
if we type outfit its remove that
element okay likewise if we say del and
then spit and just say I don't know
three it's going to remove another one
so we can fix it again and it's removed
you can see the three right here okay so
that's just a coincidence we didn't say
we wanted to remove the three just
position through your index three which
is actually the force on a long zero one
two three okay so just a coincidence at
the bathroom but anyway that's how we
add different things to list and how we
remove them as well so we've already
seen it strings in list we can say
something like this cars equals and then
this is to be some kind of memory or
character so I'll say the first one is
knowing all these raw strings sell them
in a single quotes fan out then we'll
add Luigi as well and then finally we'll
add in peach of thousands all right cool
so now we've got these three in the list
so cars will turn these three elements
now then we can also mix and match so I
could add a number to this list if I
wanted to so I could say cars attend and
then five for example and if I say cars
now then we're going to get five in that
list but this really makes no sense in
this context it's just an example so
although you can mix and match with
lists and different types and advise
that you make collections of data that
are stored in a list that ideally belong
together for example you're not going to
store Mario characters in the same race
as Chinese currency values right makes
no sense whatsoever and finally we can
also make lists within lists so for
example I could say nums
right and we can see right here we have
Mario that is a list already so we can
say okay well one has to be the first
one then this simple want wherever is
anyway
life still succeed one is the second
element and then we'll just make up a
third array right here we're going to
explicitly type not on a radar a list
we're going to explicitly type a new
lift in this third position so we'll say
1 2 3 4 ok and now if we type gnomes
we can see that we have these different
lists within the list so how do we
access say the different elements in
here well if I say gnomes and I don't
know why I call it numbers by the way
because they're not all numbers they
were saying numbers 0 then this is going
to get us back this first list right
here with the Mario characters in it and
this random 5 then I say numbers 1 it's
going to get us back the Fibonacci if I
say numbers - it's going to bring about
this last list that we added them so
what if I wanted to get the element we'd
in the list within the list so for
example this 2 right here
well what I do is that same numbers -
first of all that's going to get us this
last list yeah and then we want to get
the position 1 in there because it's 0
then 1 so I can do nones
- 1 and then that is going to give us to
back ok so that is how we nest lists
within lists and that I think is just
about enough for lists for the time
being again we're going to use these
extensively as we go through the course
so this isn't going to be the last time
you see them in the next tutorial what
we're going to do is switch over now to
the text editor I'm going to be using
atom and we're going to start making so
on different files some Python files so
then we can run those through the
interpreter instead of just keep typing
in the command line okay so I'll see you
guys in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
