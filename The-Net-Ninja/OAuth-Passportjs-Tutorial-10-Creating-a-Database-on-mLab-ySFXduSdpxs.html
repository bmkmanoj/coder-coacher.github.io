tenth or wealth tutorial and in this
video we're gonna create a database
using M lab to store our users in for
our application all right there so I
know you're probably sick of these
diagrams by now but I just want to say
where we're up to we round about here
where we're firing the passport callback
function so at this point right here if
you remember what we need to do next is
decide whether this user has been to our
application before or if they've not
been to our application before because
if not we want to create our own record
for them in our own database if they
have been to our application before we
want to just retrieve their record from
our own database right so this is the
point that we're in now so we can do all
of this kind of check inside this
callback function because this is what
fires when the profile comes back to us
right so we can take this profile
information and we can say get the
Google ID and then we can look in our
database to see if there's a user with
that Google ID and if there is we can
retrieve it if there's not we can create
that profile or that record in our
database does that make sense
cool so before we do anything we first
of all need to create a database I'm
going to be using MongoDB and I'm also
going to be using an online service
called M lab so we can create our
database online instead of locally on
our machine and I'm doing that just to
speed things up because this is not a
Mongo tutorial this is an authentication
tutorial on MongoDB just a small part of
this so I'm going to use this online
service called M lab comm which is going
to allow us to create a database online
and then sync up to that database in our
application alright so the first thing
you want to do is either sign up for a
free account or login if you've already
got one I'm going to log in and you can
see right here we have no deployments or
anything like that I am going to create
a new one so this is going to create a
new database for us and you can choose
your provider I'm just going to stick
with Amazon Web Services and I'm going
to go for a sandbox plan type which is
absolutely free
we can select a location and
we need to continue first of all and
then select the location I'm going to
choose Europe because that's nearer to
where I am then we can continue database
name I'm going to say n n for net ninja
Oh or test and then continue you can see
the database name is populated right
there so continue with that and yep I
just want to confirm everything submit
order even though I'm not paying a thing
and this is going to spin up my database
form it okay so now we have this
database and it's in progress you can
see thanks for your patience
blah-di-blah but if we click into this
we're going to notice a little key at
the top this thing right here right this
is what we need to use to connect to
MongoDB right this is the connection
string now it's asking for a database
user and a database password and
currently we don't have any users for
this database and don't get this
confused with the user you used to log
into the whole and lab account this is a
database user that we need for this
right not your account username so we
need to create a new user for this
database so I'm going to click on add
database user and I'm just going to call
this net ninja if we can spell it is
that right yep okay and then just give
it a password and another one in fact
let's just make this easy for myself
just gonna call it test okay and then we
can create this username and password
for this database so now we have this
user associated with it we can import
that user and the password right here so
I'm gonna copy this string and I'm gonna
go back to my editor over here and I'm
gonna add this into the keys file
because again this is not something you
just want anyone to see because your
username and password are going to be
inside this string as well so I'm gonna
pop this into my keys file and
underneath Google I'm going to create
another property and this time it's
going to be called Mongo dB okay and
then I can add in an object right here
and it's going to be the DB you
you are I I'm gonna paste this string in
and I need to add in my username which
is MIT ninja and also the password which
is so original test and that's fine so
now we have this key stored inside this
file right here so we can use it to
connect it's a MongoDB now we're going
to be using Mongoose to connect in the
database which is an ORM it just makes
it really simple for us to communicate
with MongoDB it adds a load of different
methods that we can use to query the
database that kind of thing all right
and by the way if at any point you feel
like you're being left behind when it
comes to MongoDB I do have a full series
on MongoDB which takes you right from
beginner having never used it before
through to a fairly advanced level so
I'll leave the link to that down below
if you want to check that out so now we
have our MongoDB URI we can use this to
connect to the database and we're going
to do that in a pas now like I said
we're going to use Mongoose which is a
package for node to do that so we'll
need to install that first of all so I'm
gonna come over here and exit out of
this process and then we're going to
install Mongoose by saying NPM install
Mongoose that's just going to take a few
seconds to do alright cool so when
that's installed we can go back to the
code in a PJs where we want to connect
to MongoDB so we need to import a couple
of things here first of all Const
Mongoose we're going to import that
which we just installed
so that's require and then I'm mongrels
not mongoose mongoose all right so we
can use that now in this file we also
need to import the keys file because
we're using this thing right here Mongo
DB DB URI so we need access to this so
let's import all so that Keys file will
say Const keys it's going to be equal to
require again and inside this time we
need to say dot forward slash in the
config folder forward slash keys alright
so now we have access to that keys
object as well so then let us connect
now to MongoDB so a little comment to
say connect to MongoDB
just like to do this so everything's
organized I don't know what everything
is and then I'm gonna say Mongoose which
we just installed right here and
required Mongoose dot connect and we're
gonna pass through the connection string
right here so instead of passing it
directly in here then potentially
committing this to get and upload and
it's a github where everyone can see it
what were instead going to do is pass it
in using the keys object and then it's
dot Mongo DB I think
yep MongoDB dot DB
URI so I'll say dot DB you are I okay so
once we've done that we can pass in as a
second parameter a callback function
which is an es6 error function and
inside here we're gonna say something at
like console dot log and then connected
to Mongo DB alright so if we were to
save this now and run the file
by saying no daman up then hopefully
fingers crossed this is gonna work no
errors so far this is all fine there's
no real errors and you can see right now
we've successfully connected to MongoDB
that's awesome so now we're in a
position where we setup a database to
store our users in and we've also
connected to that database right here in
app j s which is gonna fire as soon as
we start up our application so now we've
synced to our database so now we're in a
position where we can take this profile
and we can save it to the database that
we've just created so we'll take a look
at that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
