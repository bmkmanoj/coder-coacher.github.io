your sixth django tutorial and in this
video i'm going to introduce you to
django models
alright then so far we've been messing
around with URLs and views and we've
been sending back templates to the end
user
however at the minute these are just
static templates but what we really want
to do is start working with data because
after all a blog is a collection of
articles which is data and that's going
to be stored in a database right so we
want our views and our templates to be a
little bit more dynamic and not just
sent back static HTML or send back maybe
articles which are stored in a database
table so to do that we're going to have
to understand the concept of muddles
so what is a model then well basically a
model in Django is a class which
represents a single table in a database
and each type of data that we have in
our application for example that could
be articles or users or authors or books
or something else that we have in our
application each type of data is
represented by its own model okay so
each model then maps to a single table
in a database so for example if we had
four models articles users authors and
books then we would have four tables in
a database each table is mapped by a
single model so it looks something like
this
in the code to represent a model we have
a class and we give that class a name
for example article so this class then
represents this table in a database so
don't worry too much about this code for
now here we're going to go over that in
a second but for example this article
has a title field and a body field right
generally in a blog so that is stored in
our model in the code and that then is
mapped to a database table called
articles which is going to store
instances of this model so we have three
instances of the model here and we have
a generated ID for each one even though
there's not an idea over here
there will be an ID in the table which
is automatically generated we have the
title which is a character field and
also the body which is a text field so
each row here represents a single record
inside this articles table and this
model is a way for us to map to the
table
okay so models in the code are going to
allow us to create new instances of
records and then store them or save them
in the database table and we can also
use the Django ORM to interact with the
database as well using these models and
we'll learn more about the ORM later on
for now let's just create a model inside
the code
okay then so back in our code what I'd
like to do is create a model for our
articles so inside these articles up
right here we have a model stock py file
that is automatically generated when we
created these articles up so we're going
to store our model for our article
inside here so it's already imported
this thing muddles which is built into
jungle and we're going to use that in a
second so the first thing we need to do
is create a class remember a model is
represented by a class in jungle and
we're going to give this class a name
it'll be called article and I've given
this a capital a that is a convention
when we're creating models we start with
capital okay so this class is going to
inherit from models dots model alright
so this is in built into jungle as well
and it's just inheriting some basic
functionality that all models will have
so inside this class what we need to do
is define our different fields what is
going to be stored in an article well
let's think about it we're going to have
a title a body which is the whole text
inside the article we might have a date
of when the article was published and I
think also a thumbnail or an image of
some description maybe the author who's
writing it and a slug which is the URL
address if you like of the article so
let's create some of these now first of
all I'm gonna say title then underneath
I'm gonna say slug then I'll say body
and then I'll say date and we're also
going to add another couple of fields
later on but we'll leave them for now so
I'll just add in a little comment here
to say what we're gonna add in later on
we'll say add in thumbnail later and
also add in the author later so who
wrote this article so now we have these
four properties right here we need to
set them equal to something what type of
data is this
well this title might be a text field or
a character field so a character field
in Django is a small amount of text and
a text field is a large amount of text
so it makes sense that this is a small
amount of text because a title is not a
big paragraph it's just a one-liner
so while we're talking about fields I
just want to show you the documentation
on these different fuel types and I'll
leave the link to this down below
because they have a big list of all the
different field types that we can have
in a model there's things for images
file uploads text dates that kind of
thing so what we're doing is we're
telling Django what type of data is
going to be stored in each one of these
different fields because some of them
were protect some of them will be a date
so might be a file an image that kind of
thing okay so we need to tell Django
here
okay what type of data is a title what
type of data is a slug a body and a date
and we can find that out by reading
through these different field types so
if we scroll down here we'll see this
car field which I was just talking about
and this is for small to large sized
strings so that's what we're gonna do to
begin with we're going to use that or
the title so we're going to set the
title equal to models because the
different field types are on this thing
right here it's models top car field
and we can also pass through in here
different arguments for example if I
want to set a max length of a hundred
characters I can pass that through and
you can see the different things that we
can pass through down here as well you
can see max length we can use all right
so let's pass you in max underscore
length set that equal to 100 meaning we
don't want more than 100 characters for
this title all right so the slug is
going to be a field called a slug field
that's built into Django as well so say
muddles dots slug field okay we don't
need to pass any kind of extra argument
in there the body is going to be a text
field so I'll say muddles dot text field
and you can see that text field down
here if we scroll down enough can be in
alphabetical order this we have to go
down a fair whack we can see right here
text field so the default widget for
this is a text area so that's another
thing when we're telling Django here
what kind of data each field is when it
comes to output in a form in both the
admin area or in the front-end for users
to add a new article it's going to know
what type of widget whether that's going
to be an input field a drop-down box a
file upload or a text field it's gonna
know what type to output depending on
what we put here all right so that's
another cool reason we do this kind of
thing so we're gonna use text field
right here for the body and again we can
set a max length but I'm not going to do
that for the body and finally we need to
use the date/time field for this awesome
models dot date/time field so this is
gonna grab whatever the date and time is
that this instance was created when we
create a new article all right and
inside here I'm gonna pass through an
argument which is called Auto underscore
now underscore add and that's going to
be equal to true and what that does is
when an article is created it's going to
automatically populate this field with
the time now the user doesn't have to
input the field it's going to
automatically add that for us okay
so this my friends is now our model so
far for an article okay and so the next
thing we need to do is make a migration
so that this model is then mapped to a
database table and we're going to do
that in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
