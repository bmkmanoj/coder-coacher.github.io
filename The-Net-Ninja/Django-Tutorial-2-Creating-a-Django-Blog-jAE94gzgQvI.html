second Django tutorial and in this video
we're gonna install Django and start
creating our blog alright then so I
guess the first thing we want to do is
install Django onto our computer so we
can start using it now by this stage I'm
guessing you've already installed Python
if not stop here
go on install Python first of all I've
got Python 3 running on this machine so
we're gonna install Django using pip
which is the package manager for Python
and we'll say pip install and then
Django now I've already installed Django
on my computer so I don't need to hit
enter but you do that's going to
download and install jungle for you on
your computer now the next thing you
need to do is navigate to a directory
inside your command-line tool where you
want to create a jungle project
okay so I've directed myself into this
jungle playlist folder and by the way to
change directory inside the terminal all
you need to do is CD that stands for
change directory then the directory name
for example documents that's gonna jump
into the Documents folder for you ok or
to go up a level you just do CD double
dot and that's gonna go up a level you
can see right here it's jumped up to
recording so I'll say CD jungle -
playlist again and that's gonna jump
into this folder this is where I'm going
to create my jungle project so how do we
create a jungle project
well once we have jungle installed dead
simple all we do is say Django - admin
then it's starts project and then the
name of your project I'm gonna call this
Django notic and that is not a
completely random name when Python uses
use jungle they call Django notes so I
just thought Django notic was a good
name for a Python block alright so if
you click enter now that's going to go
out and create this Django project for
you and over here in my editor you can
see this Django notic folder inside the
jungle playlist this is my project
folder now and if I open it up then we
get another Jackie nautic folder which
is a little bit confusing at first but
this is basically the base up of your
project and we'll talk about django apps
later on but understand this is kind of
like the root up of your project and
inside here we have diff
files we have the init file which is
just saying look this is a module in
Python then we have a settings file and
this is going to control some different
settings of our project and we're going
to talk about that a bit later on and go
through right throughout this series we
also have a URLs dot py file and inside
here is where we control all the
different routes or URLs and send users
to different pages etc again we'll go
through that later on as well and we
also outside of the folder have this
manage py file and we're never going to
be editing anything to do with this but
this is going to control a lot of
different things for us it's going to
allow it to spin up a server to make
migrations to enter some kind of
interactive shell and communicate with a
database etc and in fact we use a
command using this manage py
straightaway so if I just go to my
terminal again I'm gonna say Python
because we're running a Python file
right then I'm gonna say manage dot py
because this is the file I want to run
and by the way before I do this I just
need to CD into this Django notic older
first of all sauce a CD Django notic
alright because otherwise it'd be
looking inside this folder right here
for a money drop py file it's not there
it's inside this one so now I can say
python managed dot py and the command
we're going to use is a run server
you
and this is going to spin up a local
server for us which is going to run our
application alright so you can see right
here is saying now that the development
server is at 127.0.0.1 and then port
8000 alright now if we go to this
address in a browser we won't see much
at the minute because we've not really
done anything in our project there's
nothing really there yet but this is
where we would preview our project later
on down the line okay so to exit out of
the server and just press ctrl + C
that's going to quit it for you
so now if we go to this address it's no
longer gonna show our website the server
has to be running so whenever we want to
preview our website all we do you say
Python man you stop py and then run
server so this run server command is
coming from this manage py thing and
again we're gonna be using this manage
py file for a few different commands
like this later on through the series
you'll also of noticed when I run this
we've also got this DB SQL Lite 3 file
so Django projects automatically come
configured with SQL Lite so that's going
to store all of our data for us inside
this project of course later on down the
line you're free to use a different kind
of database but for now we're just going
to stick with this one so that's what
that file is all about as well so there
we go my friends we've now set up our
first Django project installed Django
and we're ready to go in the next lesson
to have a look at some of these files in
here in particular we're going to look
at this URLs file to begin with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
