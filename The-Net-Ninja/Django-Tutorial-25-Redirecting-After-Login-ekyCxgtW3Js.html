tutorial and in this video I'm gonna
show you how we can redirect our users
after they've logged into the
application okay then so we saw in the
last tutorial that if we try to go to
forward slash articles forward slash
create if we're not logged in it will
redirect us to the login page but if we
then login it doesn't take us to the
article create page where we try to get
to it instead just dumps us on this
article listing page now that's not very
good
I'd like it to redirect us to the page
we just tried to access now if I go back
if I log out in fact and try to go to
articles create again it will redirect
me to the login page notice this in the
URL it's gone to the login URL right
here but after that we have a query
string and a query string is denoted by
this question mark that starts the query
string then we have a variable a query
parameter called next and that's set
equal to forward slash articles forward
slash create so this is telling jungle
look this is where the user probably
wants to go to next
right it's captured where we've come
from where we've tried to access and
then when we login we probably want to
go back to this forward slash articles
forward slash create but the trouble is
how do we then access this variable
right here from the query string and use
it to relocate the user to that URL well
when we render this login page we can
see this in the login view down here
when we return this render we render the
login dot HTML page we also send the
request object and on the request object
we have access to these parameters right
here and we get them via the dot get
property ok so this is a get request so
we can use the dot get property much
like we use the dot post property to get
post data we can use the dot get
property on the request object to access
this next variable okay so this request
right here this is accessible inside
this login template or any other
template so if we go to the login
template we have access to that request
object down here so we can check that
hey does the next property right here
the next parameter does that appear
anywhere in the URL and we can check
that underneath this by opening our
template tags so curly brace and
percentage sign then saying if between
an if check right here
if request dot gets so we're saying get
the get object on the request object if
request don't get dot next which is the
parameter name that we want right here
there so we're saying if that exists
right now then we want to do something
so this HTML that I put below this will
only appear if this is true if that next
parameter occurs so what do we want to
output well we want to output an input
field and I'll explain this in a second
and this input field will be hidden so a
user can't see it the name is going to
be next that is where we want to go to
next and the value of this is going to
be dynamically output so double curly
braces again is request get dot next so
the value of this input field is going
to be this thing right here whatever
next is equal to so in this case forward
slash articles forward slash create that
will be the value of this input field
and then after we've done that we can
end this if statement so and if so why
are we doing this well we're checking if
this query parameter next exists because
if it does then we want to redirect them
to whatever that next is equal to right
so we're checking if that exists first
of all on the login page if it does no
more output in this hidden input and the
name of this input is next and the value
is going to be whatever the next
parameter is equal to inside the URL in
this case forward slash articles forward
slash create and the reason we're doing
that is because when we then make a post
request this information will come along
with the post request this value
and we can then access that information
inside the post request of this login of
you so if we can access that information
right here we know within this view
where we want to send the user back to
and we can do that right so instead of
just redirecting them to articles list
we can check if this next property
exists if it was sent back in the form
in the post data and if it does exist we
can send them to that value make sense
so after we've logged the user in let's
just do a little check to see if the
next property in the post object is
present so we'll say if then next and
then outside in request dot
post then do something so this right
here is saying if the next parameter
occurs in request up post if that's
being sent along via this thing right
here yeah then what we want to do is
actually redirect them to that next
position so we'll return a redirect and
this redirect is going to be request dot
post next or rather get to get a
particular parameter from the post
object and it's going to be next
okay so it's getting the next thing
right here because we have a name of
next and we also need to spell hidden
correctly we have a name of next so it's
getting this input field value and it's
redirecting to that value which will be
/ur articles forward slash create all
right now else if we don't get that on
the post request then instead I just
want to return a redirect to articles
list so if we just go directly to the
login page and we're not coming from
that article create page then this won't
exist right here it won't be present
therefore if that's not present inside
the HTML
this won't output because this will be
false right this won't appear
in a request therefore this won't be
output therefore when we click Submit or
login we don't receive that and so this
will be false because next is not in
request at post and then we're going to
return this redirect instead I hope all
that makes sense so let's save both of
these and try it out so again I'm going
to make sure I'm logged out then try to
go to articles create get forward into
the login page and it says where the
next value should be I'll log in and now
it takes me to the article creation
field now if I log out again and just go
direct to accounts forward slash login
then we don't get that next parameter
and if I log in this time it doesn't
redirect me to the add or create article
page it just redirects me to this
article listing page cool so there we go
that's how we detect where we're coming
from when we go to the login page and
redirect to that page if we need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
