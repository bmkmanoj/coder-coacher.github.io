JavaScript for beginners lesson 28 and
in this video we're going to create a
new object from scratch Wow alright guys
so in the last lesson you heard me talk
about objects as if they were real world
objects and we use the analogy of a car
we said that a car has behaviors such as
driving and accelerating and they were
the equivalent of methods on JavaScript
objects and it also has properties such
as the driver or the top speed the
length of the car etc and then with the
equivalent of JavaScript properties on
object right so what we're going to do
is use that car analogy in this lesson
right here and we're going to create a
new object from scratch and give that
object some methods and properties all
right so what I want to do is take back
to a raise first of all and we saw that
if we create an array it was just
something like this var my array equals
new array yeah we can do something like
that to create a blank array with
nothing in it and then what we do is say
my array 0 to put something in the zero
position that's just a number my array 1
to put something in the next position
which could be a string it could be
anything out hello etc etc yeah now we
can do exactly the same with an object
we can say books via my car because
we're going to use the car analogy
equals a new object alright and what
we've done there let's create a blank
object with nothing in it
now to put properties in it and give it
methods we use a similar kind of
notation to arrays but instead of using
these square brackets we use dot
notation and instead of these numbers we
have names for the properties and
methods so the way we give it a property
is by saying my car dot um let's say max
speed equals and we'll just give it a
number we'll say 50 and that stands for
50 miles an hour right so we can give it
another property my car dot driver
equals Shawn yep so now we've given it
two properties so we could call these
let
console dot log just one of them will
say my car doctor either save that
refresh over here and now it's logging
shown to the console because that's what
driver is okay so we've given an object
properties that's all there is to it and
it would be like saying if you have to
string my string dot length exactly the
same principle alright we've just
assigned our own names to properties of
this my car variable which is an object
so that's all there is to it now we can
give the my cloud object methods also
I remember methods are just behaviors or
functions of that object right so we
could say my car drive this is the
function or method name and then we set
it equal to a function right and we'll
just have the function to console.log
now driving okay so dead simple and then
because you've got this assignment
operator here we do need the semicolon
at the end just like assigning any other
variable if I was to do something like
this var my bar equals hey I'd have to
put the semicolon at the end we're doing
exactly the same here we're setting this
function variable or this function this
method of the car equal to this function
here so at the end we have to have this
semicolon and this semicolon here is
just the end of this console dot log
statement right so that there is a
method of this my car object now so we
can call it we can say my car not Drive
and remember to call a method or a
function we always have to specify the
parenthesis yeah that calls the function
right here I don't put the parenthesis
because if it was to do that it try and
call this drive function and currently
it doesn't exist
okay it only exists after we've assigned
it so we don't do that when we're
assigning methods but when we call the
method we use the parenthesis to call it
okay so let's save that and refresh over
here
now you can see it prints out or it logs
out to the console now drive it and
that's this function right here okay so
now what we've done is assigned
properties and methods to that object
okay then so much like arrays we can
also use shorthand notation you saw with
arrays we could say my array 2 equals
this and then just put through 15 high
just like that that was the shorthand
notation for making an array right we
can do the same kind of thing with
objects what we'll do is say var my car
to this time and then equals and then we
use the curly braces that is the
shorthand notation for an object for
creating a new object and then within
here we have to specify the property
names and the property values and the
method names and the method values right
so we'll give it the same ones for now
we'll just say max speed that's the
property name then we do a colon right
and then we put a value then after we've
done that property name and the value
pair we put a comment to say look the
next value pair is coming up property
value pair all right the next one is
driver and that is I'll say net ninja
for this one make it a little bit
different and in fact we'll change this
as well to 17 all right
and then again comma to say and other
ones coming up and final it by the way
we don't have to write my car dot here
because it already knows it's on the my
car sorry my car two dots it already
knows it's on the my car object because
of this here we're assigning it to that
object right so finally we need that
drive method source a drive colon and
then this is a function and we'll just
copy and paste this right here so now
we've added that function it and that's
the last kind of method name and value
pair so we don't need a comma right at
the end here because there's not another
come in but what we do need is the
semicolon right at the end of this
closing curly brace where it started
there it ends there remember this is all
an assignment so we end it with this
semicolon right so that there is another
way to assign properties and methods to
an object and let's just make sure this
is where let's call a couple of things
let's say my car to dot max speed and we
need to love that to the console
actually so we'll write console dot log
my car dot max speed and then we'll just
say my car to dot Drive
yeah and that should log this to the
console now driving beginning let's
point man all right so let's save that
and refresh over here and now we get
seventy which is the max speed and now
driving again which is this function
right here okay
so that is the shorthand way of creating
objects now this right here does not
look very readable to me so I like to
present it in a slightly different way
okay all I want to do is just bring each
property or each method down onto a new
line just like this and then the closing
curly brace right there and then we've
got each separate property or method on
a new line and it just looked a lot
better because we can see all the
methods and properties right there
stacked on top of each other so that
should make no difference whatsoever
let's save again refresh yep exactly it
the same now just to take this one step
further right
in fact what we'll do is we'll make this
a little bit more readable here and
we'll bring that down onto a new line
what I'm going to do is pass in a couple
of variables into this function or
parameters or arguments as the call
button now what I want to do is pass in
a speed variable and also a time
variable right and what we'll do is get
rid of this message and what I want to
do is console dot log how far you've
driven which is the speed times time
right if we say the speedy v is 50 miles
an hour
and the time is two hours two times
fifty it's going to be a hundred miles
that is traveled yet so I will do is
consult log
speed times time and that's going to
print out how many miles traveled yeah
so what I'll do is when I call this my
car to drive and calling this function
it's expecting two variables so what
I'll do is I'll pass in the speed to be
50 miles an hour and then three hours
yeah so let's save that and let's
refresh over here and now I get 150
which is the distance travel right there
okay guys that's how we create new
objects in JavaScript
in the next lesson I'm going to take
this one step further and introduce this
keyword so we can use that within this
object I'll tell you all about that in
the next lesson for now if you have any
questions about this lesson feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those questions otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you in
the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
