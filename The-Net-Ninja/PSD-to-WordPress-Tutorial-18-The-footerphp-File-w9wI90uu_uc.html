WordPress tutorial and in this video
we're gonna walk through the footage PHP
template Wow alright guys all this junk
over here is the footed up PHP template
and remember this is the stuff that's
docked at the bottom of pretty much
every page on your WordPress site so for
example again if we go to the index dot
PHP file you can see at the bottom here
we've got the get footer function which
is calling that template footer so
anything in this footer is gonna get
dumped wherever we see that get footer
function right so most of this stuff we
don't really need if you take a look at
this footer right over here then you can
see most of it is just the wrapper ul
tag and then this image at the bottom so
we can get rid of a lot of this the
first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of
all this info here because we don't need
any of that as you can see it's got no
attributes over there so we'll get rid
of that next thing we want to do is turn
this into a wrapper just like this and
then this stuff here is a wordpress link
which is gonna say powered by WordPress
and this one here is a link to your
website when we downloaded the theme he
asked us for our website I put this in
and so basically if you're making this
theme for someone else and you want your
website link at the bottom of this theme
this is how you do it
this PHP function right here is gonna
output that link at the bottom of the
theme however for this one I don't want
to do it so I'm gonna get rid of both of
these things like that okay so all we
need to do now is grab this DS ul tax
and we're going to paste them right in
here like that let's just neaten this up
a little bit what if we done get that
and there we go done over here there we
go
should be fine now okay so now we've
just got the UL tags in there in the
image and that's pretty much it guys
this WP footer function at the bottom is
similar to the WP head it's used by
plugins and other things to load in
resources that we're gonna need so it's
best to keep that there where it is okay
so let's take a look at this there is
one more thing I want to show you in a
minute but
to do that I want to show you what it
looks like first of all so I'm gonna go
to the website and this is the footer as
it currently stands if i refresh now
we've got those things in here now you
can see two things first of all these
links are not right so we need to sort
that out in the CSS the second thing
this logo the images are loaded right so
let's have a look at the image first of
all you can see here we're saying okay
it's in the images folder and it's the
white logo so why is it not picking it
up well it's because this right here
this index oh sorry this footed up PHP
has been loaded in the index dot PHP
file and it's not going to be relative
to this images folder okay so what we
need to do is provide the full URL now
I'm going to use a PHP function that is
a part of WordPress to do this all right
so let's go in here where the source is
I'm gonna open my PHP tags and then I'm
gonna say echo and echo basically just
means I want you to say this thing I
want you to output this next bit of
information and we need our parentheses
for that and a bit of information I want
to put in is a function called get
template directory you are I like that
and then we can put a semicolon at the
end of that and close our PHP tag and
what this is gonna do now is get the
full base URL of this theme folder okay
so he's gonna get the here RL up to this
theme folder and then we're gonna carry
that we need to put a forward slash
there we're gonna carry on this URL with
from this theme folder so then it's once
it gets into the theme folder it goes in
the images folder and then gets the logo
alright so that should win out if I save
it and come back here first of all if I
right click this and inspect the element
then you're gonna see you can see the
sources images forward slash white logo
so that's going to the root of the whole
directory not the root of the theme
folder and that's why it's not working
right but if i refresh this page now the
logos there and you can inspect the
element
and you can see now that function that I
just put in as grab the URL of the theme
we were in up to here and then we added
in the rest of the the path to that
image okay so that's why we did that and
that's why it wasn't working originally
but it is now so next thing we need to
do is just make these this kind of gray
color which I think was a EEE or
something like that so let's go into
this again let's go to Starbucks CSS and
it will be in the footer somewhere so
let's control and flutter go through
until you find it there we go footer a
life or to a what we'll do is just pull
important there to over add any other
rule and see what it looks like now and
now it worked perfect alright guys so
now we've got the footage sorted we've
got the header sorted and the footer now
so in the next tutorial what I want to
do is style up or rather transfer the
content across to the home page itself
alright so until then if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to drop a
comment down below otherwise guys still
forget to subscribe and I'll see you in
