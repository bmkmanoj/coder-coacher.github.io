your 13th REST API tutorial and in this
video I want to introduce you to Mungo
GL Jason
okay so we've handled all of our request
types except for debts or flowers don't
delete put and post so all this left is
this debt request but it's not just a
case of a simple get request where we
retrieve every ninja out of the database
and then display them all to the user
you saw at the start of this tutorial
series that we're going to create an
application which returns ninjas which I
nearby so we're going to use some form
of geolocation to identify the ninjas
which are near by to your latitude and
longitude and which we've only those so
we need to kind of create some kind of
geolocation feature within this API to
do that for us
so you might just think well okay go to
your model and where we've said adding
to your location let's just add in for
example and a longitude property which
is something or other and a latitude
property which is something or other and
let's just pop those numbers in and then
if a user pops numbers in which are near
we can go out find these do some code or
do some magic and return just those
ninjas but now MongoDB does not work
this way at all when it comes to your
location it's actually usually something
internally called geo Jason to handle to
your location for us which is actually
really good so this is the Geo JSON web
site and it's basically a method of
storing geolocation data in JSON format
and the bit we're particularly
interested is this geometry bit okay so
you can see this geometry property right
here has two sub properties type and
coordinates so the type here is point
and that's what we're going to be using
we're going to be using single points on
a map just imagine a ninja is on a map
somewhere or you've got many ninjas on a
map and they're all single points on
that map they've got an x-coordinate and
a y-coordinate if you like to write a
latitude and a longitude but this could
be other things like line strings
polygons multi points multi strings for
example this multi-line string could be
used to plot a route on a map through
different streets or something like that
but we're going to use a point
the coordinates are obviously the
latitude and longitude of the ninja okay
so where it's located on the map so this
is what we're going to use we're going
to store the geometry the geolocation of
our ninjas in Jason format like this so
what I'm going to do is just copy this
and I'm going to paste it in here for
reference just at the top so we can
refer to it okay so let's paste that
right there now okay what we could do is
we could add this directly on to our
ninja ski map right here okay underneath
this but because we have kind of sub
properties here within this property of
what I like to do is separate this out
into a separate schema and then put that
schema here so I'm going to show you how
to do that so what I'm going to do first
of all is create a new schema for our
geolocation and we're going to call this
geo schema so let's pop a little comment
here see in create geolocation schema
okay and then under here what we need to
say is Const geo
oops capital to geo schema is equal to a
new schema much like we did with this
thing down here then inside here we need
to pass through how this schema is going
to lock well here's a starting point but
I want to expand on it a little bit more
so we've got these two properties the
type and coordinates right so we'll say
type and then we're going to set that
equal to just an object at the minute
and then coordinates and again just set
this equal to an object at the minute
remember if we're just passing through
this one thing points and array we don't
need these curly braces but when we're
passing more things through like we have
them here where we say the type of the
property whether it's required or the
default value then we need to rather we
need these are killer braces to pass
these two properties through make sense
okay so this tagging right here it's a
point so we'll say the default value if
we don't specify anything else is going
to be point okay like so and also the
type of this is
string you can see the string value
right here so I'm also going to say type
and don't get confused with this type
right here okay this is saying the type
of coordinate it is on a map this is
saying the type of data that this
property is which is a string right so
don't get confused with those but this
is a string and then we've done that bit
so the next one is the coordinates and
again we're going to do a type to
propagate and this time it's an array
you can see it's in the red because
we've got those square brackets so we'll
put that square bracket notation in
there and it's an array of numbers right
so if only to say is number inside there
then this knows that it's going to
expect an array of numbers so I want to
add one more property here and that is
the index property which is going to be
to DC so I'm going to say to the sphere
right here and basically this is saying
the type of map that we want to use
essentially we're saying we want to use
a 2d sphere which takes into
consideration the circumference of the
planet if you like so just to explain
this in a bit more detail
MongoDB can use either 2d or to be
sphere for this index right and imagine
we've got two points on the world one in
the UK and one in China almost directly
opposite each other right
so 2d would say okay well the distance
between those two points is this line
going across right here from A to B now
a 2d sphere maps itself out like to
earth right it's 3d intercept in essence
or it's on a 2d plane is that makes
sense so this time instead of saying
well the distance is just a direct line
from A to B it takes into consideration
the 3d aspect of the world and the
circumference of the earth and it does
that kind of curved path instead from A
to B as if you are walking around the
globe from point A to B so this is
obviously more accurate to you so that's
what we're going to use in this playlist
so now we've set up this geo schema we
can delete this but I'm going to copy
this because this geometry property is
what this schema down here is going to
expect we need
pass through the geometry of the ninja
when we create a ninja so let's do a
comma and add in the geometry as well so
this is going to be equal to listing
right here the Geo schema so what we're
doing in essence instead of nesting all
of this stuff right here within this
property right here because it gets a
little messy instead we've created a new
schema kanji or schema just for this
geometry property and then when we
create a new ninja it's going to look at
the geometry property and say ok we need
this to look like the geo schema right
here ok so that is now the ninja schema
updated so now when we go to create a
new ninja we're going to pass in these
different properties up here the type
which you can be a points or it's going
to default to points if we don't pass
that in and also the coordinates of our
ninja so we're going to create a lot of
different ninjas in the next tutorial
with a few different coordinates and
then we're going to set up our get
requests to retrieve those ninjas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
