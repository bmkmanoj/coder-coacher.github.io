watching CSS for beginners a lesson 47
and in this video we're gonna take a
look at color Wow all right there so I'm
back here in the code and we've still
got this div idea of banner right here
I've stripped out all of those
background properties and we're just
gonna focus on the background color in
this lesson so the background color
property we know is background - color
alright then and we're going to start
out with hexadecimal cold or sharp hex
cold and hex code is a series of six
numbers or six letters or a combination
of both that make up a color and it's
made from three channels okay the first
two numbers in the series control the
red colors the second to control the
green colors and the final to control
the blue colors so we'd start it with a
hash symbol always that's how hex code
works and then we put our six numbers or
six letters and they range from zero all
the way up to nine and then after nine
to go from A to F F being the lightest
and zero being the darkest so if zero is
the darkest and we put zero zero for our
red Channel if we put zero zero for our
green Channel and zero zero for our blue
Channel then what do you think that will
be well it's the darkest of all channels
that I would say would be black but
let's just double check oops in a
browser
let's refresh this yep black and that's
because all the channels are zero
there's no color in them okay now if we
shift up the first channel say Liam take
that to five five or even it could be
five zero or what five two can be
anything what you want and save that
that is the red channel that we're
putting brighter color into the green
and the blue Channel still have zero
color so we'll give that a whirl and see
what color is in the browser refresh
this yeah now we started to get a red
color and the same would be true if we
were to pop
digits in the other ones instead let's
put 50 there this is the green channel
in fact a mug interview in a browser
brackets is being cool and it's just
showing me that cooler there in a little
thumbnail box so you can see that's a
green one and it would be the same for
the blue let's put that at five there we
go blue comes up and the higher the
number I've changed it to ninety the
light of the color I change that to F
then we're getting a light blue yeah you
see the point and obviously if zero zero
zero zero zero zero is black then the
other end of the spectrum would be FF
this is the brightest FF FF now what you
think that would be you've guessed it
white there it is brackets is showing me
so we can mess around with these and
give different channels different values
so I'll change these to a that's going
to bring down some color in the green
channel I'll bring down the red to 44
see what happens there yeah that's
giving us a pale blue so we can mess
around with these and we can use a color
picker such as the one on Photoshop see
we're generating these codes for us I'll
just show you quickly the one on
Photoshop it's right here and we can put
this little color picker anywhere we
want right now this is the hex code here
it's black and it's zero zero zero but
if we want to say go up here and get
this kind of maroon color that it gives
us the hex code for that if we want to
change it to wear a green color we can
go here make it a bit darker gives us
the hex code alright so that is the hex
code in a nutshell now there is a
another method we can use RGB form and
it's similar in there it takes three
values first of all we write RGB to
specify we're using RGB format then we
open and close our parentheses and then
within here we specify our three values
and they range from 0 0 we're going to
give this to all of them
oops so we're saying 0 0 for the red is
0 for the green 0 for the blue separated
by commas each time that's important and
same again this is gonna give us a black
call it because we're saying in each
channel you want the 0 color now that's
showing up on brackets again perfect
than it's black
they range all the way up to 255 so we
can take this two to five five that was
the red channel the green Channel and
two five five that's the blue Channel
now this should be white because now
we're maxing out all of those and we can
have any combination of colors in
between for example we could drop down
the red channel to 100 and this gives us
a more kind of light blue color same
again we can go to any kind of color
picker like in Photoshop which I'll do
now for you and we can check out these
values here now the minute it says
thirteen one away and fifty-eight but if
we want to see again orange color say
like this here then we use these values
that's two five one I'm going to change
this to something that can remember 250
150 and sixty two fifty one fifty and
sixty so that's the red channel 215
green channel 150 blue Channel sixty so
let's put those values in in here
so we said 250 oops 251 50 and 60 and
that should give us the orange color yep
there we go perfect so that's it my
friends we've got hex code and we've got
RGB colors so we can use any of these
that we want to and I normally use hex
code but feel free to use RGB if you
like it's especially useful when you
come to work with background opacity
we're going to talk about that in an
upcoming video but for this video that's
about it if you have any questions feel
free to comment down below I'll answer
all of those otherwise if you enjoy

one where we're going to look at
