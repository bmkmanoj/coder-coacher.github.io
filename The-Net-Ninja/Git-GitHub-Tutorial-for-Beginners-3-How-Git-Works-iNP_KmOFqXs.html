your third git and github tutorial and
in this video I just want to take a few
moments to discuss how it works okay
there so before we start using git
whatsoever I want to take a few minutes
just to explain the very basics of the
get mechanics and how it all works
so at the heart of gates are these
things called or repositories but
because of a hipster
you might hear me refer to these as a
repos from now on so these are repos and
they are containers for projects that
you want to track with gift for example
you could have a repo which is a website
project ok and it's going to track that
website project for you and by the way a
repository or repo can add be local
stored on your computer or remote which
is stored on some kind of online service
like github don't worry about remotes
for now we'll cover those later on for
now let's focus on local repositories so
anyway we can have as many of these
different repos on our computers we want
for as many different projects and all
of these different repos and projects
are going to be tracked
independently of each other by git ok so
essentially it gets repo or repository
is essentially a project folder which
git is going to track the contents of
for us for example we might have some
kind of folder on our computer called my
project or whatever the hell your
project is called and inside a surefire
sign that this folder is a repository
and being tracked by git is this dot git
file ok that says that this is a
repository right here and because this
is at the root level of this project it
means that git is going to track changes
to any file in this folder even files in
subfolders ok if this dot git file was
not in the root but instead in this
image folder it would only track changes
to this image folder and this would be
the repository not this but because it's
at the root the whole thing is the
repository and it's going to track
changes to every single file so if we
meet changes to the index of style or
any of the images
git is go recognize that and track them
forward
so there's these things called commits
and commits are a bit like safe points
if you were playing some kind of video
game and you come to a save point you
can create some kind of save file right
and you can create many different same
files and then return to which have a
different save file that you want at any
given time commits are a little bit like
that in the most simplistic form so we
have these different Commission right
here okay so for example we're starting
a project and say we start scrape some
of the HTML and at one point we finish
your header and we say ok this is a
logical point to kind of create a commit
safe point if we like so what we do is
we commit the state of our code and that
fails and that one particular time to
the commit history we create this kind
of saved by this commit okay so whether
down the line we might start on
something else and finish in the footer
and we say ok this is another logical
kind of save point I want to track the
progress or to here as well
we'll make a commit here so we name that
to make finished footer and further down
the line we do some more code we added a
JavaScript slider and we add a commit
there so these are all different commits
in the commit history within our
repository ok so the cool thing is say
we make about five different commits
right and that can make five over here
we're trying to say actually you know
what I want to rewind and go back to the
fourth commit or the third commit or the
second commit I want to go back to one
of these save points and see what the
code is like there instead you can do
not using git because we may be
different commits we can roll back the
code to any different commit in it the
commit history which is really cool so
it's tracking our different revisions of
the code as we go along and as we commit
so we get working in this fashion it's
going to be incredibly hard for us to
ever actually lose our progress and our
work because we can just roll back fast
forward etc so before we make a
repository I just want to talk about
these different three stages ok so we've
got our project folder over here and we
make some changes to say the index file
right then those changes are going to go
into the modified stage right here
okay they're modified but they're not
ready for committing we don't know
whether we want to commit these files
and create like this save time if you
like where these changes but if we
decide we do what we can do so we can
add this file into the staging area and
what that says to get is look when I
make a commit the changes I make to this
index file I want that to be included in
the commit so say for example we change
both of these files we are in the
modified stage then we say okay we want
to stage these we want to add them to
the staging area okay so both of those
files are in the staging area so that
when we create a commit those files
those changes are going to be committed
and a snapshot of those files is going
to be added into the commit history okay
and the same goes as we make more
commits as we go along so this is how it
works in repositories and by making
commits okay by the way these kind of
stick here that the commits are on this
is what we call a branch and when we
begin a repository in the most basic
form we have one branch which is the
master branch which is this kind of
thing here but in future we're going to
talk about having additional branches
which kind of branch off from the master
and then merge back in at later times
and that's really cool because it means
we can work on new features without ever
altering the master branch code make
sense but don't worry about that too
much for now like I said we're going to
cover all of this later on so anyway
that's the basics of how git works so in
the next tutorial we're now ready to go
ahead and create our very first
