to WordPress lesson and in this video I
want to talk about WordPress is template
hierarchy Wow okay this so we've done
the footer dot PHP and we've got the
headed up PHP of the theme now we have
to start making the different pages okay
and coding the different page templates
that WordPress uses now I've downloaded
this image from the WordPress codex
website and I'll leave a link to that
page down below so you can go and check
it out by the wax it's pretty useful but
basically I just wanted to use this
image to describe to you how WordPress
picks a different template file in the
theme directory depending on which URL
or page you visit okay now typically
speaking these deeper blue page
templates over here come installed or
come with most WordPress themes as
standard right and these ones over here
are custom templates that we can use to
override these ones so basically you've
got all these different kinds of pages
on your WordPress site and the first one
is the archive page we'll start at the
top so an archive page can be either an
author archive a category archive custom
post or taxonomy date archive or tag
archive right so for example we'll start
at the top again author archive you now
say I wrote a lot of posts on this Risto
website now if my author name was net
ninja right then the first template that
WordPress would look for if you clicked
on net ninja would be author - net ninja
PHP and this nice name variable here is
just going to be the author name so I
clicked on net ninja this is gonna be
net net ninja if you clicked on Bob this
is gonna be Bob
alright so whatever the author name is
gonna substitute it there so if it finds
that template file in the WordPress
theme folder then it's going to use that
template file to show that page now in
our theme directory so far we don't have
this we don't at all so what we do is
move on to the next one and then
WordPress would look for author - ID and
that ID variable is the ID of the author
in the WordPress admin area now if I was
the first author to be create
my idea would probably be want so it be
off - one dot PHP so if it finds that
then it used that template file to
display the page now again we don't have
that one so it moves on to the next one
or for PHP so if it finds a 38 speak
then it's just going to use that for the
author archive and again we don't have
that one so it moves on to this one
which we do have archived PHP so then it
shows that or you see that template to
show the author page okay so that's what
we're currently using for our author
archive saying for the category archive
if there is a category for example
called latest news then the first
template is going to look for is
category - slug and this slug is just
the name of the category but it
substitutes spaces and replaces them
with hyphens so if the categories latest
news the slug would be
latest - news so the first template file
WordPress would look for would be
category - latest - news dot PHP and
then it would use that template to
display the latest news category okay so
we don't have this one so then it would
go on to the next one category - ID
again the idea of the category we don't
have this template so then it goes on to
this category dot PHP again we don't
have that template at least I don't
think let's just double check see no we
don't so again it just moves on to the
archive dot PHP which we use for the
category as well so we're currently
using this archive dot PHP to display
all the archives and category archives
right but if we wanted to display a
particular category of posts differently
for example our website come forward
slash category forward slash latest news
and we wanted to display that
differently than all the other category
pages we could use or we could create a
template file called category - latest -
news dot PHP and then make our own
template file for that one category so
it's going to overwrite all the other
files and use that one but if you go on
another category archive it's still
going to use this archive dot PHP all
right make sense
so the same goes for pretty much all of
these here as well we just move along
from left to right depending on which
file that we have okay so the second
type of template I want to talk about is
the singular page and this is actually
split up into two types
you've got the single post page and the
static page and remember these are split
up in the back end of WordPress the
posts are here and the pages are here
now the post will be used for things
like blog posts on news items and the
pages for more permanent features like
and about just page alright so if we
look at these the single post page is
split up into these three different
things you've got attachment posts for
things like image or video pages things
like that custom posts and then blog
post now most of the time it's going to
be this blog post or custom post maybe
and the blog post if we go across here
is going to look for the single - post
up PHP template file now we don't have
that so we look for the single dot PHP
which we do have and that's the template
we're using for the blog posts okay now
the static page type looked for a page
template and that could either be a
custom template or a default template
now I'm not going to talk about this too
much for now maybe later a will but if
it's the default template which is
basically what we're using at the minute
then it's going to look for page - slug
dot PHP so if we had a page called I
don't know hello world then it would be
page - hello - world but PHP we could
make that file in the template sorry in
the theme directory and it would use
that as the template so if it doesn't
find that then it's going to use the
page ID dot PHP I think it doesn't find
out that it's going to fall back to this
page dot PHP okay which we're currently
using for all of our pages now this one
is the site front page and it's going to
look first of all four fronts - page PHP
and we're actually going to make this in
the next tutorial this is why I wanted
to show you this whole image first of
all if it doesn't find that which we
don't currently have then it's going to
look for whether the front page in
WordPress is either set up as a page
or like a static page or to show the
latest posts now if we set up as a
static page it just blows up here and it
carries on the page template hierarchy
if it's the posts then it's going to go
forward and use this home dot PHP
template which we don't actually have
and if you don't have that it's going to
use this index dot PHP template okay now
you'll notice that this index dot PHP
template is like the catch-all if you
can't find any other template file then
it will use this index dot PHP template
so it's really important that you have
one of these in your theme and in
earlier tutorials I've been saying that
this is what we're using for our
homepage and yes is the index dot PHP is
currently showing out homepage but
that's only because we don't have this
one in our theme directory and it's not
set up as a custom page so it's the post
for this court let's settle past so it's
looking for this not finding it and then
using this instead but like I said we're
going to override that in the next
tutorial and we're going to make this
template file so we can have a totally
different template for just our front
page okay so we've also got these ones
down here as well which just lead right
over to these pages there and again
we've got the index dot PHP as a
catch-all so might be a little bit
confusing but just have a look through
this make yourself familiar with it and
the hierarchy that WordPress uses and if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in that very
next tutorial where we're going to make
this front - page naki HP for the home
page of our WordPress website I'll see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
