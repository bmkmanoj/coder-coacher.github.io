36 wjs tutorial and in this video i'm
going to show you how to create a custom
search filter okay then so we've seen
how to use filters to change the display
of data in a browser such as these to
obligate and snippet we learned that in
the last tutorial so wouldn't it be cool
if we could use such a filter to change
the output of these blogs right here for
example it would be nice if we could
have a search box at the top research in
that search box and then it filters out
any blogs which do not contain that
search item alright so some kind of
custom search filter so it would be nice
if we could just come over here and say
okay blogs this is the array of blogs
let's add a filter to this called I
don't know search and then we'll create
that filter so that it only returns to
us the blogs with a specific search term
yeah that would be good but vue.js
doesn't really like this anymore it's a
very bad for performance and it suggests
instead to create custom search filters
using not a filter but instead a
computed property so I'm going to show
you how to do this exactly the same
using a computed property and it's
really quite simple so first of all we
need to add some kind of search field so
that when you use inputs into it we can
search for that term okay so let's come
underneath the h1 and add in an input
which is going to have a type equal to
text and then we want to attach a V
model to this so we can store what's
being typed into this and we'll call
this its search and we'll also add a
placeholder and give this a value equal
to certain blocks okay okay cool so
those are important now we need to
define this property down here on the
object so underneath blogs will say
search and currently let us start off as
an empty string okay so if we save this
now we're going to see this search box
up here at the top but when we type in
nothing happens yet so we want to add
that for
Nancy lamb so how are we going to do
this well we're going to use a computed
property okay
so let's come down here and create a new
computed property it will say down down
compute it and this is going to be an
object and the computed property is
going to be called filtered blogs okay
so it's going to take our current blogs
there which we retrieve right there and
it's going to filter them okay so this
is a function and inside this function
what we want to do is return the
filtered blogs so what we're going to do
is return and it's going to be an array
and we're going to take the current
blocks which is an array so this top
blogs and then we're going to apply the
filter method to them okay and each time
around this takes a blog the single item
in the array so I'll explain this
properly in a minute so now I'm just
going to take that we're going to use a
fat oral function okay and then inside
this function what we're going to do is
return either true or false
so I'll just say return boolean there
right just so we know this has to be
true or false
now let me explain this this filtered
blogs property what we're going to do
eventually is replace blogs with
filtered blogs okay and that filtered
blogs is going to be some kind of
updating array based on the search term
alright so if a certain user searches
for for example this word right here
then every blog with that in its title
is going to be remaining in a blog but
every blog without that in the title is
going to kind of be filtered out with
the blog okay does that make sense so
what we're going to do is eventually
cycle through filters blogs and not just
blogs so this thing down here we're
returning and updated array okay this
return statement here is returning an
array this is going to be an array all
it is is the current blog array with
some stuff filtered out of it that's
what the filter function does okay so it
cycles through the array of same as ten
things in it each time around it's going
to perform this little function right
here for each item and we get the item
that individual item is the blog right
and then inside here we're going to
return true or false for each blog so if
we return true then that
Blagh stays in the array if we return
false that blog is removed from the
array so we want to return a boolean and
to do that we need to determine whether
the search term is in at the blog or
it's not because if it's in the blog
then we're going to return true so it
remains in the array if it's not in the
blog we're going to return false
so it's filtered out of the array okay
so what we're going to do is return blog
that's the current blog right there and
we want the title property to check
whether that search term is in it okay
and then what we're going to do is use
match right there to see if it's got a
particular term in it and the term we're
looking for is this dot search okay
which is this thing right here search so
when a user type something into this
it's going to update the search variable
the search property okay so see that's
like ABC or whatever it updates to ABC
then when it filters through the blog's
we're going to look at each blog in the
title property and this match function
function is going to check whether that
ABC this search is in the title of the
blog if it is then it's going to return
true and it's going to remain in the
array if it's not it's going to return
false and it's going to take it out of
the array make sense okay so now we've
done that we've got this property now
called filtered blogs which we can then
output here instead of blogs okay so
this time it's going to cycle through
filter blocks now to begin with filtered
blogs is just going to be and the blog's
basic liquors we're just looking for an
empty string and everything has got an
empty string in it okay so let's save it
and view in a browser
so to begin with everything there if we
start to add this word Oh see see
a/e okay they're both going in so that's
why both of them have been returned
delete that let's try this one
cue you I and all of these must have qu
I in the title yeah cool so that is how
we create a custom search filter in UGS
using computed properties not filters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
