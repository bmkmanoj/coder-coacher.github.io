first CSS tips and tricks tutorial and
since it's the festive season at all in
this episode I'm going to show you how
we can create some Christmas lights
using only HTML and CSS
alright so quickly just before we start
with the code I am going to be hosting
all of the closed files on this
repository right here CSS tips and
tricks and this could be a separate
branch for each different lesson so
since this is the first one we're going
to choose 0 1 Christmas lights and this
is going to be the end code for that
project okay so you can see all in this
Christmas lights folder just an HTML
file and a styles dot CSS file so you
can go ahead and download that by going
to the appropriate branch so number 1
and then going to clone or download and
download in the zip files ok so just a
quick preview of what we're going to be
making something like this where we've
got these flickering lights at the top
and this text right here which is
actually a Google font which looks quite
christmasing so let us start with the
index file so I'm not going to go
through creating this because it's
really simple all I've done is linked up
a stylesheet in the head which is
linking to this style.css file right
here in fact let me just zoom this dude
right in so we can see ok so this is the
stylesheet were linking to and then
right here this is the link to the
Google font which is outputting this
thing right here so if you just want to
pause the video and paste that in or
just download the files it's already
going to be there for you so in the body
we have this UL with an ID of wire this
represents this wire going across the
top right there
then each li tag represents a different
light bulb that's flickering it right
here so put as many of those in as you
like then this h2 is this mo Christmas
thing right here okay so in the styles
to begin with all I've done is set the
body background and amarjot so we've got
this deep gray background and the margin
of 0 the hates - of styled as well color
of white position:relative just give it
a margin from the top text ally to the
center letter space in not point to M is
just to give us that little spacing in
between the letters font size right
there
is the font-family I've loaded in from
Google Fonts and then this is the text
shadow which is giving it this glow
right here okay so that's all pretty
simple to begin with now what I'm going
to do is save that dude and this should
Auto refresh over here so no hungry have
those light bulbs just these dark black
dots which look nothing like Christmas
lights so let us start how do we do this
well first of all I want to style the
wire ul itself okay
so remember we have that kind of wire
that went from left to right I'm going
to style out first of all so the first
thing I want to do is say hash wire to
grab the ID and then I'm going to say
text-align is going to be Center and
what that's going to do is centralize
all the bulbs so if you've only got four
bulbs it's going to bring them all to
the center okay next thing we want to do
is say whitespace with a hyphen in
between no wrap and then below that I'm
going to say position it's going to be
absolute because we're going to position
this absolutely at the top of the page
we're going to give it no padding we're
going to strip that off completely and
we're going to say the width is 100% of
whatever page it's on so if it's this
big
it's 100% if it's this big it's 100%
then what we're going to do is we want
to take it a little bit up to the top so
we want to take it kind of so it's above
this so we only see the bottom of it if
you like okay so what I'm doing it is
same top - 80 pixels like that right
then I'm going to give the boarder
bottom and a stroke of about 3 pixels or
something like that and that is what
it's going to give us the wire going
across so I'm going to say border -
bottom is 3 pixels solid and then 2 - 2
which is like a dark gray but not quite
as dark as this background which is 1 1
1 all right so if you see now we've got
this line going all the way across like
so okay right then one more thing you
want to do is set a height on this UL
because right now is quite tall and
that's because we've got all the
different elements sitting in it but I
want to set
height of it to about 100 pixels so
we'll say height is 100 pixels save that
and now this should scoot up a little
bit yet so that's where we want our wire
to go okay okay so next thing we need to
do is style all of these Li tags so
we're styling the bulbs in essence so
let us just scoot down here a little bit
and it's wire Li and I'll just give
ourselves a bit more room so we can see
okay so first of all position is going
to be relative and we're using position
relative so that we can nudge it down a
little bit okay because right now is
going to sit within the UL but we need
to know each bulb down a bit so it's
sitting below this wire as if it's
hanging from the wife okay so list-style
is going to be an on or get rid of those
bullets then it will take away any
margin that may be on it and also any
padding it may be on it we're also going
to display each one of these as inline -
block and that will basically sit them
next to each other left to right we're
going to give each one a width and we'll
say that about 15 pixels will also give
each one a height of around 30 pixels so
they're gonna be 30 pixels long coming
down and then 15 pixels wide and we'll
say in fact let's change this margin
from zero to zero and then 15px pixels
the left and right so that's just going
to spread out the bulbs from the left to
the right a little bit okay next I want
to say a border radius and that's going
to be about 50% so that's going to give
us the curvature of those bulbs yeah
then I'll come down and I'll say top
about a hundred and two pixels I'm not
just guessing this I've already done it
previously that's why I'm finna with a
number so specific and it was 102 pixels
so that's again going to bring those
bulbs down for us okay then after top we
want to say the animation details now
we've not created the animation
so we'll just leave a comment instead
which says animation stuff here okay
so well do the animation is later for
now let's just give this a background
color so we can see these dudes on the
screen so we'll say background and we'll
just say F F F which is white so I'm
going to save that and now we can see
those things right there and the reason
we've not got a border radius is because
I've called it nor the radius so let's
change that to a B and now we see those
bulbs so they're taking shape now right
so ideally what we want is for these to
glow in and out and we want them to fade
so we want the opacity to change from
one to maybe not point two we want them
to go darker as well so the two
different properties we're going to
animate right here is the opacity of
each li element and then we're also
going to give each of the bulbs a
different box shadow and that box shadow
is going to represent the glow and
that's going to glow in and out as well
okay so the next thing I want to do is
create those animations so I'm going to
come down here and I'm going to say at
keyframes by the way if you don't know
what CSS animations are I've got a whole
series on CSN emotions where I take from
beginner to ninja I'll leave the links
to that down below so you can have a
look at that so we give this a name this
animation which is going to be called
even flushed and the reason it's called
even a flash is because it's going to
flash every even element in the list and
we're going to create an odd flash later
but for now this even flash is going to
do everything okay so this even flash
animation what do we want to put inside
well first of all we want to say well at
0% we want to say what the state of this
animation is going to be and the state
is going to have those two properties
the background color and also the box
shadow so with the background first of
all is going to be RGB a and I've done
RGB a so that we can add an alpha
channel on the end which controls the
opacity of that background because I
said we're going to animate the opacity
if you like all the color of the bulb so
the color I've chosen was this one right
here two five five then two thirty then
sixty-five
and then the alpha channel is going to
be one that means it's fully visible
okay so that's the first property the
second one is going to be the Box shadow
this is going to be zero pixels two
pixels 20 pixels and four pixels and
then rgba this is also going to be the
color of the glow if you like around it
this is going to be exactly the same as
this dude right here so the glow and the
background are going to be similar okay
so that's the state of this animation at
0% now when it gets halfway through the
animation at 50% we want to reduce this
right here so that it's not as a glowy
or not as bold okay so let us now come
down here and say 50% and I'm going to
paste these two things right here
in here and I'm just going to change
this number to 0.5 and this number to
0.3 so what we're doing is just reducing
the opacity of these colors so it goes
darker so it's blowing from Bright to
dark okay so what 100% we want it to go
back to bright again because it starts
off bright goes dark halfway through and
then at 100% goes bright again now
instead of writing 100% down here like
this all we need to do is tack it on to
this thing right here because it's going
to use exactly the same properties as
this okay so now we've created that
animation we can add this animation
right here on this element so how do we
do that well first of all we're going to
say animation - name and this is this
thing right here even flash so I'll say
even flash that's the animation name
then after that I want to say animation
duration and this is going to be about
one second so every one second it's
going to flash then after that I want to
say animation - iteration - count and
this is going to be infinite
so this is how many times the animation
is going to continue fall and then I'm
going to say animation - Phil - mode and
I'm going to set this to both which is
basically going to extend the animation
once it's finished we kind of loop it if
you like almost so I'm going to save
this and let's view it in a browser now
and now we have that animation going on
that was pretty cool so far but it's all
one color at the minute what we'd like
is for every other light bulb to be a
different color so this is where we can
say wire Li enth
child and then specify pod so this is
going to grab every odd Li and then we
can say animation - name and this is
going to be odd - flash now we've not
got that just yet but all we need to do
is copy this and paste it down below
change this to odd and then what I'll do
now is add in some different colors so
the color I've chosen for the second
bulb is kind of like a pinky color and I
wanted to do is change this middle one
to 65 and then this last one to 185 so
let's copy that and paste it in each one
of these like so and then save it once
we're done and check this out now now we
have the two different colors which
looks pretty cool now this is good but I
want to give it more of a twinkle effect
where say the light ones glow and the
pink ones fade and vice versa after it's
finished
so the way we can do that is by
exchanging this with 50% okay so at 0
and 100% they're going to be faint and
halfway three of they're going to be
bright so let's save that now let's
check this out now it's got more of a
twinkle effect that is pretty cool so
this is pretty much done just one more
thing to do and that is to add on the
little caps at the top of these bulbs to
make it look a little bit more realistic
as though the wire is attached to the
bulb itself and the bulbs are just
floating near the white
so to do that we're going to comment
down here and we're going to say Wyatt
Li then pseudo-class before and this is
going to inject some content before the
Li tag if you like or at the beginning
of it and the content is just going to
be empty but this means we can stay all
that little bit before the Li so we want
to say position:absolute and by the way
if you want to learn more about pseudo
classes check out my CSS for beginners
tutorial series I'll leave the link to
that down below as well so
position:absolute the width is going to
be around 14 pixels height about 10
pixels then the border radius is going
to be about 4 pixels the top we're going
to shift it up a little bit so it's at
the top of the ball and that's going to
be around minus 5 pixels - because we're
going up okay left is going to be zero
and then the background color is going
to be about four four four which is kind
of like a lighter gray so there we go
again a spot border-radius incorrectly
so let's change that and this should now
work and there we go wallah now we have
our lights like so and like I said you
can add as many of these lights as you
like so if we go into the index and add
more lights let's see what that looks
like save it and check it out this time
to extend almost all the way across
let's just add one more batch come down
here paste in save and check that out
there we go we have our Christmas lights
