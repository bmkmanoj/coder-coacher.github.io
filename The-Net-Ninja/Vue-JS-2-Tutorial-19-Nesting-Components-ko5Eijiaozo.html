19th of UGS tutorial and in this video i
want to show you how to create new
components and then import and mess them
into other components ok so in the last
tutorial I showed you that root
component called app top view and this
is the mother of all components it sits
at the very top of the application and
controls the entire thing now if we
wanted to we could create all of our
template codes within that one component
and then just output that to the browser
but typically for larger applications
what we do is split our code up into
different components and then just use
those components to show them to the
browser when we need them for example we
could have a header component an article
component and a footer component and
then we connect those components in the
route component likewise we could also
have a login component and a link
component and then nest those in the
header component so these can go as many
levels beat as you like so why would we
do things this way
well imagine we have an article
component which is used in different
sections of the website now rather than
code that may be four or five times in
different areas of the website which is
code it once in its own component and
then nest it four or five times wherever
it's needed okay so this is that root
component app top view that we looked at
in the last tutorial now before we do
anything with a new component I just
want to make some small edits to this
I'm going to get rid of this function
right here greeting and also the method
two down here we don't need those
anymore make sure to get rid of that
comment as well then we'll change the
title to ninja app okay let's say that
now we want to create a new component so
I'm going to create this in the source
folder so I'll right-click new file and
I'm going to call this ninjas dot review
so it's a dot view file whenever we want
to create one of these new components
all right now I'm just going to copy all
of this and paste it because I'm super
lazy and this time the template is going
to be a UL an insert if ul we want an li
tag
what I want to do inside this Li tag is
cycle through a rate of ninjas and just
output the name of each ninja so in the
data we'll get rid of the title and
we'll replace this with ninjas which is
going to be an array and inside this
array we're going to have some names of
ninjas so Joshy Mario I realized these
are just Mario characters but what the
hell and we'll just go with and one ok
so now we want to use reform and we've
already seen this to cycle through these
ninjas and output the name of each one
to the browser so we say ninja in ninjas
and then we can access that ninja
variable output the current ninja so
let's save that now and this is the
component we want to now import and nest
into this component now when we nest in
components first of all we have to
register the component for use now we
can do that to raise and a globally or
locally now if we register the component
globally that means that we can use that
component in any other component we can
nest it in any other component if we
register it locally then it means we can
only use that component and nest it in
the component we register it locally
with so I'm going to show you both ways
and they're both very simple so first of
all global it if we want to register it
globally we want to go to the main Jas
file and we want to register it right
here so the way we do this is by saying
of U dot components this is how we
create a component right and then we
want a name of this component so we'll
give it a name of ninjas and then also
we want to say the object that we need
for this component now we want this
object that we just created right here
right and this template so what we need
to do is import this file first of all
into this main GIS so I'm just going to
copy that and paste it down here and
we'll call this import ninjas from
forward slash ninjas W and then the
object that we want to place here is
ninjas this thing right here that we're
exporting right because right here we're
exporting by default this object
so we can then import it right here and
then place the object there okay
so we've now registered this component
globally and now if we wanted to we
could go into our apt of view and we
could miss that right here so that's
what I'm going to do I'm just going to
nest that component and it's called
ninjas and it's called ninjas because
that's how we registered it in the main
KS as the name we gave it there so we
can now nest it like that just in a
hecht ml type tag with the name of the
component and then this component is
going to be output or right here within
the root component so ever save this now
check it out on the browser hopefully
this will work
yep we can see that component now is
nested in the root component pretty cool
right so that's how we nest something
globally however what if we just want to
nest that component locally so we only
want to nest it within this we're
component and not any other components
that we're going to be making it in the
future well I'll show you how to do that
as well so first of all let's go to main
Jas and delete this stuff right here we
don't have register it global anymore
this time we're just going to register
it for this components freaking use it
in this file and nowhere else okay so
first of all again we do need to import
so I'm just going to paste this again
and we want it ninjas and again it's the
current directory and then ninjas W and
then what we need to do inside this
object is register that component right
here and we can do that by same
components and then this takes an object
and inside this object we can say which
components we want the self the name of
the component which is going to be
ninjas that's this thing right here
looks like when we register the
component would give it a name that's
going to be the name right here and then
go on and it's going to be this thing
that we want the object to be the
component
okay so we'll paste it right there save
it and also we want to comment out save
it and this should still work yep it
does cool so now we've seen how to
register a component globally and
locally and how we can nest components
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
