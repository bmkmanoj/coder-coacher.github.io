your very last jQuery for beginners
lesson and in this video I want to talk
about what kind of things you want to be
looking at next Wow or I think gang so
the first thing I suggest you take a
look at is jQuery UI and UI just stands
for user interface now this gives us
lots of tools to help us easily make
improvements to use interactions it's
great for desktop great for mobile apps
and websites alike now the kind of
things we can do with this make date
pick is really easy for forms make
draggable elements sort of all elements
resizable elements plus loads and more
cool stuff so yeah I'll leave a link to
that website down below so you can go
there and check that out and also guys
stay tuned for a playlist coming up on
this channel soon for jQuery UI also the
next thing I suggest you do is just get
out there and experiment with jQuery
yourself to create some new cool
interactivity on your web pages the kind
of things you want to be looking at are
sliders tooltips expandable lists image
galleries all the kind of things you're
going to find on modern websites now
everything I've taught you in this
series so far can be put together to
create these kind of things so your
knowledge level right now is good enough
to do this however I will be doing a
playlist called jQuery projects or
something similar in the very near
future I'm going to upload to that a
regularly with a new project each time
and I'm going to be covering all of
these four things plus all this so yes
stay tuned for that awesome another
thing we could look at is Ajax and Ajax
just stands for asynchronous JavaScript
and XML and it's a way to communicate
with a server load data into your web
page without refreshing so it's just
better for the user because we'd have to
load everything again and a couple of
places you may have seen this is on
Google Maps yeah you search for an area
and it throws up a map that's
communicating with the server to grab
that information initially now when you
scroll on that map you know when you
click down and move the map from left to
right it has to reload that image right
so it's communicating with the server
and getting the data to reload that
image without actually refreshing the
page that is Ajax in action right
another example could be traffic update
websites where
every minute or so it just posts a new
update without refreshing the page so
yeah this is a really cool thing and
jQuery provides a cool toolset to make
working with Ajax really really simple
so what I'm going to do in the future is
first of all make an AJAX tutorial
series for JavaScript that's vanilla
JavaScript and then I'm going to compare
that with jQuery and Ajax to show you
how much easier this is okay so we're
gonna do some cool projects with Ajax as
well in the future and finally we're
going to take a look at jQuery plugins
in the future as well and I suggest you
go out there and just search google for
some cool plugins there's absolutely
thousands of them out there not all
great but there's some really good ones
things for creating image sliders
galleries loads of different things so
yeah have a look around and in the
future like I say I'm going to take a
look at them as well showcase some
really good ones on this channel as well
as do a few tutorials on how to create
your own plugins for jQuery and
distribute them yourself so I hope
you've enjoyed this playlist guys and
you've learned something if you've not
do tell me and I will make improvements
but it would be great to get your
feedback and the kind of things that
you'd like to learn in the future also
so thanks again for watching guys don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you in
a very next playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
