tutorial where we're gonna take a look
at mobile app ass alright guys so this
is where we ended up in our last lesson
we did our navigation and we added this
title here and these buttons right here
so it's all working pretty cool and by
the way we've done know CSS ourselves so
far bootstraps taken care of all that
forward just by adding a few classes so
that's pretty cool so this looks alright
a desktop and kind of iPad sizes but
when we get down to mobile sizes which
is the extra small viewport size it's
gonna look like this bootstrap is going
to stack the links on top of each other
and it's gonna go full width like that
now these looks alright but if you're
viewing a site in a mobile you really
don't want all this space taken all by
your navigation at the top ideally what
you want is some little bar at the top
and buttons that when you click it opens
and closes this navigation right and we
can do that in bootstrap pretty easily
and yeah I'll go throw a few more
classes out here and it is pretty
difficult to remember all these
especially when they're quite similar
look I had to look up these before it
did these tutorials because I don't
remember them all that's a refresh my
memory and you know I know that you guys
are gonna have to do the same thing too
but all you need to do is make a quick
cheat sheet for yourself I'll just take
a look at the bootstrap documentation
there simple so what do we need to do
well the first thing we need to do is
enclose everything that we want to be in
the drop-down menu within a div now the
things that we want to be in the
drop-down menu these links right here
yeah in the UL and these buttons so we
want all of this enclosed within a div
so let's make that deal now oops
hopefully your typing is a bit better
than mine and take the closing tag and
put that all right at the bottom over
here I'm just gonna move these in a
little bit like that
ok now we need to add these classes to
this D if there's two classes we need to
up the first class is just collapse all
right under the second class is just
navbar - collapse now it's just one of
those things you just have to remember
them or just look them up when the time
comes to making an app but that's it
simple as guys now there's one more
thing we need to do with this thing
that's to give it an ID this ID can be
whatever you want it to be
but I suggest make it quite semantic I'm
just gonna call it my drop-down
something like that okay but you might
want to call it something better now
this can be anything you want it's gonna
be unique to this kind of menu right
here and we are going to use it we're
gonna reference it later and when we
make our book and in fact we're gonna do
that right now so let's make a button
and this button needs to go in the nav
bar header and this is the bottom that
the user is going to click to open and
close the menu so let's write that
button and we also need to give this a
couple of places of the zoo the first
class is just nav bar
- toggle and the second class is
collapse like that okay we need to do
two more things we need to do two more
attributes the first one is data - oops
toggle like that and we set that equal
to collapse and then the second
attribute is data
- target and this is where we're going
to specify which menu we want to control
with this button now it's this one right
here and remember we gave it an ID all
right so we take the ID and we put it in
here but be careful because we also have
to put the little hash or pound symbol
however you want to call a thing in
front of it right there okay otherwise
it won't work okay so now that's done
there's just one more thing to do and
that is to make the icon for the little
button now this at the minute would just
be an empty button we've not put
anything in it on mobiles you typically
see three little bars as the button to
open and close a menu and we can add
this in really easily using bootstraps
icon classes so I'm just gonna do a span
here and give it a class equal to icon -
bar and that makes one single bar now we
need three of these so let's copy and
paste this three points just like that
and I think that should be it guys so
let's take a look at this now in the
browser this is what it looks like
without all that jazz when i refresh we
get this little burger at the top these
three lines here the span types we just
added in we've still got the title there
in the header as well these two
you remember the Nath by Fedder when we
click on this zooms down and shows us
all of those things right here we might
want to style this a bit differently in
our own CSS we can override any kind of
bootstrap styles and ourselves but then
we click it against closet all right so
that looks now a lot better than it was
before it doesn't take up as much room
here at the top and they're just a bit
better for mobiles so there we go guys
and that is how we make using bootstrap
a mobile drop-down menu and I think
you'll agree it's a lot easier than
adding in our own JavaScript and things
like that these took me what less than 5
minutes to do that
the only thing I don't like about this
is that we have to use a lot of classes
and they're not all really semantic all
of the time so it depends what you want
to go for if you want to make something
quickly then boot shop is really good
for that just to get prototypes up and
running sometimes when I'm making a
client website and it's quite high-end
or something like that I would typically
do a custom drop-down menu using my own
JavaScript and whatnot my own elements
just to make it a little bit more
semantic and less bloated but the choice
is entirely yours any questions put them
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to subscribe share and like it all that
jazz and I'll see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
