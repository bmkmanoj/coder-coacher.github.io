nodejs tutorial and in this video we're
going to have a quick introduction to X
brace okay then so Express is one of the
most popular node packages on the
Internet and that is for good reason
first of all it has a really easy and
flexible routing system we can use
secondly it integrates with many
templating engines really easily which
is great when it comes to crafting front
ends to our applications and thirdly it
contains a middleware framework which
other node packages can plug right into
and extend and we're going to take a
look at all of these three things as we
work our way through this playlist so
let's take a quick look and Express in
action
okay then gang so I'm backing up KS but
as you can see I've deleted all of the
code in here and that's because we're
going to start afresh with Express and
we're going to create an Express up so
I've already installed Express a couple
of tutorials back but if you've not done
so already all you have to do is come to
the terminal type NPM install Express
and then if you want to save this in
your package JSON file as a dependency
go ahead and do - save then click enter
that's going to install it for you I've
already done it so then when you've
installed it it's going to appear in
your node modules down here somewhere
there we go Express cool so the first
thing we need to do to use Express is to
require it in our code because at the
end of the day Express is just a module
written in JavaScript which we can use
in our application so we know how to do
now we just say var and we'll call this
variable Express I set it equal to
require and then in here pop the module
name which is expressed and nodejs is
clever enough to go out and grab that
module and return it to us right here
okay so we now have access to this
module but what we need to do first is
sell what's commonly known as an express
app and that way we get access to all of
the functionality that Express comes
baked with now to do that we just store
in a variable and commonly it's called
app then we set this equal to Express
and then fire it because what returns
was
to all the exports in this module is a
function so we go ahead and fire that
function right here and then we have
access on this variable to all of those
different methods on Express which help
us with things like routing or setting
up template engines okay so we also need
to listen to a port much like we did
before so to do this in Express we just
say up don't listen and then we give it
a port number now I'm going to say 3000
so now when listening to port 3000 so in
this console file we have our Express
app running right there
and now we're listening to a poor but
how do we respond to requests well when
we set up this app variable we're given
access to a variety of methods on it
that can help us respond to requests and
these methods all correspond to the
types of requests being made there
what's known as HTTP verbs or methods so
HTTP methods are essentially the kind of
requests we make for example a get
request which is what we made when we
type a URL into an address bar or a post
request which is generally made when we
post some data to a server forearm sale
web form or a delete request or a put
request these are all different HTTP
methods or verbs and they're the type of
request that we make now there's nothing
actually that's special about these
different request methods they're all
just requests working in the same way as
each other it's just that each different
type of request contains a specific
piece of information attached to it to
say to the server what kind of request
it is then it's up to the server to look
at what type of request it is and then
treat that type of request in a
particular way however it seems to fit
so by using expressing node we can
respond to each of these different types
of requests very easily and the way we
do that is by using the methods that
express provides us with so to respond
to get requests we use the app get
method then we pop a routing or fire a
function
we get that request same for post it's
just up top post and Fedeli up delete
and so forth so for now what we're going
to do is just stick to these get
requests because this is what we've been
doing so far type in a URL into the
address bar and then getting something
back from the server and then get
request so that's what we're going to
take a look at for now and we are going
to look at these other methods later in
the playlist so we're listening to a
port now and we want to respond to a get
request and we've seen that we can do
that by saying app get ok and then the
first thing we pop in here is the route
what is a user going to type in so that
we can respond in this particular way
and for now let's just do forward slash
and then we're going to apply a function
when a user requests this when they go
to just the root directory and again
this takes the request object and the
response object as well but Express has
extended these objects and added
additional functionality to them so
anyway when a user goes to this address
just forward slash it's going to fire
this function right here and we can
respond to it in a particular way and
what I'm going to do for now is just
send a string so I can say response not
send and then we'll just send it a
string and we'll say this is the home
page ok cool so now if we run this and
I'm going to use node 1 to run it
we install that in the last tutorial so
node Mart app KS if we run this now then
view it in a browser I'm just going to
go to forward slash here then we're
going to get this string back so Express
has listened for this get request right
here and then when it receives that
request is firing this function and then
on the response object
it's saying dot send this is an express
method and is sending a string and
notice we've not specified the content
type here in the headers Express is
clever enough to figure out what this is
and do it for us okay
so let's set up another run
let's copy that dude paste it down here
and this time we'll say forward slash
contact and we'll say this is the
contact page save that and then let's go
to forward slash contact and now we get
this is the contact page pretty cool
right so you can see how much easier
this is to set up a routes than it was
before when we didn't use Express and
don't worry for now about just sending
strings we're going to look at sending
HTML pages later on and other things
like JSON for now I just want to show
you the bare bones of how Express is
working so we require it first of all
the module then we set up our Express
app by same app equals Express and
firing the function then we listen to a
port 3000 by same app dot listen and
then we set up our routes by saying app
get and these are responding to get
requests and we responded to the forward
slash request and then the follow slash
contact request when we did that we find
these functions which take these
requests and response object extended by
Express and we use the send method on
the response object to send a string and
express identify that this was a string
there was no need for us to type in the
content type okay then guys so that's
your quick introduction to Express we
are going to take this much further over
the course of the next few lessons so if
you have any questions so far leave
those down below otherwise don't forget
to share subscribe and like guys and I'm
going to see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
