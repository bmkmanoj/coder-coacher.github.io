CSS for beginners
lesson 13 and we're going to talk about
the important declaration ah
all right there so we're here back in
the HTML file and I've ripped out all
the Styles we've used so far so we've
got a blank canvas again so what is the
important declaration well essentially
it's a tool we used within CSS conflicts
to make a property important and by that
it means that nothing else can override
it even if you have a conflict within a
rule that's more specific if you've got
this important declaration within your
original rule it can't be overridden
okay so the best way to show you how
this works is by using an example so
we're going to go after these P tags
again and I'm going to do a couple of
rules the first one I'm going to do is
just a simple piece elector I'm going to
say yo color these all red and then
under this I'm gonna do another selector
within the main idea main content P tags
I'm going to say Chloe's Bree
alright so by now you should know what's
going to happen okay in both counts this
one's gonna win and by both counts I
mean firstly it's more specific and
secondly it's lower down in the Cascade
so it's gonna overwrite this one anyway
okay so we should see these P tags here
being green this one will still be red
put these green but let's just save this
and view it in the browser just to make
sure we'll open this in Google Chrome
and you know there we go there's the
other P tags within the div with an ID
of main content and that's the one
outside that date for still written so
now then what if we wanted these P tags
to be read no matter what you want to
say to the CSS look no matter what or
the rule tries to override this I always
want the color of P tags to be red now
if you're dead certain of that you can
use the important declaration that's
what it's here for
and the way we do this is by putting a
space after our value red and then we
open the important declaration with an
exclamation mark that kind of says
doesn't it well this is really important
then we just write out important and now
that's saying to the browser hey browser
lock right no matter what happens I
always want these P tags to be read in
color
he's very important that's what it's
saying so this now even though it's more
specific and it's lower down in the
Cascade it's no longer going to
overwrite this property because this
property has been classified now as
important so let's have a view of that
I'll save it once again and open this up
in a google chrome and there you go
you've you've got all your three
paragraph tags all read now so that's
the important declaration in play now I
will say to you err on the side of
caution when it comes to this important
declaration because new designers and
new coders have a tendency to use it all
the time when they can't figure out
what's going on with their conflicts
that's a bad thing to do if I was you
I'd concentrate more on resolving
conflicts naturally by that I mean
scrolling through your CSS and finding
out why the conflicts are taking place
it may be rearranged where you need to
or rewrite your selectors rather than
use this important declaration and the
reason being is it's not a quick fix ok
you might think it is you might think oh
I can't be bothered scrolling through
all the CSS looking for these selectors
and rearranging things you might think
you can just put this important
declaration on the end of this property
and it's going to work hallelujah and
yes it will but that's not what it's
intended for and imagine this you've got
a big CSS file and through well
developing it you've splashed this
important tag around willy nilly
everywhere and you've got maybe a
hundred important declarations in your
CSS file now when you start to get more
and more conflicts it's gonna get more
complex because you no longer just taken
into account the specific especially
fits here there's 10 word again of the
selector but you oh you're also taking
into account the the important
declaration and if there's quite a lot
of them and it's gonna get pretty tricky
because you don't know what's important
what's not and you might be thinking
well do I need to make this important do
or not is it to do with the selector is
it to do the important tag and it gets
really messy really quickly it's going
to be really high
for you to update in the future so I
would definitely err on the side of
caution when it comes to using this
important tag me in my entire career as
a front-end web developer in commercial
projects I probably needed to use this
important declaration maybe and up five
times maximum okay and the reason I've
used it is for very very specific rules
where I don't want any user agents tashi
or anything like that to override my
rule okay so the very specific ones that
I know we're never gonna change so feel
free to use it it's there to be used
don't use it too often okay don't get
into that habit anyway that about covers
it for the important declaration and
conflicts in general if you have any
questions feel free to comment below I'm
going to answer all of those as soon as
I can if you like these videos please
