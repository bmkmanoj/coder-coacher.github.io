JavaScript for beginners a lesson 44 and
in this video I want to go through a
very simple form validation script ah or
anything Gong so I've got exactly the
same form up here in the HTML as the
last lesson which is this thing right
over here I've just added an empty div
at the bottom and that's got ID of
message now I want to create a really
really simple form validation script
which is going to check when someone
clicks submit whether a name has been
entered all right now it's not that hard
to do this but again this is a very
simple validation script when you're
doing validation for real you're going
to want to dive a lot deeper but because
this is a beginners course I want to
start off lightly there is going to be a
whole playlist on forums in the future
so stay tuned for that this is just an
introduction all right there so let's
jump over to this test j/s and start
writing some code first thing I want to
do is put my own form in a variable so
we'll create a variable called my form
just like we did in the last lesson and
we'll set this equal to document dot
forms and then remember from that we can
grab the my form form right here by
using this name alright so we'll say dot
my fault
and then that stores the form in this
variable now I want to create a second
variable called message and that's going
to grab holder the element right here
called message because we're going to
update this with an error message if a
user fails to put in a name so we'll say
document dot get element by ID and then
the ID is message all right cool so
we've got those two variables now I want
to introduce you to the on submit event
now the on submit event is the event
which occurs when you click Submit all
right so normally what would happen is
when you click Submit it would
communicate with the server and do some
kind of a server-side validation and
then return back a result now we can
interrupt this process using the on
submit event do some kind of client-side
validation right here in the browser
with JavaScript and
if it's not to our liking we don't have
to send it to the server so we save all
that time all that communication all
right so let's do that let's say my form
dot on submit and notice the on submit
method is on my form not the submit
button itself all right that's important
and we set that equal to a function and
inside this function is where we're
going to do a little bit of checking
right and I want to make sure that
something has been entered into here so
basically I want to say if this is empty
then I'm going to throw up an error
message if it's not empty then I'll
return true and the form can process all
right then so we'll say if my form dot
name because that's the name of this
input field here don't value is equal to
an empty string meaning there's nothing
in it then I'm going to throw up an
error message and the message dot
innerhtml
that's this element right here will sit
in the inner HTML to be please enter a
name all right else then we can say
message dot inner whoops inner HTML to
equal nothing alright because if they do
it incorrectly once then it's going to
throw up the error message here then if
they click it again we want the error
message to disappear because they've
done it correctly this time once they've
put a name in all right so we're getting
rid of that error message now there's a
little bit more to this I need to do
something right here which means we're
going to stop that form from being
submitted and the way we do this is by
returning a value and we saw in
functions how we can return values in
this case we're going to return false
and that will just say hey nope they've
done something wrong I don't want this
form to be submitted we can save time
communicating with the server all right
right here I'm just going to return true
to say oops which would return true to
say yeah everything's hunky-dory go
ahead and commune
the server submit this form all right so
let's save that now and refresh over
here and what I'll do is submit without
entering anything here and you'll see we
get the error message now if I say ninja
and then submit now the error message
goes away and the form is submitted
awesome alright guys so that is a really
really really simple form and validation
like I say it goes a lot deeper than
this and the good news is html5 helps
out a lot with it however I'm not going
to go into too much detail now about
that like I say I'm gonna do a whole
playlist on farms in the future
validation html5 all that jazz so if you
want to watch that stay tuned it's
coming pretty soon otherwise guys if you
