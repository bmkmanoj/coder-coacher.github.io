CSS positioning lesson 7 and today I
want to show you how to create text
columns without using floats Wow other
than guys so I'm exactly where I left
off in the last tutorial and in this
video I want to show you how we can
create text columns without using floats
and it's a really neat little technique
that we can use and it's really simple
to pull off so what I'm going to do is
focus on this content right here okay
and we know that that content is within
the content div there and it's the P tag
that I want to split into columns so
what I'm going to do is come under the
content rule right there and save
content P and then we need to specify
the column properties now there's a few
different column properties and they're
still not fully supported in all
browsers so we may have to use vendor
prefixes in some cases this is Google
Chrome so I'm going to use the WebKit
vendor prefix now if you don't know what
they are feel free to check out the
video in my CSS for beginners course
I'll leave a link to that down below so
I'm going to say - WebKit - and then the
first property I want to show you is the
column - count property and this is
saying how many columns we want to split
this content up to now if we want we can
have two if we want we can have 20 but
it gets a little bit unreadable where we
have 20 so I'm just going to stick with
3 for this example so now we've got 3
columns right here what I'm going to do
is just get this and copy it and paste
it underneath silver for browsers that
do support the property we've got it
there as well all right there so the
next thing I want to do is specify the
gap in between the columns alright and
we can do that again using the WebKit
prefix and then the column oops I
spelled that wrong yet column - gap
property I'm going to set this equal to
50 pixels so now you can see it's just
widen that gap a little bit awesome same
again I'm just going to copy this for
consistency and paste it underneath
alright the next thing I want to show
you is the column rule property so again
webkit - column - rule and the rule is
basically going to put a line in between
each column like that kind of splits it
up a little bit I quite like it
so with this property we need to specify
three values first of all the real width
and I'm just going to set that to one
pixel then the type of rule so dotted or
dashed I'm going to say solid and then
finally we need to give it a color and
I'm going to say CCC which is like a
medium gray all right so now you can see
that rule in between those elements
right there up in between those columns
rather cool now I'll do the same there
just copy and paste that underneath and
then finally I'm just going to justify
that text so when I say text align
justify and it just makes it look a
little neater awesome so there we go
guys there are our three columns and
we've done that with one rule right here
with a few different properties dead
simple no floats whatsoever that we need
to worry about and a dead quick so yeah
we have any questions whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
