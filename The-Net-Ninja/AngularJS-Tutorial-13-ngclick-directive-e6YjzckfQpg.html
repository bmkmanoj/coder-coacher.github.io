13th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at the
ng-click directive ah okay then guys so
the ng-click directive is really cool
and it allows us to respond to click
events from the user on elements so I'll
say for example a user clicks a bullet
we could attach the ng click directive
to that button and then respond to that
click in some way I'll run it okay
so we're going to take a look at that in
this tutorial and to do so we're going
to work through an example whereby we're
going to give the user the option to
order these ninjas by their name which
it currently is being by default or by
another property and that are the
property we're going to allow them to
order by is the belt and it's going to
be in alphabetical order by belt
alright so to do that what we need to do
is create two buttons one button is
going to order the list by name one
button is going to order the list by the
belt all right so let's go ahead and add
these buttons in our controller right
here
just going to come to the top of the
controller and I'm going to cry create a
button and this is going to have an
ng-click attribute associate to it I'm
not going to fill this in just yet we'll
come to that in a minute but in the
button I'll write order by name so
that's the button they're going to click
if they want to order it by name then
we'll do another button and this time
it's going to say order by belt so
that's going to order it by the belt
color now currently like we said these
ninjas are all being ordered by the name
property and we're passing that name
property through to this order by filter
in this string so what's happening is
angular is finding that name property in
the string then it's locking in our
controller for this name in the data
right there it finds it and it's
ordering it by the name now we want this
string here to change dynamically from
name to belt depending on what button
the user clicks so what we'll do is
instead of having name here
we'll just pass through a variable and
what Karger call this order right so
that order is a variable and we've not
put that in quotes because the variable
is going to be a string which is already
going to be in quotes so how do we pass
through that order variable well we're
going to do it on the ng-click
event so when someone clicks this button
what we want to do is set this order
variable to be equal to name and when
someone clicks on this button what we
want to do is set this order variable to
equal this belt okay so let's do that
all we need to do is say order that
variable is equal to and then we have to
pass it through in single quotations
because that's what it's expecting right
there and then we'll say name so now
when someone clicks this name button
it's going to set this variable equal to
this string and then this string is
being passed through there so it's going
to order all those ninjas by name okay
if you click this one we want to set
order to belt so let's do that
order equals belt and now when the user
clicks this button belt is going to be
in this variable pass through here and
it's going to order the ninjas by belt
color all right
but we also want the belts to appear on
the screen currently they're not doing
it's just this thing right here so what
I'll do is I'll wrap this in h3 first of
all like that and then I'll put another
h3 closing tag there then what I'll do
is I'll just create a span tag down here
and I'm going to output ninja belt and
that's going to be the color of the belt
so it's going to output like green or
black or yellow or whatever then I'll do
a space and I'll say belt so it's going
to be the color in belt for example
black belt green belt okay so let's save
this now take a look in the browser you
can see we get the green belt yellow
belt black belt thing right there that's
this stuff out put in it and we've got
these two buttons order by name and
order by belt so when we click this it
should order them by name alphabetically
which it does pretty cool and when we
click this it should order by belt
alphabetically which it does bgy
pretty cool right no that was a
pretty simple example of using ng-click
we can do things that are more complex
with it and we can interact with the
controller to implement that more
complex functionality so I'm going to go
through another example now which is
going to demonstrate that and this time
around what I want to do is add some
kind of cross in here so that if you
don't like the look of a ninja you can
be like Matt click the cross and it
deletes them from the list
ok so let's add in that functionality
the first thing I want to do is add in
that cross over here so that someone can
click it off so to do that I'll just
come under here into this h3 and I'll
just do a div with an ng-click and we're
going to come back to this in a bit and
passing that functionality later but for
now we're just going to pass in this
cross right hit and we'll save it and
there you'll see this cross now I'm
going to give this a class equal to
remove like that save it again and
hopefully this should be yeah viewed a
little bit now this is the CSS in action
which I did before and like so you can
download that from github the links down
below ok so now the cross is there we
want this to remove whatever is here if
we click it ok but before we do that I
just want to tidy this up a little bit
this little section ok now you've seen
how we can use expressions there to
output data but we can also use
expressions in the tag themselves in
other things so for example I can do
span and then I'll do style equals I'll
do background and then I'm going to do a
expression right here which is going to
be the ninja belt and that's going to
pass in a color
don't forget right here yeah so if it's
green is going to style this green this
background here ok so I save it and see
what happens
that's pretty cool right so now we've
got some kind of visual effect going on
as well which shows the color of the
belt now I'm also going to give this a
class and that's going to be equal to
belt and again this is coming from this
tablet CSS that are made beforehand so
let's save that see how it looks
boom pretty good right
except okay you can barely see this so
we might have to tweak our styles at
some point but for now it will do so
let's add in this functionality that so
when we click this we want to fire off a
function which is going to remove this
ninja right so we need to hook up that
functionality right here we need to pass
a function through for this to fire when
someone clicks it and the way we do that
is just by saying the function name
right here so we'll call that function
remove ninja okay and we invoke that
function by using the brackets so let's
save that currently nothing is going to
happen if we click this because we don't
have this function anywhere so where do
we define that function we define it on
the sculpt object in our controller okay
so let's come above here and let's just
make this function so we'll say scope
and then we'll say remove ninja right
we'll set that equal to a function like
that and what we're going to do is we're
going to pass the ninja through into
this function okay now then where are we
getting that ninja from well we can pass
it through right here because we've got
access to this ninja object okay
so let's pop it in there so that's going
to tell the controller right here which
ninja we're currently on because each
time we output an ally we're going
through a certain ninja okay
so every time this is output ninja
equals to the current object that has
been output so we're passing through
that object right there into the
controller so I'll save that go back
into the controller and then in here
we'll add in that functionality so what
do we need to do well the first thing
I'm going to do is create a variable and
I'm going to say that variable is the
removed ninja and I'm going to set that
equal to sculpt dots Ninja dot ninjas
rather which is here I'm going to
reference that and then I'm going to use
a JavaScript function called index of
okay and what this does it will find the
index off if I pass through ninja which
is this thing passed through towards
there if I pass that into in deck
12 is going to look for the index of
that ninja on this scope object okay so
if it's the this one right here it will
come back and say look it's in position
2 because it's 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 okay so that's
going to return to if it's this one
going to return 1 if this one 0 if it's
this one etc so once we've got the index
of that what we need to do is modify
this right here this array to remove
that element so imagine that this
returns 2 then we want to remove the
second element of this array so the way
we can do that is by saying scope dot
ninjas and again I'm going to use a
JavaScript method called splice and I'm
going to pass through removed ninja and
then one so what that does is it says
okay I want you to get into this array
this splice method and I want you to
start at this point which we've passed
through because that's equal to here so
for example if that was 2 it start at
this point and I want you to remove one
element in that array so that's what it
does it just takes that element out okay
and then we're left with the remaining
elements so let's save that now and
refresh and now when we click one of
these it's going to remove it
okay so quickly just to go through again
we've made a cross here attach this
ng-click directive to it which is
invoking this remove ninja function on
the scope object and it's passing
through the current ninja object okay
then when that function is fired right
here we've got access to the ninja
object that we pass through we create a
variable and we find the index of that
ninja in this array right here once we
found that index we then splice this
array starting at that index and
removing just one element from it okay
so that's how it's being removed so
let's say that again if we refresh is
going to come back so then we can remove
another one remove that one I'll remove
that and now we've got none left
brilliant okay so guys that is ng
click might be a little bit complex at
first especially maybe this part butter
just keep practicing and you'll get the
hang of it eventually okay any questions
feel free to add those down below
