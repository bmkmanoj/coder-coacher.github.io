bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a look at tooltips Wow
alright then guys so it's about time now
we moved on to some of the more advanced
JavaScript components so the rest of
this tutorial series or most of it is
gonna be focused on those now we're
gonna start with the most simple one
which is tooltips in my opinion so a
tooltip is one of those things where you
hover over a certain element or word and
then it comes up with a little bubble
with a bit more information about that
word or link maybe right so we're gonna
put a tooltip on this bad boy right here
this more info link so to do it what we
need to do is find it in the HTML first
where is it more info that's the one so
what we need to do is just give this a
few attributes this link we're going to
apply the tooltip to the link so we give
the attribute to the link and the first
attribute that I'm going to give it I'm
going to just enter onto the next line
just to make more room we don't need to
the first attribute is gonna be all in
lower caps and it's gonna be data
- toggle equals tooltip alright the next
attribute we want to give it is data
- and placement by the way this
attribute just says look this is going
to be a tooltip to bootstrap okay so
data - placement is where the tooltip is
going to appear now that can either be
at the top above it when you hover over
it or at the bottom I'm just gonna put
it at the top for now and I'll change it
later so you can have a look at that too
the next thing we need to do is give
this a title and this is the content
that's going to appear when you hover
over this inside the little bubble so
I'll just put how to be a kick-ass ninja
like me alright so if I save that and
refresh your notice that that does not
one little bit except for that little
thing that's not really a tooltip that's
just kind of like the default behavior
so what we need to do for this to work
is add enabling a bit of JavaScript now
it's not much it's very simple and I'm
going to do that right at the bottom of
the page and basically this job is great
is gonna say to bootstrap look hey go
get the tooltip elements and kind of
initialize them make them run alright so
you'll notice right here I've got two
script tags I'll rather one script tag
and a closet one this right here is just
using jQuery it's saying look when the
document is ready I want you to fire
this function so when the page is loaded
then we'll do this function and this
function is gonna say you know start the
tooltips initialize them dead simple
it's using jQuery so we use the dollar
sign and then what we want to do is grab
the data toggle you can see right here
where I've done it it says there it is
data toggle okay so this is an attribute
now we can use an attribute selector in
jQuery to grab the element that that's
on so I'm gonna say that so that right
there is an attribute selector it's in
square brackets and this is the
attribute that we're looking for with
this value so it's going to go out and
grab whichever elements have that
actually associated with them and then
we just need to apply a method which is
tooltip like that and that should do the
trick so let's refresh over here and
come down go for more info and there we
go okay so that's at the top we can also
put it at the bottom you see this data
placement right here we can put butter
like that and save it refresh and now it
appears at the bottom
I prefer at the top because then you
hand get if you look here your hand kind
of goes over it a little bit I'm a
little bit OCD I prefer the tooltips at
the top if you can't now this doesn't
have to be on an anchor tag I put it on
an anchor tag but it can be on whatever
you want okay it could be on a span tag
or P or you know any element you choose
so there we go guys that is how to make
a dead simple quick tooltip any
questions put them down below otherwise
don't forget to subscribe like and all
that kinda stuff
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
