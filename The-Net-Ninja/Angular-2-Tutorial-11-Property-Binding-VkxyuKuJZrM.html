angular2 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about property
binding RNs of what is property binding
well property binding lets us bind data
or expressions to HTML properties and
that could either be on a native
Hicksville property such as the value
attribute on an input field and that
could be set equal to an expression
which evaluates to a string or it could
be on a built in angular directive such
as ng class or it could be on a
custom-made property such as this
example right here and don't worry about
these bottom two for now we're going to
talk about those in a later tutorials in
this one I just want to concentrate on
these native HTML property data binding
all right there so I'm here in the home
component template and down here at the
bottom I've created two input fields
well with an attribute of value and one
with one of required and not being in
Hicksville weird it just rightly string
in here right we'd say something like I
love chicken okay and then if we save
that and output it to a browser then
this is going to appear in that input
box right but what if we want this data
here this value to be dynamic well we
can bind data to it by just popping
these square brackets around the value
property right there this is data
binding on the property so now we could
set this equal to some kind of data that
we've defined in this component for
example this have created this variable
right here called my string in a
facility equal to I like chicken okay so
I've defined that on this class this
component class so if I grab this now
this variable is available to us over
here and we can bind it to this property
so I can output it like that press save
and if we view this in a browser right
now and I refresh then it should show up
in this input field right here and there
we go I like chicken so it's not
outputting my strength which you would
do if we take away these square brackets
but instead it's now
outputing I like chicken and that's
because we added those square brackets
and now this is binding data to this
property it sees this as the value on
the whole component racket okay so let's
try something else let's try this
required and we need to give this an
expression right here that evaluates to
either true or false or a variable which
is equal to either true or false so
again you can see on this home component
I've got a variable called my boolean
and that's set equal to true so let's go
over here and I'll put my boolean and
save this dude and let's watch it update
over here or rather just refresh okay
and although we don't see anything
changing in this box right here let's
inspect the element and we can see that
required equals true okay it's required
now if I change this to false over here
and save it then let's see what happens
in the code all right and let's inspect
the element and this now should no
longer be required
you see required equals false so that's
pretty cool we are binding data to these
properties by using these square
brackets now there is another way we can
bind data to them and that is by taking
away these square brackets and instead
using string interpolation so right now
if I saved it then this value right here
is going to be I liked sorry my string
that will appear in here and then this
thing right here probably won't work at
all so let's just take a look okay so we
see my string there and then if we
inspect this probably nothing is going
to happen yet required equals my
building and that doesn't really make
sense okay but what we can do without
the square brackets on is use string
interpolation in here and that is also
going to bind this data to that property
much like we've seen in the previous
tutorial when we use these double curly
braces is going to output the data from
this component class instead of what's
inside it so let's save that now okay
cool now we get I like chicken back and
if we inspect this one more time and
wish
see that this is false again required
equals false which is what it is on the
component class right here pretty cool
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
