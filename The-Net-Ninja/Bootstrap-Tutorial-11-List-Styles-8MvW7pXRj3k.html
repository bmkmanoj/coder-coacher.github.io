your eleventh bootstrap 3 tutorial and
in this video we're gonna take a look at
some of the list styles that bootstrap
provides us with all right again so I've
got three lists up here you can see I've
got a ul at the top there Noel and a DL
nothing fancy going on at all and over
here on the right this is how bootstrap
styles those three types of lists okay
so it is different from default browser
styles if I just remove this link to the
bootstrap CSS file you'll see that's the
default browser Styles really ugly and
then if I undo you can see it just makes
things a little bit nicer and neater
okay especially these where the
definition titles or terms are in bold
all right let's so I want to show you
just a few different classes as well we
can use to make these look different so
the first one I want to show you is
called lists on styled and basically
that just takes away the styling of list
items so let's give this a class this
first one and its list - on style
alright so you can see there those
little dots have gone and it's moved
everything to the left it's got rid of
the padding and things like that
okay so if you want to on style or your
list items you just give it this class
this also works on the oh L so I can say
the list
- on style like that and it does the
same thing alright so the next one I
want to show you if we just delete that
is called list in line so basically now
they're going from top to bottom yeah
but if I say list in line like that now
they've got from left to right they
remove those little circles as well so
this is really cool for things like like
navigations at the top of your site up
something line up that's pretty cool and
again we can do the same for this one
here take that off and then do list in
line and they styled exactly the same
way all right it takes the numbers off
and Spacey's them from left to right so
now the DL we can't use list in line on
that I'll show you if we use list in
line does it really do much okay it
moved it over to the left a touch but no
major change what would
can do something similar we have this
class called DL horizontal alright and I
think this looks a little bit better so
now it displays it left to right so this
kind of thing is on the left the the
definition and then this is on the right
and if we just made one of these a
little bit bigger you can see they're
all aligned to this side here so it
looks nice and neat so that's pretty
cool and that's pretty much it guys I
know this has been a short lesson I just
wanted to show you these classes we can
use on the lists in bootstrap so ya shot
lesson if you don't like it a little bit
anyway I'll see you guys in the next
