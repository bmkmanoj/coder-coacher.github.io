PSD to WordPress less than 31 and in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can package a theme up ready for use
Wow all right then guys so we're really
staged now with that theme where it's
looking like it's ready for being used
on a live web site we're ready to hand
it over to the client so that they can
install this theme on their WordPress
setup okay or whoever wants to use it
they can install it on their web press
setup now if you go to appearance and
then themes in the WordPress admin area
remember this is how we added a new
theme and this is what your client will
be doing are you will begin for your
client on a live server
remember this is all locally at the
minute we've got to add new and then
we'd upload a theme and we choose a file
and it says here if you have a theme in
dot zip format you may install it by it
loading it here so to do it this way it
needs to be in a dot zip format so
that's what we need to do with our theme
now that it's finished okay so all we
need to do to do that is come down here
and go to bump then go to
www.deewr.gov.au/rjcp - send that to
your client or you want to just
basically upload that file here on a
live server not locally and then install
it on your WordPress setup that's all we
need to do once we've finished our theme
okay so I know this has been a really
short tutorial I thought I just sneaked
this one in here before it closed the
series off in the next tutorial what I'm
going to do is just point win a few
directions of the kind of things you
want to be looking at next to expand on
this knowledge you've got hopefully for
me working through this playlist okay so
any questions feel free to comment down
below otherwise guys I'll see you in
that very last tutorial coming up next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
