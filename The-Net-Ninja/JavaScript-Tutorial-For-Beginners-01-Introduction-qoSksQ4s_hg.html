JavaScript for beginners lesson 1 Wow
alright and so before we embark on this
journey of JavaScript goodness you
should know a couple of things and the
first one is HTML now you don't need to
be a wizard you just need to know enough
to make a simple web page and that's
because JavaScript works alongside HTML
so you add interactivity to those web
pages so if you don't know what hTML is
or you don't know much about it you can
check out the playlist I've done right
here on YouTube called HTML for
beginners I'll leave a link to that in
the description down below the next
thing you need to know is CSS and again
you don't need to be a pro you just need
to know enough to style up a simple web
page and again that's because JavaScript
sometimes utilizes CSS to change the
effect or the appearance of things on a
web page so I've also done a playlist
called CSS for beginners you can check
out that also if you know nothing about
CSS and I leave a link to that in the
description below too so once you've
swatted up on those two areas it's time
to get cracking with JavaScript for
beginners ok so what we're going to
learn in this playlist well the first
thing we're going to cover is what
JavaScript is and when we use it and
then when we've got that other way we're
going to look at the basics of
JavaScript syntax now it may be daunting
at first but I promise you when you get
the hang of it it is really simple
you're going to pick it up no problem
then we'll start working with data types
in JavaScript and these include integers
strings billions etc and then we'll look
at control flow now control flow kind of
controls how a program runs and the
logic behind gate within JavaScript the
include things like loops and
conditional statements once we've done
that we'll dive right into the document
object model of a Dom for short now the
Dom my friends is a really really
important area for a front-end
development it's the core of my skill
set and probably should be of yours too
because this is how we manipulate
elements in a web page and how we
communicate with the HTML to change the
look and appearance of things on the
website ok so we're going to master that
and then finally we're going to move on
to some examples of jazz
script on web pages and start making a
couple of simple programs of our own
so before we start coding things up I
just want to show you a couple of tools
that I'm going to use for this playlist
now you don't have to download them but
if you want to follow along exactly the
way I'm doing things then you probably
want to head over to brackets dot IO
first and download this web editor
called brackets now it's a really cool
free text editor for Windows or Mac
comes with intellisense
along with a lot of other cool features
as well supports HTML CSS JavaScript
among other things so you want to
download that first of all and then head
over to google.com forward slash chrome
now chrome is just a browser and you can
use whichever browser you want the
reason I like to use Chrome for
development is that it's got a cool
console and other development tools and
bedded into it now other browsers have
those as well I just prefer Chrome's so
if you want to follow along with me head
over to this website and download Chrome
I'll leave the links to both of these
websites in the description below so
that's about it for this introduction
lesson and next we're going to start
looking at what JavaScript is so I'll
see you guys in that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
