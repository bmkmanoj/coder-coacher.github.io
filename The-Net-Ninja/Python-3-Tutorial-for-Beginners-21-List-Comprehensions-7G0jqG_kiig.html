21st titan-3 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about list
comprehensions and so in this video I
want to talk about list comprehension
and this comprehension basically gives
us an alternative way to construct lists
or dictionaries based on other
collections so I think the best way to
explain this is to go through an example
so I've already created this list called
prices and it contains a list of
monetary values which could be prizes to
some kind of competition now on one
particular weekend the boss comes to say
we're going to have some kind of double
prize money weekend bonanza so what I
want you to do is I want you to create a
new list with the double prize money
based on these values right here so
don't override this way they create a
new list with the double prize money in
it so we could do this using a for loop
and I'm going to show you that way first
so I'm going to create a new list as
well called dbl prizes and set that
equal to an empty list to do it
then we're going to use a for loop to go
through it so I'm going to say for price
in prizes so we're looping through this
prizes list right here and we're
referring to each one of these
individual items as the prize singular
so inside you follow what we're going to
do well we're going to double the prize
money and add it to this list right here
so I'm going to say dbl underscore
prizes which is that new list then on
the $6 tend to add a new item to it and
the item we're going to add to it is the
individual prize from this iteration
around it could be five ten fifteen
hundred or a thousand doubled sometimes
two so that will create this new list
for us with the prizes updated to double
prizes
so let's print this out see what it
looks like as a prints dbl underscore
prizes so save that and I'm going to run
this file by saying python comprehension
qwy okay so now we get these double
prizes in this list tool so this is work
and this method of doing things is
absolutely fine but what I want to do
now is show you the comprehension way so
I'm going to do a comment saying
comprehension method and then underneath
what we're going to do is a
list comprehension so Sam again I'm
going to override this thing right here
double prizes so we're using the same
ways but we're now creating it from
scratch and what we do is we place our
comprehension in here and it looks
something like this
so first of all what do we want to
appear in each element well I want the
price times 2 to appear in each element
and then we say what do we want to cycle
through to create this list and I'll say
I want to cycle for prize in prizes so
this is quite similar to a for loop in
it I mean this thing here is exactly the
same here but what we're doing is we're
just adding this kind of calculation
price times 2 to say what we want to be
returned each time around in this list
instead of this thing right here okay so
we're doing it all in one line now so
this is going to have exactly the same
effect we're going to output price times
2 for prize in prizes and that's going
to create this list of doubled prizes so
again let me print the more prizes I'll
copy that and paste it down here save it
and we're going to run this file again
you'll see we get exactly the same so
first of all we create it here and it
outputs these and secondly we create it
here and it outputs it here so they're
exactly the same so this comprehension
way of doing things does exactly the
same job but it does it in less lines of
code so some people prefer it for that
reason okay let's do another simple
example I'm going to show you how to do
some squaring all the numbers so I'll
create an old list and that'll be equal
to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 and then
what we want to do first of all is cycle
through these using the for loop right
so the first thing I want to do is
create a new list and this is going to
be called squared even notes so all
we'll go to is create a new list based
on this one and we're just going to
square the even nodes and output that to
the new list okay so this is going to be
an empty array to begin with then we're
going to use a followed
I'm going to say for norm in notes first
of all then we're going to check if the
number is even so we'll say give a len
norm squared modulus 2 is equal to zero
right so if the squared number is even
if it doesn't have a remainder then what
we're going to do is add it to this new
list right here ok so do a core block
also squared even honest then dot append
and we're going to attend norm squared
right so then eventually what we can do
is print out now the squared
even knows to see this is what so let's
run this file again and this time we see
four 1636
64 and hundred right so what only output
in the numbers which went squared are
even make sense
ok then so now let's look at the
comprehension way of doing this because
again this is a little long so let's
give ourselves a little bit of room and
we'll say here is concrete tension
method if we can tag it ok so now how do
we do this well again what I'm going to
do is create the new list so I'll say
squared even underscore nuns and that's
to be equal to this comprehension now so
inside here what do we want to do first
of all well we want to say you norm
squared that's what we want to output
now what do we want to loop through so
we want to say for norm in nuns what in
the follow what we did is we checked if
the squared number was even by using
this little calculation right here and
then we only added that now we can do
the same kind of thing over here at the
right we can add on an if statement and
I can say if and then it's going to be
no squared modulus to
equal to zero make sense so we add what
we want to answer the list first of all
then what recycling through and then any
conditions so if we want to add a
condition to what we add to this new
list then we can add it right there so
right here we're saying we're only
adding numbers from the original list if
that number squared modulus two is zero
makes sense so this is exactly the same
now as of this dude right here but again
one line so let's save this and in fact
we need to print these sort of prints
and it's going to be squared even nuns
so let's save it again
and let's run this now so again we get
exactly the same result so there we go I
mean these comprehensions
are not something you necessarily have
to use but they're just a way to easily
create lists based on other lists
instead of using folders like this okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
