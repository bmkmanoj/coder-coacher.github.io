16th bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna dive in to some tabs
and pills uh I think guys so when I say
we're gonna dive into some tabs and
pills I don't mean we're gonna get off
our faces on LSD and ecstasy what I do
mean is that we're going to create some
mini navigations that bootstrap provides
us with ok so the way we do that is by
first of all creating a UL list like
this I've already done that
and I've got some allies within it and
there are links in that so the idea here
is that I'm going to offer some training
in each one of these different kind of
areas pretty cool right so to make this
look like a mini now we first have to
come to the UL tag and give this aid
class and the class is going to be now
now that doesn't do an awful lot it just
kind of gives you some base styles this
hover effect and spaces the links out a
little bit we have to combine this class
with one of several other classes the
nav pills on avatars to make it look a
bit better now I'm going to show you now
the tops first of all so I'll just
combine it with nav - tabs ok now look
at that does it look great it just looks
like a horizontal navigation with a line
under it
Brill but the OL idea is that we can
apply a class to one of these and this
is where the magic happens of active and
then voila all of a sudden this becomes
like a tab box right so we could have a
box of content down here and then we
could click on each one of these and
when we click on one the tab becomes
active showing this thing around it and
the content changes here so that's
pretty cool now what I'm gonna do
because when we click on one of these at
the minute it doesn't become active as
such I'm gonna add a little bit of crude
JavaScript or jQuery down here so that
we can have that functionality and so
you can just see in action alright so
I'm gonna say jQuery and then we're
going to go after the nav element and
then the Li tags within it because we're
gonna attach a click event each one of
these Li events and we want to say
unclick fire on this function or write
it then in this function is where we can
control over taking away this fact of
class or giving it alright so the first
thing we want to do is take away the
active class from any L
so when we click on something we're
gonna take the active class away from
all of them all right so to do that I
will say jQuery nav Li dot remove class
and then the class I'm going to remove
is active all right and then after that
I will say this dot add plus active all
right so when we click on one first it's
going to remove the class active from
all of them then this the one that we
click on is going to be added or rather
given a class of active all right so
let's see this now when I click on
something maybe we have to save and
refresh so when I click now there we go
you can see that tab becomes active
pretty cool yeah
now the other one we can do is now that
this looks slightly different so if I
click on one now you can see it becomes
a different color pretty cool right now
we can do a couple of more things with
this we can say nav stopped and that
oops have put a dot in there for some
reason that is going to stack them all
on top of each other like this I don't
like this as much but if you wanted to
you could have them just a little kind
of navigation say yay wide and do it
that way all we can do now justified and
that is going to make them the same
width going left to right it's going to
take up the whole kind of space on the
potato at the page in the container
right pretty cool and we can do the same
with nav tamps that works just the same
so when I click over here now let's just
get rid of that blue box okay now they
tick up all the spaces well and each one
is equal in width alright so that my
friend is how we create tabs and pills
in the next video we're going to take
this one step further and we're going to
look at the nav element itself to create
a fully blown menu system I'll see you
