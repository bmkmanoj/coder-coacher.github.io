deep tub tutorial and in this video we
are going to create our very first or
repository okay so hopefully by now
you've got gets installed on your
computer you'll also need open at this
point some kind of command-line
interface I'm using commando right here
also you'll need open a text editor
hopefully Atem which I suggested in the
previous tutorials if not sublime or
whatever is fine as well now I've
created two directories one called get
one and one called get two and we're
going to create a repository in each one
of these directories in Amit so go ahead
and create one of those but the first
thing we need to do is navigate into one
of these directories where we want to
create a repository in our command line
tool so I could say something like this
CD you know documents and then go see
decent-enough and eventually wind up in
this get one fold it right here instead
a little trick you can just right click
this in a to go to cook copy full path
and then we can just say CD paste that
in and then we're going to navigate into
this exact directory where we want to
create this repository cool so how do we
create this repository dead simply all
we do is say git and then emits which
stands for initialize click enter that
is going to initialize an empty git
repository inside this project and
you'll see now or just about see this
get to fire right here I'll rather this
is not a dot git file but a folder
because we can expand it and you'll see
all of these different things inside now
I'm not going to go into detail as to
what these are just yet because it's
quite advanced and for leave that for
another tutorial but all you need to
know the existence of this get folder
means that this is now a git repository
with inside this folder the working
directory and it gets is going to track
any kind of changes that we make inside
this project folder cool now one cool
thing about atom is that it provides
some kind of highlighting effect for the
different stages of our files in gates
on that will all become clear later on
but in order to see these look work you
might have to restart atom so I'm going
to close it off and open it up once
again you might not have to do that this
is just my version of atom so now you'll
notice it's no longer a folder but these
little bars are right here which is a
symbol for a repository so that's an
easy way tin atom to see that this is a
repository right
another cool thing if we say inside this
directory such index.html and by the way
this touch command is only good work if
you're on like a Mac or Linux or just
using commander it won't work on the
Windows command line interface okay
you'll have to create that manually
instead by right-clicking and creating
anyway it creates this index file for us
and if we now go in it you can see that
this is green okay so normally when
we're not in a repo this is just going
to be great and all the different files
are great but because if you now a git
repository inside Adam get is
recognizing that this engage file is a
new file it wasn't there before and it's
letting us know that by changing this
file to green is letting us know that
it's new some kind of change has been
made okay so I'm just going to create a
dummy HTML file for now and save that
doesn't really matter all I wanted to
show you for now is how to create this
git repository and now we can see that
these changes are being tracked because
of the different colors okay so a
project folder doesn't have to be empty
for you to create a repository we could
create a repository in a folder such as
this one gets here which already has
files in it so this already has an
indict file and a style.css file so if I
wanted to create a repository in here I
just do exactly the same thing with a
right-click get the full path and say CD
and go to this path so inside here we
can say the same thing it git init to
initialize a repository so now this is a
git repository again just going to
restart this so receive those updated
icons etc those different colors now we
can see that these things here are being
tracked as well okay cool so now we've
created a repository from scratch in a
folder but also a repository in an
existing project directory which already
has files and it's going to track
changes in these files from this point
ok so there we go that is how we create
a repository and in the next tutorial
what we're going to do is start editing
files and adding them to a staging area
which is showed you in at the last
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
