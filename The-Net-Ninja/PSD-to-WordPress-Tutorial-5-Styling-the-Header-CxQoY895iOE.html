PSD to WordPress lesson 5 and in this
video we're gonna style up the header in
the CSS Wow alright then guys so in the
last lesson we coded up all of the home
page content in the middle and that's
where I've left it here I just want to
do one more thing that I forgot to do in
the last tutorial and that is just go
above this section tag with the whole
menu ID and through a div with a class
of wrapper because as well as the header
we need to keep all this stuff here
within a central column also so I'll
take that end tag and I'm gonna put it
right at the bottom of the homepage
content because all of the home page
content is gonna sit within that central
wrapper column okay so apologies guys
for skipping out that in the last
tutorial
but now we've done it we can get on to
the CSS so first thing we want to do is
slide out this pane here right click and
go to new file and we're going to make a
file called style dot CSS and this is
going to be our main CSS file now in the
index file what we need to do is link
that CSS file up so we'll do that in a
head we'll do a link tag with a href
attribute of the style dot CSS and then
it's type is text slash CSS then we need
a rel attribute of stylesheet all right
so that's linked up completely now so
now we've linked that up we can jump
into the Styles dot CSS and start
styling this up but before we do that I
want to go to view and then go to
horizontal split and that's going to
split it in the middle right here so
essentially I can now have the index in
the top pane and drag the style to the
bottom so I can see it down here so
we've got both open at the same time
alright so let's get cracking then the
first thing we want to do is stay up
this header section so I'm just gonna
have a quick look at the PSD file just
to see what we need to do okay all
pretty simple so we're going to start at
all by the way guys this is it going to
be a pixel perfect representation you
know I'm not here to show you how to do
that I'm here to show you the process of
turning a PSD into HTML into a wordpress
site okay so if you want to kind of
really
focus on the intricacies you feel free
to do so I'm just going to do like a
general outline which is gonna look good
enough so the first thing I want to do
is go off to the body tag
and within the next all I want to say is
font family Georgia now this might not
be the exact font family used but it's
quite similar so I'm happy with that for
now so the next thing I want to do is
given a margin of zero to remove the
margin all around the body tag okay now
after that we're going to style this
wrapper thing right here so we can make
our central column now the wrapper I
said I was going to give a maximum width
of 1200 pixels but before we do that I'm
going to give it a width of 100 pixels
okay and then set the max width to 1180
pixels and you might say well why are
you doing that when you said 1200 and
the reason is so I can give it a padding
left and right all the 10 pixels so
that's zero to the top and bottom and
then 10 pixels to the left and right
which scoots the content away from the
edge a little bit so now in total it's
1200 pixels maximum width all right
then see you position that's essentially
all we need to do is say margin zero top
and bottom auto left and right okay and
now if I save this and maximize you can
see this central column here
this wrapper and this wrapper is
centralized it in the middle yeah so
that is how we do it because this margin
auto to the left and right is working
out what's left on the left and what's
left on the right and centralizing it
all right so now we need to style the
logo so we'll say H 1 dot logo because
we give it a class of logo right here
and the first thing groups I want to do
is delete an article and then give this
a background image property there's
going to be a URL and the URL is going
to be in our images folder forward slash
logo dot PNG all right so now we've
given in that background image but it
goes on and on and on multiple times we
don't want that to repeat so we need to
use the background hi
repeat property so that's a no repeat
alright the next thing we want to do is
give this a width of about 100 pixels
all right that'll do and then set the
text indent so mine is 10,000 pixels and
that's gonna get this text over the top
and scoot it off way over there so no
one can see it now we just see that log
of pretty cool yeah all right so now
we'll float it to the left so that we
can also float that main navigation
which is what we're going to style next
we're gonna get the header now because
it's the nav thing right here within the
header tag yeah so we'll get that and
we'll float it way up to the right all
right I'll do and then after that we
want to grab the h2 within that so we'll
say header now takes two and we're going
to give this a text indent of minus
10,000 pixels again because we don't
want that to show up we're also going to
give this a height of zero so that it
doesn't occupy this space and then now
can move up and same for the margin give
that zero as well so the nav can move up
again all right let's move on so that
now for then let's grab the Ally text
within it so it's header now Li and
we're gonna flow all of these left so
they stack left to right like that
we're gonna get rid of those little dots
and to do that we need to say
list-style-type:none that's going to get
rid of those then we need to give them a
Maggi so they're not all close to each
other and we'll say 10 pixels top and
bottom then 20 pixels left and right
like that and I think that will do for
the Li tags the next thing we need to do
style up the links within them so again
header nav Li a and these are going to
have a text decoration of an on just get
rid of that underline effect up here so
it gets rid of that then the color is
going to be like a 333 dark gray color
and the font size
it's gonna be 18 pixels so just slightly
bigger and then after that we need to
just style this banner so that it all
fits in currently shut off there so
let's grab the main banner ID which is
this thing right here and then we also
want to grab the image within that so
I'm gonna do a comment then main banner
image and that's going to grab them both
so I can stand them both within one rule
and I'm just going to give it a simple
width property of 100% so that it's 100%
of the width so if the window is this
big it's this large and if the windows
this big it's this large all right makes
sense now then that's right that's why
it doesn't work we've called it in my
grid in fact it should be margin and now
we've got rid of that little gap left
and right all right guys so there we go
we've styled the header up here and
we've got that banner styled as well in
the next lesson we're gonna move on and
style up this menu and possibly the
footer as well but we'll see how it goes
alright so don't forget to subscribe
share and like and I'll see you guys in
the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
