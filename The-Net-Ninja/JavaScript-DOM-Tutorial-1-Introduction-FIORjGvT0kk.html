and the Dom lesson one so a while back
now I created a java script for
beginners tutorial series and I actually
did a few lessons in there about three
or four which touched on the Dom but I
think go into any great detail about it
now I think if you're in front and
developer in this day and age it's a lot
about interacting with the web elements
the different HTML elements on the page
and changing them via JavaScript and
that's all encompassed by the Dom which
stands for the document object model so
that's what this series is all going to
be about so this model is created by the
browser when a web page is loaded and in
graphical form it looks something like a
tree of elements or nodes which is meant
to represent every single HTML element
on your page so it looks something a bit
like this where we have parent elements
at the top and children elements nested
beneath those and programmatically what
this model allows us to do in JavaScript
is interact with this tree this Dom and
do things with it and there's a lot of
different things we can do with it so
some of them are these things here we
can change or remove HTML elements in
the Dom or on the page so we could reach
in remove an element of relate to all we
could change and add CSS styles to these
elements via the Dom we can also read
and change element attributes and by
that I mean things like the hatred
attribute on anchor tags or the source
attribute on image tags or alt
attributes or any kind of custom
attribute you may have on your HTML
elements we can also create new HTML
elements and insert them into the Dom or
the page via JavaScript and we can
attach event listeners to different
elements things like click events key
press events and myth events and react
to those as well in JavaScript so we're
going to be covering all of this in this
series and you might be sitting there
thinking at the minute well you know
what I can actually already do all of
this all I need to do is grab jQuery and
I can do all of this really simply with
that and yeah ok you probably could do
I wouldn't recommend it in a lot of
cases and a lot of developers which just
use jQuery all the time only for the Dom
and I think that's kind of overkill and
you can do everything you can do in
jQuery just using vanilla JavaScript and
that's what I'm going to teach you in
this series nothing to do with jQuery
it's all going to be about JavaScript
and how we can reach in and interact
with this Dom using only pure JavaScript
and I think that's much more fun and
it's going to make it a much more
rounded JavaScript developer as well so
this is everything we're going to be
covering the first few lessons of the
series are going to be focusing on how
we can navigate the Dom go up and down
it Traverse if you like from parent to
child that kind of thing and we're going
to look at the query selector which is
very much like the query selector in
jQuery not much different set we're also
going to take a look at how we can
change the Dom and manipulate these
different HTML elements inside of it and
the content within it as well as the
styles as well as CSS we're also going
to look at interacting with farms and
events in Plexus submit events click
events key press events all that kind of
jazz then we're going to start creating
new elements via JavaScript and insert
them directly into the Dom in different
places wherever we like which is really
cool and along the way as well we're
going to be creating this kind of mini
reading list app which I'm going to show
you in a second
okay so this is the basic application
we're going to be creating throughout
this series and I'm not going to win any
CSS awards for this well that's not what
this course is all about we're going to
be looking at how we can interact with a
different web element here to do things
like delete books search for books or
even add new books like so so that's
what this series is all going to be
about and we're going to be creating
this app as we go along now I'm going to
be using two things to write the code in
in this series the first one is going to
be the developer tools which you can
open by clicking f12 over here and we're
going to be writing in the console later
on and showing you how to do different
things with the donc there but I'm also
going to be using the UH text editor as
well which is completely free and really
cool so you can download that at attempt
oh the link is going to be down below
and I am also going to be giving you all
the course files for the whole of this
series so every lesson is going to have
its own branch on this github repo this
link is going to be down below so if you
want to check out the code for lesson 10
for example just select the lesson 10
branch and you're going to see all of
that code right here okay speaking of
code I'm going to walk you through the
HTML that I've created for this mini
application right here I'm not going to
create this from scratch and you can
watch it this isn't a hate email course
I'm assuming you've already got base
understanding of HTML so I'm just going
to walk you through it quickly now in
the head we're just linking up to this
stylesheet right here which is over
there and I'm going to show you that in
a second we have a wrapper down here
which is wrapping all of the content
then a header with that forming or
roundabout here that is for searching
for books we're going to hook up that
functionality later on we also have a
div for the book list itself where every
book has its own Li tag and below that
we have another form to add new books
which is just an input field and a
button so we're going to add to this as
we go along but this is kind of like the
starting point if you like so take a
look through that familiarize yourself
with it I'm also going to include this
star CSS as the starter files again this
is not a CSS course so I'm not going to
create these from scratch I see no point
if you want to learn CSS I've got a CSS
for beginners tutorial series leave the
link to that down below but yet peruse
through these you
realizer if you wish some really basic
styles just to make it look a little
less crappy on the webpage all right but
also going to have this app dot J's file
that's where we're going to do all of
our JavaScript as well and we're going
to start on that probably in about two
or three lessons time so that's all for
your introduction if you do like these
videos my friends please please please
do not forget to like them subscribe and
share them and I'm going to see you in
the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
