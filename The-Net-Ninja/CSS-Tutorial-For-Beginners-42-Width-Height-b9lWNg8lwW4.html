you're watching CSS beginners lesson 42
and in this video we're going to talk
about the width and height properties in
CSS all right so so far in this course
we've talked about the box model quite a
lot and we've said that the box model
controls the kind of spatial properties
of block level elements so we've also
talked about what block level elements
are so we've discussed the margin we've
discussed padding and we've talked about
borders as well but we've not really
talked about the width and height
properties in any great detail so that's
what we're going to take a look at today
okay so I'm back here in the code now
and as you can see I've added these four
div tags right here and the first one
has got a class of static width the
second one has a class of percentage
width and the bottom two here have
classes of inline block I've also added
a selector up here which is going to
target all of these divs it's going
after all of the divs within the main
content remember the main content is
here and it's going after all of these
divs within that and it's given those a
background color of the light gray and
it's giving them a margin bottom of 20
pixels remember the way this module
shorthand works is top right bottom left
okay so let's take a look at what this
looks like a browser before doing
anything else okay then so there they
are and we've got our four divs within
this parent element and they're all
taking up 100% width of the parent
element - this area here which is the
padding on the parent element so
remember all block level elements
automatically take up 100% of the parent
elements width so that's why they're
doing that so what we're going to do now
is take a look at the width and height
properties in the code and mess around
with those a little bit and the first
thing we're going to do is go after this
static width div here so to do that I'll
do my class selectors start with a
period and then say static width and
then we'll give you some values now the
width property is just width and by
static width I mean we're going to give
it a pixel value and we'll just say 300
pixels and that's that
because no matter how big your browser
is or how big the parent element is
we're saying to this one here it's
always going to be 300 pixels all right
and we're going to do the same for the
height we'll just give that a height of
100 pixels
okay so let's view this in a browser now
and see what it looks like all right
cool so there it is it's a width of 300
pixels and a height of 100 pixels cool
so now we're going to take a look at
percentage width and to do that we'll go
after our percentage with the class here
and we'll give it a width property and
this time I'm going to say 70% so what
that there is saying is whatever width
the parent element is I want this div to
be 70% of that width okay and then we'll
just give it a height of 50 pixels so
the height is always going to be static
but the width is going to be dynamic
depending on how wide the parent element
is so let me show you that in a browser
okay so here now you can see this gray
box is about 70 percent the width of
this white box which is good because if
we were designing for a mobile screen
then maybe the browser and the white box
would be smaller and now you can see
here as I increase and make this window
smaller that this white box is getting
smaller and subsequently this gray box
is getting smaller because this gray box
is always 70 percent of this white box
so this is really good for mobile kind
of devices of your designing a website
that's going to scale down to mobiles
then it's really good to work with
percentages because where is this 300
pixel block you can see now is creeping
over the edge
okay this 70% width on here is always
70% the width of this parent element so
it's never going to do this all right so
that's really cool so now let's look at
these two here which I've given a class
of inline-block Seuss
we'll target both of those and this time
what I'm going to do is say give them a
width of 40% and we know that block
level elements stack on top of each
other now in this case I want these to
stack side-by-side and we know to do
that we have to give it those in line
properties because inline elements stack
side-by-side however if we were to say
display:inline we know that that will
take away the box model properties we
won't have full control over those
because the mob the box model only
controls block level elements so what we
need to do is say in line block to get
the best of both worlds remember so
we're getting that side to side property
we get within line elements but we're
also getting the block level element
properties which is going to let us
control the box model properties things
like margin and padding okay so let's
save that now and view this in a browser
cool and there we go now we have a 40%
width here for this one and right next
to it another one which is 40% in width
too and same again if we inspect the
elements and scroll this in and out I'll
rather zoom it left and right we can see
them get smaller and getting larger
dependent on how large this parent
element is okay so that about covers
everything we need to talk about when it
comes to width and height if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
throw a comment down below I'll answer
all of those as soon as possible
