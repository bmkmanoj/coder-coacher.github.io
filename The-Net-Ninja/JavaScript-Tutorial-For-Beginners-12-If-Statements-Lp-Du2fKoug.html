JavaScript for beginners lesson 12 and
in this video we're going to take a look
at if statements and control flow Wow
all right there so control flow and
logic and if statements are a big part
of your everyday life it doesn't have to
just be in code and here are a couple
examples of that right if you pay for
your train ticket then you all get a
fine if you take a crap in public you'll
wind up in prison
all right simple as that so you're
seeing these if statements really in
real life wherever you go it's just that
they're not associated with code it's
just common logic if you do something
you'll get a specific result and
JavaScript is exactly the same we use
these things called if statements to
check whether certain conditions are met
if those conditions are met then we'll
execute a portion of code if they're not
met we'll execute a different portion of
code right a good example of this would
be if you have an image gallery if you
click on a thumbnail then we'll show a
big image if you click on the cross of
that big image then we'll shrink that
image this is all conditional statements
in action so we're going to jump right
back into the code now and take a look
at these if statements in more detail
all right guys so I'm back here in
brackets for this lesson and I've just
got this blank HTML document here
there's nothing in the body except for
this script tag right here where I'm
linking up the test yet file and that my
friends is right here completely empty
I've also got this browser open on the
right which is the web page this index
dot HTML so we're going to refresh this
as we write code okay there so in the
last lesson we looked at building in so
we said we could assign variables a true
or false value and the different
expressions evaluate as true or false
for example 7 is greater than 5 okay
so we're going to take a look at those
and we're going to use if statements to
evaluate these expressions so first of
all I'm going to say var and you like
meet equals true all right so we're
saying yes okay you like me we're doing
that true value and we're going to write
an if statement and an if statement
checks whether certain values or
expressions are true and executes a
portion of code if they are true and
perhaps if you want to a different
portion of code if they're not true okay
so the way we do this is by first
writing the keyword if all right that's
a keyword in JavaScript and it's used to
write the if statement and then after
the if you can do a space you don't have
to do you can keep it like this if you
like I always put a space for
readability and then we open and close
our parentheses and then within these
parentheses is where we put the
expression which we want to evaluate
okay so if this expression is true then
it's going to execute a certain portion
of code so we'll put in here you like
meat so essentially what we're doing
there is check in the value of this
variable and it's true so I suppose we
could just write true and that's the
same okay because these are the same
values we've assigned you might meet the
value of true so this is going to
evaluate that's true okay
so after the brackets we put the curly
braces and this is where we put the code
that we want to execute if this
condition here is true all right so this
is called a code block anything between
these two color braces is the code block
that we're going to execute so it's
going to evaluate this statement here if
it's true then we execute the code
within the code block I'm just going to
do an indent here this is what we do in
JavaScript we indent our code as it goes
deeper into different code blocks and
I'm going to write something to the
document so we don't say document right
then within the parentheses I'm going to
put here is the beauty menu all right so
and I'm going to put the semicolon at
the end so we're saying here you like me
equals true we've assigned that variable
the value of true then we're checking
this variable to see if it is true if
it's true then we're going to execute
this block of code if it's not true then
we're not going to execute this block of
code
okay so we'll save that and let's
refresh this browser window and you can
see it's printed out this string because
it is true after all if we change this
to false then this right here is going
to reevaluate to false and hopefully it
won't print so I'll save that and
refresh and there we go doesn't print
okay so that's simple enough and we can
also evaluate different expressions like
we did in the previous tutorial in these
brackets here so we could say if 7 is
greater than 5
then write out this expression is true
okay and we know this to be true we know
that 7 is greater than 5 but let's just
check it anyway yeah this expression is
true if I change this to a less than
symbol we're saying is 7 less than 5 and
in value 8 that oops we need to save it
first value 8 that then it doesn't print
out this okay so let's make another
variable let's say there mine up and
let's equal this to 10 all right
semicolon at the end and let's say is 9
or greater than 10 and then we'll put
here my num is greater than 10 so if my
num is greater than 10 then it will
print out this line here so let's save
it and refresh and it doesn't print
anything else that's because our number
is 10 and 10 is not greater than 10
however if we put down there and save it
then it does print out because my num is
greater than 10 okay
likewise we can use the equal sign and
remember when we evaluate an expression
to see the equality of two things we
don't use one equals because that's the
assignment operator that we use to
assign numbers or values to variables we
use the double equal sign because then
this compares the two values alright so
we'll put in here is equal to 10 so
we're saying if my norm equals 10 then
right in the document my num is equal to
10 so let's save that and yet my num is
equal to 10 let's change this now to 8
and hopefully this shouldn't equate to
true so this won't write out so let's
refresh and there we go
cool so that's how we do if statements
now there is other portions to this we
can write else right here at the end of
these statements we can write else and
then another code block and essentially
what we're saying here is go ahead and
execute this if this is true then do
this portion this code block ok execute
all this if this is not true then move
on to the else statement we're saying if
the
is true do this else if not do this okay
so we're right out here document dot
write my null is not equal to ten then
we'll put a semicolon at the end okay
makes sense so my name is eight so it'll
come here hopefully evaluate this find
out that it's not ten so it doesn't
execute this so it goes to the else
statement and it executes this okay so
let's save that and refresh and you'll
see here it prints out my num is not
equal to ten if we change my num to 10
again then refresh then it prints out my
num is equal to ten which is this one
because this evaluates to true and it
doesn't have to do the else statement
here alright so we can do the same with
means you like meat okay so if you like
meat is true well right out you like
meat
okay if it's not true we'll go to this
else statement and will write out you
hate me all right so let's save that and
see what happens refresh you hate me and
that's because this is set to false so
it's evaluating false here doesn't
execute this code block but it goes to
the out statement and it executes this
one so let's change this to true final
it just to see the outcome and hopefully
this should evaluate to true and write
out this message here so we'll save that
and refresh and there we go guys you
like me alright guys so that just about
covers it for the if-else statement
there is an extension to this statement
called the elsif and we're going to take
a look at that right in the next video
until then if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave those down
below I'll answer all of those otherwise
