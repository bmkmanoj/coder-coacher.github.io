fifth angularjs tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna introduce you to
directives Wow
okay then guys so directives pretty much
run the show in angular application so
you're going to be using them all over
your code to do different things so it's
best that you become friends with them
early on so I'm just gonna introduce you
guys and get you acquainted and then you
can go from there so in the last
tutorial we actually use two directives
already we use this one right here ng
app and that's all angular that we want
the whole of this document to be our
application and then we use this one
right here and Jean modeled and that's
all Dona learned that we want to create
a model called fave me and we want to
store some data in it okay so both times
we're telling angularjs to do something
for us or you might say we're directing
angular to do something for us that's
what directives do they tell angular to
perform some kind of behavior to help us
out
all right now there's tons more
directives than just these two here and
we're going to explore a lot of them as
we go through this course right but
let's just take a little peek at the
documentation to get a rough idea of
what we're dealing with here so if you
go to this address right here at the top
I'll leave the link down below you're
going to see a list of all these
different these different directives on
the left left right here so if we click
on one let's just click on one that
we've already used ng app it's going to
tell you a little bit about that
directive right here and then also give
you some examples so this is a really
good reference guys if you're not sure
what a particular directive does just
head over here click on whichever
directive you want and it's gonna give
you some pretty thorough documentation
on it okay so it's a really good
reference and if I should go there
immediately let's have a look but you'll
notice that these two directives right
here these are both in the form of
attributes now that is not always the
case they don't have to be just
attributes they can also be used in the
form of an actual HTML element and we'll
take a look at that later on in more
depth when we dive into making custom
directives ourselves but just quickly I
could do something like this I could
come down here and make a tag called
ninja like that
now obviously that's not a real HTML tag
although I am pushing for it to be added
but I can't do this in angular by
defining a custom directive called ninja
and then what I could do is program some
behavior into that directive so that
whenever I write this ninja tag in my
HTML something cool will happen like
displaying a random picture of a ninja
or something okay
so they're really flexible and we can
create a directive to do pretty much
anything we want and it essentially just
extends html's functionality for you and
it makes life easier for you when you're
doing bigger projects okay so for the
next few lessons we're not going to be
looking at this form of directives the
HTML type we're just going to be looking
at this form right here and going
through quite a few different directives
that do different things but we are
going to look at this later on like say
when we do custom directives celebra
guys that is what directives are all
about I know this has been a really
short lesson but I just wanted to give
you an idea of what they're all about
before I start throwing them at you all
over this code so you're not so confused
about what they actually are okay so any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
a comment down below otherwise guys
don't forget to subscribe share and like
and I'll see you in the varnish tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
