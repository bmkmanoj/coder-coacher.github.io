41st of UGS tutorial and in this video
we're going to go ahead and start adding
route links to our project
all right there so we have set up our
routing using the history mode so that
if we go to forward slash we get a list
view right here which is loading in the
show blogs component and if we go to
/add we get this view here which is
loading in the add blog component so
that's really cool we've got our routing
up and running however now how about
adding in some kind of header at the top
with a navigation bar with maybe two
links one link takes you to this view
and one link takes you to the other view
and loads in that component we can do
this we're going to create a new
component to create the header so with a
right-click components and cutting new
file and we're going to call this header
dot view and then I'm just going to
paste this thing in right here so an
empty template an empty object and empty
star tags so how do we want this header
to look well first of all let's do a nav
element that inside that will do a ul
and then inside this a series of Li tags
and each Li tag is going to have a link
it now I guess what we could do is
anchor tags like this href equals
forward slash to take your home or /ad
to take you to the blog view okay and
yeah we could do that but instead I want
to use something else I want to use a
tag called router link okay and this is
provided by the view router and this is
better because it intercept the click
event so we don't reload the page
whereas you would if we just added in an
anchor tag okay so it's quicker so the
router linked takes an attribute called
two and that is equal to whatever URL we
want to go to so for example forward
slash for lis home so we'll put in blog
here because this is going to login this
show this your blog's component then
we'll do another Li tag then again a
router
- link - and then that is going to be
equal to four slash ad and this is to
add a new blog so add a new blog
so now that we have created this we can
now import it into the root component
right here and display so I'm just going
to copy this for an hour and place it
down below and we'll change this to
header and we'll change this to header
as well and we'll go down here and what
we'll do is come under I will say app -
header and this is going to be henna
okay
and the reason remember we need a patter
is because header is already HTML tag
okay then so let's do app - head and out
and save that a view this in a browser
okay so now we get these two links and
if we go to blog it takes us here and if
we go to add new blog it takes us there
this is really cool so if we right click
we can actually see that in the console
or rather in this element selector we
see these a tags added all right
and check this out if something is
active then we get this router link
active so if we go to blog we can see
that this blog thing right here has a
router link active associated with it
now we can use that to style this link
to show that it's active okay the first
of all I want to just add some kind of
generic Styles to this header so I'm
going to copy and paste these from my
github repository the link to that is
down below you want to select lesson 41
I think we're up so I'm going to paste
these down here in the styles and
there's some really basic styles so
we're styling with ul right there so
it's got a list out type of none
text-align:center margin:0 display a
live tags as inline-block give them a
bit of a margin we're giving these a
links a color of white six decorating
nice bit of padding and a board of
radius and then the nav element has got
a background of kind of like a deep gray
some padding and a badging emerging
bottom of 40 pixels so if I save that
now let's just see this okay so that's
what the navbar looks like now now let's
make use of that active class so if we
inspect this again when we go to blog we
can see that this has a class of router
linked active so we can make use of that
to show where on this page
so let's go to the CSS again and add in
this class so we'll say dot router - a
link - active and then style this cell
at the background is going to be eee
which is kind of like a really light
gray and the color is going to be four
four four which is a dark gray so we
saved this now now we see this has this
kind of styling because it's got this
standing for this class right here check
this out if we click on this one
they both get this Stalin so they're
both active okay no that's because if we
inspect this element again we still get
router link active on this even though
it's not technically active and that's
because it's got this it within it so it
doesn't have to exactly match this it's
just got forward slash in it so if we go
to forward slash anything whatsoever
this is goal always going to be active
likewise this one if we inspect this if
we go to a forward slash ad and then
forward slash something else you know
and that was some kind of page then /add
would also still have this router link
active as well as this makes sense now
we can get around this all we need to do
is use a property called exact on both
of these and what that is going to do is
only make these active if the URL is
exactly this or exactly that not just
contains that make sense
so now if i refresh we can see only this
one has this class of the rattling
active and then only this one has the
class as well
okay so that is much better so there we
go we have set up some links for our
project and this is all starting to take
shape now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
