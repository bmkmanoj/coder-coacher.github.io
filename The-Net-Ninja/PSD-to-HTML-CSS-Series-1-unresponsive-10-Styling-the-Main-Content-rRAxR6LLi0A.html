to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 10 and
in this video we're going to start
styling the main content Wow
all right then gangster as you can see
we're exactly where we left off in the
last lesson we've style this header and
the banner now I want to start on this
main content right here so we've got
three sections remember we've got that
top section which is all this bit in
here then we've got the middle section
where we've got this image in the quote
and then we've got the bottom kind of
footer area so we're just going to
concentrate on these top two in this
video so the first thing I want to do is
style each of these sections because if
you remember from the HTML in the main
content here each of these three
sections is within a section tag and
what I want to do is just give each of
those sections a little bit of margin so
let's start with that we'll just write
our section tag like this that's our
select good because they're the only
three sections on the page right and
then we'll give each one a margin of
five pixels at the top zero right and
left and then 60 pixels at the bottom so
now we get that gap there at the top and
then 60 pixels between each section as
well alright cool so the next thing I
want to do is style this UL right here
so what I'm going to do is say section
and then the section of one is points of
sale so I'm going to grab the ID pop it
in there and then style the UL within
that so I want this have a list style
type of Nan because that will get rid of
these little dots cool so the next thing
I want to do is get rid of this h2 right
at the top because that's not on the
design so what I'm gonna do is come down
here I'm going to grab that points of
sale ID again and then the h2 within
that I'm gonna say height is zero and
then just to be safe I'm gonna say text
indent minus 10,000 pixels that's going
to get rid of it right off the page over
this way
alright cool the next thing I want to do
is style these allies because each of
these three
points of sale is within an allied
attack you can see here this one this
one and then another down here now what
goes to flow left next to each other and
each one to take up about 33% of width
okay so the like three equal columns so
to do that what I need to do is first of
all grab that Li oops not find I will
leave that there
so points of sale Li and then we'll
float each of these to the left now we
have to give them a specific width
because currently they're all 100% width
so they're not going to stack from left
to right at the minute so we'll give
each one a width of about 32% okay so
now we've got that little gap left at
the end but we're going to use that to
pop some margin between these elements
right here so they're not tight up
against each other so to do that all I
need to do is give this middle one a
left and right margin because that's
going to pop the spaces in right there
yep so let's say the points of sale Li
that we're going to use the pseudo plus
nth child and then this is the second
child yet because this is the first
second third so we want to get the
second one and then we want to stay this
is gonna have a margin of 0 top and
bottom and then to the left or right 2%
oops 2% and that's because it adds up
yeah the width of each element is 32% so
times up by three we've got 96 percent
which means there's four percent left
out of 100 so we can afford to give it a
percent of two to the left and two to
the right which adds up to four yeah so
the whole thing is now 100% alright then
so let's give us some space down here
and we'll start styling this text what I
want to do is say points of sale li h3
that's these titles right here I'm a
star those first of all first thing I'm
going to do is say text-align:center
bring him into the middle next thing
I'll give them a color of like a kind of
like a light or mid Tong ray which is
gonna be about eight eight eight it
might not be exactly the same on the
design but that doesn't matter to me at
the minute the next thing I want to do
is do a font size of about 24 pixels
font-weight:normal because by default
browser Styles give H 1 H 2 H 3 etc at
font-weight:bold so we're just taking
that off then we will give it a margin
at the bottom for around 10 pixels just
so there's a little space in between
this and the P tags all right so let's
style the P tags next so we'll come down
here and again we'll say points of sale
P this time and what we want to do is
align this in the center as well so text
align this Center well say the width is
80% because in the design it doesn't go
all the way across it kind of goes
slightly less than the width of this
image so I'll say width
80% but now that kind of Vez off to the
left we want it central so to do that
we'll say we'll give it a margin o 0
top and bottom and then 10% left and
right because 10 plus 10 plus 80 is 100
yes or same again we're using the 400%
e alright next I want to say we'll give
it a font size of about 14 pixels and
then a color again of 888 and then
finally I'm going to give it a line
height of about 1.4 and that's just
gonna space out a little bit vertically
like that alright then so that is the
top section done but as you can see now
this second section is skewed right up
to the top and that's because this
section has collapsed we've used floats
within it and like we saw in the header
when we use floats within a section that
section can collapse and I don't mean
the section tag I just mean any kind of
container if we use floats within that
container then the container will
collapse so if I find
points of sale let's just do this you
can see now the top one here has
collapsed it's literally got a height of
zero so we saw how to escape that in one
of the two towers where we did the head
up I'm going to do the same trick for
this right here so what we need to do is
get the section and I'm going to do the
same for each section not just this one
but each one alright because we're going
to have flopped in each different
section
so what I'll say is section pseudo-class
after and then I'm gonna say content
there's gonna be just pretty much
nothing just giving it some empty
content we're gonna display this as
block and then it's gonna clear both and
then pay attention to this right here
guys because it's gonna scoot down a
little bit in a second yeah you see that
now we've got that margin buck right and
if I hover over the sections again you
can see this has got its height but all
right cool so let's move on to this
second section and what we need to do is
this title this was like a green box and
we need to float this to the left and
this to the right so I'm not much to do
here the section is called clients I
think let's scoot down a lot yet aidid
plants so let's grab that I'm gonna copy
and then I'm gonna paste down here
plants and I'm gonna give this a border
top of one pixel solid and color of CCC
which is like a light grey can't see at
the minute because we've got this blue
border all free but if I come away from
this selector now you can see it alright
I'm also gonna give it a padding top
about 30 pixels just to bring the
content away from the border a little
bit so now you can see that little space
there alright so next thing I want to do
is style this h2 and if you remember
from the designs have like a green box
around it and it was in the middle of
this line right here so also clients h2
and the first thing I want to do is give
it a background color of green then the
text color was white
so that's FFF
padding will say about eight pixels just
give it a bit of space in the realm of
text text a line we want its central
self sensor and the width is going to be
about 250 pixels all right text
transform to uppercase um we'll say it's
gonna have a position of relative now
what I'm doing here is giving it a
relative position so what I can do is
now move this h2
relative to its initial position so if I
say top - 20 pixels it's gonna use its
initial position as a reference point
and go up 20 pixels all right so what I
can do now is say top I'll say about -
40 pixels that's not quite high enough
so say about minus 45 that's about right
yeah in the middle of that line alright
so we want to scoot it over to the left
as well right in the middle but to do
that we don't want to use an exact pixel
because it might change depending on how
wide the screen is so what I'm going to
do is give it a margin the property 0
top and bottom and then also to the left
them right and that's going to move it
into the middle alright because well we
have an element with a specific width
and a positional property of relative
then we give it a margin of auto to the
left and right that or automatically
gives the left or right margin and a
koala mount so that it kind of positions
it essentially yeah all right so the
next thing I want to do is give it a
border and the border is going to be
white and it's gonna be around here and
here you just saw it appears that the
line does it go right up to the Haiti -
so we'll say border left
we'll say about 16 pixels solid and FFF
which is white and then to the right as
well board and right 16 pixel or solid
FFF alright so now to go away from this
selector you can see here we've got
those little spaces or right there
pretty cool yeah all right so let's just
stop
things up right here you give us some
room at the bottom and I'm going to go
after this image first of all so it's
clients image we're gonna float that to
the left and it's gonna have a width of
about 30% we'll give it alright now
we'll style this quote right here so
clients block quote that's the tag name
right here we're gonna float this one to
the right like that we need to do it a
width I'm going to say about suit to the
six Peaks also not quite seventy because
I want there to be a little gap in
between here then I'm gonna give it a
margin top around 20 pixels just to
bring it down a little bit
text-align:center and the font style is
italic then we're going to give it a
slightly larger line height just to
space it out a little bit
we'll say line height is about one point
six and something like that that will do
the color is gonna be that great color
which is eight eight eight oops not
seven seven seven eight eight eight and
we'll give it a padding top of about
fifty pixels and this padding right here
is so we can insert that background an
image of the quotation mark right so
that's what we're gonna do now give it a
background URL and it's in the images
folder forward slash Walt yeah it's
found it right there then it's gonna be
no repeat we don't want it to repeat
over and over and top left position
which he was automatically but I just
like to kind of put it in explicitly
just in case any of the styles might
override it who knows alright then so
that is my friends the two top sections
completely done alright
next lesson we're going to move on to
this final bit here which is more like
the footer and then it's job done guys
I'll see you in that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
