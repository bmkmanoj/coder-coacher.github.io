animations tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about transitions
Wow
alright then gang so what the hell is a
transition well basically they're like
the most simple way to do some kind of
animation on a page but they're not
technically part of the whole CSS
animation camp right what they do
basically is they transition an element
from one state to another
all right in a certain way over a set
amount of time so for example say we
have this cloud right say this is way
over here on the left and what we want
to do is make it look like a windy day
so we want that cloud to go from the
left to the right over a set amount of
time we want it's kind of drift to the
right
yep well what we can do is we can use a
CSS transition to go from the first
state to the second state and we can set
the options about how we want that
transition to occur such as how long we
want it to occur to take timing
functions the delay etc okay so that's
what transitions are all about going
from one state to another and how the
element transitions between the two now
I'm not going to go through that example
in this tutorial I want to do something
a little more practical so what I've
done is creating this dude right over
here it's just a div with the class of
circle and it says hover me right so
this is just going to be an element on a
webpage this thing here could be a
button or something like that and what
we're going to do is we're going to
apply some transition effects when we
hover over this button so if you look in
the CSS what I've done is just create
some basic styles at the minute give it
a width of 100 some padding blank height
of 0 or this is just to make it into a
perfect circle then give it a bit of
margin background color is going to be
pinked again with this is what we're
going to transition to begin with the
text is white border radius of 50 pixels
to give it a circular effect and then
the cursor is pointer so the first thing
I want to do is just give this a Hava
state right so let's say circle hover
and then we're going to just change the
background color so we'll change it from
pink to salmon all right so now if I
save you
obviously it just kind of flicks to that
salmon color when we hover over so this
is the first state where it's just pink
and this is the second state of the
element right where it's salmon now what
we want to do is make a transition so
that this is a little more subtle and it
kind of blends from one color into the
other so that's when we'd use a CSS
transition so all we need to do is come
to the element we want to apply the
transition to which is this thing right
here yet circle element and we say
transition that's the property name and
then we pass through some options on how
we want this transition to occur so to
begin with I'm just going to pass
through one option which is the time so
I'm saying right here I want this to
take one second and whatever we change
from state one which is this to stay to
which is the hover State then I want
that to transition over one second right
not straight away as was the case before
this when it just kind of flipped from
one color to the other but I want it to
take one second so now when I hover
you'll see it gradually fade in and out
a little more so on yeah cool so this is
going to affect everything we change on
this element for example if I say
transform and then what we want to do is
rotate it and we want to rotate it 360
degrees so it's going to do a full turn
right it's going to spin round once now
this transition here this 1 second is
going to apply to every thing that we
change so it's going to apply to this
and it's going to apply to this so it's
going to rotate 360 degrees over the
course of one second as well and I can
demonstrate that like so okay pretty
cool now what if we want a different
kind of transition time for this one
then we do for this what we can do that
we can specify what effect we want this
one second - you know transition over so
right now we want this one second to
apply to the background like so now if I
hover over this you'll notice you don't
get that spin effect because it's
happening automatically
is doing the full sweep around 360
degrees
it looks like it's not changing that's
because we've only applied now this
transition to the background property if
we want to also apply a transition to
this we can do we can just change it on
the end and we can say now we want to
transition the transform effect and we
want that to take nine point three
seconds so that's much quicker now if I
hover over you're going to see that
circular motion much quicker than the
fading in and out of the background so
now we've got two separate transitions
controlling two different things so if
you want the transition to control every
different property that changes you
don't need to supply these keywords on
what you want to change you just say
something like one second like that and
that's going to control everything
otherwise you have to specify which
properties you want to control and you
know give them different options if you
like so so far we've said we want the
background and the transform to be
transitioned over these times we can
also pass through other parameters if we
like where we can pass through a delay
so I could say on this one I want a one
second delay so always the first number
you supply is the transition time and
the second number you supply is the
delay right so what I'm saying here is
this one is going to fire first because
it's going to take one second this has
got one second delay so it's essentially
going to wait for this to finish and
then go around in at nine point three
seconds so the whole thing is going to
take one point three seconds right so we
can see that there we go like so okay so
there are three parameters we can pass
through to the transition property I'm
going to show you one more and that is
the timing function so we could say
something like linear this is how the
transition kind of goes so linear means
it never speeds up and it never slows
down and if I go over this now you'll
notice that the the twirl effect just is
a kind of constant rate in fact what I'm
going to do is just change this to one
second also so you can see clearer and
you'll see it's a steady ray all the way
around okay
never speeds up never slows down but if
I change this to ease in then what
that's going to do is start off slower
gradually speed up so now if I hover
over starts off slower then speeds up
okay starts off slow and speed up so
there's a few different timing functions
we can use we can use easing and we can
use ease out or just ease and they're
all going to do different things so you
can ever play around with DOS you want
to do so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to ask those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
