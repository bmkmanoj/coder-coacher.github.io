fourth CSS tips and tricks tutorial and
in this video I'm going to show you a
cool way to create a CSS only drop-down
menu okay so first of all as always I've
uploaded all of my course files to my
github accounts and you can find them
for this video in the CSS tips and
tricks repository I'm going to leave
this link down below what you need to do
is make sure you run the correct branch
first of all 0 for CSS only drop-down
menu the files are located inside this
folder right here so if you click on
that you're going to find some image
files right here and the index and
styles file as well okay so that's the
finished code so let's get cracking on
with the code and by the way a museum
item for my text editor and I've also
got a package called atom live server
installed on this this is going to let
me spin up a local server on port 3000
so it can preview my index file in this
browser ok so if you want to do that
just install that then all you need to
do is press ctrl alt 3 and that's going
to spin up the server as well for you ok
so inside this image folder we just have
two images these are on my github
account like I said we have a closed
icon that's the big enough for the
closed state of the menu and we also
have an open icon which is across which
we're going to click on to close the
menu so we're just going to be using
those two images and yet we could
probably start these in CSS but since
this video is not about that I'm just
using images to speed it up ok so we
also have an index file over here and
it's just basically a blanket index file
at the minute all I've done inside here
is add a title and also a link to a
stylesheet over here on the left
we've not done anything in the body yet
this style sheet has in it just one rule
at the minute it styles the body and all
we're doing is giving this a background
color of a light gray giving the whole
page a font family of Arial font weight
of bold a color of this kind of purply
shade and then a font size of 18 pixels
right so the first thing I want to do
now is start creating the HTML of this
menu that we're going to create so first
of all let's create some kind of
surrounding element some kind of rough
and for this menu so I'm going to create
a give to do that I'm going to give this
a class equal to drop-down menu just
like that and this is going to surround
the whole menu now okay
so inside we need to do a few things
first of all I'm going to actually add
the menu content the links if you like
okay so to do that I'm going to create a
div and I'm going to give this a class
equal to menu - content so this is going
to surround all of the different links
and these links are going to be
displayed in an unordered list so
instead of me writing out all of these
links what I'm going to do is just
quickly paste them in instead and as you
can see just the UL tag series of Li
tags and inside anchor tags with a whole
about store contact and blog link does
it really matter that they're not
linking anywhere so this is our menu
content what is going to be displayed in
the menu when it is dropped down when it
shows if you like or when it's open now
the way we're going to do this using
only CSS is by using an input and a
label right so normally when we create
some kind of drop-down menu when we
click on a button to open it and close
it we've used jQuery JavaScript or some
other kind of library now in this
tutorial we're going to use any of that
all we're going to do is stick to CSS
and there's a really cool way we can
kind of mimic this click event using CSS
and that is using an input field and a
label so first of all I'm going to
create this input field and I'm going to
explain why we're using this in a minute
so this input field is going to have a
type equal to checkbox right and then
we're going to give this an ID as well
equal to menu okay so now we have this
check box we want a label as well so
I'll say label and then it's going to be
four equals and then it's going to be
equal to whatever ID we set here
all right so this is a label and we just
felt like in correctly a label for this
particular checkbox right so when I type
tables now or menu here what this is
going to do is associate this label with
this input so as we click on this label
it's going to check this box right
because we've made this Association
here so let's just give this some text
inside the label I'm going to call this
menu never save this now we can view it
over here we can see this check box and
I'm going to zoom in just a little bit
so you can see that these check box
right here you can see when we click on
the check box itself it checks it right
and also when we click on the menu it
checks it as well so we've made that
association when we click on the label
it checks the box and unchecked it all
right so now that is all we need to do
for the HTML we just need to style it
something else so that when we click on
this it opens this stuff when we click
on it again it hides this stuff right so
let's go to the Styles dot CSS to do
that so the first thing I want to do is
just start this concept first of all all
right so let's just do some basic styles
for this so we're going to target the
drop-down menu and then inside here what
I'm going to do is give this a
background of white just so it stands
out a little bit from the gray
background of the page so say background
is going to be FFF also going to give
this some padding we'll say about 20
pixels all the way around we're also
going to give this a border bottom so
it's going to have like a thin strip of
purple at the bottom so to say that I'll
do border bottom will be 2 pixels and
solid and then finally it's going to be
a hex code of 6 0 3 B 7 B that's the
same color as this text right here okay
also going to give this a box shadow
just so it jumps out from the page a
little bit as well so I'll say box
shadow can be one pixel 2 pixels 3
pixels then we're going to give it a
background of RGB a so we can use this
alpha channel right here and give it
some kind of a paucity and it will be
black which is 0 0 0 and then not point
to you for the apostate okay so let's
save that now we can see it stands out a
little bit this menu from the page and
we have this border at the bottom as
well which is quite cool alright so by
the way this is not going to be the
greatest-looking menu you're ever going
to see that's not the part of this
tutorial I just want to show you this
functionality of a drop-down menu
without using javascript so anyway now
what I want to do is stand up the UL a
little bit so I'm going to copy this
dude
come down here and take it in again and
then we want to sell the UL begin it
so this ul is going to have a list -
style I can type of non that is going to
get rid of these little spots right here
so we don't want those and we also want
to remove the planning so I'll take
having is zero so we save that now we
get rid of the spots and we move
everything left so it's flush to the
side of the venue okay so the next thing
you want to do is style up the links
inside so again I'm going to paste this
drop down menu in and say a for the
links and inside this what we want to do
is display them first of all is the lock
so that we can say we want a padding of
10 pixels all the way around now and
then we want to give this a text
decoration of Nan which means it's going
to remove that underline effect so if I
save this now then it looks a bit better
we're also going to color these the same
color as this purple so I'm going to say
color purple and now it looks something
like that okay so the next thing we want
to do is style this thing right here
because most menus aren't controlled by
this kind of checkboxes don't have a
tick for open and then a none tick for
close right you want some kind of image
and we're going to use these images
right here so this one which has a kind
of burger icon in and then this one for
when the menu is open so we click on
this to close it again make sense so
that's what we're going to do we're
going to use those two images and we're
going to style this ting right here okay
so the way we're going to do that is by
coming down here and saying drop down
menu and then the label first of all
inside it we're going to display this as
block first of all right so it becomes a
block level element now we're also going
to say cursor is going to be pointer
which means when we hover over it it's
going to have a hand instead of this
little arrow okay so if I save it now
you'll see that so you can see this
little hand now when we hover over which
says we can click it we're also going to
give this a background image and it's
going to be that closed icon source a
background
is going to be URL and inside we need to
pass through the path to the image which
is in the image folder forward slash
closed
de we're also going to say we don't want
this to repeat I'll say no - repeat we
only want to show this image once and if
we want it to be on the left and Center
up and down so if I save this now we can
see this icon behind it right here but
it still doesn't look quite right so
what I want to do now is come down here
and say padding is going to be and it's
going to be 30 pixels for the top zero
to the right 30 pixels to the bottom and
then 80 pixels to the left that's going
to give this image room to breathe so we
click Save now we can see that image
right there and it looks big because I'm
zoomed in but if I restore this back to
default it's a little smaller okay so
there's our image for this menu icon
right now we want to get rid of this
thing right here we don't want that -
she'll do it so let's now say input and
then it has an ID of menu and we're
going to say display not right but
before I do that if i click on this
remember this is a label this is being
checked right every project again it's
been unchecked so even if we set this to
display non when we click this it's
being checked in the background and it's
been unchecked when we click again so
now we have this check and uncheck state
when we're clicking on this icon right
here and we can use that state to style
things differently right because we can
use a checked pseudo class to style
something so I'm going to come down here
and what I'm going to do is create first
of all a little comment which is going
to be total effect so now what we can
say is we want that import and we want
to detect when it's checked right so
this pseudo class of checked which is a
colon and then checked is going to apply
when this import has a ticket when it's
been checked or when we've clicked on
this right now we don't want to star the
actual import what we want to do is
style listing right here okay we want it
to be come across when it's open so what
I'm going to do
is use the general sibling selector so
that looks something like this if this
little squiggly line first of all right
and then whatever the sibling selector
is so in our case it's going to be dots
or rather just a label so let me just go
back to the HTML to explain this so
right here we have this input right and
when it's checked we're saying okay well
grab the input then grab the general
sibling which is the label and a general
sibling will match up to anything that
is on the same level as the original
element so you feel like these two are
on the same level right but this URL is
not these are this URL is nested one
level deeper but when we use the general
sibling selector we can say okay we want
to grab the input use a general sibling
selector to grab an element which is on
the same level which comes after the
inputs and then we can use a different
selector for each one of these a label
or menu content which is what we've done
we've done it for the label right here
make sense so now we're targeting this
label and we'd explain it differently or
styling it differently when the input
box is checked or when this thing is
clicked okay so when this is checked
what do we want to do we want to change
the background image to the cross
so we'll say background is going to be a
URL and this time it's image and then
forward slash open dot PNG and then we
also want to set this to no-repeat and
left center for the position so if I
save this now if I click this is going
to censor the cross then it's going to
turn back to the Bergin up cross big
enough and that it just because this
input is being checked and then
unchecked and it's been spelled
differently because we're using this
pseudo class and the general sibling
selector make sense cool
so we also now want this to close and
open so by default we want this close
right so to do that what we're going to
have to do is come up here and at the
top I'm just going to say menu
contents remember the menu content was
listing right here which contains all
the links so by default what I want to
do is give this a height of zero or a
max I think height of zero right so if I
do that and save it then okay the height
of this is zero but it's still showing
these things and that's because we have
to set the overflow to hidden so I'm
going to say now overflow is hidden then
we don't see those things right let me
click on this we get the cross but we're
still not showing the links so now what
I want to do down here in the toggle
effect is this time say input checked so
we're saying when the input is checked
again again we're going to use the
general sibling selector but this time
we're going to grab to this general
sibling right here the menu content it's
still on the same level and it comes
after the input so we can do that so
it's menu content so let's go back to
the Styles I'll say dot menu - content
and this time what we want to do is give
this a MUX
as an height of 100 percent so we're
saying it can be open okay it does have
a height so now when I click on this it
opens when I click on it again it closes
there we go and you've got a fully
functioning menu which is drop-down
based on a click event and we're not
using any JavaScript whatsoever
so you can make this better you could
probably incorporate some kind of
animation effect on this icon or the as
well menu coming down I'll leave you to
either play around with that if you do
have any good demos of what you've done
