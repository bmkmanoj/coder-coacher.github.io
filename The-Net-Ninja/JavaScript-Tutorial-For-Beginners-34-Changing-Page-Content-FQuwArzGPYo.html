JavaScript for beginners lesson 34 and
in this video witness that changing up
some content using the Dom Wow alright
then guys so as you can see I've gone
right to the nettinger website and i've
got the elements panel at the top here
and then the console panel at the bottom
so what we're going to do is start
changing some of this content using the
Dom now to do that we have to follow two
steps first step we covered in the last
lesson it's grabbing which other element
we want to change the content of okay
the second step is using different
methods to change that content now I'm
going to show you two methods in this
video and the first one is going to be
inner HTML okay so first of all let's
grab an element and I'm going to just
grab this body tag for simplicity so we
know we have to store it in a variable
if we want to later on call methods on
this variable so we'll do that we'll say
my body equals document get elements by
tag name and then we'll pass in body
because that's the tag that we want I'll
ask a store that tag in that variable
Forest so if I call my body should
return an array yep with just that body
tag in it so to get that tag and use
properties on it we have to use array
notation we'd say my body and then in
square brackets 0 and that's going to
get the first element within that array
Forest so this one right here then we
can use methods on it and Caesar method
we'll just do our dots and then the
method name is called inner and then in
capitals HTML okay so if I just call
this without doing anything else at all
that then is going to return back
towards the whole HTML content within
the body tag the whole inner HTML of the
body tag so I'll press ENTER and you can
see right there I get all this data
right here which is all the HTML in the
body tag ok well that's alright but not
much used to us what if I want to change
it I want to give it some different HTML
instead of this right here and I can use
in HTML to do that also I'll say my my
body 0 dot in
HTML equals and I'm going to put the new
HTML within these quotation marks and
I'm just going to do something really
simple I'm going to say P and I am a
paragraph tag just like that dead easy
then I'm gonna close that pew tag off so
if I click enter now that should replace
this current HTML all this inner HTML of
the body tag with this HTML here so
let's press ENTER and we Purdue we've
done it right here now that is a pretty
extreme example we're not going to do
that very often but this is just to show
you how you can take an element from
your web page and change the inner HTML
of that element so you could change the
header section you know you could put
different H tags or a navigation section
and put different a tags within there so
that's what we do we'd use the inner
HTML method to change the HTML of tags
on our page all right so let's refresh
over here to get the original page back
and this time I want to show you the
second method which is called the text
content method and this is similar to
the inner HTML but it only changes the
text content not the HTML tags so say
for example you want to change the a
links different you want to put
different links in you'd use in a hasty
ml because you're passing through a tax
right if you just want to change the
text on say a h1 or h2 like this here
you'd use the text content method
alright so let's do that now we'll say
VAR my title and then we're going to go
after this title right here so I'll
write play inspect that and we can see
it's got an ID of page title so we'll
use document dot get element by tag nerd
by ID rather and we're passing the ID
which is right here page title page -
title and that's going to store it in a
variable for us and this time remember
it's not in an array it's just the one
element itself because only one ID can
be given to each page right so we can
use methods and properties directly on
this variable without using the bracket
notation so we'll say Mike
I talk dot text content right there and
see what that returns to us and there we
go it gives us this text content which
is what is displayed right here now if
we want to change that we can do so we
can say my title text content and then
we use the equal sign and we set it
equal to a new string and that string is
just going to be your ninjas get ready
to learn room okay and now you can see
it's changed the text content right up
here and here so that is the text
content method alright guys so they are
two pretty simple methods you can start
using to change the content of your
webpage remember there's two steps first
of all grab the element that you one
second use the method on that element
that you want to either change the HTML
or the content the text content of that
element if you have any questions for
you're free to comment down below answer
any of those otherwise guys if you enjoy
