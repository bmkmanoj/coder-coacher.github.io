CSS positioning or lesson 10 and in this
video I want to talk about fixed
positioning Wow all right then going so
we've looked at relative positioning and
we've looked at absolute positioning now
I want to take a look at fixed
positioning and to do that I want to
create a navigation system so what I've
done is at the bottom of this wrapper
underneath these two columns I've just
put in a nav element right there then it
UL then a few Ally tags each with a bit
of text in it so it's just looking like
this in a minute now I've stabbed these
allied tags with a list style type of
knob and a margin of top and bottom of 0
and left over out of 10 so what I want
to do is just stir this up a little bit
first of all I'm going to start with the
nav and I'm going to make that a
background of three three three like a
dark gray okay and I think I'll give it
a padding of five pixels all right so
what I want to do now is come down to
these allies I'm going to make the color
of them white so they stand out a little
bit more and I'm going to float each one
to the left like that but you'll notice
when I do that in fact I float them to
the right you'll notice want to do that
this nav collapses and that's because
these elements within a nav are floating
and we've not played the floats but
remember we can use that clear fix
technique that I showed you a few
episodes back are a few tutorials but
rather where we take the parent element
and we insert an empty content string
into it using CSS and then we cleared up
okay so let's do that let's grab this ul
will say now ul and then use the seal
class after and what we're going to do
is insert that content an empty string
give it a display type of block and then
clear both okay and that's going to
restore that height of the now all right
there so that's how I want it to look
but now what I want to do is position
this right at the top and it's going to
be fixed at the top so that want to
scroll down it stays there
so to do this all I need to do is give
this nav element a fixed position I'll
say position fixed and then what I want
to do is give it a top and where is it
I've lost it give it a top value of zero
and a left value of zero and then I want
to give it a width of 100% and it's
going to span across the whole page then
so now guys this navigation stays at the
top no matter how far I scroll down okay
so what I've done is I've given it a
fixed position and where as absolute is
positioned relative to its parent
container which has a position of
relative attached the fixed position
always positions itself relatively to
the document window okay so this is zero
zero top left this is zero zero top
right so if I put top 20 pixels in are
200 I'll put 20 pixels to begin with
it's positioning itself 20 pixels from
the top of the window if I put left 20
pixels is positioning itself 20 pixels
away from the left makes sense right so
that is commonly used for menu systems
like this to fix it at the top so you've
always got that navigation there right
so that is how we use the fixed and by
the way when we used position fix this
is taken out of normal document flow
also so it no longer occupies that space
down here at the bottom now the reason
I've got the scroll bar at the bottom
here is because I gave this some padding
if I take off that padding that should
no longer do that yeah it's gone away
now that's just because it was already
100% and we applied padding to it as
well so it was going over the 100%
weight all right guys so that is how we
use the position fixed property in CSS
we have any questions whatsoever feel
