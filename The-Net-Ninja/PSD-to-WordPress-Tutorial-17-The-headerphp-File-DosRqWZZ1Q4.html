PSD to WordPress a less of 17 and in
this video I'm going to walk you through
the header dot PHP template Wow alright
then guys so on the right over here
we've got our static HTML from the
design that we built and on the Left
we've got the headed up PHP file and
remember this headed up PHP file is the
content that gets dumped at the top of
pretty much every page wherever we use
the get headed function for example on
the index file we've got to get header
function right there so that's calling
the header template and it's loading all
of this content at the top okay so this
is going to be pretty much at the top of
every page in your WordPress site so
let's go down bit by bit and transfer
things across start off with the doctype
which we've got over there that's fine
then the HTML tag with some cool
language attributes we can keep that in
it's pretty clever then we've got the
head tag we've not got the title in here
so we'll put it in title and then its
rest oh cool and then we go further down
we've got some meta tags this is all
kind of dynamic data which is pulled in
from WordPress so that's pretty cool we
can keep that then this tag right here
WP head is important we need to keep
this above the closing head tag because
this loads in any JavaScript off things
like that that are needed by plugins
that we install as well as a couple of
other cool things so we're going to keep
that in that's pretty important
all right so that's the end of the head
we're fine with that jump down to the
body it's going to insert some dynamic
body classes for us which is fine no
problem against that then right here
we've got the div with an ID of page I
don't see why we can't keep that I mean
if not got it over here but it's always
helpful to have this at the top just to
contain everything and plus the style
dot CSS that came with this theme maybe
using it so let's keep it then we've got
this skip to content link which is
pretty useful for screen readers so
we're going to keep that in as well and
now we get to the head which is where
we're going to start changing some
things so over here we've got all this
stuff here we don't need the class in
the ID you can see over here we've not
got that and it doesn't need a roll of
planet either so let's just get rid of
all that stuff there and have the head
attack on its own now underneath that
we've got div or the class of sight
Brandon over here we've got a class of
rapper so let's change that as well to a
rapper and then what WordPress is doing
now is a quick if statement to check
whether we're on the front page and it's
the home alright so if it is a plus h1
otherwise the outputs of P now all this
stuff we don't really care about because
we want this h1 with a class of logo no
matter which page we're on all right so
we can delete all that and we can also
delete this description stuff right here
so let's get rid of all of that code
right there okay so now we're just left
with that wrapper tag which is empty and
let's copy this page 1 and put it within
the rutter ok cool next we need this nav
and the nav is down here so we can grab
that stuff let's copy it and paste it
underneath there like that now we don't
really need this ID and we don't need
that class we can delete those we can
keep in the role of navigation and
that's absolutely fine then underneath
that we don't need the button now we
want to transfer this main navigation h2
min so we'll copy that and paste it in
here like that and then this PHP
function is basically just loading in
the menu from the backend of WordPress
remember when I showed you a quick tour
of the WordPress back-end I said we
could edit the menu item to create a
custom menu all this is doing is go in
there and it's grabbing one of those
menus which is called the primary menu
ok and it's going to output that in an
unordered list a bit like this so we can
keep this as dynamic so that it gives us
more control in the backend if we want
to add links or remove links rather than
coming in and changing the HTML over
time okay so this is like a smart part
of WordPress that we're going to keep in
instead of this but the output is going
to be very similar so it's gonna style
pretty much the same way ok so this here
is the end of the nerve let's scoop that
across a little bit
and this is the end of the or rapper
let's just change that to rapper alright
so then the head is closed as well
change that to header alright and I
think that will pretty much do it for
this file this ID of content here is
gonna start the main content of the page
we can keep that in I have no qualms
about that because again the base CSS
file may be using this ideal class to
style some of the base elements on the
page so we'll keep that in and yeah
let's take a look at how that looks in
the browser so before unstyled and
rather before we had the our HTML moved
across it looks something like this now
if we refresh we're going to start to
see things coming shape we've got the
logo at the top left we've got the
navigation coming in at the top right
now there's only one page to begin with
but we're gonna add more later as we go
on and then this will populate across
like that all right so that's the header
and that's going to appear at the top of
every page pretty cool
in the next tutorial I want to go into
the footer dot PHP file and code that up
so I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
