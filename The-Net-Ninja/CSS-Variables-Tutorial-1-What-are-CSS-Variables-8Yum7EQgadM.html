lesson in using CSS variables alright
then so I decided to do a miniseries
about CSS variables because I definitely
think they can come in handy when you're
working with large websites with huge
repetitive stashies
for example if you are coding a large
website and you've got this huge
stylesheet there may be many values that
you use over and over and over in your
statute such as certain colors or font
sizes or margin values so for example in
this case we've got three different
rules but there may be 20 different
rules in your case using the same color
for their fonts now that's fine
but if you ever come to update that
color if you want to change the look of
your website then you're going to have
to change every single instance that
this color occurs in your stylesheet and
that might be in 20 to 30 different
rules now it would make much more sense
I think in my opinion to just have one
variable which stores that value this
code right here and then we say in each
of these selectors we want to use that
variable so if we ever want to change
the look of our website and we want to
change that value we don't have to
change it in every single one of these
different selectors we just change it
once where we declared the variable and
then that updates each one of these
because they're all saying we want to
use that variable for this value so that
makes much more sense now I guess you
could use sass or less to use variables
and accomplish this too but not every
single development stack that you will
work on will be using these technologies
and besides when you use CSS variables
unlike sass unless there's no
transpiling needed from sass into CSS
which is one less task for you to do and
of course CSS variables can do more than
just store simple values as well things
that sass and less can do and we'll find
out exactly what those things are
later on now CSS variables are also
known as custom properties and you'll
probably see that if you read the w3c
specification on them
and that's because when we're making
variables in CSS we are in fact making
custom CSS properties and they look like
regular CSS properties board but with a
double dash before them so something
like this double dash my property and
then the value so that looks like a
regular CSS property except it has this
double dash in front of it but they're
one and the same thing a CSS variable is
just a custom property it's just that
more people talk about this in terms of
CSS variables and that's what I'll be
using as we go forward but I wanted you
to know just in case you came across
custom properties mentioned in the
future that they are one and the same
thing CSS variables are custom
properties so then throughout this
series we'll be working on a little
one-page demo site that I've already
made and this is a seriously simple
website and by the way I would suggest
that you know HTML and CSS before you go
forward with this course that's kind of
a given but I just wanted to make sure
that you have an understanding of those
two things first of all so anyway
dead simple HTML with a nav some main
content some different content spots and
a bit of content in the footer as well
so that and this are already included in
the course files I'll show you where
they are in a minute what we're going to
be doing is working on CSS variables at
the top over here but at the minute this
site looks something like this so very
very simple and the course files can be
found on my github repository called CSS
variables I'm going to leave the link
right down below and you can choose
whichever lesson you want from the
brunch drop-down here so for example if
you want to see the code for a lesson to
select that brunch and you'll see the
code right here okay so you can use
those if you want to follow along with
me if you like and by the way I'm using
Adam for my text editor you can find
that item i-i'll leave the link down
below so finally when it comes to
browser support at the time of this
recording CSS variables are quite widely
supported with all major browsers having
no issues all major browsers of course
except Internet X
Laure as usual however edge is supported
so anyway there's your introduction to
CSS variables now please my friends if
you do enjoy these videos do not forget
to share subscribe and like that really
means a lot to me and I'm going to see
you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
