and getup tutorial and in this video I
want to show you how to start on giving
stuff for when it all goes wrong okay so
this is kind of the stage where at the
minute well we've made some commits to
our master branch and although those
commits might not represent these
commits which are on the screen we're
still added about three or four so far
so we're at the point now where I want
to show you how to start kind of
rewinding things or in doing things if
you've made mistakes or just if you
wanted
so say for example you're right here in
the code you've made these commits and
your boss comes to you and says hey
actually can we rewind this to about
here I'm going to show you how to do
things like that and we're going to do
these things using three different
methods checkout commit revert commit
and reset them in now the reason the
colored like this is because they're in
order of danger so this one right here
is green because it's completely not
dangerous and very safe and it's not
going to let you edit anything in any
shape or form or ruin your commit
history this one right here revert
commit is still very very safe but
potentially not quite as safe but you
know still very safe this one here at
reset is unsafe basically and you want
to be sure that you need to use this
before you do because potentially it
could ruin your repository okay so how
do these three different methods work
well first of all check out commit so
say you're here at the code and you hand
it off to your boss and your boss says
can we just go back in time I just want
to see what the code was like for
example at this commit and you with your
newfound knowledge can say yeah I can do
that I can use any check out commit to
check out this commit and what it's
going to do is show me in my text editor
the code at this point in time when I
made this commit okay but any changes
that I do here while I'm checking out
this commit they're not going to be
saved
this is read-only so I'm not going to be
able to destroy the commit history or
alter in any way shape or form so that's
why it's really sixth this second one
here revert basically it lets us undo a
particular commit so again say for
example you're here you hand it to your
boss and he says actually don't really
like this slider can you revert that
commit you can say yeah I can do that so
revert commit is going to basically put
a big X through this commit as though it
never happened
it's going to revert the changes of this
okay so almost kind of like delete it
out of the commit Jane
it doesn't delete it and we'll see how
it works later but the effects are the
same it's like it never existed okay so
the last one
reset commit is the danger one and what
that's going to do is kind of
permanently take you back in time to a
particular commit so again you're here
your boss says actually we don't need
any of these three last commits can you
go back to here and we're never going to
use these three commits again you can
use a reset commit to do that you can
reset to this commit and it's going to
permanently delete all of these commits
and your code is going to go back to how
it was at this point in time okay so I'm
going to see examples of all these
different three commands now okay then
so I'm still in the get one repository
and what I've done for the sake of this
tutorial is just adding two more commits
so I'll do a git log to show you those
git log and then on one line and you can
see these five commits in total so the
new ones have added is this added new
feature which is just a simple
JavaScript file okay and the second one
I did was on the index file which was
added a heading to the index file right
there
so I made those two commits now what
we're going to do is start rewinding so
the first one your boss comes to you and
says ok I want to see the state of the
code in and earlier commit so I want to
see the state of the code for example in
this commit right here where you added
the index title well you can use
checkout to do that so the way we do
that is by saying get and then checkout
and then you need to tell git which kind
of commit you want to check out and the
way we do that is by referencing this
thing right here this unique ID so I'm
going to copy that and I'm just going to
paste it down here below
so if I click enter now just check out
this thing on the left it's going to
change okay it deleted that right there
for a start
now this JavaScript files got as well
and we're basically seeing the code in
the state it was in
and this commit right here okay where we
just added the index title so that's
this thing so any changes we do here are
read-only we're not going to alter the
committees to in any way shape or form
so this is really good for going back in
time seeing the state of the code at one
particular commit
now one we finish the way we get back to
you know the top of the stat is by
saying get check out muster a muster is
the brunch now we're going to see
branches later so don't worry too much
about this now we just say we want to
check out the master branch again
because what we did was detached when
the master branch to go to a particular
commit so now we're reattached to the
master branch at the head of the master
branch okay and now we see that Cody oh
okay cool so that is how we kind of just
go back in time using git checkout the
second thing I want to show you is get
revert I remember get revert basically
kind of on doors one particular commit
so again let's do it get logs to see
what we've got and they're going to all
go on one line so we've still got all of
these different commits now your boss
says to you well I tell you what you see
this new feature right here I want to
undo that I don't want that new feature
anymore you can say to him I'm going to
use a deep revert to do them so the way
we do this is get revert and again we
need to say which commit and it's this
thing or right here so when it copies up
dude and paste it in and press Enter now
you get this scary screen or right here
don't be put off this is basically just
kind of like a text editor and it's
asking you to give this commit a title
because it's making a new commit forest
and I'll explain this in a minute so you
can see the changes to be committed
we're going to delete that feature jas
file right because that was the commit
we want to kind of undo so what I'm
going to do to get out of this screen we
don't need to change anything in the
screen right to get out of it you want
to press shift and :
so we get this little sign at the bottom
then press WQ press enter and it goes
out so what's happened now is we've
removed that feature GS file right now
if I do a git log and then one-line what
you're going to see is actually we've
not removed that to me what we're doing
is just added a new commit called revert
added new feature so what this commit
here is done as basically undoing
anything that we did in this thing right
here so say for example we added the
JavaScript file here and we say we want
to revert this commit then what it does
is it makes a new commit
which reverse it on doors anything that
was made in here okay so we still have
access to this commit in the history
it's just reverting it at the top okay
and that's why it took us through to the
text editor because it's asking us if we
want to add a new message for that
particular commit makes sense cool so
that's how we kind of undo one
particular commit using git revert
now the last thing I want to show you is
the git reset and this is the thing that
is going to potentially destroy the
contents of your repository so be really
careful you want to do this so anyway
this is our log and your boss comes to
you and says okay you know what these
last four commits right here we don't
need them anymore so what I want you to
do is go back in time take the code to
this point in time and just work from
there again okay so the way we do this
is by saying git reset then we say which
can make we want to reset to which is
this thing right here
so I'm going to copy that dude and paste
it in now if we were to hit enter now
although it would take us down here it'd
give us a message just show you give us
a message saying we've got some unstaged
changes right the index and the style
file so basically what that means is
we've gone back inside of this commit
but it's not changed our working
directory everything we did after is
still here right but they're not
committed if I do a git log I said git
log one-line
then we're not going to see those extra
commits we've only got these two but the
changes that we made in these commits
they're still hanging around in our
editor right just in case so if we
changed our mind we could re add
individual files or all of the files and
commit them again so I suppose this
could be good if you want to kind of
take all of these commits and put them
into one you can add them all here and
make another commit or if you want to
rewind in time and actually you know not
preserve these changes what you do is
get then it's a reset then it's a branch
again I'm just going to hit up because
we can get that command again cycle
through them and then once we've
specified which commit we want to go to
we're passing the higher flags and what
this is going to do is take us back to
that particular commit but because
you're passing the
like it's not going to retain any kind
of changes from the commits afterwards
right in the editor so if I click that
now then you'll see them disappear okay
so now we no longer have those things
and this if we are innovating no longer
going to be in the folder right here in
the stars we only have that one style
right there as well and I tell you what
I'll just go right back to the start
here so let's copy that dude if we can
just throw my guard grab it okay
control see I'm just going to get rid of
that and that over here now if I say get
reset and then the particular commit I
want to go to the first one
and then say hard what that is going to
do is potentially take away the index
title right so press Enter
now if we open up the index we no longer
see the title right and if we do a git
log one-line we only see that one coming
and guess what there's no way now of me
getting back those commits that come
afterwards they're permanently deleted
and that is why I said be very careful
if you're ever using this git reset
because it could potentially ruin all of
your files or delete them all okay so
there we go that's how we kind of rewind
go back to all the revisions of code to
see them etc now we know how to do that
what I want to do is introduce in the
next tutorial the concept of branching
which is going to let us work on new
features in our projects without editing
the kind of core code based on the
master branch okay
so I'll see you in that very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
