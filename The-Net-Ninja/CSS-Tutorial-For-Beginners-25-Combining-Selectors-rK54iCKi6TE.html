is CSS for beginners lesson 25 and in
this video we're going to talk all about
combining selectors that's coming up Wow
alright then I'm back here in the HTML
and as you can see I've changed it once
again and this time I've got two
articles at the top this one here and
this one here two div tags at the bottom
with images in between bit of a gallery
and the top article has got a class of
featured content and the top div has got
a class of featured content now see we
want a style the featured content
article differently and the div of
featured content differently but we
don't necessarily want these two style
the same because this is an article
after all and this is gonna be an image
so how do we do this well we can't just
have one rule
Sagat in the class at the featured
content and then style that because
that's gonna take both of these and stab
them the same we don't want that we want
to stand them differently and so what we
do is we'd combine our selectors and
what I mean by this is this first of all
we'll start with the articles we want to
take the article text and if we put
styles in this it's gonna start both
this and this we don't want that we want
just the article tag it's gonna be
featured content so the way we do this
is by combining our article element
selector with our class selector a
featured content so we don't have any
spaces and then we just do our trust
selected directly after which would be
this and now they're my friends you
saying go out and get me the articles
which have a class of featured content
and style them this way will just give
it a background of red and pay attention
there's no space here whatsoever
it's just article and then the featured
content selector here which stands for
the period remember so that's how we do
it remember if there was a space there
this would say go out and get me the
featured content class which is a
descendant of article because of that
makes we don't want a space alright so
now it's getting all the articles that
have a class of featured content and if
there were multiple of these you know if
there were two of them it would get both
of them if we put that
you'll get both of these okay so let's
just delete that and target our active
featured content we do exactly the same
we go after the divs first of all and
then we say we want a div which has a
class of featured content all right
same again we're combining our div
selector with our class selector
featured content and this time we'll
give a background of blue so that makes
sense yeah and we'll save this a view in
the browser and there we go guys this is
our featured article and this is our
featured image there's no image there
because I've not put a particular image
in I've just put a kind of dummy similar
thing but anyway that's not the point
the point is we've targeted the article
which has a class and combine those two
selectors and we've targeted the div
which has a class of featured content
and combine those two selectors and
we've stabbed them differently from each
other even though they're both the same
class we want to stab them slightly
differently depending on the element
okay so that is how my friends we start
we combine our selectors if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those as soon as I can otherwise if you

or share and I'll see you guys in the
next one where we're going to look at
the universal selector I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
