create a regular expression in
JavaScript let's create our first one to
validate one of these fields and we're
gonna start with the easiest one which
is the telephone number thing because
that's just 11 digits long so what we're
looking for in this field is a user to
enter 11 numbers from 0 to 9 that
matches a UK telephone number so what
we'll be doing is storing all of our
different reg X patterns for these
different fields in one single object
rather than create a different variable
for each one I want to store them all in
one single object and then each property
inside that object can be a different
regular expression which refers to a
different form field okay so let's
create a constant to store this object
in and we'll call it patterns set it
equal to this object and the first
property that we want to do is for this
field right here called telephone so
let's be wild and call this property
named telephone as well okay cool so we
know that this is going to be a regular
expression so let's do our double
forward slash first of all and we'll put
our reg X inside this then what we want
to do is say look the stuff inside this
field needs to be digits from 0 to 9 so
I guess what we could do is a character
set with a range inside it saying okay
so anything from 0 to 9 that will match
a single character from 0 to 9 but
instead of that we can also use the math
the meta character backslash D and that
is also doing the same thing remember
it's saying much any digit from 0 to 9
so at the minute this is looking good
but it's only matching one single
character so it's only getting much
something like 5 or 3 or 7 etc not the
whole 11 numbers so what we need to do
is say look we need 11 of these things
and we know how to do that
after the D we can open up our curly
braces and inside specify how many times
we want this repeated 11 times okay so
you might be sitting there thinking well
that was easy
this it don't know but you'd be wrong
this is not done just yet
remember if we were to type something in
this field right now
if it's 11 numbers long let's just do
that 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 then this is okay
this would get a match but also what
would get a match is this
this was also getting much because the
regex
pattern that we've created is looking at
this field and saying well yeah I'm
getting a match because I can see right
here 11 consecutive numbers in that
field so yeah this is fine but in actual
fact it's not fine is it because we
don't want this d EF and we don't want
this stuff at the start either so how
can we combat this well we've already
seen how we can combat this we use the
two special characters the carrot at the
start which is saying okay well this
thing right here now must be at the
start okay and then we also use a dollar
sign at the end to say it also must be
at the end so this right here now is not
going to match because this thing is
neither at the start of the field nor is
it at the end okay it's matching the
numbers but it's not matching the
position of this inside the fall field
so now this won't match but if we get
rid of these dudes now this would match
now the number is at the start and it's
also at the end of the test string does
that make sense so we're going to be
seeing this carrot and this dollar sign
at the beginning and at the end of every
different form field that we do and now
this is valid how simple was that to
create a regular expression so much a
valid phone number is a carrot then
backslash D in 11 times dollar or
between the two forward slashes and
that's all we need to do so now we've
created that regular expression but we
don't know how to test it against this
it's not really doing anything that the
minute we've just stored it in this
property in the object patterns what we
really want to do is take this regular
expression and then when a user types
and number in here test this number
against this regular expression to see
if it is valid and we're going to be
doing that in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
