second webpart tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how to
install web pack and how to bundle
javascript files together into one file
so by this stage I'm expecting that
you've already installed nodejs
if not then head to no js' to org and
download the latest version so the first
thing I want to do if you're following
along with the course files as well is
check out lesson 2 so I'll say git
checkout less than - - that's just going
to update this index file to remove all
the scripts and the comments
ok so let's install web pack now the
first thing we need to do is run NPM in
it and what that is going to do is
create a package JSON file for us so we
can keep track of all our dependencies
so this is going to throw up a series of
questions that we just need to hit enter
- so the name version description entry
point this is all fine keywords off of
me and licensed MIT ok that's all fine
this is going to create a package JSON
file for us right here so this just has
information about our project and it
also tracks our dependencies now web
pack is going to be a dependent set for
so it's going to keep track of that now
the way we install web pack is by saying
NPM not up there down here NPM install
web pack and we want to save it as a
dependency so we say - - save and pass
it through the dev flag to say it's a
dev dependency ok so that's going to
install web pack and it's also going to
track it right here once it's installed
okay so once that's done you're going to
notice two things first of all this node
modules folder has appeared magically
that is just everything that web pack
needs to run so it's installed all its
dependencies etc and then right over
here we scroll down you're going to also
notice this dev dependencies and this is
keeping track of the web pack version
we've got installed so now we've
installed it we can start using it in
our application now you'll notice on the
right over here I've gone to localhost
3004 slash web pack playlist so it's
serving up this thing right here so
let's just test it
see save that and then over here we
could see that okay cool so we know it's
working so let's get rid of that for now
save it what I'm going to do is create a
JavaScript file and Link it up to this
file right here so I'm going to right
click over here say new file call it
script 1 KS and then in here what I'm
going to do is declare a variable called
message set that equal to what you say
Tempus Fugit and then what we'll do is a
load up message so a message that's
going to alert so now for this to work
on this page we need to link it open the
index file so let's go ahead and do that
we'll say script source equals then dot
/to say the code directory then it's
script - 1 j s so if we save this dude
now then hopefully we should get an
alert on the right yep Tempus Fugit
ok so that works now what if I want to
split my code up into two different
files and I know that seems like
overkill at the minute because there's
barely any code here but imagine that we
have lots of different code and we want
to split up our messages from our alert
functions or something like that so
let's create a new file let's say new
file and call this script - CJ s and in
here we're going to say var message
equals
Tempus Fugit like so save that and then
in script one I want to get rid of that
and what I want to do now is alert this
message right here which is this in the
browser
now currently that's not going to work
because this is in one script and this
is in another and we're only linking to
this script in the HTML so what we
really want to do is require the use of
this script whatever is in here in this
file so now we've got web pack installed
we can do that web pack allows us to
require or the scripts and bundle them
together so if I say var message
equals require and we're going to
require this file right here okay so
it's quotation marks then it's dot /to
say the same directory script one and we
want to script - two like so we don't
need to put yes we can do if we want we
don't need to that's just going to know
that this is a GFI okay but this isn't
done yet so what we need to do is
explicitly say what other script files
can require from here and we do that by
using module that exports so we can say
instead of our message module dot
exports equals Tempus Fugit so now we're
exporting this right so we're saying
whenever another script uses require to
grab this script give them this okay and
this can be whatever you want this can
be object this could be an array or
multiple strings whatever you want okay
for now it's just one string so let's
save that and this still won't work if
we refresh over here we're still not
going to get that alert and that's
because we've not run web pack yet we
need to run web pack in order for it to
bundle these files together okay because
right now this is not supported in most
browsers it's not a readily available
JavaScript function we can use in
browsers so we need to run web pack and
that's going to bundle these two script
files into one file for us all right so
let us come down here and say web pack
then what we're going to say is script
one is this is the entry point if you
like this is the one which is
controlling everything okay and then we
want an output which is going to be dot
forward slash bundle is so if we run
that now then what that is going to do
is bundle these two together and output
them in one file which is now here
you're going to notice that is right
here and at the minute it looks like an
awful lot of cold
just for one little alert but as your
applications get bigger and you're using
many different requires you've got many
different scripts it's going to bundle
them all together into one file and
output them here okay so now in the
index instead of linking to script 1
what we need to do is link to this new
file which is combined those two scripts
ok so let's say glendol dot j s save it
check out over here now this works
Tempus Fugit ok cool so what webpack now
allows us to do is create multiple
different files to split up our code if
you like into logical different modules
and then require the code wherever we
need it and output all of the different
modules all of the different JavaScript
files into one file at the end just this
bundle yes okay and in the index dot
HTML file all we're doing is requiring
one script file instead of those five or
six or seven files so we just requested
something from the server once instead
of multiple times really cool and by the
way if that web pack command isn't
working then install web pack globally
on your computer now to do that just say
npm install web pack - gee that's going
to install it globally on your computer
and then that should work ok cool so
there we go that's how we bundle
JavaScript together we're going to be
doing more of this as we go along so
this is just a little bit of an
introduction in the next tutorial what
we're going to do is create a config
file for our web pack so that we don't
have to start running web pack down here
it does it all automatically for us so
until then don't forget to share
subscribe and like and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
