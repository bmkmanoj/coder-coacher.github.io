jQuery for beginners lesson 17 and in
this video we're gonna talk about the
document ready and window load events
Wow are anything going so by now you
should probably know that I always put
my script tags right at the bottom of
the webpage just before the closing body
tag right and the reason I do that is so
that the rest of the HTML can load first
of all because if in the JavaScript I am
creating an event or binding an event to
one of these elements I want to be safe
in the knowledge that that element sorry
has loaded before I bind it and if I put
them at the bottom here I can be pretty
safe in that assumption but some people
or some developers like to pop their
script tags right the top in the head up
here right and I've wait for clients
where they're very protective of their
source code they don't want me to move
these script tags to the bottom of the
page which is fine you know they want to
do that that's up to them but in order
to make sure that everything help
everything else has loaded in the web
page first of all I need to do one of
two things in my JavaScript files I need
to either use the document dot on ready
function or the window dot onload
function right so I'm going to show you
these two functions now the first one is
the document dots on ready function
right and then specify my callback
function right here and then right here
is everything that's gonna happen on
that webpage like me binding events to
certain elements this way I can be sure
that those elements have been loaded in
so this is what the document on ready
function does it says hey when the
document is ready and that means when
all the elements have been loaded when
overdog the document object model is
ready for me to bind events to then fire
your events or bind your events or do
whatever it is you want to do okay so I
get in the habit of doing this first of
all and again we have the shot and
methods that I taught you in the last
tutorial we can say got ready document
dot ready and for this but
particular event there is an even
shorter version we can use we can just
do this like that okay and that is
essentially saying when the document is
ready then do whatever you need to do
okay
it's just a dollar sign open parentheses
and then your function and then the
closed parenthesis right there at the
end okay so that is the document ready
we put everything in here after the
document is ready right now the other
one I want to show you is the window
dots on load event and this is similar
but it waits for the whole web page to
load not just these elements right here
so things like if you've got images
right we're not just waiting for the tag
to load in the document we're waiting
for the image itself to load you know
where you see a bit at a time loading of
that image
once it's fully loaded then we fire our
code okay once everything has loaded on
the page and you might think well why
would you want to do that surely all you
need is the Dom to be locked it's right
all these tags because if the tags are
there then you can start binding events
to them and yeah if that's what you want
to do that's fine you can do that but in
some cases you might want to figure out
the dimensions of certain images right
if you're doing some kind of image
slider or some other thing to do with
images and you want to calculate say the
width of the image or the height of an
image you might want that image to fully
load into the web page first before you
calculate that height because then that
is the only way it's gonna be accurate
okay so that's when you'd use the window
onload method instead of the document
don't read it and again there's a
shorthand version we can take this away
and we can just say window don't read it
sorry not not ready don't load okay
that's exactly the same so they my
friends are the two methods I wanted to
show you if you had your scripts right
up here and to be honest even when
they're down here I get into the habit
of doing something like this document
ready or window download I always do it
okay so if you have any questions about
these two methods feel free to drop a
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share and like and
I'll see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
