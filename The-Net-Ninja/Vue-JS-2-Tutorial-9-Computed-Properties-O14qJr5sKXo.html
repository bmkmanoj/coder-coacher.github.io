ninth of UJS tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about computed
properties okay so in previous tutorials
I've shown you that we can define
methods on this view j/s instance right
here and we can call those methods from
this HTML template that we create which
might return to as a string which is
then rendered to the Dom right but I
want to show you an alternative way of
doing this which is a lot of time more
efficient and quicker and that computed
properties now to demonstrate this I'm
going to do a quick little example and
show you the difference between using
methods and computed properties so we've
got two buttons right here oh we've got
one that says add a on one that says add
to B and when you click on a we've got
this click event right here which is
saying a plus plus or added one to a and
when you click on being we've got B plus
plus which is adding one to B now these
properties right here are defined on the
view instance you can see a and B they
start off at zero with also the age
defined which is 20 right so very simple
so far so when we click this it's going
to add to 8 click this add to B then
we're also outputting a and B right here
in these paragraphs ax right so let's
just have a quick look at how this looks
so far and if we refresh ad-seg a goes
up and to be B goes up right
very simple so now what we want to do is
we want to output the age which is added
to a and the age which is added to be I
remember ages to find here 20 so to do
that what I'm going to do is now another
key tag and I'm going to say age plus a
is equal to and then we're going to do a
method in a minute and it's going to be
called add to a write so add to a and we
have to call it using those parentheses
so let's do the same now it would be a
copy this and paste it down below and
just change age plus B is add it to be
alright so what these are going to do is
take the age of 20 and they're going to
ask whatever the value of a is and
output it here or whatever the value of
B is and output it in right so just a
simple formula so let's make those two
methods first of all
so if we go to the view instance we can
define now add it to a and that is going
to be a function and in this function
what we are going to do is return the
list or a which is this thing right here
so it's going to grab the current value
today and add it to this dot H right so
I don't knit 220 sort of a is 3 then
this is going to be 20 plus 3 which is
23 right so I want to do the same for B
so let's do a little comma and I'm going
to copy this thing right here let's
paste it down below and change this to
add a to b and this time we won this
plus b plus this plus a this B plus
Vista 8 ok so if we save that and check
it out a browser you can see the court
let this aim be above 0 8 plus 8 20 and
8 plus B is 20 if we add a you can see
this growing up right and if we add a
bead you can see this going up now how
does this work well every time a value
changes whether that's a or b vu j s is
going to look at these functions right
here add to a and add to B and it's
going to run them both okay
every time a value changes so it doesn't
matter that we might just change a and B
doesn't change this still runs even
though technically it doesn't really
need to because the value of B is still
the same and this is still going to the
same a plus B a plus B rather and it can
demonstrate that by doing a quick
consult that log if so I'll say console
that log and we'll say in here and add
to okay right so we know that this
function has run and then I'm going to
do the same down here except I'm going
to change this to add to B so if I save
this now let's check it out
every time I press this button add a
check it out add to B was run and it's
re at a was run and add to B which runs
for both of those functions run even
though I'm only clicking add to a and
changing a and the same goes if I add to
B both of those folks
when really only one of them needs to
run either at a or are to be so to make
this more efficient we can use computed
properties which are very similar to
methods but this is only ever going to
update when one of these values updates
ok so add a computed property will only
run when we change a and AD to be
computed property will only run when we
add to B when we change this right so
let's see how this works very similar to
methods
so we'll say computed and this is going
to be an object and basically all we're
going to do here is copy these two and
we're going to paste them down here like
this and they're exactly the same
there's no difference whatsoever so
giving the same thing tracked but what
really though is common all of this out
now so that the methods no longer run
and instead is computed properties now
currently we get an error
I just saved this and as American says
up to a is not a function so it's
looking here at this add a and if they
look a nice a method that's a function
which is defined on the view instance
I'll go and find it and it cannot find
it that's because we've commented them
out so how do we find the computed
properties
well pretty simply all we do is take off
the parentheses then this is going to
find the add a computed property and
that has to be completed property right
so if we save that now then we no longer
get those errors and they run to begin
with both of those computed properties
we want to begin with that's why we're
seeing this message but then when we
click add a check it out only add a runs
so it's kind of watching this a variable
and when it changes it reruns the add a
method right so if we now do add to be
it's only we running this method this
computed property make sense so it's
more efficient to use a computed
property a lot of the time than a method
because you Jonas doesn't know when it
comes to methods which ones it needs to
run okay depending on what has updated
the computed properties do they kind of
watch the variables that they need to be
computed to be calculated
they only run when needed make sense so
there we go that is completed properties
and we will probably use these again in
the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
