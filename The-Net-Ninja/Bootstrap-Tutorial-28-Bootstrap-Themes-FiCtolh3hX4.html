28th boot shot 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at how we
can add a theme Wow alright then guys so
we've added all of these different
bootstrap components in and they've all
got that kind of default look about them
you know these different colors here
these are the default contextual classes
things like primary danger warning
success color of these things here okay
and that looks fine but you don't want
to upload your website looking like this
because it's just gonna look like any
other lame-ass out with a box bootstrap
website alright you want to make yours a
little bit different so we couldn't
approach this in a few different ways we
can either add our own style sheet like
right here underneath this style sheet
and do that by just say something like
this link hate red equals style dot CSS
something like that and then create this
file over here so we can link to that
and then we can just override some of
these default styles right here but if
you want a quicker solution then we can
always use oops themes okay bootstrap
themes are basically just CSS files that
other people have made that we can link
into our website that is going to change
the look and feel of this website so
it's not just going to look like a
standard out-of-the-box bootstrap
website and it's not gonna look like you
can't be bothered to change anything
alright so where can we get these themes
well you might just want to do a quick
google search because there's quite a
lot of different sites out there where
you can download themes you can get free
themes and you can get premium themes
now premium themes probably start from
about $2 these days so you can get them
pretty cheaply and free themes you can
get from this website here plus another
couple of websites as well I'm just
gonna show you this one which is boots
watch com
okay so head over there and take a look
at these themes so you get a quick
preview right here if you want to
preview it even more you can just click
this button right here but I'm just
gonna download one that looks alright
I'll go for this superhero one and she's
gonna press this download button right
here and it's gonna show you so I'm just
gonna link to it in my document now if
you were going to use this theme
I'd probably download this CSS file I'm
putting in your local files I'm just
going to link to it now just for you
know simplicity so let's go back to our
HTML file and we'll add in a link it's
ref equals then we'll paste in that the
rel is gonna be stylesheet and type
equals except slash CSS okie dokie so
let's save that and check out this beast
in the browser and boom it's all changed
no longer does this just look like a
lame-ass bootstrap out-of-the-box
website looks a little bit different
yeah okay so that's how we can quickly
change the look of our website and if we
want to customize it further we can do
you know we can just add in our own CSS
file again here right so for example we
could just do something like this I'm
just gonna inspect this element just so
I can go rule and where is it okay so
let's come down this one here I want to
inspect these things I don't know why
chrome is doing all this so I'm just
going to wear get this rule here okay
copy it I'm going to close this now then
I'm going to come here and I know that I
would normally add in a stylesheet but
just to make this quick I'm gonna paste
it right there like that okay and oops
I've put a little wrong side of the
style tag paste it right here and then
what I'll do is give these a border
radius of 10 pixels all right so I'll
save that and just refresh over here and
now you can see these all have a bit of
a border radius like that okay so you
can change the styles further if you
wanted to you can probably see that kind
of light blue coming behind so I'd have
to do that as well to make it look okay
but you get the point the point is we
can use things to quickly change the
look and feel of our websites right and
then we can further add changes using
our own CSS or you know just use your
own CSS from the beginning entirely your
choice all right so that's how we add
themes and that's pretty much it for
this tutorial series guys and I will be
doing more bootstrap stuff in the future
I'm going to be making a bootstrap
WordPress theme
so I'll show you how to do that and I'll
also be looking at bootstrap for in a
few weeks as well so until then if you
