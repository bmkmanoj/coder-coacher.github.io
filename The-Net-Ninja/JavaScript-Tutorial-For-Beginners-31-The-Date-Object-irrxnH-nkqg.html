JavaScript for beginners lesson 31 and
in this video I want to talk about the
date object Wow alright so javascript
has an inbuilt object called the date
object and that's really cool because we
can use it to create dynamic dates or
store previous of future dates so how do
we do this well the first thing we want
to do is store our dates in a variable
so we declare a variable var we'll just
call it my date for now and the way we
create a date is by simply writing new
date all right and that right there my
friend is going to store the current
date in this variable for us so let's
just console that log this to the the
browser we'll say my date and save it
refresh over here and now we're getting
back Friday August the 28th 2015 and not
only did we get the date but also the
exact time as well so that is the
current time and if i refresh you'll
notice this time change really there we
go its update to 59 so that's really
cool because it's dynamic and you don't
have to keep editing it yourself so if
you have a blog where you want to show
the date at the top you can just use
this inbuilt object from JavaScript to
display that to your users so that's
really cool now we can also store
previous or future dates in variables
too so we'll do that we'll say var my
past date equals and we'll say new date
and then we're going to store the
variables in here we're going to pass
through the year the month the day and
if you want also the timing hours
minutes and seconds let's just do the
first three first of all so we'll do the
year first and we'll just say 15 45
completely random date the next thing
we're going to do is pass in a month and
that is a number from 0 to 11 0
represents the first month with his
which is January and 11 the last month
December so we'll pass through 11 and
we'll say December and finally it will
pass through the day and that is for a 1
to 31 represents the date of the month
so I'll say the second
right and that is going to be your past
date I'm going to do one for the future
as well
so I'm going to change this to my future
date and we'll say 25 15 we'll change
this to 0 which is a January and the
31st cool so let's save that and refresh
over here or we need to log those out
console.log my past dates and then we'll
do exactly the same on a future date my
future date have a look there we go now
we get the two dates right there and
notice that this time is set to zero
zero zero zero zero zero that's because
we've not specified it over here if we
wanted to we can do we put in a further
three numbers so the first one we do is
ours and it's from 0 to 23
so we'll put in 10 that will represent
10 a.m. the next one is minutes and
that's from 0 to 59 we're putting 30 for
30 minutes and the final one is seconds
again from 0 to 59 and we'll put in 15
for this one so we'll copy those now and
paste them down here because they can be
the same it doesn't matter refresh and
now we get the seconds minutes and hours
update in here as well so that is really
cool now like pretty much any other
object in JavaScript we can call methods
on this object and I've already written
a few down below here so I'm going to
delete all this at the top bring these
right bolt but before I show you these
I'm going to create a new variable to
store a dating and I'm going to call it
birthday and we're just going to make up
some imaginary birthday let's all say a
new date and the birthday is going to be
1985 it's going to be in January and
we'll say the 15th I'm looking at a time
as well we'll say they were barred at
11:00 a.m. and we'll say 15 minutes and
25 seconds very precise I know
all right so now these are all the
different methods we can call on this
birthday date so the first one I'm going
to just uncomment and this is called get
month and this gives us back the month
in the form of a number from 0 to 11 now
we set the month with zero which is
January so that is what should print
right here to the console so yep 0 we
get 0 so let's get a month the next one
I want to show you is get forward Year
so birthday dot get forward year and
that's going to give us back the Year in
the four digit format much like we
specified or right here so let's save
that again refresh and yet 1985 third
one that is get date and that's going to
bring back a number for 1 to 31
depending on which date of the month is
stored we said 15 so let's check that
save and refresh 15 cool and next we've
got the get day now we didn't specify
this right up here but this is going to
work out for is which day of the week we
were born on and it goes from 0 to 6 and
0 with Sunday 60 Saturday so let's save
that and find out comes back with 2 so
that works out as 0 Sunday Monday's 1
Tuesday's 2 so now we know we're born on
a Tuesday
this person pretty cool yet the next one
I want to show you is get hours that's 0
to 23 we specified that up here to be 11
a.m. so let's just double check yep 11
and the final one I want to show you is
get time now this is a little bit
different from the rest
this one right here returns the number
of milliseconds since the first of
January 1970 now that is completely
random right and you might be thinking
why would I want this number well
normally you wouldn't but we use this
one quite a lot first of all I'm going
to save it I'm going to refresh over
here and it's brought back this big
number right and this is the number of
milliseconds since this dates in respect
to this day okay so number of
milliseconds between those dates now why
would we use this number well it's quite
simple we'd use it to compare two dates
right so two
show you this I'm going to copy this
date and I'm going to paste it right
under here and call this birthday too
and it's going to be exactly the same
these two people were born right down to
the second on the same date and we're
going to compare those two birthdays in
an if statement so the way we do that is
write out if statement and the color
block and then within here I'm going to
say is birthday equal to birthday two
and then if it is what we'll do is
console.log birthdays are equal right
now you might look at that and you might
think yep well that is true and we'll do
an else statement right here and we'll
log to the console birthdays are not
equal right so let's refresh and we get
a reference error birthday is not
defined and that's because it's not my
friends all right
let's save that and refresh and there we
get birthdays and not equal which is
right here and you might think well why
is that because up here they're exactly
the same aren't they they should be
equal well that's not the way JavaScript
works it's not looking at the value of
these birthdays it's looking at these as
two separate objects saying well I've
got an object here called birthday and
another object here called birthday two
and those objects and not technically
equal right but if we do birthday dot
get time and then birthday to get time
now they are both pulling the number of
milliseconds between that date and the
first of January 1970 so they now should
be equal right let's save it and find
out and there it says birthdays are
equal so this method right here is
really useful when you're comparing
dates
all right then guys so that there is the
date object in a nutshell there are
other functions and methods we can use
on the date object
got time to go through them all in this
video but what I will do is leave a link
down below so you can go out and check
those and play with them on your own you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
to comment down below I'll try and
answer all of those as soon as I can
otherwise guys don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
