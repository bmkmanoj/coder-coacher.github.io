CSS beginners lesson 43 and today we're
gonna talk about rounded corners Wow now
at first glance this may seem like a
plug for the net new to Twitter and it
is gonna lie however I also wanted to
show you how it uses this technique of
rounded corners to get some really cool
soft effect for their elements so we can
see they use all over the place first of
all here this big icon they've got some
rounded corners on there and up here in
the search bar they've got some big
rounded corners there and even these
buttons here and the little icon there
so it's very common across the whole web
you're gonna see rounded corners
everywhere just to give that softer look
so I'm going to show you how to use it
in this lesson but before we do that I
just want to go over to can I use calm
which I've shown you in a previous
lesson and we come here to see if we can
use certain CSS or css3 properties in
modern-day browsers just to make sure
that every browser supports them now the
way we use this is by just putting the
property name in the top here so I'm
going to say border radius this is what
it's called and we can see here that
most things support it if we go back to
ie 8 it's not supported but it's only
got a global usage of less than 2% and
over here Opera Mini which has got a
global usage of 4.7 1% wow I didn't
realize that huh but either way mainly
across the board it's supported now this
is one of those properties where a while
back we would have had to specify vendor
prefixes to get it working across the
board now I'm not going to go into what
vendor prefixes aren't now I'll go into
that later on when we cover browser
testing and things like that but these
days is widely supported so I just
wanted to show you that here Before we
jump into the code so we don't need to
do vendor prefixes we're just going to
do the property on its own and see how
it looks in a browser Wow alright guys
so I'm back here in the code and
I'm starting off exactly where I left
off last time so I've got these four
developments here and we were working
with static and dynamic widths so what
we're going to do is just apply a border
radius to some of these so we'll start
off with this static width dip here and
the property name remember is border -
radius now it has four sides or four
corners right an element we can control
the top right the bottom right the
bottom left and the top left and it goes
around in a clockwork fashion so first
of all if we just specify one number
let's say 10 pixels yeah that's going to
apply a border radius of 10 pixels on
every corner and I'll show you what that
looks like in a browser so I'm gonna
right click show an explorer and get
this opening Chrome so now here you can
see this first one has rounded corners
all the way around and that's a 10 pixel
border radius now the higher the number
the more curved the border radius is
going to look like so let's just
increase it to 30 and view it in a
browser again you see now more rounded
and if we carried on and eventually we
could go into a full circle if you want
and that's a pretty cool technique and
I'll show you that with one of the other
elements you can just make a circle out
of a square by using the border radius
property or ankle for now what I'm going
to do is go back into the HTML and now
we're going to control each corner
separately so I'm going to say border -
radius and I'm going to say 5 pixels 10
pixels 20 pixels and 40 pixels so it's
going to double each time around the
clock so let's review this in a browser
all right so where are we now you can
see here in the top left is a very small
curve here that's where we start with
the 5 pixels and then if we zoom over to
the right here it gets a little bit more
curved that's a 10 pixel border radius
down below here is a 20 pix of boiling
radius and right all the way over here
but this really curved one
this curved corner that is a 40 pixel
border radius it kinda looks like a bowl
to me so that's how we can control each
corner separately all right and it's the
same with margin whereby if we just said
something like this 10 pixels 20 pixels
we'll save that and view it in a browser
now you can see here this one here is 10
pixels top left bottom right is 10
pixels top right is 20 pixels and bottom
left is 20 pixels so it's a little bit
differently the still opposites there's
still opposite from there so top left
bottom right top right bottom left okay
so it's a little bit more complicating
you just have to figure out which number
controls what but once you get the hang
of it it's fairly immediate and to be
honest I just like specifying the four
different values for all different sides
if I do something like this to avoid the
confusion okay so now let's do that
whole circle thing right so in line
block what I'm going to do is take away
those properties and give them a width
of 100 pixels and I'm gonna give them a
height of 100 pixels I'm gonna give them
a border radius all the way around of 50
pixels unless a view this in a browser
looking at now the circles that is
pretty cool no so you can make some
warning buttons or anything you might
get creative with them
by creating circles with initially
rectangle elements obviously this
content here is no longer within the
confines of this gray color here but we
could use padding and margin etc just to
drop that down into the middle so why do
we use 50 pixels well if you imagine the
whole thing was a width of 100 pixels
and we have a corner on the top left and
a corner on the top right yeah if each
one of those has a border radius of 50
pixels that means that is going at that
border radius is going to occupy 50% of
that
it's going to occupy 50 pixels in month
yeah now the whole thing is 100 pixels
in length so we've got to the top left
on the top right both 50 pixels they're
going to meet in the middle and make a
perfect circle same for the bottom
alright so that is border-radius
