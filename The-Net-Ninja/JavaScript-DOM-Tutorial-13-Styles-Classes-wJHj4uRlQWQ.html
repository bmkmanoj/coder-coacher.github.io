JavaScript and the doll tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you how to
change styles in classes using
javascript okay then so in the last
tutorial I showed you how we can hook up
the functionality of this form whereby
we enter a value into this simple field
click Add and it gets added to the books
to read list and we're doing this by
creating an element on the fly then
injecting it into the Dom right here but
it doesn't look quite right just yet
it's not looking the same as these
things over here and that's because we
don't have any class names associated
with these spun tags whereas in the rest
of them we do a class of name for the
top and a class of delete for the bottom
all so we need to figure out a way in
this tutorial to add those classes to
these elements and I'm also going to
show you how we can change the style of
certain elements on your web page on the
fly in JavaScript so over in the console
first of all you'll notice I've only
grabbed a reference to this Li tag at
the bottom using document dot query
selector then Li last child and this li
looks something like that of the minute
so first of all how do we apply styles
on the fly to different web elements in
our page but first of all we need a
reference to that element which we
already have a lie so we say li then dot
style property then we can say dot
whatever CSS style you want to apply to
it for example color we're going to set
that equal to red so if i click enter
oops I don't add on the end rotation if
I click enter then these are now going
to be styled as red and if we take a
look in the elements panel we can see
now it's got this style property
associated with it
cool so say for example I want to add on
some kind of double-barrel style for
example margin-top well let's do that
I'll delete the call a bit and I'll say
margin - top now margin - top is how it
looks in the CSS however in JavaScript
we can't use these things right here
when it comes to styles and that's
because this is essentially in
JavaScript a minus sign so we need to
remove that and then change the next
letter to a capital now we can apply
that rule I'll set that equal to 60
pixels
and now we have that margin right here
as well so if we take a look at the
elements we can also see that margin top
has been applied cool so that's how we
apply styles on the fly in CSS now I
want to show you how we can retrieve
classes and add classes so first of all
how do we get the class name of an
element well whatever element we want we
type that first then we say class name
right now it doesn't have a class which
is why we're getting an empty string
back but we can apply a class to this I
could say li class name is equal to
something so I'll just say test click
enter and now if we have a look in the
elements panel we're going to see this
class of tests right here applied to the
Li and now if I say li class name is
test ok so now what if we wanted to add
another class let me just clear this so
we've got a bit of room so if I say li
class name and then equal something else
let's say I don't know test two now then
if we take a look over here
you can see we have the class of test
two but it's deleted the class of test
so this isn't the best way of adding new
classes now let's just try something
here I'm going to say class name plus
equals test three to see what this does
and if we click enter then it's all
going to become just one class there's
no space in between them now I suppose
what we could do is this test for click
enter and now we can see we have those
two classes right here and if we try and
style test for but then it will work let
me just come down here and say test for
and I'll say background
is going to be black and this works so
this is fine this way of doing it
however I don't really like this way of
doing it because sometimes you forget
the spaces and I don't think it's the
best way of doing it generally but I'm
going to show you another way we can add
and remove classes but to do that I'm
going to jump over to the console so I'm
just gonna refresh this for now
get back to the original state and I'm
gonna jump back to the text editor and
what I want to do is add a remove
classes right so to do that I could say
the element that I want then dot class
list then add or remove and then the
name of the class so let's add the
classes down here or say add classes and
then underneath I'm gonna say book name
dot class list and if we just logged
this to the console that's going to get
the whole class list for this element
however we don't want to do that we want
to add a class to this and the class I
want to add is called name alright now I
want to do the same for the other one so
it's not book name it's delete button
dot class list dot add and then we can
type in the name delete for this ok so
now that is going to add the class of
name to this element and the class of
delete to this element then we're going
to append those to the document alright
so if we click Save now check this out
over here let's answer some kind of book
and now we get the correct style imp for
these and that's because if we inspect
it we now have those classes of name and
delete on these span tags ok cool so we
can easily just remove pluses by saying
things like remove instead now we don't
want to remove them we want to add them
so I'm just going to keep that as up so
there we've got my friends that's how we
change styles on the fly and that's how
we access class names and add and remove
them as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
