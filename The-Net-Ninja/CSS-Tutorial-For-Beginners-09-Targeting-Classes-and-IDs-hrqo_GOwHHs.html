net ninja and this is CSS for beginners
lesson I'm targeting classes and ID's ah
so before we start I just want to have a
quick recap on what classes and IDs are
now both essentially are a way to
describe your content a way of giving it
meaning and semantics and the only
difference is that a class can be used
multiple times on a page and an ID can
only be used once per page quick
examples you might have an article page
and below that some comments from the
user and say you've got five or six
comments imagine in the HTML each of
these comments is surrounded by a div
tag now you can give each of these div
tags a class of comment for example okay
so there's multiple classes on one page
now an ID could only be use one so an
example of that could be a header so on
the page you've got a logo you've got a
title and you've got navigation you
could surround all of those elements
with a div tag and give that div tag an
ID of page header because there's only
one of those on the page now if you want
to learn more about IDs and classes you
can do that by checking out my video in
the beginners HTML course I'll leave a
link to that in the description below
otherwise for the rest of us we're going
to carry on in turn HTML and start
adding some rules with classes and ID's
oh here I am back in the HTML and the
first thing you'll notice is that I've
ripped out all of these CSS styles that
we did in the last lesson I've also
added a couple of tags we've got this h2
within the header we've got this h2 here
with an ID of content header and I've
added some span tags here with a class
of deck now we learnt in the last lesson
that we could targets elements and we're
going to do that first we're going to
say h2 and we're going to give them a
font size of 24 pixels okay and now we
know that that is going to say hey go
find every h2 in the page and star them
this way give them all the font size of
24 pixels so it's going to look for this
h2 and it's gonna find this h2 as well
star them exactly the same now we might
know one that we might want this h2 here
to be slightly different a bit smaller
maybe because it's not in the head
and we can do that we can target it
using this ID so the way we do this is
by starting our selector with a hash
symbol or a pound sign however you want
to call this little symbol here
we always start an ID selector with that
that says to the CSS hey this is an ID
that I'm looking for and then what we do
is we put the ID name which in this case
is content header so I'll just write
that in content header and then that is
saying to the CSS look I'm looking for
an ID because I'm using this hash symbol
and the ID I'm looking for is content
header which is here so go and grab that
element there and then let me style that
in the declaration which I'm going to do
now so I'll open my curly braces and
close them and then I'm going to give
these a smaller font size
which is going to be 18 pixels and you
know what I also want to give these a
color of red so what we're doing here is
overriding this h2 style okay the CSS
works from top to bottom so it starts
here at the top it says okay I found all
these h2s this one here and this one
here and we're going to give them a font
size of 22 pixels then he finds this
rule here which I've just minimized and
it says okay well I've got this ID
symbol here so I'm going to go find an
ID of content header which is h2 and I'm
going to override this h2 rule by giving
it a font size of 18 pixels and then a
color of red so let's save that now make
sure it's worked I'm going to open up
the content contact page in a browser in
Google Chrome and there we go this is
the h2 in the header and this is the 82
with an ID of content header which is
read and smaller so that's worked
brilliant so that's how IDs work now
the next thing we're going to do is look
at classes and to do this we're going to
make use of these span tags here that
I've given a class of deck
now first again we're going to starve
them all in one rule by targeting the
span elements and again that's saying
look don't find every span tag on that
page which is all of these four here and
style them this
way and I'm going to make them
display:block you won't know what this
means yet but don't worry about it and
give them a color of blue so all the
span tags display:block and give them a
cleric blue so I'm going to open this up
again in a browser take a look first of
all Google Chrome and there they are
these four here these are the span tags
they're all blue and displaying block
now display block just means let them or
display on a new line essentially you
don't need to learn about that yet I'm
going to cover it later
but just bear in mind that that spanning
rule that we've just applied is
targeting all of this buns okay now what
we want to do is style these class ones
differently and to do that we can apply
a CSS rule which targets this class here
and because there's multiple classes of
Dec it's going to grab every element
with a class of Dec and style it the
same so the way we do this the way we
style a class tag is to start it with a
period off we'll stop depending on where
you're from and that says to the CSS hey
whatever comes next is a class name okay
and the class name is dead and that's it
that's a class so the CSS is going to
look for every class of deck on this
page and it wouldn't just be these spans
I could give this P a class of deck as
well if I wanted to and it would also
style this but we're not going to do
that for now we'll just get rid of that
and we're just going to style these here
so what I'm going to say is wanna color
these red so the bottom three spans here
should be red and the top ones still
blue because we've not overridden that
that's still applied here so we'll save
that and have a view in the browser and
there we go the top span tag is still
blue and the bottom three with a class
of gag you're I'm a span tag too this is
a deck of spans I like spandex they're
all red so hopefully now you know how to
create a ID in a CSS rule you just put
the hash or pound sign at the start and
then the name of the ID and then
your declaration and you also know how
to target a class you just put a period
off will stop however you want to call
it at the start and then the class name
which is Dec in this case and then we
style it in the declaration so if you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
to comment below I'll answer all of
those as soon as possible don't forget
