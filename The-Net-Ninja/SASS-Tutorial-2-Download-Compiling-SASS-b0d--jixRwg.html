second sass tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can install
and compile sass on our computer ah
all right there so the first thing we
need to do is install sass on our
computer and there's two ways of doing
this we can either install a standalone
application or we can do it via the
command line now if you choose to do it
via the command line you're going to
need to install Ruby first of all
because sass is written in Ruby so you
can do that unlimited by using the sudo
command on Windows you can go to the
Ruby installer which is this website
right here and just click the download
button I'll leave this link down below
and on mark for you guys it's already
installed so you don't need to do
anything so that's if you want to go
down the command line routes I'm not
going to do that for this tutorial I'm
just going to use one of these
standalone applications because it's
much simpler to get going so I'm going
to use this one right here pre process
or however you pronounce that and this
has a free version or a paid version
okay now the paid version is $29 and
basically what that does is take away a
little pop-up that pops up every 15
minutes or so asking you to buy or
something okay
I'm just going to use the free trial
version on this which is fully
functional like say it does everything
that the paid version does except it
throws up that pop-up so what you want
to do is go to download and then just
choose the operating system and that's
going to download it onto your computer
just go through the installation steps
dead simple and then fire it up
mine's on my desktop right here so I'm
just going to double click that to bring
it up and you're going to see when this
first starts the little pop-up that I'm
all about this thing right here says
thanks for using pre press Continue
trial by or activates so all you need to
do is keep on clicking continue every
time it throws this message up or by
it's up to you so right here we have a
blank screen and what we need to do is
drag our project folder into that okay
and then what that's going to do is
recognize any sass files that we have
and when we ask it to it's going to
process those into CSS files alright so
you can see right here in Atem I've got
open those project files that I've
uploaded to my github website
okay and you can see this styles.css
fire right here is currently empty now
that's where we're going to output all
of our sass files - okay now what I want
to do is go into the s CSS folder this
is where we're going to keep our sus
files there's nothing in there at the
minute with a right-click and create a
new file and I'm going to create a new
sapphire and I'll call this the same as
our Styles dot CSS except this is styles
dot s CSS okay and we could use sass
sass and that's a slightly different
syntax but we still can use it there's
two methods either sass or dot s CSS I'm
going to use the dot s CSS format for
this playlist purely because it's a
little simpler to get into it's more
like CSS so if you're familiar with CSS
it's going to be easier to get the hang
off but I mean once you're comfortable
with that you could look into dot sass
and maybe we'll look at that later on in
the cost was yet okay so let's create
that file and then close this down a
little bit then we need to open up our
project folder in this window right here
so just go to add project and then now
we get to the course files from a github
page and open up the base folder so you
can see right here we've got all those
folders in there I'm just going to
select this folder and it's going to
throw them up or right here what it's
going to do is recognize our sass files
right here Styles s CSS and if we click
on that you're going to notice some
options right here first of all is
suggesting an output path tools this is
where it's going to convert our sass
file into a CSS file and this is where
it's going to dump it okay so it's in
the CSS folder right here and it's going
to dump it in this file right here okay
if we didn't already have this created
it would still suggest something like
this because it's going to take this
file name styles.css and it's going to
put it in a CSS folder and call it
style.css okay so these options right
here
Auto compiled just means that when we've
made a change on this file right here
our sass file and we save it it's going
to auto compile that to CSS and output
the result into this file right here
okay so that's cool we want to keep that
tip
this right here use libsass is just
going to speed up the whole process and
it just makes it a little bit faster so
keep those two ticked and if we want to
manually process a file we can do if we
do that right now nothing is going to
happen because our SAS file is currently
empty okay but if we write a simple rule
in here doesn't have to be anything it's
just made up and I'm going to say color
red right so once we've done that if we
press save control X or something then
you're going to notice this little
pop-up box that says styles s CSS
compiled successfully that my friends is
this in action this autom compile so
when we saved it is compiled that now
and it's put the output into this file
right here okay so if we go ahead and
check our Styles dot CSS then you're
going to see exactly the same now as
I've styles that's s CSS so it's taken
this sass file and convert it into CSS
now there's no difference at the minute
and that's because we basically just use
pure CSS in this sass file and we can do
that if we wanted to but let me just do
a simple example using some of the extra
features in sass and you don't have to
worry about these for now I'm going to
go into detail about what these are
later on this is just to demonstrate how
we're converting from one to the other
so we're going to nest the style right
here and I'll say color blue and then
I'm going to nest
another style I'll say oat color pink
alright cool so I'll save that now and
you're going to note with this box again
say it's compiled successfully and if we
have a look at our Styles dot CSS file
now you're going to notice it's compiled
that into normal CSS because this my
friends is no longer normal CSS this is
sass okay we can't do this in CSS so
it's taking that and it's processed that
into normal CSS which a browser can
understand okay and the idea is that in
our index file
we don't link to any of the the sass
files because like say browsers don't
distance us we link to the Styles dot
CSS this thing right here and because
every time we save this and update this
it updates it here right here we'd
output some new file here
then it's always going to get the up to
day styles not CSS and that's what's
going to be used to style our web page
okay so this right here will do exactly
the same kind of thing as this it's just
compiled into something the browser
understands make sense cool alright so
that is how we install sass and compile
it and by the way just to demonstrate
something here if we do some kind of
error something you can't do in sass and
press save then you're going to get an
error message right hitting unable to
compile this file and it says what the
error is which is pretty cool so any
questions feel free to ask those down
below otherwise guys I'll see you in the
very next video where we're going to
start writing our first sass file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
