responsive design lesson 9 and in this
video we're going to make a mobile menu
for our website Wow alright then so this
is the way our website currently looks
on mobile remember in the last lesson we
made some changes to the banner these
things here to spread them out a little
bit more and these pictures and the
footer so all we really need to do is
make this mobile navigation we're going
to make a drop down navigation but
before we start with any code I just
want to show you a couple of things I've
already done in preparation for this
tutorial so the first thing is in
Photoshop I've just made a dead simple
three bar burger nav icon okay and this
is what the user is going to click to
show the drop down menu on a mobile
you've probably seen things like this
all the time when you view websites on
mobile if you can't see that very
clearly I'm just going to click this
background so you can see these three
white strips so I've taken that
background off and I've saved this as a
transparent PNG this is really zoomed in
if I go to the actual pixels it's really
small okay so that's just a little icon
that the user can press on a mobile the
next thing I want to show you is just
this code so we're in the index dot HTML
file of our website and you can see
right here in the nav I've added this
one tag and it's an a tag with a class
of burger - nav now it's called burger
now because the little icon looks like a
burger right it's got three little lines
but that doesn't really matter you can
give it whatever class you want and
we're going to use this element right
here to display that icon on the website
so it's not going to show anything up
yet because we've not styled it but it
will do by the end of this tutorial
the next thing I've done in this HTML
file is down here I have added a script
link to the jQuery CDN so it's this link
right here so what I'll do is leave that
link down below and you can pop that in
your script tag as well in this file and
below that and that's important it has
to be below this because it has a
dependency on it I've added another
script tag with a source of menu j/s and
that menu guess is this thing right here
I've gone ahead and created a blank J's
file just right-click go to new file
and I've called it menu Jas you can see
there's nothing in there at the minute
but we're going to use this javascript
file to make our JavaScript for the drop
down menu so that is all I've done I've
made that icon in Photoshop and I've
saved it into this images folder right
here can see it's called Berger dot PNG
then I made those simple changes to the
HTML file index dot HTML this thing
right here and these two scripts at the
bottom of link those up and that is it
so what we're going to do is jump into
the website itself and we're going to
start styling up that Bergen out class
that popped in so we only want it to
show more power so it's going to be
within this media query right here at
480 pixels and the first thing we want
to do is just grab that class Burger -
at nav and style that up a little bit so
what we're going to say is we want this
to display as block and then we're going
to give it a height of 40 pixels and
we've set it display block so we can
give it that specific height and it's
got access to those block level
properties the next thing we want to do
is give it a width of 100% and then
we'll give it a background of the URL
we're going to give it a background of
that image that big enough that we just
created so that we know it's in the
images folder
forward slash burger dot PNG and then
we're going to say no-repeat because we
only want this to be shown once not
hundreds of times and then we're going
to specify some position and properties
or position values rather of where we
want this to appear so we're going to
say 98% across the x coordinate so it's
going to appear right over here on the
right and then I'm going to say Center
when it comes to the vertical position
so it's going to appear centrally from
top to bottom okay and it's not showing
up at the minute because the background
is white itself and the burger is white
as well but if we give this a background
color now of like a deep gray we'll say
400 400 400 now you can see that big
enough right there on that burger icon
right there
okay so that's what the user is going to
click to show these links in a minute
alright finally I want to say cursor
Poynter you don't need to do this I just
like it so that when we hover over you
can see that we can click it okay
even on the desktop okay so the next
thing I want to do is just get rid of
these two little gaps right here you see
this and this this is being caused by
the wrapper if we right-click and
inspect this and hover over this wrapper
you can see the little green bits on the
left and right over there that is the
padding of the wrapper so I'm going to
get rid of that so to do that all I need
to do is say header and then the wrapper
div within that and then I'll give it a
width of 100% and a padding of zero and
that's going to get rid of those two
little gaps all right so next thing we
want to do is style up this UL a little
bit so I'll say header and a ul and then
what I'll do is say overflow:hidden
that's going to come in handy when we do
the drop down so it doesn't show by
default we're going to give it a
background of 500 500 500 so a little
bit lighter than this color right here
then what I'm going to do is a little
forward slash forward slash so it
doesn't actually apply this next
property and I'm going to say height
zero and I don't want it to apply it for
now because I want to style this if I
put height zero it's going to get rid of
it so I can't see it I'll apply that
later on okay so and also I'll explain
why we're doing that later as well so
what I want to do next is give this UL a
class of open as well right so let me
explain this in a second I'm just
writing for now header now ul dot open
right so when this UL class has a so
when SQL has a class of open I want it
to apply these following styles the
height is going to be the bottle
and in fact that is the AMA style I need
to give it so what's going to happen is
by default height of that UL is going to
be zero so we can't see on a mobile but
when we click this we're going to apply
a class of open so that ul so that then
the height becomes auto and it will show
and then when we click it again we'll
take that class off it so the height
will be zero so it shows and
shows depending on whether it has that
class or not all right so let's comment
that out again just so we can see for
now and next I want to style up these
links right here so the first thing I'll
do is grab the Li text so I'll copy that
paste it below here and put an li on the
end and I'm going to say floats not to
get rid of those floats the texture line
is going to be the left instead of
censor like that and I'll give them a
width of 100% instead of the 20% the
currently have and then I'll give them a
margin of a zero let's take away those
margins okay now we'll just star the
links themselves so we'll copy this
again and put an A on the M 2 star those
links and within here I want to give
them a color of white which is FFF then
I'll give them a padding of 10 pixels
I'll give them a border bottom of 1
pixel solid and we'll say about 400 400
400 K I want to display these as block
like that and when the display is block
it automatically takes up the full width
available that's what's happening there
and then we'll give them a margin I was
0 just in case you have any margin
associated with them that should be
about right okay so that is the styling
done okay so when the menu is open it's
going to look like this when the menu is
closed it's going to look like this all
right
so we'll leave it at that I'm going to
copy all of these styles that we've done
right here I've control-c those and
we're going to pop them in our CSS file
over here within this media query and
I'll save it ok so now what I want to do
is create this JavaScript so that when
someone clicks on that Burger that
little icon I want it to expand so the
first thing we need to do is put a
document.ready statement so let's do
that
we'll say document and this is where you
jQuery comes in handy by the way and
don't ready and then function like that
okay so when the document is ready when
it's loaded then we're going to fire off
this function and the first thing we're
going to do is go after the heat burger
nav so that's going to grab that element
and then I'm going to say on click so
when someone clicks that burger now I
want you to fire the following function
which I'm specifying right here and
within that I'm going to say header nav
ul toggle class which is a jQuery method
and the class we're going to toggle is
open so what's the herbal I seen is look
whenever you click on burger nav that
little icon I want you to either give
the UL within it a class of open or take
it away if it already has that class
okay so that's all there is to it guys I
want to save that now and then come back
over to this website we're going to
refresh when we click on this now it
gives this a class of open if we inspect
you can see this UL class open they're
actually getting those styles of
height:auto which is overriding this
height of zero but when we click it
again it takes away that class and this
time the height is zero okay perfect
alright guys so that is the mobile menu
made if you have any questions
