35th vgs tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about filters okay
then so first things first what a nerve
is a filter well a filter we can use to
change the output of data to a browser
for example we've got data here which is
being output to the browser the title
and the body and there are those two
things right here so say for example we
want to change the output of one of
these so that they are uppercase for
example the title instead of lowercase
we could use a filter to do that for us
or if we wanted to change this in some
way shape or form then we could use a
filter to do that for us now the
important thing is that filters do not
actually change the data directly
wherever we store them for example down
here we don't change that data we only
change how their output to the browser
ok the data remains the same so how do
we use these filters
well you jst no longer gives us these
filters by default they're not built
into VJ s2 because now their titles so
we have to make these ourselves but it
is really simple now the way we use
filters is by first adding a pipe to the
end of the data we want to use a filter
on and then the filter name so for
example if we want to create a filter
called - - upper case which is going to
get this and output it in upper case
letters then we just do a pipe and then
the name of the filter which is to upper
case now we've not made this filter yet
we have to make it so let's save this
and go to main j/s and we're going to
register this filter globally so that we
can use it in every component so the way
we do this is pretty similar to how we
create components or directives let's do
a comment first of all same filters and
then underneath now we're going to
actually make our filters so or state of
U dot filter and this takes two
arguments first of all we want to give
this a name and it is - - orca cakes
remember that's what we specified the
filter to be or right here so it's going
to look for this filter okay the second
argument is a function and this function
it takes in value I'll explain that in a
second
so then this value right here refers to
the data we use the filter on which in
this case is this if we were to use the
filter here then it will refer to this
stuff okay so this is the value that we
have access to in this function then we
can take that value and we can return an
updated value for example we can return
this value right here because it's a
string we can return that value which is
then transformed to uppercase so let's
do that
let's say return and we want to take the
value and say - or / and case and we can
use to upper case because this right
here is a string so it's going to get
that string put it to uppercase and
return it and then it's going to output
it where this is okay so let's save this
and view in a browser and now we see the
title is in uppercase cool okay so let's
do another example say we want listing
right here this intro text to be shorter
is too long for an intro text so say we
want to put it down to size and show
maximum 100 characters we can use a
filter to do them so again let's go to
our show blogs component and down here
we'll add a filter to the body and this
filter is going to be called snippet
because it's going to create a text
snippet out of this thing right here
okay so I save that and create this
filter so underneath this one or save
you
dots and filter and then this filter is
called snippet and again we'll take this
function as a second parameter with the
value and at this time what we want to
do is cut that down to size and the way
we can do that is by saying well return
the value which again is a string and we
can use the slice method on a string to
say how many characters we want to slice
it down to now we want to slice it from
a zero of character that's the very
beginning to the hundredth character so
we're returning 100 characters in a
sense so if we save that now and view in
a browser
now we see this as being shortened
significantly and it's only 100
characters cool but what I want to do
now is add on like a dot dot at the end
so that any user really
notice that if you click onto the blog
there's more to come okay so the way we
can do that is just by tacking on the
dot here because this is a string we can
just concatenate it to another string by
saying plus and then the other string
which is dot dot dot okay so save that
again this time we get the dot dot dot
right now
cool so we've now used a filter to do
this and to do this and like I said
we've not altered the data in any shape
or form the data which is stored in
blogs which we retrieved right here is
still exactly the same this remains the
same to have only changed how we output
it to the browser okay so that's how we
create filters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
