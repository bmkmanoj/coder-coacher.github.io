tutorial of the best REST API series on
YouTube and in this video I want to talk
about what a REST API actually is
first things first I want to just make
sure that you have a good kind of base
understanding of JavaScript before you
embark on this course because it is
going to be quite JavaScript telling if
you don't understand that then I would
advise you to check out my JavaScript
for beginners playlist
the link is going to be down below
secondly it would be good if you did
have an appreciation or a basic grasp of
nodejs and MongoDB what also going to be
using both of those technologies in this
series now this second one is not
essential I am going to be walking you
through the whole process of setting up
nodejs MongoDB right through to creating
our express up so you don't need to know
it but it would benefit you as you work
your way through this tutorial if you
knew what I was talking about all of the
time so if you want to check out my
knowledge NS course and MongoDB course
first of all you can do I'll leave the
links to both of those down below as
well so then what is a REST API well I
think it's easier if we split this off
into two API and rest so API stands for
application programming interface and
restaurants for a representational state
transfer now that probably means
absolutely nothing to yourself we're
going to walk through these in more
detail so first of all the API write and
to explain this in more detail I just
want to abstract away from programming
altogether so imagine you've got a TV in
your house this is essentially an
application right now if you want to
interact with this application if you
want to change channels or you want to
turn a volume up what he do you reach
for your remote control and you press
the buttons so this in essence this
remote control is an interface for you
to interact with this application right
and this interaction is very human
you're actively and pressing these
buttons with your finger so in essence
this would be an application human
interface rather than programming but if
we take these concepts and now extend
them into programming then we have our
application which could be YouTube right
and we want to interact with this
application from our own application for
example we want to reach out and grab
and lifts on videos from a certain
person's YouTube channel right well
YouTube provides us with an interface so
we can interact with it and this
interface instead of being buttons on a
remote control would be a series of
endpoints so such an endpoint could look
something like this to search for a
particular video right so if we want to
find some videos from the YouTube
application we're going to use these
endpoints and we're going to use them
from our code so instead of mashing
buttons on our remote this time we're
calling this application we're using the
interface from our code so this time
instead of a human interface it's an
application programming interface right
so much like your TV exposes a log in
control or a channel control to you on
your remote a web app can expose a
programmatic interface instead tours for
a few users developers write these
different endpoints and we use those in
our programs
so some popular examples of ap is of the
YouTube API which we just talked about
Google Maps API a Twitter API or the
uber API so for example say as
developers we want to make an
application where users can book a taxi
through an uber taxi through it we can
use the uber API to do that so what
they're going to do is expose from their
code base this API a programming
interface with different endpoints so
that we can write told in our own
application to interact with this ruber
application and add that functionality
to our app right for example we could
quite easily use a specific endpoint
make a request to this API to get a list
of drivers within a given area and we're
going to retrieve that back in JSON
format and then display that to our
users on our application in whatever way
we want all right so that's what an API
is so now we know what that is let's
just turn our attention to the rest part
of REST API some rest stands for
representational state transfer and that
alone probably doesn't mean much to you
so if we break this down basically it's
an architectural style of the web right
it's a set their standard or set of
guidelines by which we can
structure and create api's and we can
identify rest api is because they follow
this kind of structure they have these
identifiable properties of your like so
what are these properties so the first
one is that they make use of resource
based urls okay so imagine we're just in
a browser and we're going to a website
football comm four slash scores I don't
know whether these are real URLs by the
way I've just made these up but anyway
imagine this URL right here gives us
this web page and it's got a lot of
different scores on it this in essence
is a request for a resource isn't it the
resource is the webpage HTML CSS and
JavaScript so it's returning that to us
right and this in essence is just a get
request
we're just requesting this data and it's
being processed through a browser or we
could go to forward slash team's forward
slash Arsenal and that would send us a
resource a HTML page right so rest api
is follow the same kind of resource
structure so this time if we want to
interact with an API instead of
navigating in a browser to the website
we could say okay we want some data from
football.com forward slash api forward
slash scores so this might be an
endpoint in this football con api and
what it would do to it instead of
returning a webpage that we can consume
on a browser it's going to return to a
some data we can consume within our
program right and do something with it
so it could return some JSON data same
if we go to /ap I fold slash teams four
slash Arsenal that could return a some
JSON data about the Arsenal team right
so these are resources it's resource
based if you like okay we're going to a
specific end points for different
resources the next prosecutor have is
that they make use of HTTP methods so
we've got four really four basic ones
get post put and delete and you get to
pick little retrieve data from a server
post to send new data to a server put to
update existing data already in a
database and delete to delete data
so we're going to talk about each of
these different requests later on but
these are the different HTTP methods
that REST API REST API is use to
interact with different applications but
these are the different HTTP methods
that REST API is use the next property
is that they make use of hate TTP status
codes for example kindred means
everything was okay for a for you
probably see that when you go to a page
and you can't reach it that means the
resource is not found 500 means there's
a server error and there's tons of
different status codes and we're going
to be using a few of these as we go
along as well so just a quick example
here I've navigated to my channel right
here and this in essence is a get
request we can make get requests from
our browser
every time we type in an address right
here to a specific resource we're using
a get request to get that resource right
and it's being displayed in our browser
and we would have a hard time giving
post requests or put requests or delete
requests through the browser but we can
use get request by just putting the URL
up there to whatever resource we're
looking for so in this example I'm going
to my channel right here on YouTube
right and if you're examining this
request right here we can see the
request URL so it's listing of taps in
the browser then we can see the request
method is get write the status code is
200 because that means everything is ok
cool but what you can't go to something
that's not ok if I just put a lot of
garbage in here like this this time I'm
going to get a page is not available and
if I click on to the URL that i typed in
you can see this is the thing that's
acting right up here this time it should
get request an explorer or 4 status code
which means that the resource can't be
silent ok so that's what status codes
are all about so anyway in this playlist
we're going to learn about all these
different HTTP methods and what they're
useful get post put and delete then what
we're going to do is create an API using
nodejs Express and MongoDB from scratch
we're going to test our API using
software called postman which is really
cool I'm going to show you that later
and then finally what we're going to do
is create a simple front-end to interact
with our API make requests
to it and that front end is going to
look something like this where we can
type in our location via latitude and
longitude so I'll just put some numbers
in here five ninjas and that's going to
return towards any ninja that's in a
certain radius to us okay so it's got
the name of the ninja the rank of the
ninja how far away is from us and this
little icon red means it's not available
green with me it is available for work
so that's the API we're going to create
an issue the front end for that API so
we can make requests to it for this
course I've prepared some files it's on
this repo right here I'm gonna leave a
link down below and there's a different
branch for each lesson with code in it
so if you go to the lesson 10 that's
going to give you the end code from
lesson 10 and you can view that all here
okay let's see more things I'm going to
use it Atem for my text editor it's
really cool Alfre so you can go to item
to aisle to download that and then I'm
also going to be using commander or CMD
a however you like to pronounce it for
my command line interface tool so well
yeah you can download that as well it's
free just go to this button right here
so then because that's your whirlwind
introduction to REST API in the next
tutorial what I'm going to do is get you
set up with no chairs and MongoDB if you
