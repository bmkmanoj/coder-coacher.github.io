and tricks tutorial and in this video
I'm gonna show you how to make a really
cool CSS only pop-up alright then so
here's a quick preview of what we'll be
making in this tutorial a CSS only
pop-up so that when you click this
button boom we get this pop-up and when
you click on the cross it disappears and
this my friends is built just using CSS
only no JavaScript whatsoever which is
are really awesome now I've gone with a
Christmas theme since you know we're
heading towards December and I'm
starting to get a little bit excited so
that is the reason behind this image and
this is actually a sponsored video by
story blocks which is a really cool
royalty free stock imagery website and
royalty-free basically just means that
you can download the image and you never
have to worry about paying royalties
it's yours to keep and used forever
it's where I found this background image
from right here so if you want to
download the same one or a different one
you can head on over to story blocks
comm /youtube the link is going to be in
the description box down below so you
can go ahead click that now and start
downloading your own images so this is
story blocks and you can get all the
stock images you can possibly imagine
premiere as well they've got tons of
high-res photos vectors icons and loads
more and if you do sign up you're going
to be able to download anything from
400,000 images in there member library
which is really cool they've got tons of
really good imagery and you're also
going to save 60% on marketplace content
as well so they're offering you a 7 day
trial - which is nice
so you can try it out for free and get
access right away to all these cool
photos vectors and loads more so the
image I'm gonna be using is this
Christmassy gold image right here so I'm
gonna just search for Christmas and gold
and hopefully we should see that on the
first page so we scroll down a little
bit we're gonna see right about here
this one so if you click on that they're
going to offer you different resolutions
I've gone for this one in the middle the
one megabyte one and have downloaded
that so you go ahead and do the same
thing and if we open up Photoshop now
you can see this is the designer
come up with so I'll just use this it's
the background image and I placed this
text I'm a little ninja icon at the top
as well so I'm gonna save out this image
now and I'm gonna see you in the text
editor all rather than so I've got ahead
and opened up a new folder called CSS
only pop-up in Adam and I've got this
pop-up inside this folder as well that
I've created now I've also got an
index.html file right here and there's a
little bit of code in there at the
minute but not much there's just a head
with a title and a link to this style
sheet which I'll open up in a minute and
in the body we have a comment here this
is where we're going to put our pop-up
code and a comment here to say normal
page code so this is where our normal
page content would be all the HTML for
our normal page right so I've just got a
h1 and a P tag with some lorem ninja
tips and in there at the minute and it
looks something like this okay so just a
basic HTML page at the minute now the
style for this is coming from this
Styles dot CSS file just two rules in
here at the minute a body with a
background of a white gray we've
stripped out the margin set the font
family the font size and the color of
the font then the wrapper which is this
thing right here which is containing all
of our normal page content and all that
does is keep it within a central column
of 960 pixels it sets the margin of 10%
top and bottom and auto left and right
aligns the text to the center and gives
the text a line height of 2m s so this
is all really basic stuff at the minute
so the first thing I'd like to do is go
ahead and create this pop-up HTML so the
first thing we need to do is create some
kind of surrounding element which is
going to act as an overlay so remember
when we had a look at that pop-up we had
a gray kind of semi transparent overlay
on the whole page we want to create that
div first of all so we'll say div and
this is going to have a class of pop-up
so this is a generic class whereby if
you have multiple pop-ups you could give
them all this class of pop-up right so
we can style all the popups the same way
and then we just have different content
within each different one so we also
want to give this an ID because that
will specify its uniqueness if you do
have several different pop-ups on a page
and this one is going to be called Xmas
hi
pop-up so this right here is serving as
our overlay if you like this is gonna
cover everything on the page and mask it
with a semi-transparent gray okay so it
kind of fades out the back of the page a
little bit then we want our actual
pop-up content to appear in the middle
right here so within this div we need to
create that pop-up content so let's do
another div and give this a class of
pop-up - content and inside here we're
going to do an image because we want our
image this pop-up image to appear inside
it so image source is equal to pop-up
JPEG and we'll give this an alt as well
and set that equal to X mas
- sale and that will do okay and down
below that what I want to do is an
anchor tag which is going to be the
little cross in the pop-up so that when
you click on that cross then it's going
to close the pop-up right so we'll get
say a plus is equal to close and then
inside this will place a little X like
that alright so now we've got our pop-up
right there and it's not going to look
like much on the page at the minute it
looks terrible in fact but we're gonna
star this in a second but before we do
that I also want to create a button down
here and this is the button that we need
to click when we want to open up the
pop-up so hey and then href is equal to
something and we're going to fill this
in later because this is going to be the
crux of what is controlling our pop-up
then we'll give this a class of button
alright or style that in a second in the
CSS I'm just gonna say show pop-up for
the text so let's save this now and
we've pretty much done out HTML we're
going to come back to this later on and
also this one I play so hates ref in
here because this is gonna control the
functionality of closing the pop-up but
we'll leave it there for now and we'll
go to the styles to start styling this
pop-up up a little bit so underneath the
wrapper I want to say button or style at
first of all and this button has two T's
and inside I want to say the border is
going to be 3 pixels solid
one one one which is a really dark gray
almost black we're also going to give
this a padding of 10 pixels and color is
going to be the same as the border which
is 1 1 1 we're also going to say text
decoration is known to strip out the
underline so it will save this now let's
just review it we see that button down
there which is pretty cool
alright then so underneath the button
I'm going to say
pop-up so this is the pop-up container
right here and remember this is going to
serve as our overlay our kind of viel of
semi-transparent gray that is going to
cover the whole page kind of fade it out
a little bit
alright so this pop-up we want to take
up the whole width of the page and we
want it to be fixed in position so it
never moves
so we'll say position first of all is
fixed and then width is going to be 100%
height is going to be 100% and also we
want to say the left is going to be zero
so it starts at the top left and top is
zero as well alright now the background
I said is going to be semi-transparent
so let's do RGB a which means we can
have an alpha channel inside the
parenthesis so we'll say zero zero zero
for black and then we're gonna say not
0.6 right which means that it's
semi-transparent if this was one it
would be fully an opaque meaning not
transparent at all and if it was zero it
will be fully transparent so let's save
that and it makes the background look
like this it just kind of fades out a
little bit so that the pop-up pops out
if you like it's more noticeable so
that's the background sort at the
overlay the next thing I want to do is
dial up the actual content inside the
pop-up so this dude right here and in
fact first of all let us use this ID to
target it so we'll say hash sign there
Xmas pop-up and then inside that we want
the pop-up - content yeah make sense so
the first thing I'd like to do is set
this to have a width of 600 pixels which
is the width of the image that I created
a high also of 600 pixels and a margin
of 100 pixels top and bottom and then
also left and right so that means it's
going to bring it down by 100 pixels
okay so let's just save this for the
time being and we can see that pop-up
now sitting in the middle of the page
that is much better that is where a
pop-up typically would be right all
right cool so the next thing I'd like to
do is set this position as relative and
the reason I'm doing that is so that we
can absolutely position this cross
within it okay so we're setting this as
the containing element of the Cross
position:relative so that when we
absolutely position this is positioned
relative to this right so we can
position in the top right easily all
right so position relative and finally
I'm going to say border is five pixels
solid and F F F which is white just
makes it pop out a little bit more I
think cool so now we've started that
let's move on to this little thing down
here this cross and that is going to be
used to close the pop-up so we'll say
closed and then inside position is going
to be absolute and we want to position
this in the top right so I'll say top is
five pixels and the right is five pixels
let's take a look at that yep that looks
about right now I want to set this to
have a background of two to two which is
kind of like a dark gray and they also
want to give this a border radius to
make it into a circle so I'll say border
- a radius is going to be 50% it's gonna
make it into a full circle in a minute
when we give it a width and a height and
first of all I'm going to say the border
is three pixels solid and it's going to
be white so FFF again and the color
inside of the cross is going to be white
which is FFF
we're also going to strip out the
underline of the cross or let's say text
- decoration is a non-save that have a
look what it looks like so far okay
looking better we just want to start
that wick down and basically the shape
of the circle so let's first of all say
line height is going to be 0 and what
that is going to do is strip out the
height of the whole container because
we're saying the line height of this X
right here is 0 0 pixels in height so it
strips out the height and then we can
specify the width and the padding so
that it looks like a circle so planning
first of all I'm going to say is 9
pixels at the top 0 left to right and 11
pixels at the bottom so let's save that
okay we get a height back and now I'm
going to say the width is 20 pixels so
save that and we finally just need to
say text align is in the center so it
centers that X okay looking good so now
we have that cross and we have all the
pop-up styled looking pretty good and we
just want to basically control this
functionality of when you click on the
cross then we hide the pop-up and when
you if we can confront display this is
none so pop-up display as none because
by default we don't want it to display
the page so when you click on this
button right here it's going to show the
pop-up so how the hell are we going to
do that well first of all we're going to
use a pseudo class and this pseudo class
is called target so have you ever used
an anchor tag and then specified a pound
symbol in here and then the ID of
something so for example this thing
right here okay now what would happen if
I clicked on this well let's have a look
if I go into the browser and say shell
pop up click on it you see this URL
right here it adds on that pound symbol
okay so this right here this ID this
element has become a target element
right so as soon as we click on this
this element becomes the target and
we're going to use the target pseudo
class so what we're going to say is when
the pop-up becomes the target and then
we're going to display it make sense so
let's say pop-up
and then pseudo-class target and this is
gonna display as block but does that
make sense so now you can see when this
is the target
this is displaying but when we get rid
of this it's not displaying when we
click on it it becomes the target again
and it's displaying as block all right
so when the pop-up is the target it
displays as block when it's not the
target then it displays as nan by
default so now we've got that button
working so that when we click on the
button it shows but we need to get this
working so when we click on that it
doesn't show and in fact it already did
and that's because that the href is
nothing at the minute but if we just add
a pound symbol inside that when we
refresh over here she'll pop up now if
we click anywhere else on the pop-up
then it doesn't work but if we click on
the cross because the target now is
becoming this and the pop-up is no
longer the target then it doesn't show
does that make sense so there we go my
friends that is how you make a very
simple CSS only pop-up as usual all the
code for this is going to be on my
github repository and I'm going to leave
that down below as well so if you want
to copy and paste from there feel free
to do so and finally guys if you enjoy
