your second get and get your tutorial
and in this video I'm going to go
through how to install git on your
computer
alright then so before we start using
git on our computer we first have to
install it now that's really easy to do
and I'm going to show you two ways to do
it the first way is to go to the git
website and this link I'll leave down
below and then click one of these four
links here depending on your operating
system that's going to download it to
your computer just go through the
installation steps and boom you have git
installed now if you're on Windows I am
going to recommend to do this instead
download commander which is a command
line interface for Windows and if you
download the full version it's going to
come with git installed as well so I
would recommend to do that purely
because this is a really cool tool as
well as installing dip finally I'm going
to recommend a theme for your text
editor that's what I'm going to be using
in this series as well you can download
that attempt
oh the link is also going to be double
look alright then so once you've
downloaded get and hopefully if you're
on Windows downloaded commander then you
want to open up your command line
interface and to check that you've got a
git installed all you need to do is say
gifts then double dash version and if
this throws back and number then you
have been successful in installing get
cool so the next thing I want to do is
set up a couple of options for git and
that is the username and the user email
now I want to do this because when we
start making changes in git git is going
to want to know who is making those
changes so they can keep track of it all
right so let's add in our username first
of all or say git config and this is
going to be double - global because
we're setting this in a global capacity
and then it's user name I'm going to
call myself by and Sean JP and then also
we want to use the email so we'll say
git config then double dash it global
then this time it's going to be user dot
email and I'm going to pour Sean Sean I
compelling comm this email does not
exist so don't try email and do it
okay so now we've settled our username
and email and if at any point we wanted
to see what they registered us we can
say git config and then user duck name
I'm not going to throw about the
username thing for the email okay now
the next thing I want to do is just want
you through a few basic command line
commands right that we're going to be
using throughout this series so if
you've never used it before feel free to
watch this otherwise just skip to the
next tutorial so first of all I'm going
to show you how to change directories
now that really of Sidi then doubled up
to go up and by the way this is a space
between CD and double dot and that's
going to take this up a directory can
see I've gone from being in short to
just users now if I want to go back into
the show directory I can say CD and that
stands for change directory by the way
and then just say short the directory I
want are going to alright I'm going to
CD again and this time going to
documents because in other the Documents
folder in there now if I would erased
the contents of this Documents folder I
can say LS that's going to list
everything inside it or on windows dir
that does a similar thing like for LS so
anyway that's everything inside this
directory so now I know if I wanted to
CD into another directory I could do
because I'm just looking at this list of
different directories now if I want to
make a new directory I can do that by
saying MK to make dir for directory and
I'm just going to call this test this is
going to make a directory called test
within my current directory so I'm going
to use LS to list those again and now I
can see test right here cool so let's
just go into that directory CD test when
we're in here we can make a new file now
if you're using commander or if you're a
Mac you can say touch if you're just
using Windows basic command-line
interface you can't do this and but I'm
going to say touch and then we name the
file so I'm going to call this index dot
HTML and this is going to create an
index.html file within this test
directory if it's had LS I'm going to be
able to see that right here all right so
now say I want to open this file with
utter my text editor I can just say Adam
and then the file name so index.html
this is going to open up at inform it
might take a second or two and it's
going to open
or with index dot HTML loaded into it
ready for me to edit which is a really
cool now this is taking a little bit of
time but there we go
so I've got index dot HTML open door
right there cool so I'll close that off
now to delete a file I can say RM that
stands for remove and that's going to be
index.html like so now if i type LS
we're not going to see that file anymore
because it's been deleted now I'm going
to go up a directory and this time I
want to delete the test directory so I
can do RM dir so I'll remove directory
and that's going to be test now when i
type LS to list the different things
test is going to be gone ok so that is
just an overview of some of the
different commands we might be using in
this series dead simple if you need to
watch this a couple of times do so
because they're going to be the most
basic commands that you will be using in
the command line and once you've got the
hang of them they are very easy to
remember ok so there we go ahead
we've got git installed on our computer
so in the next lesson we can go ahead
and start using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
