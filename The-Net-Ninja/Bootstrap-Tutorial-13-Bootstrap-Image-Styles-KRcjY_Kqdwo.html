13th bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
lesson we're going to talk about image
styles Wow alright there so as you can
see I'm just gonna row a but then I've
got four developments on each one of
those are given these column classes
alright
and each one of those have got an image
right so if we just view this in a
browser as is at the minute you'll see
this alright so you can see each of
these images is kind of overlapping the
column width that it's been given right
so if we hover over that image you can
see it's overlapping into the next image
so there is a way we can get around this
using one of built bootstraps inbuilt
classes which is what I'm going to show
you and the class is image - responsive
all right so if I do that now and in
fact I'm going to paste this into each
one so give them all class of image
responsive then I'm going to save that
come back over a refresh now you should
say yeah the each of the images and now
within each of the column widths so they
never exceed that width and if we just
click on the image and have a look in
the console over here we can see on the
styles that they've been given these
rules right here so the display type has
been set to block max width at 100%
which is why they're not overlapping
okay so the maximum width it can ever be
is 100 percent of their parent container
so this column width right here and then
they've been given a height of auto also
so that's what that class does I also
want to show you a few more classes
which are more kind of visual things and
the first one I'm going to show you is
image - circle and again I'm just going
to grab this and I'm going to copy it to
each one of these right here when I make
all these circles and then a refresh
over ear and boom guys now there are
circles and this is pretty common on
websites where you've got for kind of
selling points on the front or where you
go to the team page and they've got like
I don't know 50 people working there
they've all got like a little circle
with the face in it so yeah that's
pretty cool if you don't want it to be a
full circle you're not that extreme
we can't do something which is slightly
different which is image rounded and
never save that and refresh you can see
we still have these rounded corners
right here so it's a bit softer than
just a square but it's not the full
circle all right so we've got those
options and I'm also going to show you
the thumbnail class which is image
thumbnail I'm just going to apply this
to a couple of them so the first one and
the second and notice that this one is
rounded still but this is circle doesn't
matter we can still apply the image
thumbnail to both and if we view that in
a browser now it's a bit of a difference
but you can see this little bit of
padding around the image itself okay and
then it's also got this border around as
well so the idea is that these are now
thumbnails it's just got a little bit of
a different style to the normal images
now there's one more thing I want to
show you and that is this so for most of
the device width is going to be full of
comments are three columns in width
each one of these elements yeah you can
see up until we reach this breakpoint
here called XS 12 it's gonna be this
kind of width but when we do reach that
breakpoint now each one takes a 12
column width right now we did set that
class to each of the images which is
image responsive which means it takes up
maximum the full width of the parent
element but it doesn't have to take up
the full width it only takes up a max
width of that okay so if the picture was
like 1000 pixels wide then yet it would
still take up the max width here the
full span of the page but the natural
width of the image is 400 picked yeah
400 pixels all right so it only ever
takes up 400 pixels at most now a good
way to kind of present this better is to
centralize those images so that in a
central column rather than all the way
over to the left so to do that what we
need to do is apply another class and
the class is sent
- block I'm going to apply that to each
one of these dudes right here so that
ball in the middle alright point fit and
refresh and there we go guys everything
in the middle now alright so they are
just a few classes we can apply to
images that just make our life easier as
front-end developers so we don't have to
go into the CSS too much especially when
we've just prototyping quick websites
really useful so if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise guys I'll see you
