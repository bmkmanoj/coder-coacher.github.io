JavaScript for beginners lesson 6 and in
this video we're going to take a look at
the basic syntax and structure of
JavaScript that's coming up
all right then gang so there's just a
few things I want to go over when it
comes to syntax and structure of
JavaScript before we start writing any
real code and they're going to be
beneficial for you as we go forward
through this playlist so there's just a
few pointers I want to go through and
the first one is that javascript is case
sensitive I'll say that again because
it's really important it's case
sensitive
ok this little alert function that I've
written here this wouldn't be the same
as this because we've added a capital A
to the start of it okay this alert
function is a built-in function of
JavaScript and it's called alert with
lowercase letters if you were to try and
call it with an uppercase letter then
that would be void it wouldn't work okay
so it's case sensitive
the same goes for naming your own
functions or variables for example if I
was to write a function called my
function and then specify some code in
here don't worry about all the syntax
just yet
and then if later on I was to try and
call this function by saying my function
this wouldn't work purely because I have
a capital F here and not here all right
so case sensitivity is very important in
JavaScript the second point I want to
make is that most things you do in
JavaScript is a statement okay you can
have a statement to throw up an alert
box like this this is a statement in
JavaScript or you can have a statement
to change the color of your webpage
background or a statement to change the
position of a picture from left to right
on your webpage they are all statements
okay and each statement ends with a
semicolon
all right now we could have another
statement next to it like I could do
this and I don't know
hi again like that a run statement left
to right but if you carried on doing
that then this would get pretty
unreadable and
legible quickly so the best thing to do
is pop them one on top of another like
that okay now each statement ends with a
semicolon that's important as well now
technically speaking if you miss out the
semicolon it will still perform a
function like this but if I was to write
all the statements down below it
wouldn't know where the first statement
ended and so it may get a bit confused
and not work so I want you to get in the
habit of always adding your semicolon on
to the end of statements okay
so ideally on top of each other a new
line for each statement and always put
your semicolons after a statement now
whitespace is not sensitive like I said
you could have another one of these
statements right next to this and you
could put in five spaces ten spaces
three line breaks on library it doesn't
matter okay generally what I do is if
it's grouped together with this
statement like you've they're performing
tasks that are similar to each other and
relate to each other I just do this and
have them close next to each other
hugging each other on the next line if
they were something different and maybe
put a line break in or two then do a
comment just above this to say that it's
a different part and that brings me on
to comments so comments are very similar
to CSS comments okay we can comment out
a segment of code by doing a forward
slash than enough strips and then an
Asterix and a forward slash and that
would comment all the code out in
between these two comments here these
two asterisks we if we want to just make
a single line comment we can do that by
doing two forward slashes and then
everything on this line will be a
comment and this is what I generally do
if I'm doing a little header in my
JavaScript to remind myself and all the
developers working on this script what
is coming up so I could write here the
second alert just like that and then
that would remind me when I come to redo
this code that this is the second alert
and I could do something like the first
alert
okay so that's generally what I do and
yeah if I'm just doing sorry about this
if I'm just doing a simple statements
like this then maybe I don't need these
comments but when you have like 20 lines
of code between each comment then it's
useful just to remind yourself what's
going on in that code okay so the last
thing I want to mention is the
JavaScript much like CSS rules from top
to bottom so it will come in and it will
perform this statement first of all for
come further down then it will perform
this statement and then any subsequent
statements down below now this is really
important because if you have multiple
statements that you want to perform in a
particular order you have to make sure
you put them in that order in the
JavaScript for example if I had a
statement that was say make the image
invisible yeah
and then under that I'll say move the
image from top to bottom and then make
the image visible all right so that
would first of all see one image at the
top here like this it would make it
visible fade out then it would move it
behind the scenes to the bottom so you
wouldn't see it moving at the bottom
because it's still invisible and then
when it gets to the bottom it will turn
visible again now if I was just to
change the order of these two that would
impact the functionality of it
significantly okay so first of all your
image would be here it would move it
from top to bottom so you'd see going
right down to the bottom then it would
make it invisible and then invisible so
you'll just see it like flicker at the
bottom okay so very important the order
of your JavaScript so just to summarize
the points we've made in this video
first of all javascript is case
sensitive and I always remember that
because of the way this JavaScript is
written here we have a uppercase J and
an uppercase s so it always reminds me
that JavaScript is case sensitive and it
contains many statements
all ending with a semicolon I remember a
statement is pretty much anything that
you do in a JavaScript document so
changing the color of something changing
a position of something changing the
visibility of something all those are
statements and they all end with the
semicolon it's not sensitive to
whitespace or libraries so you could
have three lines between your statements
ten lines or you can pile them next to
each other it's up to you you can write
one line comments using two forward
slashes or multi-line comments using the
forward slash and Astrix combination and
JavaScript runs from top to bottom so
all of these six points are really
important and you just want to ingrain
them into your thought process when
you're writing JavaScript so that's
about it for this video if you have any
questions feel free to pop them down
below I'll answer all of those otherwise
