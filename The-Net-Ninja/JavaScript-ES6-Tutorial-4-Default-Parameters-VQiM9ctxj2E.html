fourth atma script six tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
default parameters Wow okay there's so
default parameters are basically
parameters that a function can rely on
as a backup if parameters aren't
explicitly declared or pass through to
the function when we call it okay so
that might sound a bit like gobbledygook
so let's go through an example just to
explain this a little bit better what
I'm gonna do is create function first of
all and I'm just gonna call it
LOC because that's all we're gonna do
we're gonna log something to the console
and this is going to take and number
right and all we're going to do is log
that number to the console so I'll say
console dot log No right so this
function right here is expecting a
number and if we call this function and
we'll say log five or something like
that then this is gonna work it's just
gonna log five to the console right so
if we refresh we're gonna see five right
there but what happens if we take that
five away and we don't pass anything
through to this function even though
it's expecting it well let's refresh we
get undefined okay because nothing has
been passed through so what we can do is
we can supply some kind of default
parameter to this function so that it
does lock something if nothing is passed
through like a default parameter right
so what we'll do is we'll say dumb
equals ten and so what will happen now
is when we call this function log
without passing through a parameter here
when it's required it's going to use
this default parameter of ten so if i
refresh now then we're going to log 10
to the console because that's the value
of none but we can override this default
parameter by explicitly passing one
through here when we call it so if I
pass through 20 press save and refresh
it's going to log 20 out so when we're
passing through a parameter is going to
override this default parameter value
right here
okay so let's do something a little more
complicated just a little more and I'm
gonna create a function here and I'm
gonna call it log ninja
and it's going to take two parameters or
three parameters it's gonna take name so
the ninja name it's gonna take the belt
so the color of the belt so they're both
going to be strings and it's going to
take an age parameter all right so let's
open those up and I'm going to log them
to the console that looks like this so
console dot log then I'm gonna say my
name is factor one of those I'll just
concatenate name and then go on to the
next line so you can read it more then
I'm gonna say and my belt color is then
concatenate the belt like that and then
finally what we're going to do is say my
age is and then concatenate the age like
that so we're just gonna print out a
sentence with all of those variables
inside right so let's go ahead and call
this function so it's called log ninja
and I am just gonna pass through a few
things to begin with so Shawn for the
name Belle is gonna be black and age is
gonna be 28 okay so let's save this now
and refresh this time what we see is my
name is Shawn my belt color is black and
my age okay there's a typo let's go to
that my age is 28 so what happens if we
don't supply these well again we're just
going to refresh and we get one defined
all of the show so let's apply some
default parameters to these so we'll say
name equals for the default Ryu belts
equals red and then age equals 25
okay so let's save that now and refresh
and you can see when this is called
without any parameters
it defaults to these default parameters
right here that we've specified within
the function so my name is Ryu my belt
color is red and my age is 25 again
let's just override these with mine I'll
say Shawn and at this time yeah why not
pink
nice among the color and I'll say for a
for my age this time by the way I'm not
40 okay so my name is Shawn and my belt
color is pink and my age is 40 alright
so that guys is default parameters it
provides us with a way to use some kind
of backup of values for parameters when
they're not explicitly passed through
into a function when we where we require
them okay so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to share subscribe and like and I'm
gonna see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
