sixth grunt jazz tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna show you how we can
uglify our javascript file
alright so currently in our build folder
we have this script J's file which is a
result of all of our JavaScript files
concatenate it together so that makes
this file pretty large and if we scroll
right down you can see it's currently
about eleven thousand lines long now
typically when we deploy this to a
website what we want to do is compress
this file so that it's all squashed up
together so that when we request it from
a server it takes much less time to come
back so essentially what we're doing is
uglify the file we're changing the
variable names into something shorter
compressing all the white space etc okay
so that's what we're gonna do in in this
tutorial so let's click off it and the
first thing we want to do is install the
plug-in that we need to do this so if
you go to the grits website right here
and search for uglify then hopefully
you're gonna see this country bubbly
file click on that and it's going to
take you to the NPM website and show you
how to install this and it's this
command right here npm install grunt
country and public eye then we're saving
that to our dev dependencies so let's
copy that dude we'll just paste it right
in here and click enter so they'll just
wait for this to install okay cool so
when that's installed let's just check
our package Jason to find out yep there
we go grunt country ugly fire cool so
now we can load this plug-in in here so
I'm going to copy this do it again paste
it down below and change this to ugly
fine okay
now what we want to do is configure this
so we'll go up to the config right here
and this time the job is going to be for
the oak leaf I plug it and again I'm
going to use this property name for our
particular task which is going to
compress this javascript file so bill
tasks and then this is going to be an
object and again we need to do something
similar to this so I'm just going to
copy and paste down here and right here
I'm going to change this to this file
right here this is
that source file so build /script adopts
Jas and for the sake of this tutorial
I'm just going to output the file in at
the same place so essentially what I'm
going to do is override the file I'm
going to look through it compress it all
and then save over it with the
compressed version so let's save that
and let's go down here and say grunts
and what we want to do is run the portal
if I command press Enter
the hopeful lips is going to go out no
that's because we spell ugly fight early
fight okay grunts ugly fight and
hopefully this time it's going to go out
and compress that file when it says done
then we're going to see this file book
date okay so it says don't so let's have
a look at this script file and now you
can see it's updated that so it's all
squashed together and if you look at
these variable names there are things
like e a B etcetera so it's all really
minified that file into a lower file
size cool so there we go that is how we
uglify our JavaScript any questions feel
free to leave those down below otherwise
I'm gonna see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
