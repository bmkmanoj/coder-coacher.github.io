third angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to go ahead and
download angularjs and insert it into
our project
all right then so I've got a head-to
angularjs or you should go there too and
we're going to download angularjs now
it's two options download angularjs one
or try the new angular two this is the
more recent version I'm not going to
cover that in this tutorial playlist I'm
going to go through angularjs one and
I'll go through angular two in the
future which adds additional
functionality to this library so what
we're going to do is click this button
right here and we're give it a few
options the first one is to choose which
branch we want so got a couple of
options either the most recent stable
branch which is 1.5 or a legacy branch
which is older so we'll keep with the
most recent one right there that's
stable then the build now that can be
either minified which is the the
compressed where everything squash
together or the uncompressed version or
zip so we're just going to get a
minified one and then we can also
install angular JS via the CDN which is
a content delivery network or one of
these two options right here I'm just
going to download it and insert it into
the files manually but before I do that
I just quickly want to talk about these
additional modules right here so if we
click download now we're going to
download the core angularjs library
which we're going to need to make any
kind of angularjs application and that's
got all that kind of core functionality
embedded into it but if we want to add
additional kind of functionality such as
angularjs animations we're going to have
to download additional modules which are
just additional JavaScript libraries to
add that functionality in okay so let's
have a look at these we'll open that in
a new tab and you can see we've got an
angular animate j/s file there so we'll
download that if we want to use the
animations angular route we download
that if we want to set up our old
angular routing system so these
additional modules we're not going to
use now but in the future when we add
additional functionality to our projects
we are going to come back here and we're
going to download all these modules okay
I just wanted to show you those now
so let's download angularjs you can see
I've already done it this is the the
second time I've done it and then once
you've downloaded that we just need to
insert it into our project
okay then guys so I've opened up this
angularjs playlist folder the one that
I've uploaded to the github so I
downloaded that going right here now and
I'm just going to pop this angular dot
min in there okay but I want to organize
this a little bit better so I'm going to
create a new folder and I'll call this
up which stands for application and all
that application kind of files are going
to go in there alright so let's move the
angular document into the app folder and
then within here I'm gonna create a new
folder called lib which stands for
library and all the kind of angular
library files that we download like this
one the angular document the core one or
the animate or the route stuff we're
going to pop in here keep everything in
one place nicely organized okay so what
we've done that if we just go ahead and
open this project up in the item editor
we can see now this app folder and this
file right here
we just need to link to that file in our
index but HTML file okay so we're going
to do that in the head and I know in
previous tutorials in other playlists
I've talked about adding the scripts at
the bottom of your body tag but with
angularjs we should insert it in the
head because it uses a templating system
it's going to manipulate the Dom
somewhat so we want it in the head okay
so we'll say script source equals and
then pretty neat trick you just
right-click here in atom and go to copy
project path it's going to get the full
path to the file okay
so then we can close that off and while
our guys now we have linked up to
angularjs so now we can create an
angular app in this code all right so
that's all the way to show you in this
tutorial in the very next one we're
going to start diving into the code and
do some of the cool stuff we can do with
angular so RC gutter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
