18th angular2 tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk about route parameters
all right there so in the last tutorial
we set up our routes like this and we
had a path for the directory and a path
for the home page so this is the hole
and then if we click on there its
forward slash directory and that shows
the direct review so we had those two
routes set up but what if we have
something like this directory forward
slash and then a particular ninja names
such as array or something like that
then ideally what we'd want to do is in
angular in our application try and grab
whatever a user has requested here this
parameter they provide it for a
particular ninja so that we can display
information about that ninja right
at least their name so in angular we can
do that this is called a wrapper a meter
and we can set up routes for it and then
grab the parameter that the user
provides us with so I'm going to go to
the applet routes file right here and
instead of just directory I'm going to
do directory forward slash and then to
say we're going to expect some kind of
parameter we do a color and then this
could be something like IDU it's going
to be a number my case I'm going to do
ninja it's going to be the name of a
ninja so I'm going to save that and then
yeah I could go ahead and request this
now and it's going to direct me to the
directory component however I need a way
to grab this data this parameter into
class so if I head over now to the
directory component we're going to do
all of that here we're going to grab
that data in the URL this parameter
right here okay now to do it we're going
to have to import something so I'm going
to come up here and I'm going to say
import the thing I'm going to import is
called activated route so it's just
activated camel case route like that and
then this is going to be from at angular
forward slash router okay so now we can
use that and then what we're going to do
when we use data from outside of the
class when it's not defined in here we
need to
pop it in there so we need to grab this
and put it inside the constructor as a
parameter for this constructor this
class so what I'm going to do is say
route in fact I'll say private or route
and this is going to be of type
activated route remember this is how we
type things a colon and then the type so
now we're going to use this route in its
constructor function okay so what I want
to do now is say this dot ninja this is
the property we're going to store it on
and we may as well declare it up here to
begin with I'm going to say ninja is
going to be of type string like that
so this ninja is going to be equal to
this thing right here this will route
which is the activated route so route
dot snapshot dot params and then the
name of the parameter we want and the
name of the parameter that we want we
set up already in the routes file is
ninja so if we put ninja in there this
is going to grab that ninja parameter
that we provide right there on this
realm so what we're doing is importing
the activated route from the angular
router then we're injecting that into
the constructor right here and we're
using it within the constructor to save
this ninja which is this property right
here it's going to be a string is equal
to the route this active route take a
snapshot of that route so it's current
state and then grab the parameters off
the route and the parameter I want is
ninja and then what we're doing is
setting that equal to this ninja which
is here but then what we'd like to do is
display that ninja on the page so if we
go forward slash rail it's going to
display rail if we got forward slash
something else it's going to display
whatever we put so let's go to the view
I'm going to save this I'm going to go
to the directory view and then
underneath here what I'm going to say is
ninja like so so I'm going to save this
now and come over here and I'll refresh
and then I'm going to go to directory
forward slash right
press ENTER and now you can see we get
directly works and array you underneath
so we've grabbed that data in here using
this and then we've stored it in this
variable which we've output in the view
using string interpolation right there
and then it outputs to the view so now
we do any name appear like Yoshi it's
going to work there we go Yoshi now you
might not just want to show the name but
then once we have the wrapper in - this
could be an ID which we can look up in a
database which is going to return some
data to us then we can display the data
for that particular user or ninja so
there we go guys that is how route
parameters work and how we can grab the
wrap parameter from the URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
