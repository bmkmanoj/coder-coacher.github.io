sixth atma script six tutorial and in
this video we're gonna take a look at
template strings Wow notes so what
happen play strings well template
strings are pretty similar to normal
strings except they've got a few extra
features baked in which are pretty cool
so let's just go ahead and do an example
and we'll create a variable we'll just
call it attempt for template string and
where we would normally define a string
using quotes like that either double or
single with template strings we have to
use backticks
now a back tick on my keyboard is just
below the escape button at the top left
might be somewhere completely different
on yours anyway I find that do a couple
of back ticks and then we place our
template string within that so let's
just create a simple sentence first of
all I'll say hello my name is ray
alright then so if we log this to the
console I should say console dot log we
should expect pretty much the same thing
as if we were to log a normal string to
the console so let's refresh over the
hair we go hello my name is Ryu so all
we can find so far so one of the
different things that we can do with
template strings is that we can add in a
line break without using the line break
character so if I come down here and
just press ENTER and save then I'll
refresh we're going to see that line
break in the console so it's not ignored
it
it doesn't ignore line breaks or
whitespace if I add in a new one press
refresh that prints out as well and even
a few spaces and we get that there as
well so template strings do not ignore
white space so you can format this drink
however you want it to display all right
so that's pretty cool and okay it might
not blow you away
but what other cooler features is that
we can embed expressions or variables
into strings as well which is pretty
cool so let's go through a simple
example all right so what I'm going to
do is create a function first of all and
this function is gonna be called log
ninja and it's just going to log some
information but a ninja and I was gonna
log is just the name and I don't know
age so let's go ahead and
making a name variable and an age
variable so right now what I'm gonna do
is console dot log my my name is and
then I'll do this how we would normally
do it in JavaScript we concatenate the
variable my name is name then
concatenate again and my age is and
we're going to concatenate let's just
return to the next line so you can see
it the age variable so if I call this
function now by saying log ninja and
then passing in the name as Ryu and the
age 24 then we should see this display
in the console my name is right and my
age is 24 okay now with template strings
instead of all this concatenation we can
just embed the variables into the
template string which is a lot easier
and better in my opinion so we use the
backticks instead then all we're gonna
say is my name is and then when we embed
a variable or an expression we need to
pop down in a dollar sign and then two
curly braces like that and then we place
the expression in between okay so first
of all we want the name variable that's
what we're inserting and then a my name
so and my age is we'll do the same thing
for the Aged variable dollar sign and
then the variable embedded right there
so if we save this this should do pretty
much the same thing my name is Ryu I'm
at ages 24 but this looks a lot more
elegant and it's just better in my
opinion to do okay so that's pretty cool
and instead of passing variables through
here we can also pass through any of
these expressions such as 10 plus 9 like
that let's just return this to the next
line so you can see it
my name is 10 plus 9 if that will do
that so if I save that now my name is
right and my age is 19 he's evaluated
this mathematical addition and it's just
output the result there
okay so that is pretty cool and now
that's how we use template strings so if
you have any questions feel free to
leave a comment down below otherwise
guys I will see you in a very next
