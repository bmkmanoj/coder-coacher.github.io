is CSS for beginners lesson 18 and in
this video we're going to talk all about
attributes electives that's coming up ah
alright so here I am back in the HTML
file I've totally stripped out the
syntax dot CSS but before we get started
with the CSS and quickly wanna have a
quick recap of what attributes are in
HTML so essentially attributes our way
of giving HTML tags additional
information about that tag so this here
would be an attribute of ID this here
would be a class attribute this here
will be a rel attribute this a type
attribute etc anything you see in green
text here is an attribute now if you
want to learn more about attributes in
HTML I have done a video on that in my
HTML probate beginners course so I'll
leave a link to that in the description
down below but for the rest of us we're
going to get cracking we're going to see
how awesome these attribute selectors
are now they are really really awesome
because they can target pretty much any
tag on your page that has an attribute
associated with it and you can get
really specific with these like I'll
show you in this video but we'll start
with a basic example and what we're
going to say is we're going to go after
any span here which has a class
associated with it this class attribute
now it doesn't matter what that class
attribute is could be Det it could be
horse anything you want the class to be
always saying is that the span must have
a class attribute associated with it so
how would we do this well the first
thing we do is we write our span element
here in the selector and then the
attribute portion of the selector is
always contained within these square
brackets so that's the next thing we do
and then the next step is to write the
attribute name in this case it's class
so we just write class and that's it
that right there my friends is an
attribute selector and what we're saying
is we want all the span elements that
have a class attribute associated with
it so that's these three here not this
one because there's no class and we're
going to call these purple so oops I've
spelled out wrong
double so we'll save this and view this
in a browser now
ople with chrome and there we go guys
everything is purple here these three
spans and this one is still black so
what else can we do well we can do with
any attribute whatsoever say we want to
target these gifts yeah and in fact just
for air just for demonstration purpose
I'm going to do another gift but I'm not
going to give it an ID and then within
that I'll do P tag this is the third div
and I'm going to say that so what we're
going to do is just go after div tags
with an ID attribute associated with it
so just these two here this one and this
one not this so how would we do that
well again we write our element name
which is div and then the square
brackets and then we write the attribute
name which is ID and we're saying there
oops sorry about this one that should be
deer with the element name that ID and
then we're saying there we want every
div element which has an ID attribute
associated with it and we're going to
give these a background oh great yeah
and we'll save that and review this in a
browser and there we go so these two
here these gifts have a background of
gray because they have an ID associated
with it and this third one here this
dude doesn't have a background of gray
so again doesn't matter what the ID is
or what the class is just that they have
those attributes associated with them
cool now what if we want to be more
specific what if we want to say the
class should be something specific like
Dec or the ID should be main content or
the title should be Google well let's
give that a whirl let's first of all
target all A's with a oops a title
attribute associated with it and doesn't
matter what that title is we're going to
give these a color of red
so hopefully that should be these two
links here because they both have this
title attribute so we'll save that and
we'll view this in a browser again
and there we go these two are red
because they have a title attribute this
one here remains blue now what if we
want to get more specific we want the
title to be equals search engine which
is this title here this eight link has a
title attribute of search engine and
notice this guys this here is identical
to this both in terms of case sensitive
I've got the capital there and the white
space here has to be identical
essentially a good way of doing this is
to copy all of this and paste it in
between there
okay so let's save that and hopefully it
will just go after this tag here now so
we'll view this in a browser and there
we go just this one with a title of
search engine that's really quite
amazing you can see from next you can
get really specific when a class won't
work and ID won't work or anything else
you know an element or a child selector
you can rely on this attribute selector
to really hold down and get the the
element that you want but hold on
there's more we can do more we can do
something called pattern matching okay
and to demonstrate this I'm going to
give you this example now to give an
element multiple classes we just put a
white space or a space bar in between
the classes and separate them that way
so we'll give this a US of holes as well
okay and say we want every span which
has a class of Dec now you would think
we'd do this yet class equals Dec and
that should work that should call color
these three here purple however this one
here has multiple classes associated
with it and the value of this class is
Dec whitespace halls which is not this
so this one will not be picked up these
two will but not this one so how do we
get around this well we use what's
called the tilde and that's this thing
here it's a little squiggly line and we
put it before the equal sign and this
pattern match is saying that we want
the value of deck to appear anywhere in
a space delimited list okay so that's
saying if it has the class of deck even
if it has multiple other classes
associated with it as well doesn't
matter
we'll still pick it up so let's view
this in a browser just to make sure
oops open with Chrome and yeah there we
go guys all these three spans here
they're all purple okay so that's how we
attribute much sorry that's how we put
match to multiple classes now we can do
other things we could target specific
sections of the attribute so say for
example we have I don't know a few links
here that are downloads a tariff equals
I don't know something dot PDF all right
and PDF final and what we'll do is we'll
just copy this so we've got a couple of
them so imagine that you want to style
your PDF links your download links a bit
differently than any other link well we
can do this we can and we can change
this with an identical something to PDF
and what we'd do is we'd say we want oil
a's yeah and then we'll open it our
attribute part of the selector and then
the href is going to be the attribute
we're looking at and what we want is
that we want to star the PDF downloads
differently so the ending of these hate
refs has to be PDF because the dot PDF
PDF so the way we do this is by putting
a dollar sign here and then if we put
PDF what we're saying here guys is that
grab all the a links that have an href
attribute associated with it that ends
in PDF that's what this dollar sign
means end in PDF so it's dollar sign
equals PDF okay so we're going to color
those
if we're not used green okay so that
should just be these two here so let's
view this in the browser again open this
up show an explorer open with chrome
brilliant there these guys we've got the
PDF file starred differently so this is
really really flexible stuff and there
is more we can have an attribute
starting with something the way we do
that is for the carrot now it's not
gonna be a PDF it's going to be hit TTP
and that would kind of signify that this
is going to be an external link okay
so then we'll call out our external
links and pink why not
so we're saying here grab all the A's
which have a href attribute associated
with it and they start that's what the
carrot symbol here signifies is HTTP so
that should be this and this they're the
two external links so let's see if that
works
we'll view this in a browser one last
time and then we go guys how awesome is
that
really they're called pink and you can
see hopefully now that this attribute
selector business is amazing we can hone
in right down to individual elements
with specific links or specific titles
anything that you want okay so really
great selectors so if you have any
questions about this whatsoever feel
free to comment below and I'll try my
best to answer all of those and if you
enjoy these videos please like them
please share them or subscribe I'm going
to see you what guys in the next one
coming very soon where we're going to
cover pseudo selectors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
