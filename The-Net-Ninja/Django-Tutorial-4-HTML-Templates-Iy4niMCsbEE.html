django tutorial and in this video we're
going to take a look at HTML templates
alright then so in the last video we set
up these URLs forward slash about or
just forward slash to detect when a user
goes to either of these URLs and then
fire one of these functions so either
about or home page and we send back a
simple HTTP response in both cases so it
looks something like this in a browser
when we go to forward slash about or
this or the home page alright now this
is pretty cruddy if I went to a website
and got this for the home page I'd be
pretty annoyed so instead what we're
going to do now is start to look at HTML
templates and sending back those to the
browser instead of this text so how are
we going to do that well first of all
what we need to do is create a templates
directory okay that's the first thing we
need to do and what we're going to do is
create that in this root directory of
the project so I'm going to right click
and go to new folder and call this
templates ok and inside that folder we
need to create two templates one for the
home page and also one for the about
page right so let's create the home page
first of all I'll go to new file and
we'll say homepage dot HTML and
inside here I'm just gonna type HTML and
then tap an in item it's going to create
this little boilerplate HTML template
for me in the title I'll just say
homepage and down here we'll just do a
h1 and inside there can be this text
this is the home page and below that
we'll just do a P tag
side we can say welcome to Django notic
alright so if we save that now we have
the home page let's also create the
about page so I'll call this about dot
HTML and I'm just going to copy this
dude and paste it over here cuz I'm
super lazy we'll change this to about
and then this will change to about us
and underneath we'll just put we like
general alright so now we have those two
hate email templates one for the about
page one for the home page and we serve
these up to the browser when a user
visits either just forward slash for the
home page or forward slash about while
the about page so we'll send the HTML
templates instead of these things right
here yeah so let us just now comment out
these dudes by putting a hash in front
of each one and instead what we're gonna
do is return a template right now to do
that we need to render a template and to
render something we have to import the
render module so let us do that will say
from Django dot shortcuts in
ports render and by the way if you're
looking at all these different inputs
thinking oh my god how and earth and
we're going to remember to do all these
different imports
don't worry about it you don't need to
remember everything just as long as you
know you have to do it that's fine
because then you can always look up how
to do something and forever looking
things up doesn't make you a bad
developer you just need to know that you
have to do it okay so we've imported
this module and what that is going to do
is allow us to render a HTML template in
the browser right so that's what we're
going to do instead of returning this
HTTP response we're going to return a
render of a template so let's do the
home page first of all or say return and
then it's going to be render and inside
this render function it takes two
parameters the first parameter is always
the request object right we're sending
that first of all then it's going to be
whatever template were you want to send
back which is going to be inside this
templates folder so I want to send back
home page dot HTML
okay so Django knows to look inside this
templates folder or this so the next
thing we want to do down here is say
return and then render again inside
we've got the request then we want it to
be about dot HTML all right so if I save
this now hopefully if I go over here and
go to forward slash then we're gonna get
the home page in fact template does not
exist and the reason this is not working
is because I've stupidly forgotten to do
something always do this you have to go
into your settings most of all scroll
down here until you find templates right
here and what you're looking for is this
property ders which stands for
directories and we want to put in here
where our templates are stored only then
does Django know to look inside this
templates folder if I was you and always
call this templates you can call it
something else but sometimes it throws a
wobbler if you do that so let's just
leave it as templates okay now if we
come over here and refresh then we get
this template for the home page this is
the home page right so Django is looking
at this URL is st. ok based on that URL
I want to fire the home page
therefore I'm gonna render this hompage
dot HTML file which is in the templates
folder and it knows to look in the
templates folder because we've said
right here this is where they are stored
ok so let's try the same four forward
slash about now alright so we get the
about page this is freaking awesome
now we've easily created two URLs and to
HTML templates take this next to no time
to do that so in the next video we're
going to take this one step further
and we're going to look at creating
separate apps for different parts of our
project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
