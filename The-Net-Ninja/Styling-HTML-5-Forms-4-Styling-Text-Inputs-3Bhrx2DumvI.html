fourth html5 form styling tutorial and
in this video we're gonna style up our
text imports okay so this is where we're
up to so far this form is start to look
a lot more customized now and in this
video we're going to stand up this field
set right here and also these input
boxes now these input boxes have a type
of email and phone okay
so you can see type equals email and
type equal to foreign telephone so now
what we need to do is target those two
in the CSS of star them up a little bit
differently but before we do that what I
want to do is target the field set on
the legend and just star that a bit
better as well so let's say field set
then in here what I'm going to say is
padding about 20 pixels all the way
around and a margin also of about 20
pixels top and bottom zero or left or
right then I'm also going to change the
border to 3 pixels solid and then a 2 to
2 which is like a charcoal gray color
she's gonna be a bit lighter than our
background here okay cool so that's
looking a bit better now let's style up
this legend to match these P tags a
little bit so we'll say legend and we're
going to give that a padding of 10
pixels just to give it a bit of
breathing room around here and then it
will also say font size is gonna be 18
pixels and the letter spacing
it's going to be 0.1 m/s as well just to
give it a bit more space in between each
letter so let's save that ok cool now
that matches these a little bit more so
let's style up these things right here
now the way I want to do this is first
of all I'll give them a charcoal gray
background put them on separate lines
and then finally I want to give each one
a background image I want to give this
one a background image of some kind of
envelope and then this one of a little
telephone icon so let's start styling
these dudes so I'll say input and I
remember the type was equal to email and
also the type was equal to telephone so
input again and type is
Paul to tell us all all right now that
first thing I want to do is display both
of these a lot then I'm going to give
them a margin bottom of about 20 pixels
so let's say that I see what it looks
like now they're on each separate line
that's cool
next I want to say the padding is going
to be around 10 pixels to the top 10
pixels to the right 10 at the bottom and
have 50 pixels on the left and that is
just going to make room for this image
which is going to sit here the envelope
on the phone so let's give them a border
of zero we want to take a border away
and we want to say a border radius of
about 4 pixels and that's going to just
give this corner this corner and every
other corner just a slight curve so it's
a little less harsh okay you can see
that little curve there pretty cool
alright next I want to give it that
background of the image so that image is
the inputs one right here we can see the
little black icon there for the envelope
and the black phone as well so the
letters do that by saying background is
going to be go around the next image
/and it was input stop PNG and I'm going
to set up to no-repeat as well okay save
that all right cool now we want to set
the background color of this input
filter by the way you see that white one
there that little white envelope you can
barely see the black one but the white
one underneath we're going to use that
when we come to do our little validation
trick okay so if you go to this image
you can see the black one and you can
probably barely see it but there's a
little white envelope there and a little
white phone there so we're going to use
those later anyway for now let's just a
background color to these Impuls so
we'll stay background - color and that's
going to be 2 - 2 same as the border
around here cool and then what we want
to do is set the font size a little bit
larger sort of take font size is there
with 16 pixels and we also want to give
it a different
we'll say SS now that color is not going
to change this color right here this is
like a little gray color and that is
because we have a placeholder in each
one you see the placeholder there email
and phone number that's this thing and
this thing and when you click it and
start typing and that's going to go away
and it's going to be replaced by noir
text and that text that we write here
that is what is being controlled by this
color thing right here to have received
it now then we should see that quality
turns white cool so now what do we need
to do we need to change the location of
these background images so that this one
shows the kind of charcoal envelope and
this one shows the charcoal phone right
there so let's do that let's grab this
one first of all and change the
background position of this it will say
background - position and illicit that's
equal to seven pixels along the x
coordinate and eight pixels down along
the y coordinate so save that and now we
can see that little envelope in the
middle there that looks nice
well let's do the same thing for the
telephone so we'll paste that there and
we'll change this to telephone and we're
going to keep the x coordinate the same
at seven and then this is going to be
minus 58 pixels so it's going to move it
right off the strip and it's going to
show that fall cool so there we go
we have now styled our two text input
fields or rather the email input field
and the phone number in full fueled and
we're going to do our validation for
this in the last video down there okay
before we do that we're going to move on
in the next tutorial and stand up this
select box right there
and the bottom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
