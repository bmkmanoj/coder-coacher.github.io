yo ninjas what the hell is up my name's
Shawn from the net ninja and this is CSS
for beginners lesson for CSS syntax ah
so CSS is just a collection of rules
that's all it is really simple just a
collection of rules and each of these
rules can target a specific tag or
relevant in your HTML document and then
when we've targeted that tag we can give
it visual properties so that it looks
how you want it to in the browser so for
example we could have a rule which
targets all P tags that's all paragraph
tags on a page and we could say look we
want all P tags to be given a font size
of 12 pixels so that's how the text is
going to look on your web page or we
could have a rule which targets all tags
within a specific ID and we say we want
this positioned in a certain way on the
page of this to be a different
background color or we could have a rule
which time you told a tags that's all
links in the navigate tags a color of
blue and we want them all to be
underlined so that everyone knows they
are links so that's what we can do with
CSS rules we can target content and then
apply it visual properties to them now
we know that CSS is a collection of
rules and each one of these rules has
two parts to it the first one on the
left here is the selector and the one on
the right is the Declaration now the
selector kind of speaks for itself
this is what we use to select the tag or
the element that we want to apply
changes to and in this example I've gone
for the ID of page header now that hash
sign or that pound sign whatever you
want to call it at the start of page
header signifies that this is an ID and
we'll get more in depth about this later
on and just for now realize that the
thing on the left is the selector that's
what we use to select the element that
we want to style and on the right is the
Declaration this is where we apply
visual properties to it in this case
I've said I want the font size to be 10
pixels so everything within the page
header div is going to have a font size
of 10 pixels
now selectors can target a multitude of
things tag names IDs classes and many
other things I don't want to get too
bogged down by that now because we're
going to go into that in more depth
later on in different videos for now we
just want you to understand the basic
syntax of how we format rules so the
selector is on the left
I've given just a few examples here to
get into the swing of things okay so
we'll go through these the first one is
the header ID and then the pin so I'm
saying here I want all P tags within the
header ID and then we're going to style
those in this declaration the second
example I've got a period or a full stop
depending on where you're from in the
world and then comment and that says I
want the comments classes okay a period
or full stop signifies in CSS at class
and then within those classes I want to
grab all the div elements and I'm going
to stand those in a particular way in
the CSS in the Declaration and the final
one is the Li tag and I'm saying here
that I want all Li tags in the HTML
document to be styled this way in the
Declaration now the declarations
contains properties and values okay so
we've got our selector on the left and
the Declaration on the right with all
the properties and value pairs and every
declaration always starts with an
opening curly brace and always ends with
a closing curly brace and between those
who've got the values in the properties
now the property is always on the left
side in this first example that's the
font size
it ends with a colon and then a value is
always on the right hand side that's ten
pixels in this case and it ends with a
semicolon okay that's really important
you always put your colon at the end of
the property name and the semicolon at
the end of the value name and again
there's loads of values and loads of
property names don't get bogged down but
that now we're going to go into those
later on just understand now that the
declaration is on the right it's
contained within this curly braces
you've got your properties and your
values in the bottom example I've got
two properties and two values and
they're stacked one on top of the other
now you don't have to stack them like
this you grab them side by side of you
wish so have it however you want I
prefer it this way because I can see
each property and each value really
clearly on each line okay so your
preference I prefer this way now the
first example
so the the first property is font size
same as the first example and the second
property is the color and I'm saying I
want this text to be color red okay so
what we're going to do now that we've
got this basic understanding of how a
rule is formed is we're going to look at
a simple HTML document and we're going
to apply a few different CSS rules to
that document alright Here I am inside
brackets and I've got a simple HTML
document here by the way bracket is a
completely free awesome
text editor you can get it from brackets
dot io so I suggest you do that right
now and then join me back here where
we're going to apply some styles to this
document all right so I've already
created this HTML document called index
dot HTML and I've created a little
folder here called CSS and within that
folder a file called syntax CSS and our
CSS files are given this dot CSS thing
at the end
that's what signifies that it's a CSS
file alright remember you can create new
files and new folders in brackets by
right-clicking this pane here and then
go to new file or new folder so that's
what I've done and before it's that I'm
going to go to view here and then go to
vertical split and that's going to let
me see the HTML on the left and the
syntax dot CSS on the right I just need
to open this up put it to the right and
then we'll put the index to the left and
we've got both files here now so what
I'm going to do is just about three or
four different rules here and the first
what I want to do is kind of select this
header I do this div here and we're
going to style that okay so remember all
IDs are targeted by using the hash
prefix so we've got hash and then the ID
name which is header and then the
declaration starts with the opening
curly braces ends with the closing curly
braces and then we'll do our first
property which is going to be position
absolute and don't pay too much
attention to which properties I'm using
here we're going to cover these later
like I said before then the next one is
top zero so it's going to be right at
the top and left zero so it's flush to
the left okay the next thing we want to
do is telling at this h1 so I'm going to
say header because it's within the
header
I D div and then h1 so that's how gets
the h1 within the header and I'm going
to give this a font size of 32 pixels
okay make it nice and big and the final
thing I want to do is target all the P
tags now there's two in this document
there's one here within the header and
there's one outside of the header within
the body tag now if I was to do this
again header P then this would only
target this Pizza here I don't want to
do that I want to target this P tag as
well on all the P tags so I'm going to
take off this header here and when it's
just P prefix with nothing it's same to
the CSS file going to HTML and find
every P tag in that document and more
style every Peter and we're going to
give this font size of 12 pixels okay so
that's about it for this video I hope
you've got a better understanding of how
CSS rules are now formed selector on the
Left declaration on the right if you
have any questions whatsoever don't
