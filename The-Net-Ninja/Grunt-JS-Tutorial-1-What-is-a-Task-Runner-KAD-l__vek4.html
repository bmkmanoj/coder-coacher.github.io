your very first grundeis tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
what a tas run is and how it can help
your development workflow okay then so
before we start talking about grunt j/s
there's a couple of things I want to
point out that you probably should be
familiar with before you start the first
one is no js' and the node package
manager and that's because we're going
to install grunt using the node package
manager now if you don't know how to do
that or how to install nodejs then i'm
gonna leave a link to my node.js for
beginners playlist down below check that
out I'll walk you through the steps of
installing it on your computer right
there secondly you're going to need to
know a bit of JavaScript because we're
going to create a file in this tutorial
series which is going to control all of
our tasks and that is going to be
written in JavaScript so if you want to
brush up your skills I've got any
JavaScript for beginners tutorial series
on this channel as well I'll leave the
link to that down below also all right
there so what does a task runner do well
it performs a repetitive task force
among other things and some of those
tasks could be something like prefixing
CSS rules so when we write in CSS and we
have a particular rule which does
something like I don't know box size in
which may need vendor prefixes because
it's not fully supported in all browsers
then we do something like X - mods -
box-sizing then - WebKit - box sizes etc
we don't want to do all that we want
something to take care of it for us and
grunt can do that so it saves us a lot
of time it can also compile sass files
into CSS for us and if you write in to
us you know that browsers can't
understand sass files we need to compile
it into CSS first and yeah we could
download another tool to do that for us
but if we're using grunt anyway why not
just use them
it can also minify javascript and CSS
files for us so I've got here a jQuery
script this is the jQuery library and
it's not compressed on modified in any
way shape or form and if you see right
there it's 11 thousand lines long and
whatever size so
yeah we could upload this to my server
and we could serve this when a user
requests it
or we could compress it into something
that looks like this and that is going
to reduce the file size by squashing
everything up changing the name of your
variables and functions into smaller
variable functions and it's just going
to load quicker when you request it from
a server so grunt jeaious can take care
of that kind of thing for us and CSS
files as well and it can also
concatenate files for us so I've been at
websites where there's been I don't know
50-plus requests for different
JavaScript libraries or files CSS files
and that is hitting the server 50 times
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo and it's going to
take a while to complete all of those
requests and get them back to your
browser now ideally what we want to do
is concatenate all those JavaScript
files into one or two files can catenate
all those CSS files into one or two
files and then just load up those files
in the website so we're just making
maybe four or five requests rather than
50 plus so that's going to speed up your
website as well and grunt J's can take
care of that as well so it keeps in
group J's but there's also other tasks
run as one of them is gulp which is kind
of like the new kid on the block not
something you anymore but a lot of
startups are using gold but grunt is
still a heavy game player and there's a
lot of support for it and it is really
cool so you'll notice right here as well
I've got some other folders I've got a
CSS folder and I've got a JavaScript
folder these are just some files that
we're going to use in this playlist
because we're going to be going each
through each of these kind of tasks here
showing you how to use grunt we're going
to be demonstrating that on these files
now I've uploaded them for you on my
github page so I'm just going to show
you that now okay so here we are this is
the repository I've created for this
playlist it's called a grunt playlist
I'm gonna leave the link to this down
below so if you want to download those
files and work along with me you can
just go ahead and click this button
clone or download you can either open it
in your desktop or download the zip file
with all of those files in it and then
we can kind of work together in this
grunt project also if you do want to
download nodejs and you don't want to
check out my tutorial on it
then just go to no js' org and click
this button right here or this one this
is the latest version but this is the
one with a long-term support so
recommended for most users and it's
certainly going to be enough for this
tutorial series so yeah go ahead and
download that just click the bottom run
through the steps and that's gonna
install node and the node package
manager on your computer so there we go
there's your kind of whirlwind intro of
grunt Jas and what attached runner can
do for us in the next tutorial we're
going to install it and we're gonna
start to take a look in more detail as
to what it can do for us so any
questions so far leave them down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the bonus
