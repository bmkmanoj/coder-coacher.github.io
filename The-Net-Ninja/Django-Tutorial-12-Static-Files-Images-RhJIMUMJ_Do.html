your twelfth django tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at how
we can work with static files in django
okay so first of all what do I mean by
static files
well static files are things like images
CSS files or JavaScript files that we
can serve up to the client the browser
now in Django it's not as simple as
saying OK in this hasty ml template I
want to create an image so here's the
image tag and this is the path to the
image which is stored in some kind of
folder over here that's not going to
work we have to explicitly set static
images up inside our project and in our
case we're going to tell Django to serve
up our images now when we are creating a
website for production we typically
wouldn't let Django serve up our images
because at best its grossly inefficient
would use another service like AWS or
something but for the sake of this
series and because we're in debug mode
I'm gonna let Django take care of
serving got our static files and in the
future maybe create a whole mini
playlist on working with a Django
website for production and hooking it up
with a service like AWS to serve our
static files but for now the first thing
we need to do is jump over into URLs dot
py and this is where we're going to tell
Django that it can serve up our static
files forbs and the way we're going to
do that is by first of all importing
something so we'll say from Django doc
contrib dots static files dot URLs
import static files underscore URL
patterns so this thing right here is
gonna let us append to the URL pattern
so that Django can handle the serving
goal of static files and the way we do
that is by saying URL patterns which is
this thing right here then we're going
to say plus equals so add to that static
files underscore URL patterns and this
is a function which we have to call and
this thing will check first of all to
see if we're in debug mode which we are
and if we are then it will append to
this thing right here so that it knows
how to serve up Alice
attic files so that's the first step
taking care of the second thing we need
to do is jump into the settings file and
zoom our right to the bottom and you
should see this thing already here
static underscore URL is equal to
forward slash static forward slash and
this is telling us look this is the
address that you have to go to to find
your static files
so for example if I wanted to find a
Styles dot CSS file I would go to my
website forward slash static forward
slash style.css and I can change this if
I wanted to - for example assets then
instead I would go to my website forward
slash assets forward slash style.css so
this right here is the URL that we will
go to to find our static files we're
going to keep it at static for now now
we do need to add something else on here
because at the minute Jango doesn't
necessarily know where to find our
static files where will we store them
over here so the way we tell jungle that
is by creating a new property and that
property is going to be called static
files underscore ders
so all in capital all static files
underscore ders for directories and
that's equal to a couple and inside this
we need to say OS path join and then
we're going to use this to join two
parts of a path together so the first
part of the path is going to be based
underscore dirt and this stands for base
directory which is built in to jungle
and we can use this and it grabs the
base directory which is this jungle
notic folder of our project so it's
going to grab that then the second part
of the string will be a folder inside
this base directory where we'll store
our static files now I'm going to call
this assets but you can call it whatever
you want so this right here is saying
okay where the static files is going to
be found in the base directory then look
in the assets folder so if we save this
now and create an assets folder over
here then we can store all of our static
files inside here so for example if I
say styles
ss that I can now serve this up to the
browser so for example body and then the
background will be for now let's just do
blue save it if I now go to forward
slash static forward slash styles then
Django is going to know how to serve up
this file and I get the CSS file back in
the browser cool right so now we have
this Styles dot CSS static file but how
do we connect it to our template right
here the articles template well I guess
what we could do is say well link rel is
equal to stylesheet and then the href is
going to be forward slash static forward
slash styles dot CSS and this will
absolutely work and I can demonstrate
that by going back over here and
refreshing then we get the background of
blue but I don't think that this is the
best way to do it by hard coding the
static file URL and the reason why is as
follows if at some point we want to
change this thing down here its assets
what are something else or to a longer
path for whatever reason then we will
have to go into every template where
we've used an asset of any kind and
change the URL to update this now that
would be a bollock and we don't want to
do that so a better method to using
static files inside your templates is to
use something that comes baked with
Django and we can load that right here
by using our templates tags and that is
called the static module so we'll say
load static from static files so right
here we're saying we're loading this
static thing which we can use now inside
this template to form our static URLs so
that if we do ever change that URL in
the settings then this thing right here
will work it out for is we don't need to
go around every template and start to
reach ange all of the H ref attributes
all the source attribute it's all taking
care for us so in here instead of
hard-coding now what we do is output our
template tags
and inside we said we want to use a
static URL then in single quotes so that
we don't escape the double quotes of the
href attribute we want to say which
static file we'd like to load here now I
want to load in Styles dot CSS so if I
save this now that hopefully fingers
crossed this should still work and it
does we still get that CSS file but this
is a much better way of loading in those
static files than to hard-code the URL
right here ok then so let's add to this
CSS file why not so let's close articles
and open up this dude and instead of you
watching me cold all of this CSS I'm
just going to copy and paste from my
github repository and you can find the
styles.css file as well on that repo if
you want to use it so some dead simple
rules we have the body just declaring
the background and it's actually using a
static file right here and we'll go
through this in a minute then every
element within the body will have this
font family we're starting the headers
and also the links right here as well so
some really basic styles to begin with
but if I save this and refresh over here
then we get this kind of display in the
browser now right now we don't have this
stars dot PNG file inside the assets
folder so it's not given us that
background image but I do have this in a
folder over here and again this is on
the github repository for this course as
well so you can find that up there so I
can save this now and refresh now we
should get those stars in the background
we can just about see those however
right here again we're hard coding to
begin with static and again what if that
URL structure changes in the future
well a better way to do this would be to
just use a relative path so we can just
say Stars dot PNG because that's in the
same directory as the Styles
okay so let's save that and this should
hopefully still work yep it does ok so
there we go my friends that is how we
can use static files in Django and we
will be using them more as we go through
