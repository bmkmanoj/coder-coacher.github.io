very first CSS flexbox tutorial ah ok
gang so before I start waxing lyrical
about CSS flexbox I just want to talk
about how we would currently layout a
page using CSS before flexbox in a
browser so we typically use different
positional properties right such as
position absolute or relative to get
elements exactly where we want them on a
page or just to tweak them a little bit
we also use things like floats for
creating a grid layouts or navigation
systems but then we'd be kind of
confronted with that problem of
collapsing elements and we have to come
up with clear fixes that kind of jazz
and we'd also probably use things like
fixed heights for columns that we want
to be equal in height now a lot of the
times when we wrote CSS for this it
seemed like a lot of work for what it
achieves on the page and also it's
sometimes felt a little bit hack in the
way we're doing it so this is where CSS
flexbox comes in and just blows all of
that out of the water so flex box is
just a new CSS display type which is
designed to help us craft those CSS
layouts much much easier so basically it
lets us control the position of elements
the size of them and the spacing of them
relative to their parent container
elements and each other and it also
works great responsively too so here's a
kind of quick and I mean really quick
overview of how flexbox
works so first of all what we do is take
a container like this this would be an
element and then we'd apply
a display type of flex to that parent
element then those children elements
directly within that parent would all
become Flex items and essentially
they've become more flexible and that
means we can control how they shrink and
how they grow within it as well as the
spacing between them so that's kind of
how it works on a broad level and don't
worry we're going to dive right into how
our nitty gritty stuff works as well so
some of the benefits of using flexbox
are that we can create navigation bars
and menus really easily without having
to use floats or worrying about
polluting elements that we can also
create
read layouts really easily as well
things like bar charts and also equal
height columns plus all the stuff as
well now before I go any further it
would be wrong of me not to mention that
flexbox is not fully supported out of
the box in every single browser and
you're going to find that a lot of the
problems are in IE like this right here
and it tells you all these problems down
here so if you're going to use flexbox
then you want to provide for back
options for those browsers which don't
support it now one way we can do that is
by using
moderniser now moderniser is a really
cool javascript library and basically it
just detects which browser the user is
viewing your website on so say you're
using flexbox in your website now if a
user visits that on an IE browser which
doesn't support flexbox then moderniser
is going to say hey and no you don't
support this so add a class into the
body tag on your web page then we can
use that class to create specific styles
in our CSS for just that browser so I
just thought I'd warn you about that I'm
not going to be using moderniser in this
tutorial series I'm going to be using
Chrome which works pretty well with
flexbox as is I just wanted to kind of
include this in case you're using
Internet Explorer or some other browser
which does not fully support it okay so
next I just want to show you this github
repository I've got this is for this
playlist so if you want to go to this
link I'll provide it and I'll put it
down below and click download zip'
that's going to download all these
different files that I've created for
this playlist and in there we've got a
few different examples as well as some
base styles and an index file we're
going to do a lot of the lessons so I'm
also using a text editor called brackets
and you can get that from brackets type
dot IO if you're interested just click
this download button here it's free and
it comes with a nice UI and some pretty
cool features too okay so if you've
downloaded those files from github then
you want to open them up in your
favorite text editor like I said I'm
using brackets and the first thing is
this index.html file right here this is
just the base HTML file where I'm going
to do most of the lessons and it's also
linked up to a style sheet right here
and those Styles are just really basic
just as the
rapper right here and the body and the
rapper just essentially keeps everything
within a central column on our page I've
also done three examples and we're going
to work through these examples in this
playlist so that's just the menu and the
nested menus and also a grid versus
stack layout so we're going to do those
examples as we move on as well and each
of these files just create a just
includes the based HTML as well as some
styles that we're going to work in as
well so there we go guys so that's your
introduction to flexbox don't forget to
share subscribe and like and I'll see
you in your very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
