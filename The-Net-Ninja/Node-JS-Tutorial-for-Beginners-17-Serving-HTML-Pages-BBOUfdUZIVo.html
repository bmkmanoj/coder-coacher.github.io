17th nodejs tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can serve
HTML pages to the clients
okay then Doge so in the last tutorial
we used this server we created to send
some data to the client the browser and
that data was a readme text file and we
sent it via creating this read stream
and then typing that to the response so
that was sent to the browser and we saw
all that alarm if some in the browser
now in a real world application you're
probably not going to want to send a lot
of lorem ipsum for the viewer to see and
you'll probably want to send maybe a
HTML page so in this tutorial we're
going to have a look at how we can do
that so first things first let's go
ahead and create a HTML page I'm going
to go to a new file and I'm going to
call this index dot HTML and this is
just sitting in the roots of the nodejs
playlist directory okay so let's just
quickly write this up so doctype HTML
and then paste him out we'll do a head
tag and then we'll do a body tag and in
this body I just want to keep it simple
I'm going to do a h1 and I'm going to
say welcome to the most awesome websites
on the net because quite simply that's
what it's going to be and then a P tag
I'll say you won't find a website better
anywhere else I speak only the truth all
right so what I'm going to do is just
add a few styles to this document and
normally I'd do this in an external
stylesheet but we're going to cover that
later on because we do need to do all
the things for that to work and in this
style tag I'm going to say first of all
body and then the background is going to
be sky blue and font family the dollar
color:white these are just some really
simple styles I'm not doing anything
special here I'll say padding through
area 30 pixels and then the next one
each one will say font size is going to
be oops and we want that to be a style
tag not styles I was wondering why it
wasn't picking up the chorong okay so
the font size that this is going to be
48 pixels and then the text transform is
going to be uppercase and the letter
space it will stay around two pixels and
text a line the center I am almost done
now guys just one more rule for the P
tag and that is going to be a font size
of around 16 pixels text-align:center
alright cool so let's save that now so
we've done our index file and this is
what we want to serve up to the user on
the browser so how can we send that well
it's pretty similar first of all let's
change this content type this mime type
right here to text font slash HTML
because then the browser knows what to
do with HTML if it gets it if we just
keep this as text plain then it's just
going to treat this as a text file and
output all of this code to the browser
as it is here but if we put text forward
slash HTML it's going to treat this as a
HTML file and render it in the browser
properly okay so the next thing we want
to do is change this file to index dot
HTML okay and now we're done so we can
now go ahead and run this by saying note
up and right there it says we're
listening to port 3000 so let's go ahead
and navigate to it and now we see this
index dot HTML site and I think you'll
agree this is the most awesome website
on the net so what we've done this time
is instead of sending in plain text to
the browser we've gone ahead and created
a hedge tml file and we've sent that to
the browser instead we've specified that
it's
HTML here and we've supplied the path to
the file and we've sent it to the
browser so that is how we serve up HTML
to a claim so if you've got any
questions feel free to ask those that
down below otherwise guys I'm going to
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
