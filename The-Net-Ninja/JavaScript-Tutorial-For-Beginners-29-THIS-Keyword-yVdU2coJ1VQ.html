watching JavaScript for beginners lesson
29 and in this video we're going to take
a look at the this keyword Wow
alright then going so in the last lesson
you saw me do something like this I
created an object called my car - and it
gave it some properties and a function
or a method right here and then we
called one of those properties and the
method down below right now I'm going to
take this one step further and introduce
that this keyword to you because it's
quite important as we go further down
the line in creating objects right and
we're going to delve into that a little
bit deeper later on for now I just want
to introduce it so what is the this
keyword well it's quite a complex
abstract idea but essentially the this
keyword refers to whatever object
currently owns that space that you use
that this keyword in right so if I just
say console dot log
oops this at the root of my document
right that I'm not in any kind of object
or function or anything here I'm just at
the root of my document I'm going to
console dot log this to see what it is
right and if i refresh it logs the
window object right so right here in the
root of my document the window owns the
this keyword and evaluates to console
dot log these anywhere on the top level
or in some kind of anonymous function or
something like that
this would refer to the window object
however right I'm going to call that
come back up here and create a new
method called test here and this is
going to be a function where we're going
to log to this keyword like that save
that and then I'm going to call it right
here my car - dot test all right so now
let's refresh over here and this time it
logs the object my car - because these
are all the properties right and the
method right here and here of the my car
- object so that's what this right here
is referring to and that's because in
this context within this object this is
owned by
this object right likewise if we had
another one let's call this my car
three console dot log this and then
we'll say my car to not test and my car
three dot test right so it's going to
log it out twice save and refresh this
time we get two different objects yet
the properties are the same but if we
change this one to Shawn and save again
refresh now we can see that it's login
both objects so right here this refers
to this object because my car three ohms
this context and up here this refers to
my car - because my car - owns this
context and you might think well instead
of seeing this why can't I just write
out my car - and yeah you could do if
you wanted to but then if you were to do
this copy and paste it down here change
this to three you don't have to go in
and change every everywhere you've
referred to my car - to my car three and
it might not be once it might be ten
times and each time you create a new
object like that you're going to have to
do that so it's a great time-saver and
it's also grateful when you're creating
constructor functions all right and
we're going to get into that in the next
lesson I'm not going to talk about it
now I just wanted to introduce this
keyword right now okay so this could be
used for a method instead of test
because we wouldn't have a test method
normally let's create something a bit
more exciting let's say log driver yeah
and this is gonna be a function where
we're going to log the driver name so
we'll say console but log and then
string drive that name is and we'll
concatenate this driver yeah so remember
in this context this is on by my car -
so this would be the same as same my car
- driver which is the met ninja so this
driver
so we go on save and oh we need to call
it my car to log driver it's recognized
it there in intellisense then we'll call
it using the paranthesis save that
refresh and this time we get it right
here so this is where alright guys so
that is your introduction to the this
keyword
it's quite an abstract concept but we're
going to be using it again in the next
lesson where we're going to take a look
at the constructor function so
constructor methods within objects you
have any questions about this so far
feel free to comment down below I'll
answer all of those questions otherwise
