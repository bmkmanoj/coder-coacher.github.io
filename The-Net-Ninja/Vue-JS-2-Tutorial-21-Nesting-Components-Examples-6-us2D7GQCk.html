of UJS tutorial and in this video I want
to give me some more examples of how I
can nest components okay so in the last
tutorial I showed you how we could nest
a component in the root component so in
this tutorial I want to take it one step
further and just create a few extra
components and nest of all okay so
essentially what we're going to do is
create a simple webpage with some
different components controlling the
different sections of that webpage so
we're going to have our root component
sitting at the top as always then
underneath three components one for the
header with a title in it one for the
footer with a copyright notice in and
then one for the main content called the
minja component which is going to be a
list of ninjas and their special
abilities okay so I've stripped out all
the concept from our previous tutorial
we no longer have that ninja bear view
file right here we just have the app top
view the main root component and it's
pretty empty at the minute so what I
want to do first of all is create our
other three components the header footer
and the ninja component and then we're
going to import them into this root
component and nest them in here in the
template so let's go to this source
folder and create a new components first
of all and we'll create a new folder
just to keep everything kind of
logically store together and this folder
is going to be called components so what
all of our three components are going to
live in here now okay so I'm going to
create a new file and this one is going
to be called Tedder and that's going to
review file extension and in here what I
want to do is create the header
components so first of all I'm just
going to copy this because it's just a
blank and part of basically and paste it
in here so we need to create our
template for the header and I'm going to
keep this really simple so it is
literally going to have a header tag and
then inside that head of typing it's
going to have a h1 and we're going to
dynamically output that h1
using a data property down here called
title so let's create that property
title and then this is called a new
ninja so this is the header component
which is just basically a title now I am
going to give this some styles so I come
down here I'm now going to be sculpt
remember we use sculpt to say I only
want these start to apply to this
component so we want to style up the
header first of all
and this header is going to have a
background of light green and then I'm
also going to give this header a padding
all the way around of around 10 pixels
then I also want to style this h1 right
here as well so we'll say h1 and this is
going to have a color or kind of like a
dark grey which is 2 to 2 it's a hex
code for dark gray and it's going to be
text aligned to the center so it sits in
the middle
okay so we've created our header
component right there so what we'll do
now is import this header component into
the root component right there and then
nest in it so remember we can do that by
coming to the script tag down here and
first of all saying import and then we
want to say what we want to import and
where from now we want to import the
header component over here in the
components folder right so we need to
say import and this white is going to be
called headers we'll say a better and it
can be strong and then we want to say
dot flight slash to say current
directory first of all then lock in a
components folder then you want to get
the antennae dot view file
okay so we're importing that now we need
to list or register this component in
the root component to say yeah we can
use it in this component so remember the
way we do that is by same components and
then this is an object and we can lift
our components here so what we're going
to call this one is app set it and I'll
tell you the reason I'm doing that in a
second and this is going to be the head
so listing right here so when we create
a tag up here it's going to be this in
the tag because this is the name now why
did I not just use header well the
reason is this is already a tag HTML tag
so I can't just do header because that's
already a HTML tag and the UJS won't
like that so I'm going to have to give
it something different and that is the
reason I placed at - in front of it okay
so let's pop a comment at the end of
that object as well so now we've
registered this app had a component here
in the template in the component rather
so we can add it to the template looking
nesting here
so first of all I wanna do practice
around everything within this template
and then we're going to nest that
component so I say app - head up - nest
that right there if we save this now and
view it in a browser then we should see
that header at the top cool okay so
there's one out of three components now
I want to move on to the flutter
component so again I'm going to create
this file in the components folder new
file and we'll call this photo dot view
and inside here we want to paste this
thing again so we'll copy it and paste
it inside the footer one just going to
delete a couple of things like this and
we don't want to import that we just
want an empty component here basically
okay cool
so now we can do our template for the
footer which is just going to be footer
html5 tag and then inside the footer I
want some kind of copy right now so I'll
give a key tag and then we'll output
this dynamically and we'll call this
copyright okay so now we need to define
this property down here on the object so
we'll go down here and say copyright and
this is just going to be a string and it
says copyright 2003 you ninjas okay so
the aligner alright so now we have this
defined we want to just stand up the
faucet a little bit so we'll come down
here and we'll say style is going to be
scoped just to apply the start to this
component and underneath will say footer
and we want this to have a background of
dark gray again we use the hex code of
two two two to do that we also want to
give this a bit of a cut in about six
pixels all the way around I want to
style this P tag as well so we'll say P
and this is also going to have a color
of light green and then we'll text align
this to the center as well okay so now
we've created our footer component as
well let's import that into the app dot
view the route component and place it
below the header so again we need to add
this component we need to register it
here to say that we can Nestle up here
in this route component so we'll call
this one at process for the same reason
we can't your shoes footer the
this is already html5 tag so this is
going to be footer which we're going to
import right now so let's copy this and
paste it down below and this time we'll
say footer and this is going to be
importing from the components folder
photo dot view file okay so now we can
edit the loggia source a tag for
importer to nest that save it and check
this out in the browser and now we have
the footer as well cool so this is all
going perfectly now we just need to get
our main content between the header and
the footer so we want to be placing what
other component or right here okay
so let's create that component then I'm
going to place this in the components
folder again we'll call this a new file
images dots of view and then we'll just
copy one of these things here I'm
pasting because I'm super lazy and get
rid of that stalk get rid of this data
and also this styling okay so this is
going to be the most complex component
but still we're not going to call it
anything we've not learnt so far so
basically I want this component to be
some kind of grid of ninjas and each
engine is going to be like a box in this
grid or a panel in this grid and when
you click on one of the ninjas it's
going to show the special ability of
that ninja right so first thing we want
is some data for these ninjas now I've
already copied this to my clipboard and
you can get it from the github repo the
link is down below lesson 21 you want
and I'm going to paste this data right
here so it's a property called ninjas
and this is an array and this array
holds what about six objects and each
object is a ninja and it has a name
speciality and then this show property
and it's currently set to false for each
one now when this is false the ninja is
not going to show the speciality but
when it is true the means you will show
that speciality it's been a toggle this
show property when we click on that
ninja so when we click it it's going to
set it true when we click again it's
going to turn to false okay so pretty
simple so now what we want to do is
cycle through these ninjas okay on the
template and we want to output them
right we want to show them in the main
content area so first of all
do a gift tag with an antique equals a
ninja's and then within at least give I
want to do a ul tag and then in this UL
tag is where we get output all of these
different ninjas so each ninja is going
to have an li tag right and how do we do
this we can use v4 we've learned that in
a previous tutorial we can use v4 to
cycle through all of these and output
each one so let's create an li tag and
then we'll say v4 to cycle through these
and we're going to say ninja in ninjas
which is this property right here
remember and then we're going to also
attach a click event to this so Leon I'm
going to be a click and then that's
going to set equal to ninja show equals
ninja dutch/shell and I'm going to
explain this in a second so basically
what we're doing is for each ninja we're
out putting this Li tag right and what
attaching a click event to each li tag
that we output and what we're saying is
when we click this particular Li tag
which corresponds to a particular ninja
then I want you to get the show property
of that when we click it which is this
thing and I want you to negate e I want
you to turn it around so it was
currently false turn it to true if it's
currently true send it to false that's
what this thing here does right there
okay so that's going to toggle this show
property right here between true and
false
so we've ended this Li tag now what we
want is a hate student and this is going
to be the ninja name so if you just
output that as normal
so major dots names like so and then we
also want a huge three and this is going
to be this thing right here the
speciality okay so first of all let's
output that same ninja don't special
effect okay now I only want this to show
remember when show is true so we can use
vishal to do that we learnt this in a
previous tutorial so this show we set
that equal to a boolean right and if
this boolean is true then this thing
will show it was false then this thing
will not show so all we're going to do
is set it equal to this property right
here so it can be checked whether it's
false or true so we'll set it equal to a
ninja
Shelton so when we're clicking on this
Li tag now this property right here is
toggling between 12 volts therefore this
will either show or hide depending on
whether this is true or false okay so
there we go that is the kind of template
we need I'm just going to add a little
bit of styling as well now we've got
scoped already attached there and in
fact what I'm going to do is just copy
and paste this from my repo you can get
it all from that same repo so all I'm
doing is giving this ninjas ID right
here width of 100% a max width of 1200
pixels a margin and padding and we're
saying box sizing is board a box so this
whole wickley's taken into account the
padding right there and the border if
there is one while also displaying this
ul are they flex and we're seeing flex
wrap is right so that the Li items are
the list items within it I get a wrap
we're given a list outside doing odd and
no padding we're saying with the Allies
a flex grow of one so they're all going
to grow equally the Flex basis is 300
pixels so when we reach the range of
pixels they're going to wrap because
they can't go any smaller than this Flex
basis takes the line to the center line
30 pixels I've got a border and a margin
okay
so let's save this now and we want to
import this dude into the route
component so let's go back here and we
want to import it right there but first
of all remember we have to import it
down here so let's copy that dude
paste it down below this time we want to
import ninjas from ninjas W okay and we
want to add it to this components
property right here so we'll call this
at ninjas now we could just call this
ninjas without the app but I want to
keep things consistent so we'll call it
a pingas and this is going to be the
ninjas component thing we're just
imported all right here so now we can
add it here in the middle up - ninjas
save that and let's check this out in a
browser and now you can see all of these
panels right here these are other than
just being output when we click one it
shows the speciality of that ninja right
and when we click one again it takes
away the speciality of that ninja it
toggles it pretty cool right so that is
a basic little project we can create
very quickly we didn't leave Jes using
nested components and look I know the
style of this website or webpage is
pretty crappy but guys that is not the
point of this tutorial I just want to
show you how we can nest components the
styling is all up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
