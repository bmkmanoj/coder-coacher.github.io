PSD to WordPress lesson 16 and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
transfer assets from the static build
that we did into our wordpress theme
folder Wow okay so first things first if
you've not been building the static
designed with me so far
in this tutorial series then I've
uploaded all the files that you're going
to need onto github so you can come to
this address here I'll leave the link
down below in the description and all
you need to do is download the zip
folder onto your computer and unzip it
so then you can transfer everything
across to the WordPress theme alright
okay then guys so these are all the
files that we made for the static build
we've got the images the index and the
star dot CSS and we're going to move
these over to the left first thing we
want to do is just drop the images in
right there so we can use them in the
theme now now I want to transfer the
style across but there's already a style
file there and I don't want to overwrite
it because that's some base styles that
come with this blank theme okay so what
I'm gonna do is right click over here
I'm gonna go to new and make a folder
this is optional it's just the way I
like to do things I'm going to call this
static template and then we can store
these two files in here for reference
for when we need them
alright so let's get rid of those now
and if you come over here you can see in
the static template we've got those two
files now just to walk you through this
style dot CSS this is the theme style
okay and like I say it's a lot of base
styles it's also got a bit of a reset
and some stands for specific areas on
the WordPress theme like comments and
things they're going to be useful to us
so we don't want them so we're not going
to delete that I am going to delete a
couple of things I'll change a couple of
things in this default style of CSS and
the first one is going to be the list
styles so these right here I want to
delete the margin and the list style so
I'll get rid of those those as well plus
a bit of margin because that's gonna
conflict with some of the styles in our
CSS so I'll save that the next thing I
want to get rid of or change is the link
Styles so we'll come here and I'm going
to do is change the span of these links
to 333 which is going to kind of match
we designed okay three three three and
three three three which is like a deep
gray cool so now they are the base
styles now I want to transfer these
styles into this one but I don't want to
override them like I say so I'm just
gonna grab all of that copy it come into
here and then come to the bottom of this
file and I'm going to paste them right
at the bottom here now I'm going to do a
little comment just to say additional
the files
nothing Files theme CSS and finish that
comment off the joke and I'll just paste
it on there I just put that comment in
so and know where my Styles begin and
base styles and all right so we've got
our CSS sorted we can delete this one
now if we want because we've transferred
everything now what we'll do is come to
view and I'm going to go to vertical
split I get rid of this style so now
we've got the left and the right paints
to work with now on the right I want to
put this index dot HTML this is the
initial static build we've got so now
whenever we have a file open on the Left
like for example the header which I'll
move to the left now we can just
transfer things across that easily so
this is just the way I like to work and
at the end of it when we've done
everything we can just delete off this
static template folder because we don't
need anymore alright so that was just a
dead quick tutorial just to show you the
way I like to transfer things across and
how I like to work so yeah I see you in
the next tutorial we're gonna start
styling up all rather cold you know this
header by transferring things across so
stay tuned guys and I'll see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
