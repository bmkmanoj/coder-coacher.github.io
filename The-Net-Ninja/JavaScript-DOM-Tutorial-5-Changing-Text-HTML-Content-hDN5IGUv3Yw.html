fifth JavaScript and the Dom tutorial
and in this video I'm finally going to
show you how to edit HTML and insert
text into the Dom alright then so in the
last tutorial if you can remember that
far back I showed you how to use two
different methods to query the Dom query
selector and query select all and we're
using one of those here query select all
to grab all the elements which have a
class of name that are inside an li tag
inside the book list ID so just to have
a look at those if we inspect the
elements we can see this has a class of
name inside the LI inside the book list
and the four of those in total inside
each one of these Li tags right so it's
going to grab all of those spans with a
class of name and store them inside this
variable right here called books so then
now we've queried the dog I want to
start showing you how we can start to
edit the dog and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you two different
properties the text content and how we
can change that and also the inner HTML
and how we can change that so we'll do
the text content first of all so say for
example I want to cycle through these
books and I want to first of all log the
text content of each book to the console
and then maybe we'll change it so first
of all we know we need to turn this into
an array or user for loop I'm going to
use the array method so say array dot
from and we want to turn the books
collection into an array once we've done
that we can usually for each method to
cycle through those and pass in a
function which is going to fire on each
book it's going to take the individual
book as well through each iteration and
we can do something with that book hey
gang gets shown here from the future and
I just wanted to clarify one point
before I move any further and that's
because in the code I just said that we
had to turn our books variable into an
array before we cycle through them now
to grab the books I used a method called
query select all and when we use this
particular method right here that
actually returns to us a node list and
not a hate email collection now we can
use the for each method directly on an
old list without turning it in to an
array okay so we could do something like
books dot for each without turning the
books into
arrey so i just wanted to let you know
that because there will be times where
by i'm turning things like this into an
array before using the for each method
and we don't have to do that now there's
nothing wrong with turning something
into an array it's still going to behave
the same way and like I said I will
still be doing that throughout this
course because I've already recorded the
videos however I just wanted to let you
know that you don't have to do that when
you use this method right here and it
returns a note list however when use
this method gets elements by class name
or by tag name then this returns a haste
email collection and you still do need
to use the array from message to turn it
into an array before we use the for each
method on it okay so when you use this
method you don't need it when you use
this method you do need it so now we're
just going to log it to the console so I
say console that log and then we're
going to log the book dot text content
okay so this property right here text
content is going to grab the text within
this element right here this HTML
element so if we save this now and
refresh over here go into the console we
can see we have each one of these right
here logged to the console this is the
text content inside each one of these
buns right so that's how we retrieve the
text content but say we want to change
the text content what we can do so
instead of logging it to the console
let's say booked up text content is
equal to something else so we'll set it
equal to test and save that and now if
we refresh we can see each one has a
text content of test right so is
overridden the previous content and
replaced it with this now we might not
want to do that that's a bit daft
instead what we could do is append to
the content so instead of replacing it
completely we could append to it by
saying plus equals that's how we append
something to a string remember at the
end of the day this is just a string
with the text content of an element so
we're going to append something to it
instead and I'm going to append space
and then in brackets book title so if I
save that now and go over here we can
see the original content is still there
but we've appended
it some more text content which is a
book title in bracket so I'm just
letting people know in case they didn't
already know that this is in fact the
book title alright cool so that's how we
change or update the text content of a
particular element now how do we update
the HTML well first of all I want to
grab a different element on the page hmm
or grab this one book list and go over
here I'm going to use the query selector
again this time I'm going to create a
constant called book list set that equal
to document dot query selector
I don't need to use query selector all
because there's only one of the element
I wanna grab and it's book list so let's
paste that in there and we're storing
this element now in this variable or
this constant right here so that I can
change the innerhtml of an element by
using the inner HTML property but first
of all let's log it to the console I'm
going to say console that log book list
and then the property name is in ER then
in capitals HTML server let's save this
and only flesh over here and we can see
all of this HTML is a log to the console
so this is all of the HTML that's inside
this bookless right here so the h2 and
everything inside this URL the allies
etc all of that has been logged to the
console right there so now let's change
it say instead of log in it we want to
set it to something else
well our we need to say is book list
inner HTML is equal to something I'm
gonna set it equal to a h2 and inside
this h2 I'll just say books and more
books follows that Haiti off and if I
save this dude now we're going to see
over here the instead of the previous
content inside the book list we get this
hit 2 instead okay so it's replaced all
of that in HTML with our own string this
Haiti right here and we can see that
over here as well
so we might not always want to replace
the whole thing
sometimes like up here we might just
want to append to HTML and we can do
that as well so I'll still replace the
whole thing first of all here but down
below I'm going to append to this now
I'm going to say book list dot in a phd
ml again set that equal or rather plus
equal to something because we're
appending to it this time we're not just
completely replacing it and I'm going to
add on a P tag and inside this P I'll
say this is how you add HTML
all right so close that P tag off and
save it and now we can see that this has
been appended to this hateem up all
right so if we inspect this out
we can see now this P tag has been added
on if not replaced this h2 we've added
it on and in fact if we comment this
line out completely and all we do now is
appending this P tag to the bottom of
the HTML we're not replacing the current
HTML with this h2 save it we can see
that we get all the original HTML and
then we get that P tag right at the
bottom right there and we can see that
if we inspect this is the P tag we've
added it to the inner HTML of this
element right here makes sense cool
so my friends that is how we can change
the text content or the inner HTML or
just retrieve it from Adam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
