19th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about the
transclude and replace properties on our
custom directive Wow ok then guys so in
the last tutorial we made this swanky
directive right here called a random
ninja and that output a random ninja on
the screen every time so to do that we
pass through this object or we return
this object rather with all these
different properties which control this
functionality ok now we called this
directive in the home view right there
by using the random ninja tag and then
the view is controlled by this random
dot HTML file where we output the date
to the title and then this random
thumbnail ok so we did all that in the
previous tutorial if you've not checked
it out already go and see you now first
before this video because we're just
gonna build on it in this video and go
through a couple more properties we can
pass through to this returned object so
the first property I want to talk about
is transclude now if we go into the home
view right there within this tag what
we've done essentially here is make a
new html5 tag right we've defined that
ourselves by using a directive now
within hate email tags we can normally
nest or the HTML it could do something
like this a P tag and then say something
like check out our random ninja
something like that right now if I save
this I'd expect to see that on the
screen over there however I don't ok and
that is because within this code over
here we're saying okay well we want the
template for this directive right here
to be driven by this file random dot
HTML and then in here this is what it's
been output to the screen so essentially
anything within this random ninja tag is
going to get deleted and replaced by
this stuff right here however we can
tell angular that we don't want to
delete this stuff we want to include
this within the tag and the way we do
that is by using the transclude property
on this return object so let's come over
here and we'll just say transclude true
that's all we need to do within this
object and now we're saying look we want
to include this
HTML right here nested in the directive
okay now if I save this now nothing is
gonna happen it's still not gonna show
that and that's because we've not told
angular where within this template we
want to show that nested HTML okay so we
need to tell angular that explicitly and
the way we do that is by using the ng
transclude directive so if I want to
show it just under the title right here
I could say something like div ng
transclude okay and then everything
within this tag right here you can see
it's showing now is going to be within
this div it's gonna place it right there
okay and I can move this I could put it
underneath the image if you wanted to
that doesn't make much sense I'm gonna
put it back up but you get the point
wherever we put this div or whichever
element you want with this directive
right here that is where the data or the
HTML is going to be output alright cool
so the other property I want to show you
is the replace property now currently if
we right click and just inspect the
element and I'm just going to zoom in a
little bit for you guys here okay so now
you can see we have this tag right here
it called random ninja that's how
directive right now that's cool but I
mean it's not exactly standards
compliant now you know you don't have
tags called for random ninja in HTML so
if we want to make this a bit more
standards compliant then what we could
do is use the replace property to say
look okay well we've called the
directive now in the HTML we know it's a
random ninja but now when you output
that to the screen I want to replace
this tag with something a bit more
compliant like a div tag for example all
right so to do that all we need to do is
come into our return and dodge it right
here and say replace and then set that
equal to true awesome now if I do that
and save it what will happen within this
view right here remember we said that we
want it to be controlled by this
template yeah this random not HTML so it
goes to there and then it finds the
outermost element that surrounds all of
this content right here and then it
replaces the
thing right here this tag with the
outermost tag in our template like that
so now the ninja random ninja will
become div and that's just gonna make it
a little bit more kind of standards
compliant when it comes to HTML so if I
inspect now then we should see this now
is a div tag instead of a ninja tag
right and you can still see it's got all
of those attributes ninjas equal ninjas
title equals random ninja it's got all
those attributes that were on this time
right here but it's just said hey I want
to replace the random ninja thing right
there with the div which is the
outermost element right there now if we
wanted to surround it all with something
different like I kind of know a section
tag and you probably wouldn't do this
because it's a tiny little thing it's
not really a section but just for the
demonstration of this tutorial if we
wanted to do something like that and we
wanted to the ninja tag to be replaced
by this then we could do that and if we
look in the source now if we just
inspect this element we can see now it's
a section tag all right so that is the
replace tag and it's really good because
still in your HTML it's kind of semantic
you're saying what everything is there
so it's easier to you or other
developers when they come to edit this
thing know what it is and then in the
HTML when it's published it's going to
be more complained okay it's gonna be a
tag that he's been annulled right so
they're the only two properties I wanted
to talk about in this tutorial remember
transclude and replace so you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
a comment down below otherwise guys
