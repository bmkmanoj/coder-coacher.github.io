models already and set up for action the
book and the author so we can use both
of those two to communicate with our
MongoDB instance on M lab now that
previously in our root queries what we
were doing is resolving data locally
from a race right now
we'll be resolving our data in future
from our database on n lab however
currently there's no data in there
there's no author stored in there no
books so we cannot really resolve any
data yet it needs to be present in the
database first first to do them so I
think this is a perfect opportunity to
introduce mutations in graph QL so what
are mutations well essentially mutations
are what allow us to mutate or change
our data so having data deleting data
editing data these are all mutations now
in graph QL we need to explicitly define
our mutations to say what data can be
changed added deleted etc so let's go
about doing that
now underneath the requiere what I'm
going to do is create now another
constant and this is going to be called
mutations so setting up our mutations
essentially in the same kind of way we
set up our root query up here all right
so let us set this equal to a new graph
QL object type which is right there then
inside we need to pass through an object
and this is going to have a name
property the name it's just going to be
mutation like so and then the next
property is going to be the fields
property now we also have the fields
property up here remember we do exactly
the same thing in our mutation down here
and this is going to kind of let us
store the different kinds of mutations
that we want to make to for example add
and author or delete an author or update
an author so we'll create a field called
add author so when someone uses this add
author mutation then it's going to allow
us to add an author to the database
that's the whole idea here so
this ad author property is going to be
an object and the first property inside
this object is going to be the type much
like everything else and you'll find
with graph QL it's just kind of the same
code over and over and over so once you
know how to do one thing you pretty much
know how to do the rest of the things
that graph QL can do as well so this
time is going to be an author type
because this is what we're trying to add
right here and author so that's the type
defined the next property is going to be
the arcs now when a user makes a
mutation query from the front-end then
we'd expect them to send some kind of
data or arguments right because if they
want to add an author they're going to
need to send along that author name and
the age because they're the two
different things we want to store in our
database for each author right so
they're going to pass these through to
the graph QL server as arguments so the
first argument that we expect is going
to be a named argument and the type of
this argument is going to be a graph QL
string so much like when we had in our
require ease over here when we made a
query for a book we're saying we're
querying a book type and we want the
user to pass an argument which is an ID
so we know which books a query and
that's going to be of type graph QL ID
we're doing the same kind of thing down
here when they're making a mutation
they're going to send back several
arguments the different properties of
that data type and each argument is
going to have a different type so the
type of the name is going to be a string
that we're expecting and also we need an
age and that is going to be a type graph
QL int all right because that's the
number not string so they're the only
two arguments really were expecting from
the user when they try to make this add
author mutation so again much like
everything else we do all the kind of
legwork in the resolve function this is
where we take the arguments that they've
sent along with the query we'll say okay
we'll take them and we'll make a new
instance of an author and store it in
the database right so this is where we
do that so again we're taking the parent
on the arcs and we're going to use those
args in a minute
inside here what we're going to do to
begin with is just create a new kind of
local variable so I use Lett and then
it's going to be called author and I'll
set this equal to a new author now this
author right here this is our model we
imported that right at the top of the
file over here Const author equals
require this thing so we're using this
author now to create a new instance of
that datatype just locally to begin with
this is how Mongoose works right so this
author is gonna have some different
properties inside it it needs a name
which is going to be arks name so that's
the thing that the user sent along with
this kind of mutation query they sent
along the name of the author they want
to add so when we create a new author
locally using Mongoose we're saying okay
well set the name property equal to Alex
name that the user sent along also the
age is gonna be equal to args dot H all
right so now what we've done is created
this local little variable called author
and set it to a new local instance of
this author data type so now what we
need to do is take this instance of the
author data type and save it to our
database and we can do that really
really easily by just saying author
don't save this again is the power of
Mongoose connects into our database when
we create a new instance of a data type
we have access to different properties
on that data type one of them is the
save method so we can just say well okay
we've got this instance now we want to
save it to the database a mongoose knows
how to save it to our particular
collection and database because we've
already defined the model collection in
here when we said this is the model name
so this is going to be the collection
name it's gonna PluralEyes that and
store it in a collection called authors
and it knows the database because we're
connected to the database right here so
it's going to do all of the work for us
behind the scenes that's all we need to
do to save it to the database
awesome right ok then so now we have
this mutation defined right here but we
need to do one more thing down here
where we export the graphic you
schemer we're seeing that the root query
is this thing right here this query we
also need to pass through a property
called mutation and this is going to be
mutation which is what we just created
right here so right here when we're
exporting our graph to our schema were
saying that a user can query using these
require ease right here and it can
perform mutations using this mutation
thing right here okay so now from the
front end
I mean crush your fingers and hope this
works we hopefully should be able to
make a mutation so let's give this a
whirl going to pop over to a graphical
right now and try to make a mutation now
normally when we make a query we do it
in curly braces like this we're saying
okay we want to query a book or you know
an author etc when we're making a
mutation we need to place mutation in
front of this because no longer is this
just a simple query we're making a
change we're mutating data we need to
tell graph QL that we're making a
mutation so what mutation are we making
well in the code we define this mutation
as add author so that's how we make the
mutation from the front end so we'll say
add author and they remember it expects
some arguments the first argument is the
name and that's of type string so let's
place that in double quotes and I'm
going to call this I don't know Shawn
for the hell of it all right the age
will pass through as well we'll just say
30 and then inside we want to say okay
well when we've created this author when
we've handled this mutation what data
about it do you want to receive back
well I'll take the name and age back as
well so let's give this a whirl or save
it and not save it rather let's play it
and see what comes back okay we get that
author is null so why is that well if we
take a look at M lab at the minute we
can see and you might need to refresh
your page by the way we can see this
author's collection has now been made so
in the code when we've saved this author
is saved it to a new authors collection
and if we take a look inside there we
should see that record name Shawn age 30
so it's been stored and it's given it
this ID as well randomly generated
so that's all working so why are we not
receiving the data back well the reason
is if we go to this resolve function
where we're actually saving the data
we're not returning anything now
fortunately when we use this method or
not save what Mongoose does is return
that give us that object back okay that
we saved so all we need to do is return
the results of this method right here
and that will work for us ok so if we
save this and give this a world one more
time I'm just gonna create a new author
right here and I'm gonna call it Steven
age 38 and let's press play this time
we're going to save that also then we
get these things back as well okay
so the author we just saved we get back
and we can do something with that in our
code on the front end if we wish all
right so there we go that's how we make
a mutation and all that it's just a
refresh over here to see if we have that
different record yet now we have Steven
as well so yeah that is mutations in a
nutshell so far we've just created one
to add an author so in the next tutorial
what we'll do is create another mutation
called add book or something like that
to add a book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
