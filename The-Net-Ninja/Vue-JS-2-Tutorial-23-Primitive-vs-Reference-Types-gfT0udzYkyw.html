twenty third of you JLS tutorial and in
this video I want to talk about the
difference between primitive and
reference types
okay so although it's not a part of UJS
I do want to talk about primitive and
reference types because they are going
to affect how you work with props in
vue.js
and if you don't know the difference
between those two types then you're
going to think that vue.js is exhibiting
some kind of weird behavior when it
comes to using props so what do I mean
by primitive and reference types well
first of all primitive types are strings
boolean's and numbers reference types
are object and arrays now if we were to
pass through a reference type as a prop
to another component much like we're
doing here we're passing this ninjas
property which is an array which is a
reference type it was a platter
reference tab like this to another
component as a prop then what we're
doing is actually just passing a
reference to that original data we're
not passing through a new set of data
here which is storing this component
we're just passing through a reference
to that data therefore if we were to
edit that data in here once we've passed
it through that is going to edit
indirectly this original data not just
the data locally in this component is
going to edit it up here where it was
originally created and stored once in
memory okay so how is that going to
affect things well if you think about it
this data might be passed through to
several different components and if we
were to edit this data in one of those
components then it's going to update
this data where it's originally created
therefore it's going to update in those
other components because we're just
passing references to this original data
through to them as props right so it's
not the same if we work with primitive
types if we were to pass through a
primitive type such as extremely as a
prop to this component then if we edit
it in here then it's only going to edit
that local version of that prop that
variable in this component it's not
going to be passed through a reference
to the original one it's going to create
a new one in here and just edit that one
so if we were to define a string key
pass it through as a prop into several
different components setting one of
those components edit that string it's
only going to update the string in that
one component that we update it in and
it's not going to affect this original
data here okay so I'm going to show you
a couple of examples now of how they
behave differently so say for example we
want to edit the reference type the
array which we pass through here of
ninja's we want to delete a ninja and
see how that affects everything else
well let's create a button to do that
and I'm going to add a click event so
beyond click this is going to equal a
function called delete ninja and then
inside we'll have text saying delete
ninja okay so now we need to hook this
up to this event right here of this
function rod so let's copy it and come
down here and create a method
so methods and this is an object and
inside we need this method which is a
function and inside this function we
just want to delete one from the ninjas
right here and now when a prop is passed
towards I said that we have access to it
much like we do when we define data here
so we can just say this ninjas access it
then we can say dot pop to pop one of
those elements out of the array from the
array so it's going to delete one
essentially so if I save that now check
this out in the browser just going to
refresh and if we click delete ninja
you're going to see one of those ninjas
go and again goes again goes against etc
with your leting get ninjas so like I
said what we're doing here is just
deleting ninjas from the original data
source right here okay because it's just
a reference type so what then if we had
two of these components and we're
passing through that data to both of
those components well let's just add
another one in and a hey char and
between them so we can separate them and
save this review this in a browser so
now we have to lots of this right and if
we could lead to ninja in one of them
then if deleting a ninja in the other at
same growth in a delete a ninja here if
deleting a ninja in the other one thing
and that's because we're deleting the
original source of the data because it's
a reference type
and the original source of the data is
then being passed to both of these
instances of the component so it's
updating them in both so that is how
reference types work okay so let's get
rid of this now and instead I want to
show you how we work with primitive
types because this behavior is not the
same for primitive types it's the
opposite so say for example now in our
header we have this title right say now
we want to define this in the rib
component and then we want to pass it
down as a prop to the header right so
let's do that first of all let's define
the title down here so after the ninjas
we want a title and this is a string
which is remember a primitive type and
let's call this view ninjas right so
there's the title now we're going to
pass it down as a prop so we know how to
do that we come up to the component tag
and we say V bind then the prop name
which is title and we set that equal to
the title which we've just defined down
here okay so we're passing that as a
prop now to this component so let's save
it go to the header and receive that
problem so in our object we'll say props
and then we're going to receive the
title as a prop and that is going to be
an object and the type will be off drink
okay so now we're receiving that prop in
here and without putting it in the
header so let's save it just to make
sure it's working and yet we get a view
ninjas now let's do the same for the
footer because we have u ninjas in two
places right so let's pass the same data
defined here is same title through into
the footer so I'm going to copy this and
I'm going to add that as well to the
footer so we're just passing through
this title proper to the footer as well
looks like we do but the header so that
I'm let's open the footer and now
instead of adding this here what I'm
going to do you see copyright and then
also tack on the title but we also need
to receive that prop so again crops this
is an
then we're receiving the title prop and
this title is of type shrink okay so now
we're receiving the same prop in the
footer and without putting it here so if
we save this now if you're in the
browser again we can see we're still
getting that down here and if i refresh
it's still going to be the same we're
getting view ninjas in both the footer
and the header and it can demonstrate
that it's going to vote if I change this
just a view for example then it's
updating in both of these right so when
we were talking about reference types if
I was to update a reference type piece
of data or properties passed to us in a
component here it would also update here
however these are not reference types
these are primitive types so if I update
this prop here it's not going to update
it here it's going to exhibit a
different behavior from the ninjas where
they were reference types so let's try
it out so let's change this back to view
Utley interesting to give with and then
in the header what we'll do is add a
button to change the title or rather
instead we'll just add a click event to
this h1 so that when we click it it
changes the title so we'll say V on
click that's equal to a function called
change title and then let's define this
function down here so after the data
methods and then this is an object and
then this method change title is really
a function which is going to change the
title and we can access the title by
saying this title and setting it equal
to something else right so I'm going to
clean this to view Wizards
so do wizards so now if I click this
it's going to change the title right and
it's only going to update in this one
component few visits it's not updated
down here because these are not
reference types we're not editing the
original data okay we're just editing it
right here
so my friends that is the difference
between primitives and reference types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
