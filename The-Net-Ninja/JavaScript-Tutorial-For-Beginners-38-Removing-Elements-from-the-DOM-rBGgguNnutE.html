JavaScript for beginners a lesson 38 and
in this video we're gonna start removing
elements from the Dom Wow okay then so
in the last video I showed you how to
create new elements and insert them into
the Dom in this video I want to show you
how to remove elements from the Dom when
you no longer need them alright so to do
this it's dead simple just a couple of
steps first step is to grab the element
that we want to remove for example this
a light oak there and grab the parent
element that that tag is within all
right so we'll refer to this if the
parent item and this is the child item
we want to remove so we grab those two
elements and store them in variables
next thing we need to do is use the
remove child method to remove this child
so that's what we're going to do right
now let's first of all grab this parent
item and to do that we'll store it in a
variable called parent and we'll say
document dot get element by ID and we're
gonna grab this idea of maying now
because the UL tag is within that name
now so we'll pass in main now and then
within that will say get elements by tag
name and then specify do we want the UL
because that's this right here and it's
going to return to was an array remember
because it's get elements and within
that array there's only going to be one
item because there's only one ul tag
right there so we can just say we want
the zero position of that array straight
away okay and then if we call it that
should hopefully bring back to us that
UL tag and it does cool so we've got the
parent now let's get the child that we
want to remove and we'll call this
variable child I want to remove the
first one right here so to do that I'll
say this equals the parent which is the
UL tag right don't get elements by tag
name and the tag name is Li now there's
three allows right here it's going to
return an array of three items this but
I just want the first one so I'll say
square brackets 0 to get the 0th
position item
that's going to be this Ally tag right
there but let's just call it and
double-check child expand this subject
which if we open the menu is the first
item right there cool so we've got our
parent and we've got our child now we
can call the method and to do it we
first specify the parent we call the
method on the parent and we say dot
remove child and then within the
brackets of that method we specify which
child we want to remove and I'll say
childlike now so right here guys what
we're doing is saying get the parent
which we've already stored remove one of
its children and the child I want you to
remove is this one that's stored in this
variable which is the first Ally attack
all right so I could call that right
there and it's gonna remove this Ally
attack but what I would normally do is
store this result in a variable all
right I'll say removed equals if I
removes equals parent remove child child
and what that's going to do is store the
element that we remove in this variable
all right
so if I click enter it's gonna remove
that but maybe if I ever want to
reinsert that I can do right
I can reinsert it I could say something
like parent dot append child removed
call that and now he's gonna put that
allied back at the bottom ferried off
but I could use the other one insert
before so you put it at the top all
right so that guys is how we remove
elements from the Dom if you have any
questions whatsoever for your free to
