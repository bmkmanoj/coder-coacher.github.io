33rd nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to create a view for our to
do up alright so so far we have created
this app J's file and we've run our
Express up we've also created this to do
controller where we've exported this
function and inside that function we
have these request handlers ok so
there's nothing in these yet but we're
going to fill them up as we go along now
in this tutorial I just want to focus on
this one right here and in here I want
to render a view when we get a get
request for forward slash to do so when
a user visits that URL in a browser so
we know already that we use an EGS for
our template engine we set that there
and when we did that no js' and express
no to look inside the views folder for
any template that we render so let's go
ahead and create that folder so with a
right-click at the top and got a new
folder call this views and then inside
that I'm going to create a new view and
this is going to be called to do
EGS so this is going to be the view for
this URL right here ok so first of all
HTML tags and then we want a head tag
inside that we're going to do a title
first of all and that title is going to
be to do list now underneath that what I
want to do is link up to jQuery because
we're going to use jQuery and later on
when we start using Ajax requests so
I've already copied that to my clipboard
I'm just going to paste it in but what
you want to do is just search Google for
the jQuery see the end and find
whichever version of jQuery you want to
use I'm using this one one point one two
point three dot min okay so then paste
that in there then I want to link up to
this style sheet right here to make it
look a little pretty so I'm going to say
rolling H ref and I'm just going to use
this URL here so it's the forward slash
assets forward slash styles or slash
assets forward slash styles dot CSS and
this is going to work because of this
middleware oops that we set up right
here
Express dot static so whenever we type a
URL like that and make a request then
it's going to fire this middleware and
it's going to look for that file in the
Wyck folder is going to find it forward
slash assets forward slash styles okay
so that's rel equal star sheet and type
is equal to text forward slash CSS
alright cool so that will do for the
head for now now we just want to create
a body tag and insert the body I'm going
to create a div tag with an ID equal to
to do - table and all of us new items
are going to go in this table but also
we need a form and this form is for when
a user wants to add a new item to the
to-do list so we're going to need an
input where they can type what they want
to add to the list and then a button
which they click when they want to add
that item to the list it's all let's do
an import first of all type equal to
text and we'll call this name equals
item because it's just an item on a to
do list and we'll give it a placeholder
text equal to add new item dot and we're
going to make this required ok cool now
we need a button with your user clicks
and we'll say add item and value not
value type sorry equals submit alright
so when a user types into this input
field and clicks add item then it's
going to add that to the list and we're
going to hook all this up later on ok so
what else do we need we we need an
unordered list with list items inside
and each one of these list items is
going to contain an item on the to-do
list now we're going to populate this
dynamically later on when we have data
from a database or something but for now
let's just put some W atoms in so we'll
say item 1 then let's copy this dude
couple of times and call it item 2 and
item 3 ok let's save that that's pretty
much done for our view for now at least
and then we want to render it in this
get handler right here and we know how
to do that we can just use the response
object and say response
and then we just need to view name which
is to do okay cool
so let's save that now and run it by
saying note one up now I've got no more
globally installed which is why I can do
this and if you've not installed this
you can just use NPM install node what
to do so otherwise you can just say node
fjs and that's going to run it as well
all right so now it's running on port
3000 so I'm going to localhost 3000
forward slash to do which is this URL
right here and hopefully I should get
this in the new buck cool so now we see
those three items we got our input field
and our button and this is all looking
okay I think we just have one thing
slightly wrong with the CSS because we
should have an image at the top there so
let's have a look for where that image
is being loaded in and it is here okay
so yeah it's looking for false lash logo
when in fact it needs to be forward
slash assets forward slash logo so I
save that and refresh let's just restart
the server and refresh over here and we
should see no we still not see that logo
and that is because actually we've not
got that h1 inside the view so I'm going
to just pop that all right above the to
do table so I'll say h1 and we'll just
say my to-do list I can actually save
that now reached out server again and a
refresh over here and now we get that
little logo at the top cool okay so this
is our application so far nothing
actually works yet when we click on one
of these nothing happens and nothing
will happen when we add an item but in
the future we are going to hook this up
in the next few tutorials or so so until
then if you have any questions feel free
to leave those down below otherwise I'm
going to see you in the very next
