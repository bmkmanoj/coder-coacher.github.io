for beginners lesson 3 and in this video
we're going to did a simple hello world
program in JavaScript Wow
alright guys so I'm here in the code and
I've created a dead simple HTML file we
just got the doctype the HTML tag simple
head and the body tag which is empty now
generally speaking when we do embedded
scripts we put them right at the bottom
of the body tag now I'm not going to go
into detail about where we position the
scripts in this tutorial that's going to
come later in this tutorial I just want
you to focus on how easy it is to embed
JavaScript into HTML web page ok so the
first thing I'm going to do is just open
up a script tag when we embed JavaScript
in a web page we always have to embed it
within the script tags ok now I'm going
to do that annoying alert function that
you've probably seen countless times if
you're old enough to remember that 90s
the late night is when people start at
first making websites and learning
JavaScript would get a little annoying
pop-up box on every website that you
visited I'm going to show you how to do
that you look you look at people so it's
just simply alert and then we open our
parenthesis and close them and then
within this we pass in the string hello
world and then end it all with a
semicolon that signifies the end of the
statement but again don't pay too much
attention to the syntax here I'm just
showing you in this tutorial exactly how
easy embedding javascript is so I'm
going to save that
then we'll view it in a browser refresh
over here and there we go guys you get
that annoying alert pop-up box coming up
here see in hello world click OK and
thankfully it goes away so that really
is it that's how simple it is to embed
JavaScript into your webpages so I know
a lot of people when they first start
learning JavaScript they already know
HTML they already know CSS and they've
been putting off JavaScript for a long
time because they're thinking well it's
a big step up okay it's totally
different from anything I've learned so
far and
yes it is different but the learning
curve is not that steep and I was the
same when I first started learning
JavaScript all I know knew was HTML and
CSS and I was put off and I thought oh
my god
so daunting there's a lot to learn and
there is a lot to learn but the learning
curve is not that steep and I probably
should guys if we stick with me I'm
going to teach you all the basics and
you're going to find picking it up
easier than you thought so this was just
a little introduction as to how easy it
is to embed JavaScript into your
webpages from the next lesson onwards
we're going to start learning about
where we place JavaScript the syntax of
JavaScript and exactly what we can do
with it so I hope this is kind of
introduced you softly into the whole
world of JavaScript and I'll see you
guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
