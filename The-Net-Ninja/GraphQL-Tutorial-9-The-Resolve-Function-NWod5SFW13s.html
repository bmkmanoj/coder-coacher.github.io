in the last video we created this Rick
query right here and remember we said
the requiring defines how we can jump
into the graph to query data so imagine
something on the front end some kind of
application makes this requiring they
say ok we're making a query for a book
with an ID of 2 and we want these two
fields the name and genre so when that
query gets to our graph QL server it's
going to look at it and say ok this
requiere
is a book query so I'm going to find
that query inside our root query object
type inside the fields and I find it
right here and it looks inside that book
field to know how to deal with this
query and it says ok well I know what
object type I'm dealing with now it's a
book type also it looks at the arts
property and says right well I'm
expecting an ID to come along with this
query do we have one yes we do is right
here it's an ID of 2 so it takes this
idea and it attaches it to this rx
parameter right here so the inside the
resolve function we have access to it so
when we get this query it's going to
fire up this resolve function and in
here is where we're going to write the
code to find that book now this book and
this data could be stored in a no sequel
database or a sequel database it doesn't
really matter where it's stored we're
gonna write some code here to go and
grab it later on we'll be using MongoDB
to store all of our data but for now I
think what I'll do is just create an
array to store some books in inside this
feet file so underneath here let's just
write a comment saying dummy data and
then underneath I'm just gonna paste
this in so don't want you to watch me
doing it it's just a waste of your time
so we have a book serrate right here and
it's just basically some dummy data to
store temporarily like I said later
we'll be using MongoDB but we have three
different book objects inside and each
one of them have a name as Janvrin
and an ID so this is the ID we're going
to use to find the correct book so if a
query comes in for the book ID of two we
to get the book of ID 2 from this array
right here or from a database later on
so now it's our job
inside this resolved function to take
the ID from the args parameter right
here an ID of 2 or whatever ID comes in
and we're going to look at this array to
find the book with that ID now I could
do that with vanilla JavaScript but I'm
going to make life easy for myself and
install a utility module called lodash
so I'll say npm install lodash to do
that and what LO - is gonna allow us to
do is a load of different tricks to find
data or change data inside of this array
plus lots of other things as well it's a
really cool library so I'm going to say
const underscore is equal to require low
- alright then so down here we can use
low - to look at this array and find the
book with whatever ID has been attached
to this args property so underneath this
comment let's just say underscore dot
find then we want to search through the
books array and we need a second
parameter which is going to determine
how we're finding a particular book so
the second parameter is going to be an
ID property which is gonna be args ID
all right so now when this query comes
in we're gonna fire this resolve
function we're gonna use lodash to look
through the books array and we're going
to return or find any book that has an
ID equal to the ID that's been attached
to the odds right here that the user
sends along so in this case it's gonna
look for a book with an ID of two and
it's gonna give us that alright so what
we need to do is return this value which
comes back from this thing right here ok
whatever we're sending back to the user
we're gonna return so now when they make
this request ultimately what's going to
happen is they're gonna get that book
returned to them all right so that is
how we use the resolve function to find
the data
like say later on we'll be using a
proper database rather than just this
array up here but now we've done that
we're kind of created nearly a full
enough schema to work so in the next
tutorial what we'll do is we'll test
this out in graphical that tool that
dummy tool on the front end that we can
use to test different queries so make
sure you delete this before you save
anything and then I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
