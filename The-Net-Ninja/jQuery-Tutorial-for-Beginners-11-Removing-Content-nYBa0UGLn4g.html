watching jQuery for beginners lesson 11
and in this video I want to talk about
how we remove content from the HTML
using jQuery Wow ok gang so if we want
to remove content from our web page then
jQuery it makes it so so simple I just
want to show you a couple of methods in
this tutorial and they are empty and
removed now we're gonna start with this
empty method and what that does is takes
an element for example I don't know this
button element right here and then if we
call the empty method on that button
then it's going to take what's ever
inside that element in this case it's
just that text there and it's going to
remove it so in essence we had just
emptying that tag likewise if we call it
on this section with the idea of point
of sale if we say we want that dots
empty then it's going to take all of
this code with inside it and remove it
it's going to empty that tag all right
so let's do a couple of examples let's
do this button first of all so I'll say
dollar sign then it's a class or dot
button and I'm just going to call my and
pettite method on it now we don't need
to pass anything into these parameters
right here because almost doing is just
emptying out the content of this button
so let's save that and when I do pay
attention to this button right here
press save and accepting it pull the
text has gone like magic all right now
let's do another example let's take this
points of sale section I'm just going to
copy that and do the same thing under
here - because it's an ID and then empty
again and this time I want you to pay
attention to this stuff right here I
click Save and there we go it's vanished
as well all right so the next one I want
to show you is remove and that removes
the element completely so whereas the
empty takes the element and the empties
what's ever inside in the remove method
takes the element and just deletes the
whole thing outside in inside alright so
let's try that with the button
instead of empty I'll say remove and
I'll click Save and now you can see that
orange button has gone completely let's
try something else
let's get this map which is down here
somewhere let's have a lot format there
it is
it's got altered map it's the image with
inside the contact method saw say where
the contact section rather contact then
it's a class also it's just an image and
that's the only image within there so
it's just going to grab this one here
and we're going to remove it from the
document so let's press save and look at
this map over here poof gone it's like
there's a wizard on the website right
alright so they are the two simple
methods that you need to use to remove
content from your website if you have
any questions whatsoever about this guys
