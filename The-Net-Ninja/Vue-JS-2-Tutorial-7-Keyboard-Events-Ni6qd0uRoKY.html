your seventh of UGS tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about keyboard
events okay so in the last couple of
tutorials have been taking a look at
events and specifically we've been
looking at Mouse events so things like
on click on double click on Mouse move
stuff like that now I want to move on to
keyboard events so we have access to
events like key down key press and key
up and I want to take a look at those
events and some keyboard event modifiers
in this tutorial so if we go back to the
code you can see what I've done is I've
got a couple of labels one for name war
for age and then two text input fields
as well so we're going to listen out for
events on these two fields and the
events have what I listen for are the
key or events so when someone types in a
letter into one of these input fields
when they typed out on the keyboard when
the key comes up then that is the event
it's going to listen for that event
right and then do something it's going
to react to it
so let's just add those events on as we
normally would by Singhvi - on colon and
then the event name which is going to be
key up right so that then is going to be
equal to something and probably going to
be equal to some kind of function that
we're going to define on our view
instance and we'll do that in a second
for now let's add it to that one as well
so let's just give these functions that
we want to fire a name I'll call this
one logged name because that's where
we're going to insert our name and here
we'll say log age okay
so now when we do a keep event on this
input field it's going to find this
function on the instance right here the
view instance and fire it likewise with
this input field as well so I'm going to
do two very simple methods in this
method object right here and the first
one is logged name and that's really a
function and all this is going to do is
log a very simple message to the console
to say that we've logged that we've
entered something into this input field
so we'll say console that log
you've entered your name right and then
we'll do something very similar for the
log Age method as well so I copy that
and paste it underneath and call this
one log age and change this to age as
well okay so this should all work when
we type something in here on the key op
event it's going to listen for that fire
one of these two functions right so
let's check it out now in a browser so
we'll need the console open so I'm just
going to inspect the element and go to
console and if I type something in age
then you can see that here you entered
your name and it's going to do that
every time I type something in okay so
if I type any letter in here it's going
to fire that every time I type something
in every time there's a key up event
okay now that's fine but what if we
don't want this to output every single
time what if for example we won't be
user to input the name and then when
they don't they can click enter right
and when they click enter then we fire
this function right so net every time is
a key event just when they click enter
after a key of event so we can do that
by adding on a modifier much like we
added on modifies for the mouse events
we can add them on here as well so
please modify it is going to be called
enter right and I'll do the same one for
this enter I'm going to save that now
you can see nothing in the console at
the minute now what I type in Schad you
can see nothing is being output here to
the console just yet but now typed it if
I click enter now we get it
right now we've entered our name and I
can do the same for this 27 then click
enter you entered your age all right so
now if i refresh this and going here and
press enter we still get you entered
your name because that in itself is a
key event right the enter the enter
button now I want to show you one more
thing we can tack on together we can
chain them together these different
modifiers so say for example I want the
user to hold down alt
to enter right and then only that works
so we can say alt dots enter and then
that is only going to fire this function
after a cube event when we hold alt and
enter so check this out
if now I come in here I'll just refresh
it and I'll say 27 and if I click enter
we get entered your age okay could we
save it no we didn't say me that's why
so come over here now 27 click enter
nothing happens hits bolt and enter now
now we get you entered your age so we
can tack these on together we can chain
them together to give you the desired
effect and there's a few different
modifiers we can use for key events you
can read more about them here you can
see we're here we've got enter where did
I use alt is down here somewhere ok else
is it now but we can use alt as well tab
delete escape space there's a list of
these here you can kind of read more
about them and really easy to understand
and self-explanatory but it gives you a
lot of flexibility in listening for
these events and I suppose a really good
example would be if you have a forum and
you're hitting tab to cycle through the
different form fields then every time
you hit tab you're listening for a key
event or something like that you can
fire some code right so all in all
really cool and very flexible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
