grunt j/s tutorial and in this video I'm
gonna show you how we can install
plugins and also concatenate our files
alright then so in the last tutorial we
went ahead and created this grunt file
KS and in it we said module that exports
equals a function which takes the grunt
object and I said that the grunt file
was kind of split up into three parts
the configuration where we configure our
plugins and we say right here we're
passing options to plugins references to
files etc then we can load our plugins
and this is how we do it which we're
going to do in a second and we also
registered these tasks which are pretty
pointless now so I'm gonna delete those
the only reason that made those was to
show you the kind of way we set them up
if you like so we'll create a better
task in a minute but in this tutorial
we're gonna load our first plug-in so if
we head over to the grunt website you're
gonna see grunt jest con /ik plugins
there is the list of all these plugins
and right here it says there's five
thousand eight hundred entries so that
is in a lot of plugins which will do a
lot of different things for your project
so you might want to sift through these
and find anything that you like you'll
note we saw some of them they've got a
star and it says contribute of it and if
you read up here it says that the ones
with can't rip in they're officially
maintained okay so we're going to use a
contribute oriole and the one I want to
use is called can can't because this is
going to concatenate our files and you
can see right there if we search for it
comes up so I'm just going to click on
that and hopefully it's going to give us
a little bit more information about it
it's come to the NPM website so it's
telling us how to install this we say
npm install grunt - contributing cats
and then we're saving it to the dev
dependencies as well so let's go ahead
and do that
we'll say npm install grunts - constrict
- can cats save and death so this is
just gonna take a second to download and
add it to our package
the file so what's this don't just go
ahead and take a look at this
package.json file to make sure that's
updated which it has there is the plugin
we've just installed okay so now we've
installed it we can go ahead and use it
in this grunt file so we loaded the
plugins right here so let's get rid of
these two comments and we're gonna
specify the plug-in name there so it
knows what's again andis it is grunt -
 rip - gettin capped okay so now we
can set up the configuration for this
task or for this plug-in rather so let's
get rid of this comment and what this
plug-in does is concatenate our files so
you can see in our project files which
are on my github page don't forget the
links down below if you want to download
these you can see down here we've got a
lot of J's files well three and we've
got a couple of CSS files right there as
well so instead of having those in three
separate files and two separate files we
want to concatenate these together into
one file called scripts and maybe one
file called styles or something like
that okay so that's what this plug-in is
going to do but we're gonna have to
configure that plug-in first of all so
we need to say content this is going to
be our first property if you like in
this object right and it's this thing
right here so anything after grunts -
contrib - so this thing right here so
this is the property and it's going to
take an object as a parameter now in
here we're going to pass through another
couple of objects we want to run two
separate tasks if you like we want to do
a concatenation on the JavaScript and a
concatenation on the CSS so we need two
separate jobs to do that if you like so
we're going to do a different object or
property for each task so the first one
is going to be J s and this is going to
be an object as well so inside the J s
object we're going to specify the source
of the files that we want to concatenate
and the destination of the output file
that's going to be connected alright so
on the source SRC and it's going to be
these three things right here so I'm
gonna pass these through
and a rate so I can say jQuery and
what's that - 1.12 point for a yes so
coming up the second one is our slides
jas and by the way I'm doing this
completely wrong it's in the js4 the
first of all /u that and then finally it
is the script is so js4 /script dodge
yes and we want to put these things
around it as well
okay so right there I've specified if
three files that we want to concatenate
but imagine we have ten we don't want to
write them all well so an easy way to do
this is by doing this in my case because
they're all in the same folder I'm just
gonna say yes forward slash star J s and
this basically means now look in the J's
folder and then grab me any file that
means anything doesn't matter what the
name is whose extension is dot J s
alright so now we're grabbing all those
finals cool so that's the source now the
destination is where we want to output
this concatenated file to now what I'm
going to do is stick this in a build
folder which is kind of commonplace to
have like a build folder or a
distribution folder or something like
that for your final files so I'll put it
in the build folder and then I'm gonna
call this script
Jas so currently this doesn't exist
anywhere in our project files but when
we run this task in a minute it will so
I tell you what let's just leave it
there for now we'll add the CSS in in a
minute
and what I'm gonna do is come down here
and I'm going to say grunts you can cut
then when I run this hopefully it's
gonna find this plugin and it's going to
lock in the options the Jas option it's
gonna find the source files and it's
going to output in the destination and
he says don't here right now so if we
now log we can see the build folder up
on the left and inside is the script J's
file which has concatenated all of those
script files into one file pretty cool
yeah
all right so let us now
do the same thing for the CSS so let's
just do a comment and the next property
CSS on this again is gonna be an object
and I'm just going to copy this dude
right here I'm gonna paste it in now
let's change this from jf to CSS star
dot CSS and the output is going to be
Styles dot CSS cool so let's save it I'm
going to delete this build folder so we
can start all over again and this time
when I run a con capped remember the
name of it grunt can cut is going to run
this and this time it should do both
tasks the JavaScript option and the CSS
option and if we look in the build
folder now it created we can see scripts
j s and stiles J's which has
concatenated these two styles or right
here pretty cool right so nice to both
of those at once so what if we only want
to do one at a time
well we can register tasks to do that so
let's go ahead and do it so we'll say
groots
dots register tasks and this is gonna be
contact - Jas
I've made this name open right here it
doesn't have to be concave and Jas it
can be whatever you want just seems
logical to me because I just want to
concatenate the J s and not the CSS so
then we need to specify which job we
want to run in this configuration right
here so if the King cats and then it's
the J s job inside it so we'll say right
there cut a cat : j s okay so now let me
go ahead and delete this build folder
again so we can start again and this
time what I'm going to do is come down
here and I'm gonna say grunt and this
time can cats - j s and then that is
going to look for this task right here
and it's just gonna concatenate the
JavaScript because we've just specified
this option right here so now it's doing
let's say we're looking to build folder
and now we just get the scripts pretty
awesome okay
let's save that don't know why he's
asking me to do it but anyway so down
here what I want to do is and read this
through another task which is just going
to be full of CSS so I'll copy that call
this King cat - CSS this time the CSS
option I'm gonna save it again I'm going
to delete this build folder because I
only want zoom sorry I want to see where
start again and show you that it's so
gonna create a folder from scratch this
time I'm gonna say rot contact - CSS
which is this last task we created now
it's done so now we have the Styles in
there and if I then run grunt and can
catch - Jas oops that have been tagged
in there oh man
so grunt can capped - Jas this time it's
gonna run this task and we should see
the script J's file created as well cool
so we registering tasks here to run just
single tasks okay and we could create a
task so we're both of them but there's
no point because we can just say grouped
can can't - run both of them alright so
that is how we load in a plug-in and
then that is how we register tasks to
run certain parts of the plug-in and by
the way these options right here of the
different plugins are different for each
plug-in is dependent on the plug-in and
it's always a good idea just to have a
look on the plug-in documentation to see
how you use it as always an example
right here at the bottom is showing you
how to use it so that's always a good
idea because these do differ from
plug-in to plug in how you set out in
the config alright so any questions so
far leave those down below otherwise
guys I'm going to see you in the very
next tutorial where we're going to
install another plugin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
