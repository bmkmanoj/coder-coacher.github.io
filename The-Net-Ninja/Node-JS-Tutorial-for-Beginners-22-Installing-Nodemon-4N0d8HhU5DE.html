tutorial and in this video we're going
to go ahead and install a package called
node mom ok then guys so now we know how
to use the node package manager and how
to install packages before we get
started with Express I just want to
install one more package first and show
you what that does and this package is
called node 1 so I've gone to the node
package manager website and I've
searched for node 1 and this has come up
so this is a great little package for
when you're developing and what it does
is basically monitor your application
files so that when it's running in a
browser and we're listening to the
server if we make a change in one of the
application call files like app j/s then
it can monitor that and when we save
that file it restarts the server
automatically for us so we don't have to
go back start canceling out of the
process then start running the app
through node again so we can just
refresh on the browser and we're going
to get that fresh change so this is
really cool you can read more about it
here if you just search for node 1 then
it's going to come up and you can check
out the documentation and the usage of
you like right here it says this is how
we install it and notice this G flag
right here this means that we're going
to install it globally and basically
what that means is that no matter what
application we work with on our computer
we can use node 1 because when we've
been installing packages in the past
we've been doing it locally specific to
an application but this is going to
install it globally meaning that when we
create applications in the future we're
not going to need to install node 1
again it's already globally installed on
our computer so we can use it in any of
our applications on here so let's go
ahead and install it so what I'm going
to do is come over here and say npm
install node mark and then we can put
the hyphen G at the end or before node 1
it doesn't really matter does the same
thing and this is going to go ahead
download all of those files for node 1
and install them globally so we're not
going to see though
files here when it installs its going to
install somewhere else okay so that's
fully installed now and the way this
works is by instead of typing node up to
run our application instead I'm going to
say no daman up j/s and this is going to
do the same thing it's going to run our
application and you're going to see a
couple of messages that it will throw up
in a second you can see so this is the
version to restart at any time enter RS
and it's watching all the files and it's
starting node a PS so now it's listening
to port 3000 so we started the file and
it's running it but it's just telling us
that it's watching the files and if we
make a change then it's going to update
it for us so if we go to localhost right
now I still got these routes up from a
couple of lessons back so we're going to
get the home page so everything is
working and if we go to say contact
that's fine if we go somewhere else
that's not on this application then
we're going to get the 404 error so cool
that's all working but now check this
what if I make a change what if I say I
want this to be contact - us so if I
save this now you'll see right here it
says restarting due to changes and it's
restarting node a pas so we don't need
to cancel out the process here we can
just go over to the browser and then if
we go to contact because we've changed
the URL here we've changed the app yes
and it's updated on the fly and
restarted then we're getting the 404
error now because we've changed it to
contact us so this is a much better way
of working with no TX I think node 1
rather than say node app all the time
because you have to keep on restarting
that manually so this is a cool little
package which is going to help us a lot
when developing any questions for you're
free to leave those down below otherwise
and bliss you in a very next tutorial
where we're going to start looking at
Express I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
