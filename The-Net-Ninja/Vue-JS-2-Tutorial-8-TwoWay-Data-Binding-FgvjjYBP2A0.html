of UGS tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about two-way data-binding
okay so in the last tutorial we've
already looked at key of events on these
import fields now I just want to get rid
of these modified for the sake of this
video because we're going to talk about
two-way data-binding so now imagine that
roundabout here if we had say a span tag
underneath this do you want to output
the name right so we'll output the name
there and also under here we want to
output the AIDS or do another span tag
and we want to output the age now
currently these are not variables or
properties that are stored on our view
instance so this is not going to do much
for us at the minute so let's go to this
view instance and add these in the data
object so name and we'll just keep that
as a blank string for now and also age
we'll keep that as a blank string as
well okay so what we want to happen is
for when a user input something in here
this updates with what the user enters
for the name right so we'll do that now
instead of logging this to the console
what we'll do is we'll get rid of that
and what we'll do is update the name and
the aged properties right so we can say
this name is equal to whatever this is
equal to right here right but instead of
reaching in and grabbing this input
field and returning it here and updating
the name this way this is a little bit
long-winded instead what we can use is
two-way data-binding using the v-model
directive right so forget all this
forget even spoke and Internet what
we're going to do is attach v-model
to this and this so we can get rid of
this event if you like and we can get
rid of this event and instead we can say
v-model is equal to whatever variable or
property we want to attach this value
the value of this import to so we can
say v-model equals name and that's going
to attach it to this main property right
here
and likewise down here we can say
v-model
is equal to age and that's going to
attach this input field to this variable
right here this age one night so the way
to way go to binding works is that when
we enter something into this input field
right here vgs is going to look into
that it's going to pick up on that event
that we've added something into this
field it's going to see that it's
associated with this model this variable
and it's going to update it right here
okay so say we type in s the name then
becomes s and since this is changed here
when we're outputting it to the browser
roundabout there it's also updating in
the browser so it's going to waves is
going back and forth or forth and back
right
hence two-way data-binding so this is
really cool because if we go to the
browser now and titling John you can see
Sean right here is being output right if
we type in age 27 then it's been output
here and every time we edit it it's been
updated in the browser right so not only
is it being updated here but it's also
being called dated back in the browser
once this has been updated as well so
that is two-way data-binding and this
has a lot of useful features for example
imagine we had a blog right and when
you've got to write a new blog you want
to offer the user who's writing it a
preview of what they're doing right so
what you can do is attach the input
fields of that blog to a model using V
model and then you can output them to
the screen so that the user can preview
what their blog is going to look like
pretty cool right and there's many more
uses of this as well we're going to be
using V model and two-way data-binding
in other tutorials as we go forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
