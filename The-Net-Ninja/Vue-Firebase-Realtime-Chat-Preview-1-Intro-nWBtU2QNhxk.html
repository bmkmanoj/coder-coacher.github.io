quite a few people have been asking me
for a little sample of what I've
uploaded to you to me so what I've done
here is just attached about eight or
nine lectures from one of the projects
that we'll be creating and this one is
going to be the real-time chat using
view and firebase so I've uploaded these
89 lessons from this chapter so you can
see what the course is like at a glance
again there will be two other projects
that we build in the course as well and
if you do enjoy these at any point feel
free to sign up the link is always going
to be down below in the description to
sign up for the course as well as the
coupon ninja whitey 18 to get the course
for $9.99 so enjoy and if you like it
feel free to buy all right then gaming
so far we've been using the firestore to
store our data in and then when we've
wanted to retrieve or change that data
we've reached out to it manually to grab
that data what we've not done yet is
explore the real-time capabilities of
the firestore and this is a huge huge
part of it that's really really good but
what does that even mean
real-time capabilities well we can
create an application on the front end
in view and hook that up to a fire store
instance much like we did in the last
chapter in the last project then we can
set up a listener in our front-end view
application which is actively listening
for changes in the database such as a
document being added deleted or changed
and when one of those changes occurs our
app knows about it because we've set up
that listener and it pulls down the
updated data automatically and this
happens without always having to make
any additional requests for data or
reloading the page so we'll be using
this whole idea and technique of
real-time data in this chapter to create
this real-time chat application so let's
just have a quick demo I've got two
windows open here two different browsers
both at the same address up here so
let's just enter a name for each one
Mario and Luigi and when we add
something in this chat window
over here it's going to update in both
of them so if I say hey dude and then
press ENTER it's going to appear here
and also in a second here so he sees it
as well so Luigi can say something back
yo and Mario will see it as well and
then Mario can say can't see a game of
Mario karts and then Luigi can answer
anytime anyplace so this is real-time
data updates in action we're adding data
to firestore in one window and it's
automatically updating in the other a
second later so this is what we'll be
creating in this chapter so let's just
get the project up and running by
starting a fresh project with the view
CLI so I'll open up my text editor and
then I mean the view - firebase
directory completely empty because I've
deleted all of the old files then we'll
create a new view project by saying view
init webpack which is the template name
and we'll call this project ninja - chat
press enter and it's going to walk us
through the steps of creating this
project okay so the project name is
ninja chats vue.js project that's fine
Earth is fine run time plus compiler
install the view router yes we'll need
that
yes link nope unit test no and
Nightwatch no we will use NPM and that's
going to install our project for us okay
then so that's the project created and
if we open up this folder on the Left we
should see all of those different files
inside so now we have that sorted in the
next video what we'll do is just take a
couple of minutes to talk about how
we're going to tackle
creating this application and discuss
the project structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
