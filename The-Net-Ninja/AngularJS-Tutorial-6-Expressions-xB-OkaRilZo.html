sixth angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're gonna be talking about
expressions whoa I think guys so this is
where we left off in the last tutorial
we attached this model fave me to this
input so that when we wrote something in
here it bound that data to this model
then we output that data here using an
expression so that's what expressions
are all about outputting data to the
browser and expressions are pretty much
like little snippets of JavaScript code
normally placed within curly braces like
this here so a lot of the simple things
we can do in regular JavaScript we can
also do in expressions for example I
could do something like this let's
delete all this and then within curly
braces I'm gonna say five times five and
if I say that what angular will do is
evaluate this expression much like a
JavaScript and output the result right
there okay likewise I could do something
like this foo plus bar and if I had
access to these variables right here
angular would go ahead and concatenate
the two together and output the result
there okay so if we had more complex
data then we could output that data for
example if we had a user model with a
name property we could output that data
using an expression by just saying user
name so it's really simple really cool
okay now right now we've just got some
pretty simple data right here just a
simple string attached to this input
field so what I want to do is use some
more complex data so we can play around
with it using expressions so what I'll
do is go to the body tag and I'm going
to use another directive called ng in it
and the ng in it directive is going to
allow us to initialize some data when
our application loads now to do this
we'd normally use a controller so don't
get in the habit of loading some data
using ng in it I'm only going to be
doing this for this tutorial
just for a simplicity sake and so it's
quicker
okay so let's initialize some data in
here and what I want to do is create an
array and
array is gonna hold some numbers so
we'll call this array numbers I'll set
it equal to an array holding one two
three four okay now what we can do is
output some of this data right here in
the paragraph tag you're using
expressions so let's open up curly
braces and say we want the numbers
variable and they're using a row
notation we can output the first number
in that array which is what right so
let's save that let's see what comes up
over here yep one now if we want to add
that to another position in the array we
could do we could just say numbers zero
plus numbers three and then save that
and see what comes out here this time we
get five because this is zero and this
is three so it's one plus four right so
pretty cool now let's make a different
kind of array well what comes for meats
and we'll set this equal to some strings
so I'm going as single quotations right
here because I've already used double
quotations to open up this attribute so
ever do double quotations again it's
going to kind of escape this one over
here and it's going to mess things up so
I'm going to use the opposite which is
just singled quotations so the first one
is going to be poor and the second one
is going to be 1/2 then we'll say
something like beef okay so now we can
do something like meats one or two and
we'll say outside of the expression do
you like and then save this time it's
gonna say you like him all right then we
can come out the expression we can put a
comment and say and you also like and
we'll do another expression and say
meats to save that and then it comes out
with and you also like beef so this is
really cool we can just easily grab the
data that's accessible to us and output
it to the browser using these
expressions really cool right but we
don't have to just output expressions
here to the browser we can also add them
in attributes and I'm going to show you
a quick example right now all right I'm
going to just set a simple color
variable right
to be equal to I'll say to do miss ring
orange okay now what I want to do is
just type something like hello dudes or
whatever there and then I'm going to
give this a class and I'm going to set
that equal to then I'll use my curly
braces I'll say color alright so now
we're going to get a class of whatever
this string is so the class is going to
be orange so I'm going to save that it's
not going to do much there at the minute
but if I then come into my Styles dot
CSS and right at the top I'm just gonna
make a class called orange
I'm gonna set the color of this to be
orange alright we're going to save it
and then right now you can see that's
updated because we've got the class of
orange added to this P tag and that
class has come from this expression
which is loading in this data right here
so if we changed this to red then
obviously we've not got a class called
red but we need one in here and I could
say red and I'll set that to be a color
of red like that and save it and this
time it outputs as red so these
expressions are really cool really
simple to have some pretty cool
functionality in to our pages and just
for outputting data all right so so far
we've just seen expressions displayed
using these curly braces but sometimes
expressions can be written without them
in conjunction with angular's attribute
directives but what we're going to do is
visit those later down the line so for
now if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys don't forget to subscribe
and all that jazz and I'll see you in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
