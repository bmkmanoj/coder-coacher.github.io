created this create new article form and
I said that in this video what we do is
save that article to the database and we
will do that but I want to talk about
one important point first of all if I go
ahead and start creating articles right
now then store them in the database then
what we're not doing at the minute is
storing which user has created those
articles yeah I'm logged in and I could
be logged in as someone else and create
articles under their username however
we're not taking that username and
storing it with this article so we don't
know who the author is at any point and
that's because in the model over here we
have these five fields the title slug
body date and thumb but we're not
storing the author we're not saving that
information taking who's logged in and
who created this article so that at a
later point in time we can output that
data and associate articles with authors
or users so I'd like to address that
problem first of all so how are we going
to do this well the way we're going to
associate an article with the user is by
using what's known as a foreign key and
a foreign key is a way to associate a
record from one model in our case the
article model with a record from another
model in our case the user model so
we're going to associate an article with
a user makes sense so we're gonna call
this field and author and I'm gonna set
this equal to models dots foreign key
like so now inside here we want to say
that it is a user that we're associating
this with we're associating this model
with the user model now of course to use
this model we have to import it I've
already done that so from Django
contributor author models import user
capital u then we can associate this
user or this user model with this author
field right here
okay so we're saying right now the
author field will be a user now I'm
gonna say also that the default is gonna
be equal to none not node none now there
is always going to be an author but
if we're logged in and we create an
article then I'm gonna take that user
and associate it with the article okay
but I'm just putting this here to plate
safe so now we have that we know that
when we make a change to a model that we
have to migrate those changes now before
I do that I'm going to comment out this
save it and then head over to the admin
section and I've gone to the articles
and I just like to delete all of these
articles because none of them have an
author associated to them so to save
myself any kind of trouble
I'm just deleting them all yes I'm sure
delete all of those articles that's fine
there's none left now what I do is
uncomment this save it and I'm gonna
migrate these changes so open up your
terminal cancel out of the server and
we'll clear it to give us a bit of room
then we'll say python managed py then we
need to make the migration files first
of all so make migrations then when
that's done we'll say python managed dot
py migrate those changes to the database
like so okay so it's applied those
migrations now now if we go to the
front-end
refresh over here and if I try to add a
new add oops I can't do that because I
need to run the server first of all so
python managed dot py run server like so
now I should be able to do it now if I
create a new article now then you can
see down here I can select an author and
it lists the different authors available
to us right automatically because we've
set up this foreign key right here we've
said that the author must be associated
to a user so it's looking inside that
user model finding our current users so
that we can assign a particular article
with an author good right so we can do
this on the back end easily enough but
we also want to do it on the front end
now I don't want to give them a
drop-down list and say okay well I'm
logged in as Mario but I'm going to
choose Yoshi as the author that doesn't
make sense we need this to be automatic
so that if I'm logged in and I create
an article then my user is automatically
associated with this post this article
so how are we going to do that well
pretty simply again first of all let's
go into the views file where this is all
happening so when we get a post request
we're taking the data from the forum and
we want to save it to the database so we
can do that
remember when we want to save something
to the database all we need to do is say
form
dot save now in the past we left it as
this but this time I'm going to add in a
parameter which is saying commit is
equal to false
now remember form dot save returns us
that instance of the article or the user
when we save the user so we can retrieve
that instance and we can store it in a
variable it doesn't have to be named
instance it can be called whatever you
want I'm just calling it instance so I
have now an instance of that article
right here and this commit equals false
means hang on a minute we're gonna save
this in a second but don't commit to
that action just yet I just want you to
give me that instance that we're about
to save then we'll do something with it
then we'll save it so now we have that
instance of the article what I could do
is attach the author that's logged in to
that instance so I could say instance
author because that was the name that we
gave to the field on the model to author
and we'll set that equal to the request
dot user so when we logged in whenever
we make a request and one of these
functions is fired we have access to the
user on that request so I'm grabbing
that user right here and I'm storing it
in this field on the instance of the
article so now we're associating this
article that's being created with the
user that's being logged in make sense
so now we've done that we can go ahead
and actually commit to this save so
we'll just run instance not save so we
return that instance right here yeah we
attach the author to it by saying that's
equal to request dot user then we're
going to save it finally to the database
with the earth attached so
now if we save this what I'd like to do
is just refresh over here now if I do a
title I'll say where is Mario then blah
blah blah super original the slug is
where is Mario as well and we'll choose
a file number to create this now we get
where is Mario over here now if I look
in the backend
if I go to articles yeah I can see where
is Mario and the author is Shawn because
I was logged in as Shawn pretty cool
right
now if I try to log out and create an
article with someone else we need to log
in to do that so let's go to accounts -
login I'll login this time as Mario and
it's test 1 2 3 4 login so now I'm
logged in as Mario if I try to create an
article as Mario then it should store
that in a database so I'm right here
hello and then I'm right here ok
let's choose a file and create this now
we'll check this out in the admin
section I'll probably have to log back
in as Shawn to see that now if we see
I'm right here
the author is now Mario awesome so now
Django is taking the current logged in
user associating it with the record that
we create the article and it's saving
all of that information to the database
how awesome is that very little work but
what we've done now is associated an
author to an article and we've saved
that to the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
