had a look at character sets and I said
that anything within a character set
will match in that position so for
example if we typed in all the letters
of the alphabet inside this character
set for the first position of the
expression then any letter in that first
position will be a match does that make
sense now
I also said that this was pretty
long-winded we don't want to write out
all 26 letters every time we'd like to
match any letter of the alphabet that's
just one winded it's prone to error and
a bit annoyance so instead fortunately
there was an easier way to do this so we
can delete all of these letters and we
can use what's known as a range so if
we'd like to include all of the letters
of the alphabet for this first position
then we can just say A to Z and that is
a range a to Zed or it could be a to H
and that would match all the letters
from a to H okay so you can see a to Zed
still matches all of these because we're
including all the letters of the
alphabet but a to H just matches this
one or a to n matches both of these two
okay so that's how simple range is out
and it doesn't have to be from a by the
way it could be from G to n or L to N
and that would match all the letters
between L and M okay cool now what if we
try to make this into a capital first of
all let's go back to a to Z so we're
matching all letters in this first
position if we try to use a capital now
then these do not match and remember
that's because we don't have the
case-insensitive flag on so there's two
ways to combat this we could either put
that insensitive flag on and now we do
get matches or if we don't want the
whole regular expression to be case
insensitive but we just want this right
here to be case insensitive we can take
that flag off and instead we can do a
tea set in lower case followed by a to
Zed in upper case now that will match
both of them we've included two ranges
here the lower case range and the upper
case range so that is matching both of
those inside this one character set so
we can use either uppercase or lowercase
now they're both
going to work oops like so all right
then
now as well as lettuce we can also do
numbers so let's delete these and we
could do not tonight so that would be
the same as right now not one two three
four five six seven eight nine okay but
instead of writing all of that we can
just do a range zero to nine and if we
delete all these and say zero India and
this makes no sense whatsoever but bear
with me I'm just demonstrating the
ranges here or six India they both match
and again we could do it from five to
nine and now this matches but this one
doesn't because we're not going from
zero anymore we're going from five okay
so let's just take this one step further
imagine we want you to match a phone
number in the UK that's 11 numbers so
zero to nine for each character if you
like and that has to appear 11 times
because we want 11 numbers in the whole
expression so what we'd have to do since
this is just matching one character
right here we'd have to copy that and
paste it another 10 times now I'm not
going to count this out but you know you
get the point if we wanted a phone
number it would look something like that
right so I could do a 1 500 164 7 8 - 3
- you know I'm gonna do this until it
matches there we go now we get a match
because it's the same number of
characters long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 ok I've done one too many and there's
12 of these character sets right here
okay so now that's a match but again
this is long winded
yeah we've used a range to make this bit
this character set shorter but it's
still long winded and if we want
something repeating over and over like
this there is a much easier way to do
that and we're going to take a look at
that in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
