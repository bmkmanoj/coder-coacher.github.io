very first standing kick tomorrow five
forms a tutorial so although we are
gonna be styling html5 form from scratch
in this series I am going to expect you
to know a little bit of CSS and HTML
before we begin typically you should
know how to code on a simple HTML form
and maybe how to use selectors to style
that in a basic way and then this series
is going to focus on expanding that
using some extra techniques to make your
forms look better and to customize them
according to your website so if you
don't know anything about CSS or HTML
this is not a good place to start you
want to check out my CSS for beginners
series I'm a Hixton well for beginner
series I'll leave the link to both of
those down below I have also created a
repository for this on my github page
it's called styling html5 forms playlist
and I'll leave the link to this down
below so inside this repo we just have
an image folder with a few different
images that were going to be using in
this series as well as an index dot HTML
file which contains the Fallen HTML I've
already written that for us and we're
going to go through that in a minute
then finally we have this style store
CSS file which is pretty much blank at
the minute and we're going to build this
up as we go through the series so if you
want to work along with me what you have
to do is go to this button clone or
download and then the clone it or
download it to your desktop in a zip
file then just open it up in your
favorite text editor I'm going to be
using atom in this series which you can
find at Assam dial this is a really neat
text editor a lot of people always ask
me which one I'm using when they see my
videos it is atom and it is completely
free so yep go ahead and download that
if you want to awesome ok so i've
downloaded does files from my repo and
i've opened them up in attempt and you
can see here we have the index file the
Styles file and these images up there as
well so we're going to go through this
index file in a moment and first of all
I thought I'd give you a quick preview
of what we're going to be building this
is the form and it's finished state and
you can see we've got some custom images
here for the radio buttons and the check
boxes so if we click these you can see
we have more custom imagery then we have
some custom images down here we also
have some kind of
going on if I have no valid field right
here I get that little tip and we've
styled up the Select box and the button
as well so I'm going to show you how we
do all these different things in this
series but we are going to start from a
blank slate which looks something like
this pretty cool or not
so just to run you through the HTML that
I've created first of all we're linking
up to the Styles dot CSS in the head
then we are outputting this logo right
here in the header which is this thing
that you can barely see it them in it
then the first section here is this in
the fall the gender and all it is is a
couple of radio buttons and we also have
a label for each one now notice this we
have a 4 equals male which matches up to
the ID right here and what that does is
associate this label with this input
type right here so now if I click on the
label it selects that input type and
it's the same for the checkboxes down
here if we associate the labels like
this we say 4 equals male and that
imports to the ID of the input field
then it associates the two okay so
that's why we've done that so the second
section is this interest section and
that is just a series of check boxes and
each check box has an interest so we're
going to stand on top as well
the third part is this contact details
part which is a field set which is why
it has this border around it that is the
default styling of a field set the
legend is the title for that field set
we sit inside the border right there
then we have an import for email and one
for telephone and also we've added these
sponge right here afterwards with a
class of tip which is going to be useful
that kind of validation when we input a
valid field that tick is going to appear
then down here we have a select box
which is this thing right here asking
how they would prefer to be contacted
and then finally that's submit button at
the bottom cool so that is the HTML now
if we dive into the styles so you can
see there's actually nothing here except
for a few comments so I've split this
series into 6 videos in each video we're
going to do a different thing so this
first one is just going to be applying
some base tiles I'm at this form not
looks so crappy so first of all what do
I want to do I want to apply a
background
call it to the body so I say body and
then I'm just going to say background
and it's going to be a deep charcoal one
for one for one full and if I save this
it's gonna I told a over here cool so
now we can at least see that logo next I
want to say margin:0 all the way around
and family for the whole form is going
to be Ariel cool so let's save that all
right now then let's also target this
header section right here so we'll say
had it then inside that I want to say
background is going to be a little bit
darker than this thing right here so the
header stands out a little bit more so
I'll say background and it's going to be
0 D 0 D 0 D save that and now we can see
that strip right there I also want to
say padding is going to be about 20
pixels all the way around the header and
we'll say text align it'll be Center
which is gonna centralize that logo in
the middle cool so next we'll target the
form and we just want to say margin it's
20 pixels all the way around for that so
it doesn't see it right against the
edges then we'll say color throughout
the fog is going to be e eb save that
and now we can at least see those form
fields finally I want to say form P and
the form peas are these things right
here so we want to make those stand out
a little bit more so the first thing
we'll do is increase the font size we're
going to say font size is going to be 18
pixels and then we'll also say letter
spacing not point 1 m/s which is going
to just increase the space between each
one of these letters right here so let's
save that dude and check it out and
there we go ok so we've got our form in
a workable state now I start to look a
little bit better and in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is take
a look at these bad boys wrecking into
radio boxes and we're going to stir
those up using some custom imagery I'll
see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
