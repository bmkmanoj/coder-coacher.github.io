in regex special characters which don't
really behave as you would expect them
to for example if you place them in your
regex they're not going to look for
literal matches they're going to behave
in a different weird kind of way you'd
think at first and we've seen some of
these already we've seen a plus sign
which is the one or more quantifier
which says hey if you see this after a
character that means I want that
character to appear either one or more
times as many times as you like that's
what the Plus special character does
we've also seen the escape character
which is a backslash and if we place
this before a character then it escapes
the next character we saw that in the
meta characters in the last tutorial
we've also seen the character set which
is the two square brackets opening and
closing and if we place anything inside
here then it's saying okay in this
single position match anything that you
find inside this character set so
they're special characters and we've
also seen this carrot right here inside
the character set which is the negate
symbol and a spell hang correctly in a
character set so if we play something
after the carrot right here then we're
saying okay in this single position
denoted firm this character set I want
you to match anything except for the
characters at place after the carrot so
these are all kind of special characters
and it replaced them in our regex
without escaping them then this is the
kind of behavior they exhibit if we
wanted to find a literal match for any
of these that we'd have to escape them
first of all so there are more special
characters I'm just gonna show you a
handful in this tutorial three to be
exact but there were more as well as we
go forward so first of all the question
mark and this is the zero or one
quantifier and if you place this after a
character for example if we placed a B
or T or something before this then we're
saying okay well I want this character
to appear this B obvious T either 0 or 1
at times so it kind of makes this
character optional if you like the B or
the T and it can be anything it could be
a range before this character right here
or a character set and this question
mark makes the optional it can appear
once or 0 times next or
is the period or the dot whatever you
want to call it and this means I want
you to match any character whatsoever
except for the new line coats enter and
if we placed another symbol it would
match that every place to carry it with
much that any character whatsoever so
that's a pretty simple one and if you
see a star
this means zero or more and it's a bit
like the plus sign but whereas a plus
sign means at least one or more if you
place the star up to something it means
zero or mocs so it can appear at zero
times if you put an a before this or 500
times if you want it to okay so let's
take a look at these three special
characters inside the online tool all
right then so first of all I want to
show you the question mark so if I first
of all type out hello then I can match
it down here by typing hello this is a
match now if we place a question mark
right here if you didn't know about
these special characters and the special
meaning behind this question mark you
would think that this match is the
literal string hello with a question
mark at the end of it but it doesn't
it's not much in this question mark here
because that's not the meaning of this
character remember this means that the
thing before it the oh right here is
optional so it can appear one or zero
times so this is a match because it's
appearing once the oh and also if I take
off the O it's also about because it's
appearing zero times that's what the
question mark does right here likewise
we can place a question mark over here
and if I delete the e now it's still a
match because he becomes optional we can
place the Oh at the end and this is
still a match okay likewise if I want to
do some kind of range in a character set
I could do something like a oops inside
the brackets a to Zed and let's do an a
before it as well so the first day must
match then if we do something like G
after it that's for the character set
that matches but if we take off this it
still matches because we're saying this
character set right here is optional it
can appear zero or one at times because
of this question mark so I hope that
makes a bit more sense now the next
thing I wanted to show you is the period
or the dots and remember that means much
any character so I could do something
like
it's car and then place a dot after it
now if I say car this is not a match on
its own because we're asking for a
fourth character and that fourth
character can be anything except a
newline character so I could place an S
D B these are all matches right so this
fourth character can be anything even
something like an @ symbol an underscore
or a square bracket these are all
matches cool so that's pretty powerful
that dots right there by the way if you
wanted to say make a string which is any
length long but must be at least one
character and it could be anything in
those characters then this would do the
trick
okay so a dot can be anything and we're
saying it must be at least one or more
time so if I enter any random string
right here they all get a match
okay these are all matches for this
regular expression so this is really
powerful
this period right here alright then so
the final thing I wanted to show you was
the star symbol and remember we said the
star symbol means that the character
before it has to appear 0 or more times
so yeah it makes it optional but it can
appear as many times as you want as well
so I could say something like a range
from A to Z and that can appear as many
times as you want let's put something in
front of it let's say a so first of all
a is not optional that must appear so
let's do it first of all then this is a
match on its own because this can appear
zero times or as many times as possible
currently it's appearing zero times but
if we do a lot of letters now then it's
still a match no matter how many letters
we do it's still a match because this
star means up to as many times as you
want from this character right here if
we enter a number then obviously it's
not going to be a match because this is
just a character range okay cool so
they're the ones I wanted to show you in
this tutorial like I said there are
going to be more special characters
going forward and I'll explain them as
the time comes but I think these three
are going to be the ones we're using
most going forward so I wanted to
dedicate a whole tutorial to them oh and
by the way if you wanted to match the
actual character so
if I wanted to say ABC and then instead
of making this thing right here optional
if I wanted to match the whole thing
including the star what I can do is
backslash they start to escape the
normal behavior then it will match the
literal string ABC star okay so that's
how you escape that default special
behavior this is the escape character
like we saw in the last tutorial and we
can do this with any of the spatial
special characters we've seen so if I
wanted to match an actual dot then we
put the backslash in front of it
then matching ABC dot okay makes sense
same with any of the other special
characters plus signs you name it
alright so there we go
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you two other special characters which
we use to start and end regular
expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
