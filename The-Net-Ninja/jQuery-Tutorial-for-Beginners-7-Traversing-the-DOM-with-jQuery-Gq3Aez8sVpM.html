jQuery for beginners yes seven jQuery
under the Dom Wow okay then going so
first things first I just want to rewind
a little bit and talk about what
the dot actually is in JavaScript
now the Dom stands for document object
model and essentially it is just a way
to describe the relationship between
elements or tags if you like on a
webpage and graphically is represented
by this tree like structure here okay so
for example we've got the HTML tag at
the top of the tree under that we've got
the body tag then within that we've got
different tags such as the header the
day of the footer and then under those
different tags as well
etc etc okay so it also gives us a way
to reach into this tree and grab certain
elements and also traverse this tree up
and down to grab whichever element we
want to retrieve right so for example I
could go in and grab this h1 in vanilla
JavaScript by doing something like this
document get elements by tag name header
which is going to grab this element then
dot get elements by tag name again h1
which is going to traverse the tree
downwards to grab this element right
here now if you're anything like me
you're lazy and you don't want to do
this over and over again in your scripts
when you're grabbing elements from your
web page
so this is where jQuery were really
really excels jQuery provides us with a
wrapper around the Dom which gives us
access to additional methods which make
it really really easy to do to traverse
this DOM up and down this tree up and
down and grab whichever elements we need
so that's what this lesson is going to
be all about I'm going to go through a
few examples of different methods jQuery
provides us with to traverse this tree
ok then class as you can see I've got
the index up right here and I've got the
script GS down below now all this stuff
commented out are the different methods
that I'm going to go through one at a
time but I want to start with the next
one right here now the next method
essentially grabs an element and then
gives us the next
in line in the HTML structure for
example in this one right here let's
just uncomment it I'm saying go after
the contact methods ID which is up here
or down here rather somewhere no it is
this ul right here I'm saying get the
next element in right which is this
image tag right then change its CSS so
that it's got a red border three pixels
and solid so that would hopefully make
this map image right here red so let's
save it and voila there we go it's red
cool so let's just comment this up again
and go on to the next one which is prep
or pre for whatever you want to call it
just show up for previous let's
uncomment that and this time I'm going
after the social nav which is this ul
right here
I'm saying get this element then get me
the previous one because I'm using dot
pref or Eve which is going to be this
image tag yet again but this time oh I
thought that was blue let's make it blue
this time make the border blue okay I
just saved that and there we go it's
made that image blue because that is the
previous element yet it's going up this
time next goes down previous goes up
cool
so let's comment this again then go on
to the next one which is parents now
parent grabs an element and it finds its
parent so in this example I've said get
me the ballot I tore class which is up
here at the top somewhere yep there it
is banner title now go and get me the
parents element so if we go up the tree
one level the parent is this wrapper
give that a border which is three pixels
solid and pink so let's say this and
scoot up the page right here and now you
can see this rapid EV has a pink border
cool and that is the parents of this
banner title yeah all right there now is
a cool trick if we just add an S on to
the end of there we're making it plural
and we're saying get me all the parents
of this banner title right now this is
the first parent this is the second
parent or grandparent if you like this
is the third
parent and finally the body is the
fourth parent so we get all those
different parents and we want to give
them all a border which is three pixels
and pink just by adding that axon so
let's save this right here and now we
can see all those different elements
with a border on okay pretty cool yeah
so let's comment that up again and move
on to the next one which is children now
this one as you would expect gets all
the children of an element so I've said
get the social nav which is down here
somewhere
there it is now find me the children
within the social nav which is all of
these Li tags and give them a border
which is green and three pixels solid
now the social NAB is down here this one
here so let's save this and see what it
does
okay cool it's giving them all a green
border so that's the children method
let's comment that up again the next one
I want to show you is find and I quite
like fine because it's really flexible
essentially what we do is first of all
grab an element which is contact in this
case so it's this section right here
then I'm saying find within this section
a class called Facebook right so if
Facebook class exists within this
section bring that back to me which it
does is right here and then I'm going to
give that a border of purple right so
let's save that and now we get that
Facebook element with a border of purple
now you might be sitting there thinking
well instead of find why don't we
instead just do this contact dot
Facebook and yet that will work this is
gonna have the same effect if I say that
you see it's still purple but for
performance issues the find method is
quicker okay there's not a great deal in
it but I just prefer to find method cool
so let's comment that back up again and
go on to this last method I want to show
you which is called closest and what
closest does is move up the doll to find
the nearest parent to match whichever
element you put in here all right so
I've seen here
don't get me the social now first of all
which is here then get me the closest
parent which is a rapper class so if we
go up the doll first of all we go up to
this section now that's not a rapper
class so we go up again and the parent
of this is rapper so there we go
it's gonna grab in that element so it's
going to give that a three-picture solid
born in which is orange till i save that
and there we go guys forget that orange
border cool so that my friends is how we
traverse of the dom in jquery loads
easier i think you'll agree then vanilla
JavaScript so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to comment down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
