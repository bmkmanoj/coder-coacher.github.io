PSD to WordPress a lesson 9 and in this
video we're going to install wordpress
locally on our machine Wow okay then go
so the first thing you want to do is
head over to WordPress to all four slash
download and then click this button
right here which is going to download
the latest version of WordPress on your
computer after you've done that you're
gonna see this zip for the right here
what you want to do is extract that and
then you'll end up with this folder
right here so if we go into that folder
and then this one these are all the
files that we're going to have to dump
into our WWWE actuary and for wordpress
to work on our local server so what I'm
gonna do is come to one and go to this
directory and then what I'm gonna do is
just highlight all of these soom them
across into this folder now I've already
deleted PHP sorry index dot PHP in that
folder it might ask you if you want to
override it in which case just click yes
so once we've done that hopefully when
we go to the localhost it's going to
throw up the new index.php file which is
wordpress ease installation screen then
go yeah it has done we just select
English to begin with now it's gonna ask
us for a few things before we get
started the database name username
password and host now we've not set up a
database yet for WordPress so what we'll
do is go into W sorry PHP myadmin
and we're going to create that database
so just click on this new thing right
here and then we'll call the database
WordPress and click create now once
we've done that what you want to do is
head over to users and click add user
we're going to add a new user this is
going to be called WP admin for me the
host is gonna be localhost the password
I'm going to generate and I'm going to
copy that find notepad and I'm just
gonna write it down there so we don't
forget it
and then we need to give it global
privileges click go and there we go
we've added the user so now we've got
the user
the host the password and the table name
alright so what we need to do now oops
is go back to this screen and say let's
go the debt based aim was WordPress that
we set up this is WP admin and the
password is going to be this thing that
we copied the database host is the
localhost the prefix it's just gonna be
the little bit of text that goes before
the tables in our database we can leave
this as W peanuts absolutely fine but if
you want to change it you can call it
where if you want I'm going to submit
right now and hopefully fingers crossed
yep it's Ruud and it works so we're
gonna run the install now and the site
title is gonna be a resto that's what it
was called right and the username for
the w/p admin and WordPress admin area
I'm gonna leave this a ninja man that's
pretty cool the password for this it's
gonna generate for me so I'll do that
and paste it down here I'm going to save
this file you should probably do the
same thing to so you don't forget your
email you don't need to put this in it
doesn't need to be correct I'm just
gonna make one up I'm gonna say ninja
ninja hideout comm and we can untick
that because it's just locally this is
running on our computer so now once
you've installed a sorry box with input
all those fields we can install
WordPress and hopefully this should take
like two seconds or 10 seconds 30
seconds put eventually guys this should
work I've got my fingers crossed there
we go
so now we can login we just need to put
our password in I've already done that
and it's wrong so let's paste that in
again and hope for the best
yeah this time it is right cool so guys
we're now in the backend of WordPress
and it's all installed on our computer
if we click this right here you can
visit the site from the front-end and
this is the default kind of style or
default theme that you're gonna get when
you install WordPress out-of-the-box on
your computer so what we're gonna do in
the next lesson is just have a
brief overview of this back-end area
here we're going to go through each of
these different things here and then
we're going to get cracking in turning
our HTML and CSS into a wordpress theme
so don't forget to subscribe guys like
and share it and I'll see you in a
various video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
