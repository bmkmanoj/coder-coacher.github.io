I'm the net ninja and they say CSS for
beginners lesson a targeting elements so
in previous lessons we've talked about
what CSS is and how it contains a
selector for targeting content on your
HTML document and a declaration for
styling it now these selectors come in a
variety of forms we can target loads of
different things loads of different ways
but the simplest way to do it to make
selectors is to just target the element
names themselves really simple and so
that's what we're gonna do here so to
start with we've got these two
paragraphs here in the HTML document we
want to grab those and star them both
together in one rule and we do this by
just grabbing the element or tag name
which is P here so all you need to do is
write P and there as you select a Ted
simple
okay that's going to target all the
paragraph tags on the page so I can just
add in a few rules in my declaration
here we'll say a font size of I don't
know 12 pixels and then we'll give it a
color of red okay so well now the the P
tags on this page are going to be 12
pixels in size and a color of red so
what's next we've got this a tag here so
I want to style that too again just by
targeting the tag name which is a so all
I need to do for my selector is write
eight and then we can do our declaration
and this time what I'm going to say is a
text decoration property of oops
underline and then a color will say this
time blue so we want all our a tax which
is only this one on the page to be blue
and to be underlined and again don't pay
too much attention to these values and
properties I'm putting in here I promise
we're going to cover that later I know I
keep saying I'm going to do it later but
I will get around to it right now I just
want to focus on these selectors and how
to target tax okay so what else have we
got we've got this spam tag here so
we'll target that next and again you
just target the tag name dead simple
spam and we say for this one let's say
text transform
pappa case we want these ultimate
capital letters and then we'll go up to
this h1 here again just type the tag
name for your selector which is h1 and
then we'll say we want a font size this
time of 32 pixels nice and big and then
finally we've got this div here now
we're not going to select it using the
ID we're going to select it using the
tag name again which is div so go to div
that's our selector and then we'll say
width 100%
background color will say great for that
alright then so that's about it we've
targeted all the tags here using only
the tag names and we've stabbed them in
the CSS very very simple you can't go
wrong with it and like you say the loads
of different ways to target elements in
the HTML document this is just one of
them and the most simple form I'm going
to go into different ways of doing it in
the upcoming lessons but for now what I
want to do is save this and I'm going to
preview it in the browser just to make
sure that everything's worked ok so
we're in the contact page so we'll right
click that's showing Explorer and we'll
open this with Google Chrome and then we
go this is our header that we we gave a
background color of grey that's our h1
the P tags here in red and the a tag is
underlined in blue and then this is our
sponsor yo I'm a span tag nice and loud
in capital letters so I hope now you
have got a good understanding of how to
apply rules by just targeting the type
names
likes a really simple but if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
comment below and I'm going to answer
all of those otherwise I'm gonna see you
guys in the next lesson where we're
going to be covering IDs and classes
