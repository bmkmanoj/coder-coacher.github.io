jQuery for beginners a lesson 25 and in
this video I want to talk about how we
can use plugins to extend jquery's usage
Wow are they gangster what is a plug-in
well a jQuery plug-in is essentially
just a piece of code that someone else
has written that we can use to extend
the functionality of jQuery itself when
we use it for example you saw me in a
previous tutorial make a fader for those
block pops down here right and did a
mountain to about 10 lines of code over
here now you can bet your life this so
what out there it's already written a
piece of code with this kind of
functionality and packaged it into a
jQuery plug-in that we can download and
use so that we don't have to write out
all of that code ourselves and we can
just call upon a plug-in when we need it
so that's what we're going to do in this
tutorial we're going to find a plug-in
download it and use it to create a
similar kind of functionality for these
block quotes now I've already got this
page open here responsive slience calm
and this is a neat little jQuery plug-in
I use it quite a lot in some of my
projects and essentially it just does
this kind of thing right here you see
these images are fading into one another
and it kind of cycles through them all
now that's what we're going to use for
our block box because it doesn't have to
be images you can be anything you want
so if you scroll down here to the bottom
of this page then you're gonna find this
download the latest version from github
so you want to click that and then it's
gonna take you to the github page skew
all the way over to the right here and
then find this button download zip click
that it's going to download a zip file
or is it folder to your computer and
what you want to do is extract that and
find this file inside once you find that
file you want to transfer it to your
scripts folder like I have done all
right there so now we can call upon it
alright so once you've done that let's
get back to it and start installing this
plug-in now then we scroll down to this
bit here the usage is gonna tell us how
we can use this plugin and most plug-in
sites will tell you how to use that
plugin alright so first step is to link
up the files now if we come to the head
right here it's asking us to link up the
jQuery mid file now we've already got
this we've got jQuery at the top already
so we
to do that then it's saying loading the
responsive slides file so let's copy
that and we're gonna paste it over here
under the jQuery link now we need to
change this so that it's in the scripts
folder because that's where we'd put it
there we go and you'll notice that it's
under the jQuery link and that's really
important because this is dependent on
this okay it requires jQuery to be
loaded first so that then it can extend
its functionality okay
likewise our own script needs to be
below this one because now on script
we're going to use this alright so
there's a logical flow to the way we're
ordering our script right here now that
step two is to add the markup so let's
go down to our block quotes down here
somewhere there we go and it's telling
us to put each slide within an li tag
and then all of those Li tags within a
ul with a class of our slides right so
each slide in our case is going to be
one of these block quotes so we need to
put each block quote within and a
lighter so that is exactly what I'm
going to do right here I'm just gonna
enclose each block bolt with a lie tag
and this is just gonna take one minute
to do copy and paste these there we go
and then finally there we go alright so
they're in the Li tags now we just need
to put the UL I bought that to enclose
them with a class of our slides just
like that and then pop the closing tag
right down at the bottom here perfect
all right this is how a markup sorted
now we need to add the CSS now it's
given us these four rules to add and
that's going to make sure that it looks
correct okay when we use the plug-in so
we don't need this one all right at the
bottom because we don't have any images
with enough slide so we can leave that
one out but what I'm going to do is copy
and paste these three right here I'm
gonna go to the Styles dot CSS and just
pop them at the bottom of that file and
save then come back to the index alright
the next one is to hook up the slideshow
now we don't need these script tags
because we're in a script file direc
and we don't need this bit right here
because this is essentially just a
shorthand version of what we're doing
right here so the only thing we need to
get is this one line like that so I'm
going to copy that and paste it right
here and one ah guys that is doing
everything for us now we'd have to write
all that code to make those block four
words fade in and out this right here is
calling upon that plugin that we've
loaded in and it's do many followers now
you'll notice that this right here is
calling for the our slides element which
is this ul right so even if you call
this a different class or a different ID
all you'd have to do is use whichever
select you need to grab the element and
then call the responsive slides method
upon that element okay so now let's save
that and I'm gonna come over here and
refresh and you'll notice this block
quote now there's only one of them there
to begin with and after a while it
changes and it should change again to
the third one and then hopefully will
cycle back to the first one voila
pretty cool guys yeah one line of code
and that's brilliant because I'm super
lazy so when it comes to writing
JavaScript and jQuery so that has done
the job for me you will notice that this
has got a big gap now at the top and
this is just to do with the styles that
we've just copied and pasted in but we
could go back in here and sweep these a
little bit of suspect there's a width
yep there's a width of 100% going on
right there which is fine actually it's
this width we need to change let's
dilute that and save and refresh I
should bring it up yep now I suspect we
need to change the block called width to
a hundred percent so make sure it fills
up that whole space there so I'm gonna
just do that right now and this is just
gonna be overwriting a rule that I've
done further drop I'm just doing this
because it's quicker and I'll say with
1.2% and important just to make sure it
overrides whichever rule I previously
written then refresh and poof just like
a ninja guys we have made this fader
that was so much easier than right now
all of that code right and especially
when you have multiple slides or faders
on your website you know if we come up
here we might have one here for the lead
banner
might have one here for the different
services that we offer and on all the
pages as well so you can use this more
than once on your website and we only
have to load it in once that is pretty
cool yeah so that is what being a ninja
is all about guys it's about taking the
quickest route wherever possible as long
as long as as it is good code and this
is good code this is a good plugin to
use so that is how we use a plugin guys
