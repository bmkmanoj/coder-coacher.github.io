17th the UGS tutorial and in this video
I want to show you how to set up view
projects using the view CLI ok then so
far in this series we've been setting up
view GS by adding the script tag at the
top of our hast email file which
reference the view library from a CDN
we've also added another script which
contains all of our view code now that's
fine if you want to do that that's
absolutely fine for small projects or
even some large projects if that's the
way you like to work however I want to
introduce a different way of setting up
a view project now which involves using
the view CLI and CLI just stands for
command line interface but do not let
that put you off is really simple to
setup and I'm going to walk through
every single step along the way
so then why on earth am I going to want
to set up a view project using this CLI
well it allows us to create a
development environment workflow with
webpack and that's really cool because
straight out of the box we can then use
es6 features that is new javascript
features such as import statements which
we're going to be using for the rest of
this series so that's really cool
secondly it's going to allow us to
compile and minify our JavaScript into
one single file so instead of having
separate jazz scripts for different
sections of our web application we can
just compile and minify all into one
file significantly reducing our loading
for you
we can also use single file templates
for different sections of our web
application and we're going to delve
into that in much more detail later on
so just bear with me with that one and
it allows you to compile everything on
our machine as well and not run in a
browser to compile it before we see it
and also we're going to make use of a
live reload development server now to
install the view CLI we're going to need
a command-line tool now you can use the
one that's already installed on Windows
but angle you CMD or command S do not
know how to pronounce this it's really
cool
Alfre sewing employee to download it as
well you can get that from CMD net
secondly we're going to need to install
no GS because we're going to use NPM the
node package manager to install the view
CLI okay
so just click on the
button down here to install the version
6.10 all this work if you want the
latest version that's fine as well just
to go through the installation steps and
that should install on your computer by
the way if you don't know No - yes don't
worry we're not going to give much no
Jess at all we're just installing this
for NPM so we can install the view CLI
okay so install that then you want to
open up your command line tool and so
make sure you've got no installed on
your computer you can type no - V like
that you see it throws back this version
number right here if it doesn't then
you've not got it installed so once
we've done that let's head it now to be
github repository for the you CLI and
I'm going to leave this link down below
so you can read all about it and you can
see right here when the prerequisites
are no js' and we'll just install that
and this is how you install something on
NPM we say NPM install G means globally
and then the you CLI is what we install
it right so this is going to install the
vcli on our computer so copy that and
come to your to my life tool again and
paste it in hit enter and that's going
to install the view CLI
okay cool so now we've installed the
view CLI and we can use the view CLI now
to create new view projects now the
first thing I'm going to do is navigate
into the directory where I want to
create this project so you can see
already I'm in this directory now if you
want to navigate to a directories and
save CD and then the name of the
directory and if you want to go up a
directory you can say CD and that goes
up so just check this out I mean my
websites at the minute I'm going to clip
entity it's going to go up a level if I
say CD my websites now it's going to go
back into this directory I'm also going
to say CD recording because that's going
to go into this recording folder where I
want to create this project okay so
let's just check out now the view CLI
get but see how we create a new view CLI
project so this is how we use it we save
you then in it and then the template
name which we want to use I'm going to
come over this in a minute and then the
project name so first of all the
template name it's one of these things
down here at the where
Park web simple browserify verify simple
or simple regular use this web pack
simple template okay so this is going to
set up a vgs project using a simple web
app configuration you can read more
about these if you want just by clicking
on them so we'd be saying view init web
pack - simple then the name of our
project so let's try that out I'm going
to say view in it diminutive web pack -
simple but then our project name now our
project name is going to be UJ s - a
playlist so if I click enter now this is
going to create a new project for me
okay so it's going to ask me a few
different questions now the first one is
a project name in brackets this is the
suggested one that's absolutely fine so
I'm just going to click enter then the
description that's fine as well
and finally the author ok so just press
ENTER again do you want to use SAS no
not in this occasion and that's going to
create this project for us now it's
saying to us to get started we want to
go into this directory first of all
using CD then we're saying npm install
to install all of the dependencies that
we need and then to run the project we
say npm run dev so first of all let's
say CD view j s - a playlist and then
let's click enter then we'll say npm
install ok so that's all of the
dependencies installed as well finally
it told us to run npm run dev and this
is going to split up a local dev server
now for us and serve our files so you
should see something like this pop up in
a browser which is some kind of
placeholder project that they've created
for us that's what happens when we
create a new project using view gifts so
now let's have a look what happens in
the filesystem so what I'm going to do
is open up now this enthusiasts playlist
is created and you can see all of these
different files first of all this node
modules folder this just contains all of
the dependencies we don't really need to
worry about this at all ok
these are the things we've just
installed using the command line tool
right here second of all we have this
source folder which is where all of our
source code is going to go we're going
to look at that
in the next tutorial then we have a gift
ignore file which is just going to
ignore some files for us and we have our
index file which is the file which is
served up to us okay you can see this
give with an idea of app right here this
is going to be for our view instance you
know where it controls a certain area of
a webpage so all of this is being
controlled out by the view instance and
we're going to take a look at that in
the next tutorial this right here this
is the JavaScript that is being served
to us in the browser so right here this
is the JavaScript which is running all
of this kind of application and you
might think well hang on this is coming
from the dist folder and unbilled j/s
but i do not see that over here and
because we're running in development
mode all of this is happening behind the
scenes so it's not going to show here
but when we compile our files for
production we will get a folder a
distribution folder which we can use to
push to a server
ok so right now this you're just
happening behind the scene so don't
worry if you don't see over here on the
file listings ok next we have our
package JSON file which contains
information about our project all of the
different dependencies we have installed
and we also have a readme under a web
pack config j/s file and this web config
file is basically doing all of the
bundling for us it allows us to use es6
features and things like that ok so
there we go that is how we create a new
project using the view CLI in the
various tutorial what we're going to do
is go into this source folder right here
and take a look at these different files
which are the bones of our view
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
