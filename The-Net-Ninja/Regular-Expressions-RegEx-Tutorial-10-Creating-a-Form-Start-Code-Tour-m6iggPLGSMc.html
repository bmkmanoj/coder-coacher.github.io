fledglings
I think it's time we move on and start
to create this kind of form feedback and
validation using regular expressions so
to do this I've already created the
basic HTML and CSS structure which is
going to give you a form looking like
this on the page because I don't want to
waste your time creating an HTML form
and style and get because I assume you
already know a little bit about how to
do that so if you want this basic code
this kind of starting code then feel
free to go to my regex playlist a repo
on github and you'll find all the code
there make sure you select lesson 10
because that's the lesson that we're on
and you can find an index dot HTML file
style.css and a validation got j/s at
the minute there's nothing in the J's
file at the minute this is where all of
our regex and validation is going to go
eventually but you will find some basic
HTML and base styles in these two files
right here ok so it's gonna look
something like this we have at the top a
link to our style sheet then we have a
h1 then the form itself which is five
input fields at the minute they're all
text except for this one which is the
password field this is of type password
and all that doors is basically when we
type into the field it's gonna hide if I
just refresh this it's gonna hide those
characters so no one can see all right
but for now what I'll do is change this
into text so that we can see the
characters to begin with then eventually
what we'll do is turn it back to
password okay so we also have a hint a
pee tag under each input and this is
saying what the input must be so we can
see that on the page over here we can
say that the user name must be
alphanumeric and contain 5 to 12
characters email must be invalid address
the password must be alphanumeric at
sign underscore and dashes are also
allowed and be 8 to 20 characters long
telephone must be a valid UK telephone
number 11 digits and the slug must only
contain lowercase letters numbers and
hyphens b and b between 8 and 20
characters long so this is the criteria
that we want to adhere to and we'll be
creating regular expressions
only match these things right here in
each one of these fields if they type
something that's 12 digits or 7 digits
here we won't get a match if they type
something here which doesn't adhere to
this stuff right here then we won't get
a match etc so that's what the bulk of
this second part of the series is all
going to be about creating regular
expressions to match these different
fields so that they go green and nice
and give some user feedback okay so the
way we're going to achieve this is that
when a user starts to type something in
then JavaScript is going to listen for
that typing or key or event and when it
hears it it's going to look at what in
the farm field and when what's in the
farm field match is our regular
expression pattern then it's going to
add a class and valid to this particular
farm field then we can style it in a
particular way like give it a green
border to let the user know then at that
moment in time this field is valid all
right so we'll start by creating our
very first a regular expression in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
