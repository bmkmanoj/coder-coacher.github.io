CSS animations tutorial and in this
video we're going to go through the
animation shorthand method of creating
animations ah another dose so I've just
done a couple of things all I've done is
make Luigi go forwards instead of
backwards because I started to feel a
little bit sorry for him and I've also
just made them both linear in the timing
function so there's no speeding up
there's no slowing down so now it's just
a complete cycle going at the same speed
which looks more natural in this case I
think alright so in this tutorial I want
to go through the animation shorthand
because right now you can see we've got
quite a lot of different animation
properties going on there right and we
cannot just shorten this down to one
property with different values and that
is the animation property now to do that
I just want to pop in a couple of clouds
over here and we'll go through the
example on those so let's head to the
index and then in the sky right here
what we're going to do is add in a
couple of images and the first image is
going to be in fact they're going to be
the same both of them but they're both
going to have a class of cloud and then
the source is going to be equal to image
/y
cloud PNG so let's just copy that dude
right there and paste him underneath
save that and let's see what happens on
the page now we've got two clouds in the
sky but we just want to star those up a
little bit to make them look different
from one another so what I'm going to do
is first of all say cloud this is going
to target them both and I guess a
position is going to be absolute like
that and now one goes on top of the
other so let's make them different
positions so the way we'll do this is by
using channel to target them differently
so we'll say cloud and NHL and then this
is going to be one to begin with to grab
the first one and then in here what
we're going to do is set that to be a
width of around Sorge pixels like so a
little bit smaller and we're going to
say top 120 pixels a little bit further
down and we're going to give this a nap
acid
see over around not 0.5 because I want
to give the impression this is a little
more further in the distance and then
what I'm going to do is go after the
other cloud so I'll say cloud and child
and then to this time give ourselves a
little bit of room down here okay and
then this time I want to make the width
about 300 pixels a little bit larger the
top is going to be 0
and I think that will do so now we just
need to animate these in a different way
so let's create a keyframe for these
clouds so we'll call this animation
winged right so that's going to control
the clouds moving from left to right or
right to left which app so let's say at
keyframes call it wind and then in here
it's going to be from and - and same
with these things right here we can just
control the position on the x-axis boy
steadily doing it transform this time
I'm just going to control the left
property so I'm going to start off with
left right here to be - I don't know -
300 pixels because that's the width of
the largest one and it's going to start
at minus 300 pixels off the screen over
here then it's going to go to left and
we'll pop in 100% and that's going to go
right over to this side of the screen
yeah so let's save that and then up here
what we need to do is apply these
animations to the different clouds now I
want them to move at different speed so
I'm not going to apply them to the
clouds and target them both with the
same animation I'm going to do each one
differently so let's do this animation
shorthand a let's say animation and it's
all we need to do first of all we give
it the name of the animation that's the
first value I normally do and I'm going
to say wind that's the animation we want
right after that I'm going to say how
long we want it to take and this one in
particular I'm going to say take about
40 seconds something like that maybe
that's a little too fast I've never seen
wind strong ok 80 seconds right so now
let's go analysis slowly across the
the third one I want to specify is the
timing function and that's going to be
Alinea because I wanted to go a constant
speed throughout and after that I want
it to loop through over and over and
over so I'm going to say infinite that's
the keyword we used for the iteration
count right here infinite like so and
then after that I would like to pop it
in the reverse direction of thing so
I'll say
rehearse right there so it's going to go
from right to left okay so now let's
just copy this and do the same thing on
the other Club or just change it up a
little bit in a second and we'll say and
this one is going to take about 50
seconds so a little bit quicker because
normally you see the foreground one's
going a little quicker than the distance
right so we'll change that from 80 to 50
anything that will just about do alright
so this is the shorthand way we can
write things this is normally the the
the order I do things in the name of the
keyframe first of all then how long it's
going to take then the timing function
then the looping iteration count then
the the direction alright and if you
wanted to pop a delay in there then you
can pop it in anywhere here and it's
just another time if your likes of
seconds so we could do something like
two seconds and that's going to give
this a two-second delay but I'm not
going to do that in this case but one
thing you need to be wary of is if you
do put a delay in it has to come after
the the length of time it takes to do
the full animation right the duration
the first number that you pop in this
shot hand is always the duration the
second number is the delay apart from
that the order doesn't really matter
because it goes off these keywords right
here and the animation name right so
that is how we do the animation
shorthand guys you have any questions
feel free to leave a comment down below
otherwise I'm going to see you in a very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
