this application throughout this
playlist with graphic you out managing
our data retrieval and manipulation now
there's several different moving parts
to this app so I just want to briefly go
over all of the different parts and
technologies were going to be using
because I always think it's a good idea
to have an overview of everything that
we'll be working on and how everything
is all fitting together okay so first of
all we'll be making a graphic of our
server on node.js using Express and this
is where we'll describe how our graph
looks the different types of data on our
graph books and authors and the
relationship between those data types
how graphic you are can walk from one to
another we'll also set out the different
entry points into the graph that is
where a query can enter and land on the
graph and what information can be
retrieved from it so all that stuff is
going to go on to no js' using Express
and graph q out so once we've done that
we'll be then hooking up our graph to
our server to a MongoDB instance on M
lab and this is where our data will
actually be stored okay so M lab is just
an online service that allows us to
quickly generate a MongoDB instance so
it's an online database if you like for
MongoDB and it just saves all the setup
of creating a database locally so once
we've done all the backend there we're
then going to move on to the front-end
and we'll be creating a client side app
using react which will then be able to
make queries to our graph to our server
and retrieve data back which we can then
show in the browser now on the front end
also we'll be using this thing called
Apollo right here and this is kind of
like the glue layer for graph QL and it
allows us to use graph QL on the front
end inside react we'll learn more about
that later on so that's kind of like the
whole stack from afar and the different
technologies we'll be using now the good
thing about graph QL here is that it's
platform agnostic and that basically
means that you don't have to use it with
specific technologies like react it can
just as easily be used with angular
or view on the front end or whatever you
prefer on the front end as well likewise
we don't need to use MongoDB to store
our data we could use something like a
sequel database if we wanted to or even
a mixture of both it doesn't really
matter what technology we use the idea
behind it is still the same now I've
chosen this stat because I think it's a
good one which works well for our needs
in this series so that there is how our
project is going to look now to begin
with we'll be creating our graph QL
server on node.js but before we do that
I want to give you a little preview of
how making requests from the front end
actually works and we'll be doing that
using a tool called graphical alright so
graphical is kind of like a dummy
front-end application that allows us to
test out our graph QL
server over here and make requests to
the graph QL server and retrieve data
back so I'll be giving you an overview
of that in the next video and just
making some sample requests from the
front end so you can get your head
around how they're all working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
