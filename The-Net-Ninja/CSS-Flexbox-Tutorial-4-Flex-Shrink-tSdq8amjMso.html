fourth flexbox tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about flex
shrink ah okay then doke so in the last
tutorial we looked at flex grow and that
says to the items look I want you to
grow into the available space at this
given rate so we've given each one of
these elements a different flex grow
rate and that's why they grew a
different rates to reach different
widths then as we make the browser
smaller they revert back to that 100
pixel minimum width size or run about
there okay so in this tutorial we're
going to turn that on its head and we're
going to look at flex ring which is
pretty much just the opposite of flex
growth instead of determining the rate
at which they grow we're going to
determine the rate at which they shrink
as the browser gets smaller so let's get
rid of these bad boys and then what
we're going to do is replace this min
width property with an actual width
property of 320 pixels and you'll notice
now each one of these elements takes up
a third of that wrapper and that's
because the wrapper is 960 pixels okay
so flex shrink like I say determines the
rate at which these elements shrink as
the browser gets smaller and by the way
by default as flex items these are all
going to shrink in proportion to one
another at the same rate okay so we can
set different rates to each flex shrink
property on each of these items right
which is what we're going to do so flex
- shrink and I'm going to set this to a
rate of 1 then this one underneath flex
shrink I'm going to set to 2 and then
this final one flex shrink
I'll set to a rate of 3 so I'll save
that nothing at all has happened yet and
that's because we've not needed to
shrink these yet because we've still got
all this room but as the browser gets
smaller you're going to notice these
start to shrink at different rates and
you can quite clearly see now that this
one right here has shrunk the most this
has the highest shrink rate 3 the
the second most and this the least so
you can quite clearly see that the
bigger the number of flex rink the more
that it shrinks the bigger the shrink
rate the more it shrinks right so if we
set this to something like 10 you can't
even see it anymore okay he's got off
the page it's that small if we said it's
something like 7 or 6 even Oh get rid of
the 1 then you can kind of see a very
thin strip of green there ok so you can
see the bigger the number the more this
is going to shrink and as we make this
larger again we're going to see the
green a little bit more all right so I
mean if this was 5 and this with 5 then
even though this is 6 still a high
number it's not going to be a small in
relation to these 2 because it's a
relative measurement it's going to look
at its sibling elements look at what
their roots are and it's going to shrink
it in comparison with those all right so
it's only if this is kind of 1 then
these are going to be and so this is 2
for example then this rate is going to
be much kind of quicker
would that make sense all right whereas
if these are kind of 5 and 4 it's not
going to look like the green one is
shrinking at fast all right so then that
is flex shrink it's how we would shrink
elements as a browser gets smaller and
it controls the weight at which we
shrink elements in relation to each
other to be honest guys I rarely use
flex shrink and I've not seen many
occasions where I would need to do it
and but it's there if we need it okay
so if you have any questions feel free
to leave a comment below otherwise I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
