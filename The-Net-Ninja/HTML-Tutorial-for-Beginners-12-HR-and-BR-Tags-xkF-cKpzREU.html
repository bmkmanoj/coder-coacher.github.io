ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 12
line breaks and horizontal rules now
this is going to be a really really
really quick lesson than just a couple
of things I want to talk about before we
go any further because I think they're
quite nifty tags to know so we're just
going to jump straight into the code
editor and Here I am back in the index
file and I've not changed anything since
last time and the first thing I want to
talk about are line breaks and line
breaks are just a way of controlling
whitespace on a web page so we can force
some text onto a new line using a line
break and the tag we use is a br but
before I show you the br tag I'm going
to save this and show you in a browser
what it looks like currently and I'm
going to scroll down to this little bit
of text here under about us and you can
see it's all on one line and that's
because it's all in one Pete AGG if we
go to the code you can see in this about
Us section here that it's all within
this P tag so there's nothing kind of
controlling the whitespace within that P
tag now if we go halfway to where this
full stop is and I add a br tag that's
saying put a break here put a line break
at this by at this point so I'll save
this and we'll open it up again in a
browser scroll down and now you can see
under this about or section after the
full stop here we go on to a new line so
that's what the br tag does the second
thing I want to show you is the HR tag
now the HR tag stands for horizontal
rule and basically it's another way of
kind of segmenting parts of a website so
if you have a section at the top and
then a section at the bottom and you
want something kind of distinct between
them to kind of separate those two parts
we can use a char tag or a horizontal
rule tag and I'm going to do this
underneath first of all the kind of
intro line here we sell the smelliest on
the fish on the planet I'm going to put
them
our tag and then once again I'm going to
put that under the navigation so we've
got three distinct parts now we've got
this top part here which is the banner
and the intro text then we've got the
navigation in the middle part then the
bottom part is all this extra text here
at the bottom so I'm going to save this
out and view it once more in a browser
and we can see now we've got these
horizontal lines across the whole
webpage here and again we can style
these in CSS so you can make them look
however you want and so there we go
that's all there is to it we've got BR
tags to control whitespace and go on to
a new line within text and we've got a
chart ax which stands for horizontal
rules and we can use these to segment
content so that's all there is to it in
this lesson I told you it's going to be
quick and in the next lesson we're going
to be talking about the elusive div tag
so I'll see you guys there and don't
forget to comment if you have any
questions like the video and subscribe
I'll see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
