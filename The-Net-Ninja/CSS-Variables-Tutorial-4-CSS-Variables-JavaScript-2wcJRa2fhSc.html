more thing about CSS variables before we
close this series out and this is how we
can interact with these CSS variables
via the power of JavaScript and this is
essentially another benefit of CSS
variables over sucks because again once
we've transpiled sass variables we can't
really interact with those variables via
JavaScript whereas we can with CSS
variables okay
so let's dive into this the example I
want to go through is to create some
kind of swatch strip at the top so that
means that we're going to have some
different colored blocks and a user can
click on one of these colored blocks to
change the theme of the website so for
example if they click on yellow then
this change is yellow and this change is
yellow etc all right so the first thing
I'd like to do is create the very very
simple HTML for these swatches inside
the header so I've already copied this
from our repo I'm just gonna paste it
right in there so dead simple
it's a div with a class of swatches and
inside there's four different spun tags
and each of them have a style associated
with them they have a background color
each so the first one is this kind of
charcoal gray the second one in fact I
can't remember what these colors are so
we'll find out for ourselves in a minute
the next thing I'd like to do however is
just add in a couple of different styles
to style this swatch at the top so again
I've already copied these from a git
repo and you can get those as well I'm
gonna paste them down there and you can
see swatches was the name of this class
right here of the div and then it was
styling the sponge in each sorry each of
the spans inside that swatches div so
each one will display as inline-block to
go have a width and height of 20 pixels
so little squares on the screen and
they're all gonna have a margin of 10
pixels to keep them away from each other
cursor:pointer just means that when i
hover over them it's going to have that
little hand icon sore no to click them
so let's save this and find out what
call it these swatches actually are ok
cool so we can see the first one is
black the second one that a hex code
refers to this kind of pinky salmon
color
then we have the blue which is the
banner currently then a yellow mustard
color so the idea is that when we click
on one of these it updates the theme to
be that color does that make sense okay
cool so how are we going to do this well
first of all we're going to create some
click events inside JavaScript and when
we click on one of these it's going to
react to update that CSS variable so
let's create first of all that
javascript file if I right click and go
to new file I'm gonna call this swatches
dot J s and then inside swatches J s the
first thing we want to do is grab a hold
of these spans over here ok we want to
store them in some kind of variable and
attach a click event to them so we'll
save our and call this swatches and set
it equal to documents dots query select
all and inside in fact it needs to be
query select or because we're querying
more than just one thing this for
swatches in total and we want to return
all of them so we'll say we want to grab
the swatches class first of all and then
the span tags within that swatches class
ok so that's gonna return all of those
swatch elements all of those spans and
store them inside this variable now the
next thing we want to do is grab ahold
of the route selector so inside our
Styles over here we can see that our
variables declared at the top inside
this root selector right here we want to
grab ahold of the root selector as well
inside the JavaScript so that we can
change it okay so we'll save our root is
going to be equal to documents dots
query selector and then inside we want
to grab the root element which remember
refers to 99 times out of 100 the HTML
element the HTML tag all right so we're
grabbing ahold of that as well so what
we want to do now is cycle through each
one of these swatches because there's
four in total and for each of those add
an event listener a click event listener
so we can respond to it so we'll say
swatches first of all dot for each which
is going to cycle through those swatches
and inside here we'll use a arrow
function so we just do the parentheses
first of all then the arrow then the
code block but each time around each
iteration through these swatches we can
take the individual swatch and pass it
through as a parameter so each time we
cycle through these we're getting access
to that individual swatch that span tag
and we can perform some kind of action
on it what we want to do is attach an
event listener so we'll say swatch dot
add event listener and the event we want
to listen for is a click event if this
is all going over your head and oh this
is a CSS series and not a JavaScript one
feel free to check out my JavaScript Dom
tutorial that goes through all of this
kind of stuff in great detail so we're
listening for a click event then we're
going to fire a function when this click
event occurs on that swatch so again
we'll use an arrow function so equals
and then the little Chevron then the
code block and again we get access here
to a parameter in the inside of this
function which is the event so when we
click on something that event object
comes through into this function right
here and we have access to it so what
we're going to do now is when a user
clicks on a swatch we want to take the
swatch find out the color of that and we
want to apply that color to the variable
that's inside the root element does that
make sense so the way we're going to do
this is by seeing roots then the style
property that's going to give us access
to the different styles inside that root
element so essentially these things
right here then what we're going to do
is we're going to set one of the
properties right this is how we kind of
override one of these properties right
here because they're all properties
we're just setting one of them right so
set property this is a function and this
function allows us to pass in two
parameters the first parameter is going
to be the property which we want to set
now we want to set the variable property
which is double - theme - color that's
what we overriding when we click on a
swatch right then we want to override it
with the color of the swatch that we
click on so how do we get access to that
well like I said we have this event
right here so we can say e dot target
that
is the element that we've clicked on the
target element then we can find out the
style of that element the current style
of it remember each one of these
elements has a style right here and the
background property is the swatch color
so we want to access that background
property right here so we say a target
dot style dot background like so okay so
now what we're doing is every time we
click on a swatch then we're taking that
color
that's styled right there and we're
overriding the theme color variable
inside the root selector okay
does that make sense so now we've got
our JavaScript we need to actually make
sure that our HTML is linking to that
JavaScript file so underneath the footer
I'll do a script tag and the source is
going to be equal or rather yeah that's
right so sauce is gonna be equal to
swatches GS all right let's get rid of
that space say that and cross our
fingers in hope that this works so now
if I click on yellow then nothing
happens we're probably getting some kind
of error so let's just view that inside
the console on call error for eka it's
not a function of course it's not a
function I've spelled it incorrectly so
this should be for each knots for eka
all right then so that's spelt correctly
now let's refresh and hope that this
works so if I click on yellow voila
it changes the variable color if I click
on the red salmon color it changes it
again click on black it changes it again
etc so if we inspect this now
what we will see on the elements if we
go to the HTML remember this is the
roots element that we're targeting in
the CSS to apply our variables in what's
happening every time we click on one of
these is that it's updating the theme
color directly on this roots element ok
so therefore it's overriding the theme
does that make sense
awesome so there we've got my friends
that is CSS at variables in a nutshell
there's loads more you can do with them
this is kind of like an
traduction to them if you like but
hopefully it's giving you enough
information to go off on your own and
start messing around with them to create
some cool different things so that's the
end of the series I hope you've learned
something as she followed along if you
