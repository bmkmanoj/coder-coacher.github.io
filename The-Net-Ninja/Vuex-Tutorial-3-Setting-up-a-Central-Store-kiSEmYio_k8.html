tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about central stores so in the
last tutorial we went ahead and created
this simple view jeaious application we
have two nested components product least
one product list two both showing the
same product data that just start
differently the both nested with inside
this root component right here which is
storing this data products and passing
it down as props both of these two
components so this is typically how we'd
set up a simple view jeaious application
without using view X we'd store this
data on the root component the shared
data and pass it down to the components
which you need it now I want to show you
how we'd set this up using it view X so
we're not going to define this data
right here we're going to define it on
some kind of central store now the first
thing we need to do is install view X so
you want to open up your console and you
want to type in NPM install view X
double hyphen save and that will save it
to your dependencies to check its
installed correctly just open your
package JSON file and make sure that
view X is in their dependencies okay
cool so now that's installed we can
create this central store now typically
when we do this what we do is create a
folder called store to store this in so
let's create a new folder and we'll call
that store and inside the folder I'm
going to create a new JavaScript file as
well called store GS so this is where
we're going to create our central store
of data so the first thing we need to do
is import a couple of things well it's
important you front view and also we
need to import what we've just installed
view X so reports view X from view X ok
cool
so first of all we need to tell of the
UJS that we want to use a plugin this
plug-in right here and the way we do
that is by using the view dot use method
and inside here we say which plugin we
want to use view X so now we can use it
in this application and we're going to
use it to create our store now so I'm
going to create a constant first of all
and I'm going to call this store and
this is going to be equal to a new UX
dot store ok and stores in capitals and
view X's in capital
okay so inside here we want to pass
through an object and we want to define
the state of our application a remember
state is just the data in our
application so state and this is an
object and inside this object we can
define different sets of data
much like reward in the data method
right here of a component but we don't
need this return statement instead what
I'm going to do is just grab these
products cut them from here save that
and I'm going to define them within the
state right here so I'll paste it in so
now we have our product data defined in
this central state rather than defined
over here in the root component okay and
the idea is now that these other
components product list 1 and print list
2 will be able to access this data from
this central store without it being
passed from this root component as props
okay so writing with creating our store
and what we want to do now is export
this store because right now it's just a
file sitting on its own doing nothing we
want to export it so in the next
tutorial we can import it into our main
dot J's file and use it within our
application then we can start accessing
the data so if I save it right now
you're going to notice over here that we
don't see any of the data anymore and
like I said that's because it's no
longer stored on this routes component
okay so it's not actually receiving the
data from anywhere so in the next
tutorial I'll show you how we can reach
into this store and output the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
