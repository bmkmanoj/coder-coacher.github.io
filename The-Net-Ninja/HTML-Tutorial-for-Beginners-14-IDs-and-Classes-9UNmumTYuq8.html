and this is HTML basics lesson 14 IDs
and classes so what are IDs and classes
well they're quite similar but they've
got a very distinct difference and that
is that ID is a unique identifier issues
once in the whole page to describe one
section of content for example the
header of that page or maybe the About
section at the bottom that's a page the
important thing is that we use an ID
once on a page to kind of represent
represent one area of that page a class
on the other hand slightly different in
that it's an identifier of an element
which can be used multiple times on one
page so say for example we have a page
with a load of comments at the bottom
now an element which wraps all of these
comments or wraps each one of these
comments may have a class of comment so
it gives it that identifier it gives
each comment and identifier of comments
but because it's a class it can be used
multiple times if there's five comments
or six or seven or thirty comments okay
so when there's just one thing of an
element like header that we'd use an ID
maybe if we're going to use the element
over and over again in that page then
we'd use a class so that's the main
difference now they can both be used
with JavaScript and CSS we can use them
in the CSS as hooks so we can say if we
had a CSS document we could say okay
going to the HTML file and find all the
elements with a class of comments and
we're going to style them in the CSS
this way so they all look the same if
it's an ID we can still use that in the
CSS the CSS file will say okay find the
section of the document with an ID of
header and we're going to position this
in a certain way on the web page so they
can both be used with CSS and likewise
both be used with JavaScript and we're
going to cover a little bit of
JavaScript and CSS in this course
however a will be doing full courses on
CSS basics and JavaScript basics later
on
so we're going to dive into the coke now
and we're going to try practicing with
these IDs and classes alright here I am
back in the cold and if you remember
last time we added all these
developments which remember divided the
page up into specific divisions or
specific kind of sections of the website
so we've got some here above the header
with the banner sorry not the header the
navigation and then we've got a div tag
enclosing the header here and a div over
the types of fish we sell and so forth
down the page so we're going to start
giving these some IDs in classes so the
first one which is the the top here
which contains the banner and the
welcome text I'd say that's a pretty
good contender for a header of the web
page so we're going to give that an ID
because there's only one header on this
page of header and that's how we write
is just an attribute called ID and then
remember attributes the attribute name
equals the double quotes and then the
value of the attribute so we're saying
the value here is header so we're giving
this section of the content this element
here the div tag an ID of header all
right
likewise we're going to give the
navigation area an ID of navigation and
then we'll move down to this bit here
types of fish we sell and I'll say ID
because there's only one of these again
one of these sections types of fish
now I've used multiple words for the ID
which is fine different developers have
different ways of attacking this I like
to put a hyphen between each word now a
lot of developers like to do something
called camel cage which is where do you
write the first word and then you do a
capital word that capital letter for the
beginning of every subsequent word so
that would be typed capsule o off and
then capital F for fish so it'd be like
that that would become a case personally
I prefer the hyphenated rule
purely because I think it's more
readable so I can look at this and I can
tell it says types of fish easier than a
camel case types of fish would however
doesn't make a difference entirely your
choice so we've done that then the next
part is this so I'm going to give that
an ID there's only one about with
section on the page and I'm going to say
about source for the ID of that and then
the contact was methods here I'm gonna
give that an ID as well and I'm gonna
call that contact us so that's pretty
much it for the IDS no on this page
there's not really anything I'd give a
class at a pinch
I'd give these contact methods a class
each different contact method phone
email or carry pigeon they've each got a
h3 and a P tag now if I wanted to and
I've done this already and I've added
div tags around each different contact
method at a pinch I would probably add a
class to these so the way we do this is
say class for the attribute and then
give it a class name and I'll call this
a contact method so there's multiple
classes there's multiple contact methods
so we can remember a class can be used
more than once on a page so we're going
to give each enclosure dick div tag a
class of contact method and I've just
copied and pasted it done on each tier
so I mean that's all there is to it
this isn't going to have any kind of
visual impact yet this is like I say
just a way of kind of describing the
content so it's good for semantic
reasons and it's a way that we can hook
into the HTML document via CSS and
JavaScript and we can use these classes
and ID's to give certain styles or
JavaScript scripts to each Alvin and
we'll go off quickly JavaScript and CSS
probably in the next video a little bit
so I'm going to give one more example of
how we use classes to make it a little
bit more clear and to do that I've made
a new page here called classes HTML on
the left so I'm going to open this up
and all this is is like a comments page
so if someone wanted to give me a
comment about how smelly my fish are
they can do that here so I've got
multiple comments on this page and you
can see here I've got a title P tag and
then we've got a surrounding div tag
that encloses all the comments and then
around each comment we've got another
div tag as well so for the surrounding
comment here the surrounding div tag
there's only one of these that surrounds
the whole section of comments so we can
give this an ID we can say the idea of
this would be comments okay because
there's only one section that encloses
all the comments and inside we have
multiple comments so we can give one of
these each one of these div tags at
class because there's multiple of them
and we'll call it single - comment and
we can copy and paste that onto each div
tag and there we go we've got our ID and
our classes so that's all there is to it
in the next lesson I'm going to go into
how we can use the classes and ID's in
CSS and subsequently after that we're
going to go into how we can use them in
the JavaScript as well so if you have
any questions remember just comment
below I'll answer them and don't forget
to subscribe I'll see you guys in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
