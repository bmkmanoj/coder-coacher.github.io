yo guys what the hell is going on this
is CSS for beginners lesson 26 and in
this video we're gonna talk about you
that's coming up Wow okay so you may be
sitting there right now thinking what
the hell was that about
why has he just said Universal select in
such a godly manner and the reason my
friends is this it is the god selector
it's the mother of all selectors one
selector to rule them all that's how
powerful it is okay and essentially what
the universal selector does is select
every tag on the page so we can style
every tag on every element within one
rule and it looks like this a star
that's it that's the universal selector
quite fitting I believe because it stars
quite godly and heavenly and within this
my friends we can style everything every
tag imaginable it would be akin to doing
something like this article p li UL div
h 1 h 2 a etc etc there's too many tags
to write but essentially if we were to
write every single HTML element here and
then style it that would be the same as
writing this here a tiny little star so
this is much easier and that's how
powerful it is so what can we do with
this well we can do anything we want and
I am going to color everything below
because I'm feeling quite manic so let's
have a look at this in a browser
and then we go everything on the page is
blue that is awesome I might do a
website like this I've got blue head in
blue text blue link blue items heading
text etc etc okay so that's there that
selector that little star the universal
selector has targeted every element and
it is colored blue now this is not to be
confused with inheritance all the
elements are not inheriting this style
it's not like going like this body and
then clone everything blue in the body
because remember if we do this then
every element will kind of inherit this
body element they sir this body rule and
color them blue unless they are
explicitly styled otherwise overridden
okay so let's just review this in a
browser oops
and you might be sitting there saying
well there's no change and you're right
there's no change okay but check this
out first of all what I want to do is go
back to our star and color everything
red okay and then we'll view this in a
browser just so you can see this as well
in case you don't believe what it's
doing everything is red there yet every
element okay let's go back and do the
body here the body selector and say that
every element will indirectly now
inherit Lee style okay so are you
thinking well that should be the same
that blue is the same right so why
should this be the same well let's have
a look oh we've missed something
this here is still blue now why is that
the universal selector targeted every
element and it called them individually
blue that wasn't inherited it targeted
every element directly now when we give
a rule to the body selector what we're
doing is passing that rule on through
all the child and descendant selectors
indirectly it's inheriting those rules
now remember default browser styling
well that there is overriding
this age rule here so it's the a is
inheriting this body rule of color and
get read but then the default browser
stand is going a I've got a rule for A's
myself so I'm going to color it bloom I
don't care what you've inherited I'm
gonna color it blue okay
however the universal selector overrides
that that is selecting the a tag
directly as well as the P tag direct
that as well as the Li attack directly
okay so those are not inherited so that
is the one important difference between
inheritance and the universal selector
alright and so why would you ever use
this well it's a good question and a lot
of developers kind of shy away from it
and that's because of the sheer power of
it you know they don't often want to
target every single element and give it
identical styles but some people they
create what's called a CSS reset now I'm
not gonna get into too much detail about
what a CSS reset is now but essentially
CSS reset is a way of stripping out all
the default browser styles so you can
apply your own styles so there's no kind
of conflict so you're not getting blue
links where you don't want them or
margins or padding's or anything like
that where you don't want them so what
they generally do is put this universal
selector at the top of their CSS statue
or in a separate stylesheet all together
and they do something like this I don't
know just rip out all the margins strip
out oops all the padding zero and I
don't I'll call it everything black and
this is the simplistic version you know
a CSS reset gets into a little more
detail than this and may do a video on
this in the future but for now let's
keep it to this simple example and if we
do that and then open it up in a browser
then we'll see but now all the padding
and the margins around each element and
the color of the links they've been
stripped off so we've got like a blank
canvas if you like everything's uniform
and then we can go and style it how we
want and we're not got those default
browser Styles interfering with anything
so that's why people would use it I will
advise
that you err on the side of caution when
you use it okay
don't just kind of throw anything you
like in there because don't forget you
always have to override those styles
because those styles are going to run
through everything so you may forget
certain elements in the future to style
something and then this is going to rear
its ugly head and take away its margin
taken weeks planning and sometimes those
default styles are quite good that the
browser implements they're there for a
reason okay so be careful with it I'm
not saying don't use it if you're free
to use it in your own CSS resets or
whatever but just be careful with it
okay then so that there is the universal
selector if you have any questions about
it whatsoever feel free to comment down
below and we'll answer all of those as
soon as I can otherwise please subscribe

you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
