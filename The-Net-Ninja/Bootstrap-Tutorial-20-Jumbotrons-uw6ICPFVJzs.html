bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a look at Jumbotron
uh I guess as you can see I've gone
ahead and made some dummy content we've
still got this nut bag at the top that
would be any previous tutorials but
after I've made this 12 column paragraph
right here and then each one of these
three comes in width also so a Jumbotron
is something that the bootstrap
developers it named when they were high
for some kind of element that they want
to stand out on a web page alright so we
could make this a Jumbotron right here
and it would go and stand out a little
bit just gives it a bit of extra styling
a bit like a banner but people tend to
use them for text as well so I'm going
to show you how to make one of these and
the visual effect it has in the code
right now so this right here this row is
the top row here okay so we're going to
make this into a Jumbotron so how do we
do that well all we need to do is put a
div around the content so I'm going to
put a div there and give it a class of
you guessed it Jumbotron all right so
I'm gonna take that closing div and I'm
gonna pop it right at the bottom here
and just move this in a little bit all
right so now when we take a look at this
in a banner it a browser rather we get
that kind of Jumbotron effect so just
goes makes everything stand out in this
paragraph all right and makes it super
large as well now that's alright that's
pretty cool but sometimes I like to have
my jumbo Tron's full-width going across
the whole website so let's do that let's
head back into the code and to make it
full width we need to take it out of
this container right because that's
what's keeping everything we're in that
central column so let's grab this
Jumbotron I'm gonna get that I don't
need this row anymore and then what I'll
do is I'll jump outside of this
container underneath the navigation
still and I'm gonna pop that code right
there and just move this little bit back
there we go something like that okay so
let's take a look at that refresh and
now it's for width but yeah it's still
stupid because this text goes all the
way to
the edge and we don't want that we want
the test to kind of line up with this
and this right so one more thing we need
to do we've got the jumbotron that goes
forward within the jumbotron we want the
content to be within the container to
keep it central and aligned with the
other text on the page so we do a div
inside the jumbotron will give this a
class of container and or it could be a
fluid container you know I'm using
container for now and then what we will
do is right at the bottom of this P but
the closing gift sack trying to space
this out a little bit better good girl
there we go all right got there
eventually
and now let's take a look at this in a
browser that looks better all right
that's pretty cool so basically I would
just use a Jumbotron when I've got kind
of like a big intro maybe on a blog post
where I want the first paragraph to be
kind of bold and in-your-face you can
get a really quick overview of what that
blogs about I can shove it in your face
and then then if you want to carry on
reading the rest of the code down here
is gonna be normal sign it so that's
pretty good for things like that yeah
now one thing that's happened here is
we've got a big space there but what I
tend to do when this happens is just
inspect the element and kind of go down
you see this right here this Jumbotron
has a shed load of padding now it's okay
at the top because that padding is
behind it now we need it at the top but
the padding bottom you can see the
jumbotron right here is 48 pixels again
which is fine if you want all that
padding there and the margin maybe we
can get rid of that let's have a look
margin bottom 30 pixels so if I unclick
that then we get rid of bit of the space
there let's go down to the container the
containers got a bit of padding at the
top as well which we applied ourselves
we can take that off you know so it's
just a matter of tweaking the code a
little bit in your own styles to suit
once you've added these elements it okay
so there we have it guys that is a
Jumbotron don't know what the hell the
word means but it does that if you have
any questions feel free to comment down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
subscribe and all that kind of stuff and
I'll see you in the variant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
