this is CSS for beginners lesson 23 and
today we're going to talk all about
these ntil pseudo classes that's coming
right up
ah alright so before we dive into the
code I just want to quickly go over
again what children are in relation to
HTML so we've got this simple UL tag
here and then for Li tags within that ul
now we'd say that all these are children
right the direct descendants the
children of the UL tag and the way enth
child works is that we can go after
different children within tags so we
know this is the first child second
child third child and fourth child or
last child yet so say we want to grab
the third child we can do that with the
enth child pseudo klutz
so that's what we're going to do right
now we're going to jump into the code
and go through length child's pseudo
classes ah alright guys I'm back here in
the HTML and I've made a brand new file
just for you guys
it's called lists dot HTML and in it
we've got this simple UL tag and within
that about 711 Li tags now the first one
has got a bit of a title kind of air
about it and so is this 5th or 6th one
here halfway done so we want to grab
these and style them differently when I
make them stand out so we can use the
empty child selectors or the child
classes rather to do that now the way it
works is this first of all we grab all
of our Li tags as normal that would be
the selector right to get the LR tags
and then we add our Col lot to say that
a pseudo class is coming up now the
keyword is empty i phone child but it
doesn't stop there now we need to
specify which children we want and this
is where it differs a little bit from
all the structural pseudo classes we
pass an argument or a value if you like
to this pseudo class and the way we do
that is by passing it through to a set
of brackets here ok and then we put the
child sorry the the value or the
argument is most people call it within
those brackets so we want the first
child so we'd say f child 1 and then we
want to make this bold so
font-weight:bold yeah and then we also
want thee what is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 'the
child so we know that we can add
multiple rules on one line doing the
comma delimited list
and we can put our second one in so Li
and child seven and then that's going to
grab this one and it's going to style
both of these old okay so let's just
save that and make sure it's work will
right-click this and open it in the
browser put in google and there you go
guys
item one is there and item 7 is there
unfortunately I have not saved my list
HTML so these titles haven't shown up so
we'll do that again show an explorer and
Google Chrome and now that's saved you
can see these titles here they are bold
all right so that's what end child does
for as we can grab any child and within
a structure and we can style that one
child so we don't need the classes or
IDs that make things on semantic we can
just use the entered selectors which is
really cool okay
now there's more to it instead of
passing these numbers through as
arguments or values to the other child
we can pass other things as well we can
get a little bit more complicated and do
some really cool stuff so I'm going to
show you a few examples of what we can
do with a child okay so say for example
we want all the even or the even ones
which is the second one here the fourth
one here even though it says item 3 to
the fourth child at the sixth one the
eighth one all the even children we want
to stand up in a particular way we can
do that we can say Li again and child
and then we can say either so we do pass
it through a keyword instead of a number
and then style it and we can say okay we
want these to be background Greg yeah
and then we can do exactly the same with
the odd ones so I can copy and paste
this and put odd in here and this time
we'll use pink this is going to be a
nice manly list all right so we're
saying we want all the even tags to be
great background and all the odd tags to
have a pink background so let's take a
look at that in a browser
open this up in Google Chrome again all
right there we go that is pretty cool
it's looking a bit more like a table now
so we've got this one here which is an
odd number don't forget that's one two
even three odd four even so the coloring
them in stripes according to whether
they're odd or even so we've seen where
we can pass a number through and when we
can pass a keyword like odd and even
through now we can do even more say for
example with our pattern this is a
pattern yet we're saying all even ones
and all odd one so that's like a really
simple pattern never cared we can have a
more complex pattern because say Li and
child and then within our brackets we
pass an argument of a formula now they
can get quite complex formulas and so
I'm going to leave you guys to kind of
research that on your own but I'm going
to give you a simple one I'm going to
say 2n plus 1 okay now M starts at 0 so
for every number from 0 to however many
numbers you've got in your list we use
this formula so we start at 0 and we say
2 times 0 is 0 plus 1 is 1 so that's
targeting the first link or the first
tag sorry the first ally tag so let's
just say actually a color green yeah so
we're going to cover color all the Li
tags that fit into this formula green so
the second one is N equals 1 so we do 2
times 1 which is 2 plus 1 is 3 so we're
going to get this first one and then the
third one then the second the third
number sorry the get a third number is 2
so we do 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5
so then the 5th tag gets tile so let's
have a look at that in a browser open
this up again in Google Chrome
all right endeavour go these are other
green items now and it might look like
it's just the odd items and essentially
that's what it is but we've done it
using a formula now we can change this
formula and we can say 3 n so again
starting at 0 3 times 0 is 0 plus 1 is 1
so this one will be styled green 3 times
1 is 3 plus 1 is 4 so the fourth tag
will be star green 3 times 2 is 6 plus 1
is 7 so the seventh tag is going to be
green so I'm you know so on so we'll see
this in a browser show an explorer and
open with chrome and there we go we're
getting more complex kind of formulas
and you can kind of mix it up however
you like you can research these in your
own time and play around with these
formulas to kind of get the elements
that you want to target so you can see
this is really flexible it's quite
complicated when you first start out but
stick with it practice and you will get
there it's a very good tool to have in
your arsenal don't just skip over it
thinking you're never going to use it
because the amount of times I've used
this when I've been in a bit of a
quandary when I've been looking at
complex websites them thinking well
there's no classes attached to those and
I've not got access to the HTML that's
with the client so I have to use the CSS
alone and these have kind of got me out
of a hole in a lot a lot of cases so
stick at it learn them if you have any
questions about them whatsoever feel
free to comment below and I'm going to
answer all of those as soon as I can
