tenth rest OPI tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about error
handling so in the last tutorial we put
together this handler for post requests
and we said we wanted to create a new
record we the data that they sent us
okay then send that data back however
when we try to create a post request
where the name property was missing
remember we said in the schema that we
required the name property then the
request is kind of hung there okay and
basically we didn't know what was going
wrong from a front-end perspective as a
client we didn't know that we needed to
add the name property so there was an
error of clearing in the code but we
need to handle that error and provide
feedback to the front end to the client
if you like okay so how we're going to
do that well again what we're going to
do is use a piece of middleware to
handle our errors okay so this is how
our middleware looks so far we have the
requests coming in the body part of
firing this is fine then the request
handler is firing and this is where the
error is occurring if there is one
because we're selling some data and
we're trying to save it to the database
but because the main property doesn't
exist the schema is kind of failing the
validation is throwing an error but
we're not really doing anything with the
error so the error is occurring here we
need to add some more middleware right
here to handle that error and then send
a response back to the client to say hey
there's an error this is why it's not
working so we're going to add in this
middleware into the stack now so back in
our request handler for portion quest
right here what we're saying is ninja up
creates and this is where it's failing
because we don't have that name property
so because these returns a promise if
there's an error then we can tap on a
catch method which is going to catch
that error right and then we can pass in
a function here basically which will
fire if there's an error okay so instead
of passing through a custom function
here what we're going to do is set up
some middleware in listing right here
and we're going to call that middleware
so how do we call the middleware well
what we need to do is pass through a
function called
and we get that right here at the third
parameter so if this fails right then
it's going to fire whatever method is in
the touch method which is next and next
basically said okay and done here now I
want you to go on to the next piece of
middleware okay so remember the next
piece of middleware is going to be the
middleware for our error handling so
first thing the one I just add the next
method in each one of these just in case
you need it at any point down the line
because that is the third parameter of
these callback functions so now we've
called the next function right here so
if we get an error from this thing then
it's going to call the next middleware
now we need to create that middleware so
I'm going to save this and jump back to
the index file and with creating this
middleware or rather we've used this
middleware then we've used this
middleware this is the second in the
stack now we need some middleware for
the error handling okay so let's put a
little comment first of all and say
error handling middleware and then I'm
going to use with a web-based app use
just like we did with these two things
right here okay and then what we need to
do is pass our middleware in here now
back when we use the body parser this
was a package that we installed this
summer and we're going to use our own
function our old cold
okay so let's pass in here a function
and these middleware functions that we
create can take up to four parameters
the error first of all then at the
request object then the response object
then next in case we need to call the
next piece of middleware after this so
if we now flesh out this inside we can
do something with this error so what's
happening now is we're posting this it's
reaching this handler
right here it's trying to create it is
realizing there's an error there for
this catch method fires which said okay
move on to the next middleware we're
moving on to this next middleware which
is here and is taken in the error which
occurred so let's just lock this error
to the console first of all I say
control that log D our R so if I save
this now let's make sure everything is
running first of all yep now listening
for requests we'll try to make this
request again we'll send it and you'll
notice now we get this big error
okay we get the name the validation
error and we get a message on the error
object you can see ninja validation
failed this is the model and it's saying
that validation failed so I'll tell you
what let's just send this message back
to the client so we know that some kind
of validation has failed and we can send
whatever we want back we can send the
whole error object back or just
different parts of the Arab we're just
going to try sending in this bit back
okay so inside here
we'll just comment that out for a second
because we want to send something back
and we'll say response to send something
don't send and we're going to send an
object and we're going to make the
property called error
okay so I've named this you can name it
whatever you want you can probably power
if you want it doesn't really matter
just logical to number two name error
okay and then what we're going to do is
pass back this error object that we just
loved to the console but not just the
error object we'll pass back and a
message
so error message that was a property on
this error object right makes sense so
now if we save this and if we check that
this is running that's fine we'll make
this request again send it now we get a
response at least now we know that an
error and the validation is famous at
the front and we can say hey okay
something's wrong with the data you sent
so they can go and look at it again and
maybe add in the name property and retry
and then it would work however one more
thing here we have a status of 200 which
means everything okay when actually you
know what everything is not okay okay
because this fails we're getting it an
error so ideally what we want to do is
change this status code now typically
when there's an error we use status
codes in the 400s so how do we send some
kind of 400 status code with this well
all we need to do is say dot status on
the response so we'll say duh status and
send in four to two as the status code
then put a little dot again send so this
is get attached now in 42 status code to
this response so hopefully when we
receive it it's going to output right
there so let's make this one more time
and now we're get an internal
server error that's because I've spelled
status incorrectly ok so save that again
and try it so send now we get this 42
error which says on processable entity
so the request was well-formed but was
unable to be followed due to semantic
errors so now we know something is wrong
with their request we've got an error
message and it's all been written to
them so now it's no longer hanging so
there's a simple example of how we can
handle our errors and send data back to
the user so they know what's going on so
now we've got that under control in the
next tutorial what I want to do is move
on to the delete request Handler to see
how we can delete data from the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
