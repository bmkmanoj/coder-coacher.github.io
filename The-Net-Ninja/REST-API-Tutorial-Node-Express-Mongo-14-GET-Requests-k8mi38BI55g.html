API tutorial and in this video we're
finally going to get onto handling our
get requests okay so in the last
tutorial we set up this geo schema right
here which define the kind of structure
of our geo coordinates that we have to
give to our ninjas and we added it to
the ninja model so when we create a new
ninja we're going to give me some data
which looks a bit like this okay so what
I want to do first of all is post that
data to our API so we can add all these
different ninjas with different to your
locations so I've already prepared those
ninjas right here so what I'm going to
do is just copy these and I'm going to
post them using postman so if we come to
postman and a change list of post get
rid of that right there and just add in
a few of these and then delete that okay
so you can see now we've got this
geometry right here this property and
the type is point and the coordinates
are minus eighteen and twenty five point
seven nine one so this is longitude
this is latitude so if we send this now
then hopefully we should get those back
yep okay and we've added that's in the
database so what I'm just going to
quickly do is add all of these and then
I'm going to fast forward to what I've
done it
okay so now I've added all of those
different ninjas with different geometry
properties at the different longitude
and latitude and we can see that in Robo
manga we can see all these different
objects now ago seven in total each with
a different longitude and latitude okay
so different locations on a map so to
speak so now what we want to do is set
up a get request to retrieve these based
on longitude and latitude so first of
all let's go to our API block j/s routes
file and delete this which is just
sending a simple object as a response in
this get request handler so the first
thing I want to show you is just how you
would normally find all of our ninjas
okay so say for example we weren't doing
geolocation and we just performed a get
request to get all of the ninjas right
so we can say something like this ninja
which is this model right here dot
signed this is a mongoose method and if
we pass in an empty object like that
this is going to go out and find all
ninjas okay return them to what so then
we could say dot then once this is
complete lose this callback function
with the ninjas okay it would sense
those ninjas to us that it's found and
then we could say response dot send and
send the ninjas to the user or the
clients so that's to return all of them
but we don't want to do that in our
application what we want to do is pass
along a longitude and latitude and then
search for ninjas which are near those
longitude and latitude coordinates okay
so how do we do that well we're going to
make use of URL parameters and this is
not to be confused with request
parameters like this URL parameters as
something totally different so when we
make a request in the URL we can add on
parameters using this notation right
here so this is the route from here to
here that we go to for our get request
also API forward slash ninjas then we
can add on URL parameters using this
question mark at the end and then
specifying the different keys and value
pairs so this is the name of a parameter
or a variable and this is the value
after the equal sign and if we want to
add another one we do a little ampersand
and unsign and then save the other
variable name
equal to whatever so when we make a get
request we're going to be passing along
a longitude variable or parameter and a
latitude parameter and we're going to be
specifying what those are so then when
we query the database we're only going
to be looking for ninjas within a
certain radius of these coordinates so
ninjas that are nearby so this is what
we're going to be using to make our
request okay so imagine we've made that
get request with those different URL
parameters on it a longitude and
latitude how do we then query the
database to find ninjas which are nearby
well we can use something called gionee
and it's a method and gionee is going to
look for coordinates which in me by two
the ones we've provided so it makes
things really simple so we can say ninja
geo near and this is going to perform a
gianni query so this is a function which
is going to take some parameters right
now the first one is going to be an
object and inside this object we need to
say the type right I remember this is a
point that we're looking for on a map a
ninja is a point we said that right here
in the model where we said the type is a
point right there okay
so the type here is also point so I'm
going to say point and then also the
coordinates that we're looking for that
we want a ninja to be nearby to are
going to be what's on the URL parameters
so we'll pass through the coordinates
property right here and set that equal
to an array because we're passing two
through and the first one is the
longitude and the second one is the
latitude now the way we access the URL
parameters is by saying request query
and then we can say LNG for longitude
that's going to be on the query string
and then also we can say request dot
query this refers to the query string
dot l80 that's going to be the name of
the other variable on the query string
in those URL parameters right so that's
fine but what we want to actually do
provide a number here because we said
over here that these are numbers right
so these need to be numbers however when
they come in from a query string a URL
parameter they are strings so we need to
use a method called pass floats which is
going to turn this into a number so we
can do that on both of these dudes pass
floats and pass that in just like so
okay cool so that's the first thing the
first object that we pass in to this
gionee function within it's a type of
point and then the coordinates that we
want it to be nearby to the next object
we're going to pass into this is
basically some options where we can say
the max distance that we want to be from
these points so these points are the
ones that are provided by our user by
our clients and we want to say okay well
we'll look for ninjas which are within
what maps distance from these points
okay so I'm just going to pass in and
this is in meters I'm going to pass in
and 10 rather a hundred thousand meters
like that wpm but I'm just showing if
these are meters right so that's the
first thing
so all these ninjas are going to be
within one hundred thousand meters of
whatever we provide here the second
option is very cool shrimp so it's going
to work out the distance based on a
sphere you know that we had that world
image it's going to base the distance
based on that sphere okay okay so this
is going to return towards a promise so
we can save dot then and fire a function
which is only going to fire once this is
complete this query so this is going to
go out find the ninjas which are within
100 thousand metres of these coordinates
provided and then it's going to return
to us this function or rather it's not
going to return to us this function is
going to return to us the ninjas inside
this callback function which it will
fire when it's completed okay so then we
can say responds extend and we can send
those ninjas back to the clients okay so
if we save this now we can test this out
using postman
okay so I'm going to change this to get
requests and then I'm going to specify
my URL here which is forward slash API
/ik ninjas and then we're going to add
on some parameters okay so the key of
the first parameter is going to be the
longitude
that's LNG and let's just set this equal
to about minus 80 okay and then we're
going to attach another one key here
which is going to be latitude and this
value is going to be roughly about 25
okay so notice this string they've made
up here if I need that question mark
that longitude equals minus 80 and
latitude equals 25 so we can access
these now in here that's what we're
doing request query LNG request the
query l80 okay so if we send this now
hopefully this infinite returns was some
ninjas which are near Barbie so if we
send this then we can see our response
down here so we get three ninjas the
first one is Hatake this is the distance
in meters away from us okay and all the
different properties associated with
that ninja then we get Yoshi and also we
get Ryu and notice they're in kind of
descending order so the one that's
nearest to us is first then the one that
second news to us then the one that's
third news to us and these are the only
ones that are within this radius right
here okay make sense so there we go that
is how we can set up our get request to
perform gionee queries to return only
the ninjas that are near to us based on
the parameters that we provide right
here in the get request so now we know
how to do that we've sorted out all of
our different handlers right here we're
in a position now where we can kind of
just flesh out a little simple front end
using react and so we can interact with
this API so I'm going to do that over
the next couple of tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
