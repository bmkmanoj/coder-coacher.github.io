booster 3 tutorial and in this video
we're gonna look at accordions Wow
alright then go so if you don't know
what an accordion is basically an
accordion is a series of tabs which when
you click on them it kind of expands a
bit of content and you'll see it later
on in this tutorial when we make one
basically they are just kind of a group
of panels and we've covered panels in a
previous tutorial which kind of bundle
together and we just have to throw in a
few extra attributes to add in the
functionality essentially that's all
yeah ok so I've created a couple of
comments right here which is where we're
going to place the accordion and it's
going to appear round about here on the
screen so the first thing we need to do
is create a div tag which is going to
surround the whole accordion and that's
going to have a class of panel group so
essentially like I said these accordions
just a group of panel bundled together
so they're all going to sit within here
actually we're also going to give this
an ID I'll just call it my accordion and
we can target this a little bit later on
when we're going to add in a bit of
extra functionality so the the next
thing I want to do is create another div
and this is gonna have a class of panel
and it's also gonna have a class of
panel and there's some kind of
contextual class like defaults or
primary I'll do primary like that ok and
within that we have a heading so let's
do the heading which is a diff with a
class of panel - heading all right and
then after that we also have another div
oops
with a class of panel collapse and this
is going to be the give that kind of
opens and closes if you like it's also
going to have another class of collapse
and again this is quite a lot of classes
basically all bootstrap is is learning
these different classes and the way that
it wants you to write the HTML and then
it's going to take care of a lot of the
functionality for you all right so
the next difficulty we're gonna put all
that content in here we're also gonna
give this an ID of we'll just call this
tab one bar around the panel one panel
one and basically when we click on the
heading is going to target this ID so it
knows which one to collapse and open all
right so let's go into the panel heading
now and now we'll just do a simple h3
tank and the h3 is gonna say ninja
trained it okay so that's gonna be the
title now I'm also going to give this an
extra class equal to panel title just to
make the text a little smaller and we're
also going to give this a couple more
attributes now the first one its data
target and this is the panel that it's
going to target okay so we're going to
add in this ID right here so a panel -
one right and the next attribute we need
is data - toggle which equals collapse
that's been behavior all right so we've
got our head it and we've got our div
for our content so we'll just place our
content in here now and to do that I'm
just gonna do a div with a class of
panel body and this is all in the
panel's tutorial I did a few lessons
back so you can go and check that out if
you want to refresh so within the panel
body all we need to do is place some
kind of content I'm just gonna grab a
paragraph tag from right here and I'll
place it in there all right and save
that okay so now if we click on this you
can see this expands pretty cool right
click again and it hides all right so
now we can have multiple of these and we
can add them together so let's just do
that let's grab that and copy all and
paste it in again a couple of times and
all we need to do on each one is change
the target and the ID and the content if
we need to so I'll just change this to
panel two and panel two again then down
here panel three which is going to open
and close panel three and we'll change
the titles as well we'll change this
want to wizard trained in why not
and this final wanted coding training
like that okay so now when we click on
this one it opens that when we click on
this it opens this one and when we click
on the last one it opens this okay and
you can have multiple open at one side
however if we don't want this multiple
opening at a time we can add in a
further attribute onto the h4 is it all
h3 right here so that when one opens it
closes the other tabs as well okay so
all we need to do is go to the h3 s
we're going to add in another attribute
and this attribute is gonna be data -
parents and we're gonna set that equal
to this ID right here okay so that's why
we added an ID on that so we'll do our
hash symbol first then add that in so
I'm going to copy that now I'm gonna
paste it in on the others one there and
somewhere down here we'll paste it again
so now when we save will just refresh
and now when we click on this it opens
click on this one close you feel that
okay so only one is open at a time now
if you want we can add different
contextual classes to each one so that
the different colors so we could say
panel warning it's gonna make it like a
yellow color and we could have panel
default that's gonna make it the gray
color or even danger that's gonna be the
red one so now we've got loads of
different contextual classes on these
and they're all different colors alright
pretty cool yeah so that is how we make
accordions with bootstrap if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
leave a comment down below otherwise
guys I'll see you in the very next
