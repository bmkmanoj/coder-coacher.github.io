tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about modules and packages
alright and so now I want to introduce
you to the idea of modules and packages
so imagine you're working on some kind
of complex Python project and you've got
loads of different functions in there so
different custom classes tons of lines
of code very quickly this is going to
get very hard to update because it's so
long and what we generally do is split
out that code into logical sections and
those sections are generally going to
encompass some kind of functionality for
your program so each of these different
sections will have their old Python file
and those types of files could be called
upon when we need them we can import
them and then use them so these Python
files are what unknown and modules in
Python so I'm going to show you how we
can import a module and use in this
tutorial
and we'll also going to look at packages
as well which is basically just a
collection of modules so first of all we
have these classes file from the last
tutorial I've also created this test py
file looking in here at the minute and
I'm going to import this functionality
at this custom class from classes ok so
how do we import something well all we
need to say is frog first of all and we
tell entitled where we want to import
from and I want to import from the
classes file so I just need to say for
other classes and then I can say what I
want to import from this file so I'll
say imports and I want to import the
planet class right here so I'm going to
copy that and I'm going to paste it
right here and now we've imported it
tada
very simple now we can use this planet
class in this file so what I'm going to
do is come down to the box here where we
created this instance column the blue
I'm going to cut that out from this
classes file and I'm going to paste it
inside this file instead so now we've
created this instance of the planet
within this file because we can now
we've imported this planet class so we
can create an instance in this file and
what we're going to do is print out
the things we've already printed out
this spin method right now let's print
out one of the attributes so I'll say
print and then I'm going to print out
the name so this is a formatted string
and I'll say me and it's going to be
Naboo needs so let's see this works I'm
going to save this now and run it in the
console it's Tess py and now we get the
name the boom and the planet spins and
spins at a very high speed so
congratulations you've successfully
imported a module into this file so as
your projects get bigger you can
obviously import different modules more
modules and it's just going to help you
keep on top of your code much easier so
I said that packages are a collection of
modules and that's what they are so
imagine you have some kind of
functionality in your program which in
itself is still a lot of work so you
don't just want to put all of that
functionality into just one module well
then what you could do is split out all
of that functionality into several
different modules but then contain all
of those modules within one package okay
so that is what a package is I'm going
to show you how we can create one so
we're going to right click on this
lessons folder first of all and go to
new folder and I'm going to give this
package a name so the package itself is
the folder essentially I'm going to call
this space so this is going to contain
some kind of modules to do with space so
inside this folder right here the first
thing we need to do is add an init file
which tells python that this is a
package so with a right-click I'm going
to go to new file and I'm going to say
underscore underscore omit underscore
underscore doc py now we don't need to
place anything in this file just its
existence right here if you enough to
tell Titan that this right here is a
module now what I want to do is place a
couple of files in here a couple of
different modules so when I go to new
file and I'm going to create one called
planet py and this is going to contain
our planet class so let's grab all of
this stuff right here and cut it from
there and I'm going to go to planet not
py and I'm going to paste it right there
so now we have
this class of Planet inside this module
within this space package okay right now
let's create a new module inside this
space package I'm going to go to new
file and I'm going to call this count p1
and basically this is going to perform
some kind of functions to calculate
different things to do with space so I'm
just going to paste these functions in
there's not want to bore you with math
but essentially what I'm doing is
creating a function to work out a mass
of a planet and that's going to take in
the gravity and the radius of a planet
and this is the formula right here to
work out the mass of a planet based on
those two properties and this is the
gravitational constant right here and
we're returning the mass of the planet
so this is a simple function to work out
the mass of a planet again don't worry
about the formula this is nothing to do
with Tyson per se this is physics but
I'm just giving you an example I've
created a couple of functions here that
we can then import right so this is just
a module the second function is to find
out the volume of a planet and for that
we're taking the radius so we're work
out the volume here based on that radius
and then we're returning with the volume
so now we have these two functions and
imagine there could be many many more
different functions to work out
different values of spatial objects
right so we have all of that
functionality now within this calc
module so both of these calc and Planet
modules are in the space package makes
sense
we're just containing them together
we're keeping them together because the
kind of associated with each other that
are to do with space alright cool so
let's save this now and what I'm going
to do is create now and import inside
these classes file so what we're going
to do is import modules from this
package right here so how do we know
well pretty similar again we just say
frog first of all now where do you want
to import it from well we want to import
it from the space package first of all
that's the folder name then we want to
import a module from this space package
so we want to import first of all planet
so say dr. planets and then I'll say
import
so we're saying from space look planets
on this file import not import so import
planet right that's the class name
remember so in here we have this planet
so we're importing that from this file
inside this package make sense so now
what we can do is we can create a new
instance of that planet in here now I'm
going to go to the test up key white and
again just copy this stuff from here and
go to classes I'm going to paste it in
I'm going to get rid of these print
statements right here now we don't need
those and we don't need this as well so
we've imported this planet from this
planet module inside the space package
and we've created this instance now of
this planet because we've imported it
now what I want to do is import from
this calc module right so we have these
two functions and I want to import both
of these from this module so the way I'm
going to do that is come underneath this
import statement so we can have several
different import statements in one file
and I'm going to take from and again
it's from the space package and then
it's dots calc because it's the calc
module then I'm going to import planets
underscore mass that is the name of this
function right here I'm reporting that
function directly into this file right
here now it's not just a planet mass I
want to import I also want to import the
planet vault so to do that to import
multiple things from this one module I
can just comment and then say planets
underscore vault as well so now we can
use both of these two methods inside
this file as well so that's what I'm
going to do I'm going to print these two
functions in here now so I'm creating a
variable calling a bhoot mass and I'm
setting that equal to planet mass as the
function we've just imported and we're
passing the gravity which is naboo not
gravity and the radius which is naboo
but radius right so they're the two
parameters that this function takes and
we're passing them in from this instance
we've created we're also doing the same
for the volume creating a variable con
the boot vault and setting that equal to
planet vault auction and we're passing
in the grooves radius now remember these
two functions both return
a variable the mass and the volume so
these are both going to be floats so
we're getting a number back from them
and they're stored out in these
variables so what I'm going to do now is
output these variables to the console so
what I'm going to do now is just create
a print statement down here and this is
just printing out a formatting string
right here print formatting string we're
printing out naboo name has a mass of
Naboo mass which is this thing right
here and a volume of Naboo vol which is
the volume we worked out right here so
again don't worry too much about the
mass of all this just notice how we're
importing these modules from this
package into this file and then using
them so then let us save that now and
we're going to run at this classes file
so I'm going to say Python and then it's
classes dot py
so now we see nobu has a mass on this
gigantic number and a volume of this
gigantic number so this has worked now
we've successfully imported these
different things over here the different
functions and this class into this file
so that we can now use them in this file
and just imagine if all of this code
from these different modules was inside
this file it would have got very very
messy but now we've split them all up so
they've got the wrong files the wrong
modules and we can keep on top of things
much much easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
