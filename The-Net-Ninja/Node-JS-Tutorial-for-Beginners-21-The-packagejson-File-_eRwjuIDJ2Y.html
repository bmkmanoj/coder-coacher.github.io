21st nodejs tutorial and in this video
i'm going to talk about the package.json
file
okay then gang so in the last tutorial I
talked about the node package manager
and how we can use it to install
packages into our application now you
could install one package
you could install 10 packages but either
way it's always a good idea to keep
track of which packages you're
installing and which packages your
application depends on the dependencies
of your application now in node.js we
can do that we can use a package.json
file to keep track of all of those
packages that we depend on so we can
either create this manually ourselves or
we can use a command in nodejs to do it
for us so I'm going to do the second
option because I'm super lazy so I'll
say 10:00 p.m. and then in it and that
is the command we need to write so once
we run this it's going to ask us a
series of questions about our project so
we just need to go through these and
answer them so it's asking for a name
first of all I'm going to keep it at the
default one it suggested no jazz
playlist version 1 that's fine
description a little test up entry point
up GS this is going to be the start
point of our application that's fine
test command we don't have one of those
git repository and L keywords for ninjas
yeah whatever and then the author is at
me so the license is fine as is as well
for me
is this ok you bet your enter and then
now that is going ahead and created a
package.json file for our application
and in here is some information that we
entered about this application now one
of the cool things about this package
JSON file is that it can keep track of
our dependencies the packages that we
need to run this application ok so say
for example we install some packages and
our application depends on those now if
we pass on our applications code to
another developer we don't normally pass
on the packages as well just our core
application code that we have written so
for that developer to run our
application they're going to have to
install the same packages that we did
that our application depends on so how
do they know which packages are going to
be installed well they're going to be in
this file but how do we add them to this
file how does it keep track of it well
when we install a package in nodejs
using the node package manager we can
pass through a save flag and that's
going to save that package as a
dependency right here so let's install
Express again so we'll say NPM install
Express and then I'm going to say - save
- say look this is a dependency we're
going to depend on this package in this
application so I want you to save it to
this JSON file so if we run this now
first of all it's going to go ahead and
install Express as normal and then when
it's installed Express it's going to
update this page right here to say our
dependencies so just give it two ticks
okay cool
so now this has installed and you'll see
down here dependencies Express and then
this is the version number okay so just
to demonstrate something pretty cool I'm
going to uninstall Express I'll say NPM
uninstall Express and then this is just
going to remove all of those files okay
good all so now Express is uninstalled
and you'll notice this dependencies
thing is still here it's still listing
Express as a dependency even though this
node modules folder is empty it's not
installed anymore
and the reason it does that is because
even though we don't have Express
installed we've listed it as a
dependency is telling us we need to
install it's basically for our
application to work if we want to list
it as a dependency we can just delete
this but a cool thing about this package
JSON file is say we had about six
dependencies listed right here and then
we pass our code onto another developer
if they want to install all of these
packages our dependencies they don't
need to do them all manually
what they can do is just one command
command and that is NPM install and if
we run this nobody's going to look for
this package JSON file is going to find
the dependencies and every dependency
there is going to install into this
version that they're running so they can
install all of those packages in one
fell swoop and that's really cool okay
so now that's pretty much installed
again there we go we could use Express
in this application again so that is the
packaged up JSON JSON file and that is
how we use it to keep track of our
packages that we use any questions leave
a comment down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the very next
