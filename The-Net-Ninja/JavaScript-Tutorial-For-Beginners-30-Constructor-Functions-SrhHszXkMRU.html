JavaScript for beginners lesson 30 and
in this video I want to introduce to you
the constructor function ah alright in
class so in previous lessons you've seen
me create object like this something to
do with my car and then we've given it
some properties the Mac speed and Driver
and a couple of methods also now if we
wanted to create variations of this my
car object for example my car 2 3 4 we
could technically copy this and paste it
down here
KOB is my car - we'd go in and change
our properties then do the same my car 3
Jing's the properties and so forth but
say we want to create 30 of those or 50
or 100 even that is going to take up a
lot of room in your JavaScript and it's
also going to take you a lot of time ok
so there must be a quicker and better
way to do this well my friends there is
it's called using the constructor
function so what is a constructor
function essentially a constructor
function is just a function that creates
an object for us right and we've seen
them in play already kind of when we do
something like this
VAR my array equals new array that's
creating a new array object for us a new
blank array object and this right here
is calling the array constructor
function to create that object for us
like the same we do with strings VAR my
string equals new string right that's
doing the same thing construct a
function to create a new string object
so what's to stop us in JavaScript do
something like this by my car equals new
car absolutely nothing we can create
this constructor function car to create
those car objects for us right so we
could do this if we have one car if we
have 20 cars we can call this every time
right so that's what we're going to do
now the first thing we need to do is
make our variable to store the carcass
truck to function in and we're going to
call this car and you'll notice that I'm
starting it with a capital letter
because that's generally how we do
things when we're creating constructor
functions in JavaScript
they all start with capital letter
generally speaking so we're going to set
this equal to what to a function and
we'll open our code block right there
and then within these parentheses we're
going to pass in a couple of variables
and the variables are going to be used
so that we can set these properties the
max speed and the driver so we'll simply
call the max speed and Driver makes
sense right and then we can access those
variables in here so when we create a
new car we can say my car oops my car
equals new car and then we pass in the
two variables here like 50 and ninja and
those variables are going to get passed
into these variables here 50 and ninja
so that's how it works
and then within here we can use the this
keyword we've already talked about that
this keyword in the previous lesson if
you've not seen that go back and check
it out but you know now we can use this
keyword within this function to
represent the object that we're making
right because it owns this space so
we'll say this dot max speed equals max
speed and that right there is going to
be the same as saying whatever variable
we create say my car 2 or something dot
max speed equals much speed and it's
going to grab this value and set it
equal to that property there right so
we'll just keep this as this then we'll
do the same for driver this driver
equals driver it's going to grab that
variable right there that we pass in and
set it equal here to that property and
then we're going to do this dot what's
the first method we have drive equals
and then we're just going to grab this
function here copy and paste that and
put our semicolon at the end so that's
the drag function where it's going to
log the distance traveled they will do
this dot log driver
and we'll set that equal to this
function right here copy and paste it in
and that's going to log the driver name
out using this driver which we've
already set up here and that's all there
is to it guys that is your constructor
function right there we've got our
property set up and we've got our
methods set up now the only thing left
to do is call that constructor function
and send it to a new variable so we'll
do let's see what first of all we'll
delete that and then we'll create a new
variable called there my car equals new
car and then we'll pass in some very
balls to these here and the max speed is
going to be 70 and the driver name is
going to be ninja month and we'll do
another one let's just copy and paste
this a few times my car to my car 3 my
cup 4 and we can go on and on however
many times we want to and just passing
different details in here each time
that's how easy it is now guys to make a
new car object then we can just pass in
new names as well want to don't see
Shawn and why not but passing James Bond
alright then so we're creating four new
objects and we've only created this
constructor function once so a much more
efficient way of doing things I think
you'll agree now let's just test this
let's just log a few details out of
these cars will say first of all my car
don't drive and will pass in 30 miles an
hour and five hours then we'll say my
car three log driver okay let's just
test those out refresh over here so 150
we get first of all which is three times
five from this function so that's cool
then my car three dot log driver is
giving us driving a michaud which you
can see here in my car 3 so that's all
worked perfectly so guys that is the
constructor function in a nutshell if
you have any questions about this feel
free to comment down below otherwise
I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
