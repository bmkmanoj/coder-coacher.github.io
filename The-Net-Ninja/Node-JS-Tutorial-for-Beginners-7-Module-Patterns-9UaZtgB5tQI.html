seventh nodejs tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at some
different module patterns already guys
so in the last tutorial we went ahead
and created our first module and we
called that module count is right and
what we did is we just apply to module
got exports this function right here
counter so that this is now made
accessible outside of the module
wherever we require that module so we
can do something like this we can use
that counter here because we've stored
that in this variable right here but
what if we want to return various things
what if this was not just a counter
module but a module that returned
different mathematical things so let's
just rename this first of all I'm going
to call this stuff because it's not just
going to be a counter it'll be other
stuff as well all right
cool name for a module stuff and what we
need to do is update this right here to
require stuff all right let's save that
now what we want to do is create some
different functions in this module that
we can use so I'm going to create
another variable and I'm going to call
this adder and this is going to add two
numbers together so I'll set it equal to
a function which is going to take two
numbers a and B and then what we're
going to do is return a string which is
just going to say the sum of these two
numbers is whatever it is okay so let's
return and this time I'm going to use a
template string which is a new addition
to es6 atma script six and a template
string uses these backticks not these
quotation things and a backtick on your
keyboard is normally found towards the
top left underneath your escape key and
the difference is that in template
strings we can embed variables or
expressions without concatenate in them
like this
so I'll show you that now I'm just going
to say the sum of the two
numbers is and then to embed a variable
we use the dollar sign then the curly
braces and we pop the expression inside
here which is going to be evaluated so
I'm just going to do a plus B okay so
now we no need to concatenate that
because it's within the template string
all right cool so now we have a second
function in this module that I want to
export and I'm also going to do one more
thing and that's just going to be PI and
I'll set it equal to a number three
point one four two and I know we can get
this on the math object anyway in
JavaScript but I'm just demonstrating
how to export different things so let's
save that now I want all of these three
things to be accessible in here when we
require this module so how do we do that
because down here we've said module
export equals counter we set it equal to
this variable well module de exports is
just an empty object to begin with okay
so what we could do is add on properties
to this object and we could say module
exports counter equals counter right so
then the counter property of this
exports object is equal to this function
and therefore we can add on all the
properties which equal two different
functions in this module so let's copy
and paste that dude and come underneath
and we'll change this counter to adder
and we'll set this equal to the other
function all right so now we're
exporting both the counter and the adder
on different properties of this exports
object right now let's do a third one
and this time we'll call it PI and we'll
just set that equal to PI so now we're
exporting all three of these three
things and they're all going to be made
available outside of the module where we
require this module so let's save this
and this time what I want to do is not
call this variable counter because
that's just one of the properties or one
of the functions in this
module I want to call this stuff so
we're going to store this module do
exports object right which has these
three properties on it in this variable
called stuff so now what we can do is
instead of saying counter we say stuff
dot counter because remember stuff is
just module two exports that is what is
returned to us this object and therefore
stuff counter is equal to this function
which is what we're doing right here
stuffed up counter so let's save that
and just run this file in node we'll say
node app and see if it works yeah there
are three elements in this array cool so
let's try another thing let's try
calling this function right here add it
so again we'll console that lot and this
time we'll say stuff dot add it and
we'll pass in two numbers we'll say five
and six save that and come and run this
in node and we get first of all there
are three elements in this array that's
this thing and then we say the sum of
the two numbers is 11 so this is worked
brilliant now we can also access that pi
variable because that's just on module 2
exports PI so why don't we pass that
into this thing right here so let's say
console dot log stuff
adder and then what we're going to do is
add PI but we need to reference it on
stuff so stuff PI and then add it to 5
so let's save that and do this one more
time and then we get the sum of the two
numbers is eight point one forty which
is just three point one four two which
is PI plus five okay so now we've
exported multiple things from this
module which is pretty cool now we could
do this or we could do it a slightly
easier way we've referenced these
variables up here we've give them all a
variable name and set those equal to a
foot
 and now we've passed that variable
through to these different properties on
module 2 exports but we could just cut
out the middleman so to speak and just
do something like this copy that and
paste it there and then copy this and
paste it there instead and then finally
this one and pop that there so now we've
still exported all of these different
things on module 2 exports but we've
kind of cut out a bit of the code so
let's save that and make sure this still
works in app KS or say node app and yet
everything still works pretty cool so
that is another way that we can export
these things in the module I'm going to
show you one more way we can do this and
what I'm going to do is set these back
equal to the variables so this was var
counter and this was var adder and this
one was var PI so we still need to
export some things so let's say module
da exports and set that equal to an
object so this is object literal
notation right here yep and then we can
just pop different properties or methods
in this object so we could say counter
is counter right and then adder is adder
and then finally Pi is PI so that's
doing the same thing we're still adding
these properties on to module de exports
but we're just doing it in literal
notation right here okay so let's save
that now and see if this still works so
node up and yet everything still works
we still get those three things logged
down here to the terminal cool so they
were just a few different module
patterns that we can use to export our
data or functions and make them
available to other files when we require
the modules
okay so any questions feel free to leave
those down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
