21st bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at
styling forms why I think guys so I have
gone ahead and added this little bit of
content at the bottom I've got this get
into its paragraph right here which is
six columns and then also I've added
this forming right here just a simple
HTML form and which is six cons and
width is what because I need somewhere
for people to get in touch right now at
the minute this looks pretty crude but
bootstrap gives us some classes so that
we can make this look a lot better dead
simple all right the first thing we want
to do is add the class form control to
our import fields so for example I could
say input class equals oops let's get
rid of caps class equals form control
like that and if I save it and refresh
now you're going to see that this form
control now goes to the full width is
given some padding and it just looks a
lot nicer so I'm going to do that for
the other one as well just below it so
I'm going to copy that and I'll paste it
here
and we'll save and see what that looks
like okay looking a bit better the next
thing I want to do because everything is
kind of squashed together is assign farm
groups to these elements no farm groups
kind of group together the related
elements in the form okay so this right
here this label and this import they're
related so I put those together in a
farm group and it's going to space them
out a little bit from all the foreign
groups alright so what you need to do to
do that it's just a simple div here with
a class equal to form
- group
and then I'll get that closing div and
just put it at the bottom here like that
and scoot this in a little bit and what
I'm going to do is exactly the same for
this one down here I'll add that label
in there
if farm group and just put the closing
div at the bottom like that let's save
that and take a look at it so far okay
so now you can see those have spread out
a little bit looks a little bit cleaner
and we've still got this mystery div
thing here that's that get rid of that
all right yeah it looks a lot better now
let's group these things together now
this thing here they're both checkboxes
because I want to know which course they
want to go on either ninja of wizard and
these two here they're radio imports so
these belong together and these belong
together so I'm going to place these in
a form group as well I'll copy that
there and I'll put the closing div like
so scoot those in and I'll do exactly
the same for this one put the closing
div at the bottom and I'll also move
those in a little bit save that and
refresh now you can see these are kind
of these are on the line below these
basically alright now what I want to do
is make these look a little bit better
right and to do that I can apply the
inline radio in line or checkbox in line
class and we apply it to the label
itself so I'm just going to give this a
class equal to checkbox because it's a
checkbox in line I'm going to do exactly
the same thing for the one down here I'm
going to save that and refresh I know
they're God just looks a little bit
nicer now spaces it out a torch and
takes away that bold style it's got all
right we'll do the same thing for these
down here we'll add in the class but
this time instead of checkbox it's radio
because these are radio buttons and
we'll copy that
and we'll paste this on this label as
well so what we're making these do is
displays in line really and there we go
that's cool
so now you'll notice we can actually
select both of these right now we don't
want that we want to associate these two
together these two options because they
can't be male and female so to do that
what we need to do is give this a name
give this a name and they have to match
these two inputs so let's give this a
name here and we'll let the name be
gender and let the name here be gender
as well save that and refresh this time
only one can be selected whereas both
can be selected there okay if you want
to do both that's absolutely fine so
last thing we want to do is just stand
up this button down here and remember we
can add these button classes to input
fields so let's give this a class of BTN
that's the global class then we'll make
this button default that's the
contextual class and we have all those
other contextual classes as well like a
button primary or button warning etc we
can use whichever one we want I'm going
to use that one now that looks a little
better as well I could like I say make
this something else like primary and it
will change the style of that button to
blue so whatever we want to use we can
do alright so there we go guys that is
how to make a quick nice-looking form a
lot easier than going into the CSS and
doing this all of ourselves yeah really
cool one of my favorite parts of
bootstrap if you have any questions feel
free to drop a comment down below in
fact before I do go I'm going to show
you one other thing right because I know
some people you see these labels right
here some people don't really like those
being on the form in fact this thing
here needs to change where is it email
label for email there should be a
placeholder somewhere important put
there it is silly me I didn't change
that before let's just refresh okay
that's just me being OCD so let's get
rid of these labels now we don't want to
delete them
that's bad practice because then screen
readers won't be able to read them and
the might not be able to so associate
what these input fields are for know we
want screen readers to see them we just
don't want them to show on desktop
screens like this right so what we can
do is give these a class off and this is
kind of like a global bootstrap class
that we can apply to anything then s are
only and that stands for screen readers
only so if there's any element that we
only want to be viewable for screen
readers we can apply that class too
though so let's give it to that label as
well we need these labels down here
otherwise we won't know what's selected
so I'll save that and let's give this a
quick ugly fresh and this time the
labels go away I like to have the labels
there other people don't so it depends
on your preference but there we go guys
that's how to make a nice clean form
like today any questions leave those
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to share subscribe like whatever and
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
