yo guys what the hell's going on this is
CSS for beginners lesson 30 and today
we're gonna talk all about the font
weight property in CSS that's coming up
Wow all right so before we dive into the
code I just want to take a look at this
sample web page and can you see here
we've got a h1 and it's much bolder bit
chunkier darker than the rest of the
text here would you say and that is the
font weight in action so if I right
click this here and I go to google dev
tools we can see the user-agent
stylesheet that's the default browser
styles and it's got this h1 rule here
and it's giving it a font weight
property of bold so that's what the font
weight property is all about we can
control how chunky if you like or how
dark the the font displays on your web
page Wow okay so we're back here in the
code and we're going to take a look at
the font weight property in more detail
so that h1 we just saw in the browser
we're going to target that and we're
going to overwrite that style that
default browser style and give that a
different font weight so the property
name is font weight which is font - wait
then we'll put a column and then
brackets is giving me all these
different options I'll talk about all
these numbers later on but you can see
down here the keywords bold this is what
we saw in the browser Boulder which to
be honest and nine times out of ten or
even 99 times out of 100 is going to
give you the same effect as Boulder
inherit we've seen all about that before
in the last video just inherits the the
parents elements style for this property
leichter which is going to go to a nice
crisp light thin font and normal so what
we'll do is we'll use this normal
keywords override that default browser
style that we just saw in the browser
and give all of our h1 a normal font
weight so I'm gonna save that and I'm
going to open this up in the browser
okay there we go so now it's no longer
bolder or chunkier it's just normal yeah
it's still bigger and it looks a little
darker than these but that is purely
because of the font size not the font
weight we've lost the chunkiness and the
boldness and the darkness okay so that
font-weight:normal which by the way all
of these PTX
by default have applied to them so now
that we've seen normal we'll look at
something else
we'll look at the P tags and we'll make
these older so font weight : scroll down
for our keywords and we'll go to it
bolder here and we'll save that out open
this up in a browser and there we go
guys we can now see that all of the P
tags here are bold so I'm just going to
jump back again and I'm going to change
this back to normal just to see that all
of our P tags have gone back to the
default state open this back up in
chrome okay yeah cool so there now all
the default normal size of default
normal weights rather so let's look at
this lighter one we saw here that
there's a keyword lighter and that
generally means more crisp or thinner
text okay so we'll save that let's see
what it does in the browser okay doesn't
seem to have done anything if I compare
this window to the window we just had
for normal which is this you can see
absolutely nothing is changing with the
PX now why is that and it's because of
the font family that we're using now the
default font family in my browser is
Times New Roman and that doesn't have a
light option attached to it so that's an
important point
not all fonts have a bold and lighter
version attached to them now
one firm that does have all of those
three attached to it on Windows 8.1 is
called why you gothic why could we call
you gothic I don't know how to
but either way we'll try using that that
way and because there's two words in
this font you have to use these little
quotation marks so it's why you gothic
okay because if we didn't have these
quotes then it wouldn't recognize this
because this space here we have to put
it in quotes because it's two words
alright so let's save that and just to
begin with we're going to change this
back to normal
save that and view it in a browser okay
so now we can see this new font this you
gothic or why you gothic and this is how
the normal font weight looks like so
let's go back and change it to lighter
and open this up again in a browser and
now we can see that it's different if I
switch between this one which is lighter
and this one which is normal you can see
there's a subtle difference okay these
have got a little smaller thinner lines
and they just look a little more
delicate so that's what lighter is all
about let's just see Boulder just to
make sure that this font has all three
and view this in a browser again cool
there we go so this is nice and Bowl now
so just be wary when you're using
certain fonts they don't always have all
three options attached to them now I
said earlier we saw some numbers and
I'll show you those again it's these
things here so they range from 100 right
the way down to 900 now these numbers
which represent how bold the font sees
and 100 would be the lightest and 900
would be the boldest okay now pretty
much nearly every font will not have
values for 200 300 400 500 600 800 and
900 okay you're probably going to get at
best 3 font weights out of all of them
and generally speaking
100 to 300 is in the lighter range 400
600 is in the normal range and 700 to
900 is going to be in a boulder range so
we'll just see what this looks like
we'll go to 100 first of all so this
should be similar to what we saw with
the lighter key word leave it in a
browser and get up there so yet we can
see now these are all lighter and
instead of going back to the code I'm
just gonna inspect the element and I'm
gonna change it in the console here so
I've put 100 there let's change it to
300 see what changes no not changed at
all that's because like I say they don't
have values attached to all of the
numbers so 100 to 300 are generally just
gonna be that lighter range
let's try 500 that should be the kind of
regular range yeah you can see that jump
then it's got the normal font weight to
now and we'll try 900 which is bold so
cool there you see we've got the key
words which are lighter normal and bold
and bolder and bolder bolder by the way
pretty much the same and you've got the
numbers which range from 100 to 900 and
the 100 to 300 range is the lighter
versions 400 to 600 the normal versions
and 700 to 900 the bold versions so that
about covers it for font weight if you
have any questions whatsoever for your
free to throw a comment down below and
I'm gonna answer all of those as soon as
I can otherwise if you enjoy these
