JavaScript on the dumb tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you the
dump content loaded event okay so I just
wanted to finish up on a pretty light
lesson just a quick one about the event
Dom content loaded so at the minute in
our HTML file our script is right at the
bottom here just before the closing body
tag now this is fine everything works on
the page because by the time this script
is executed
most of the Dom is already loaded okay
all these elements are in place so when
we come to attach event listeners to
them we have no problem however if I was
to going to the index file take this
script and then move it up to the top
I'll just place it in the head for
example underneath the title
if I save it now check it out in a
browser if I try to use these delete
buttons they don't work but I've tried
to search for books they don't work if I
tried to hide them nothing works you get
the point nothing on this page works
okay
and that's because by the time the
script runs because the script is
loading in the head first of all when
that runs the Dom is not fully loaded
yet so when we're trying to attach
events to particular elements in the Dom
for example when we're trying to find
the adverb which is document.forms at
book it cannot grab that yet because the
Dom hasn't fully loaded so what's the
answer to this well one of the answers
is just to place a script at the bottom
down here okay because then everything
works as we've seen but sometimes as a
front-end developer you might not always
have the option there might be scripts
in the head and you can edit the script
but you can't change where the output
onto the page so if that's the case what
we can do is use the Dom content loaded
event and that fires when the Dom has
fully loaded and we're ready to start
manipulating it so we can listen for
that event in JavaScript so for example
I could go into this app GS and I could
come to the top and at the top I could
say document
and then we're attaching an event
listener to this document
so we'll say add event listener
and this event will be the Dom content
loaded event so it's capital D om then
content
then loaded so this event is gonna fire
on the document when everything is ready
when the dome is ready to be manipulated
so we only want to do all of these
JavaScript in here once this event has
fired so let's wrap it all in the
callback function that we passed through
here when that event does fire so let's
open this up and then I'm gonna just
grab all of this down here cut it and
paste it inside here and then I'm also
just gonna grab it although I don't need
to scoot it along I think it's automatic
we've done that father cool
it has ok so now everything is wrapped
inside this one event listener and if I
click Save now even though the script
file is still at the top of the page if
we refresh over here now everything
should work because we're not attaching
things to the dom until it's fully
loaded until that Dom content ready your
vent has fired so everything now works
as expected
ok so there we go that is the Dom
content loaded event and how we can use
it to wait until the dom has fully
loaded before we start manipulating the
Dom itself and that's the end of this
series so hope now you can see how much
you can do with the Dom in JavaScript
without using libraries like jQuery and
I hope it will make you think twice
before going out and grabbing the jQuery
library to do manipulations like this
don't forget guys if you enjoy these
