seventh Atmos script six tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
some of the new string methods available
to us in es6 Wow okay gather so I've
made a little comment down here with
sort of the new methods that we're going
to take a look at in es6 and these are
the four I'm gonna show you repeat
starts with ends with and includes and
we're just gonna start with this repeat
method or right here so we can use all
of these methods on string instances and
the repeat method basically lets us just
repeat a string over and over and over
and over as many times as we want so
let's just create a string to begin with
so I'll say var STR equals and I'm gonna
set it equal to groovy
like that okay so now all we need to do
is say console.log I'm gonna take this
string STR dot repeat and then I'm gonna
say how many times I want this to repeat
in fact I'm gonna put a little space in
there so that we don't get it all right
next to each other when we repeat so I
want this to repeat five times and if i
refresh then we agree we groove really
groove etc however many times we say so
that's nice and simple right and if you
want we can do this a hundred times and
that is just going to fill out console
window right there cool okay so that's
pretty simple the next method I want to
show you is this starts with method so
if I just create a variable called
string as equal to goodbye we can check
whether this string starts with a
certain series of characters so I could
say well check whether the string starts
with is it good for example okay so all
I'll do is console got log STR and let's
say starts with and specify what I want
it to check that it starts with which is
it good like so refresh that and we get
true so this returns a boolean to us and
it sound they're going to be true or
false depending on whether it says yet
it does start with that or nope it
doesn't start with that if I say it
starts with
bye and refresh then I'm gonna get false
because it doesn't start with bye okay
we can pass through another parameter to
this method and this parameter is the
position at which we want to start
checking so say for example we want to
start checking at in this position
that's the zero one two three fourth
position right so I could say for start
checking there click refresh now I get
true because we're saying okay check if
it starts with by from this start
position I've specified or right here
all right so we can do the same thing
with ends with I'm just gonna say ends
with by I'm going to take out the second
parameter for now and click Save refresh
and I get it true because it does end
with a by but if I say does it end with
good and it says false okay now with
this we can also you know supply another
parameter which says where you want it
to kind of start from going backwards so
we could say something like STR dot
length minus three and it's going to
start from like this position going
backwards and save that and now we get
true okay because we've gone in three
and now it does end with it good pretty
cool right so they are these two methods
right here starts with and ends with I'm
just going to do a little example of how
would you theis not maybe how we use
these but something a little more fun
than just console dot logging true or
false
so what I want to do is create another
variable again and I'm going to call
this variable that you say set that
equal to goodbye
and then what I'm gonna do is a little
if statement to check whether this
starts with goodbye so I'll say if you
say dot starts with
goodbye which it does then I'm gonna
execute this code block and I'm gonna
create a new variable called I say I'm
gonna set that equal to hello
so what it's going to do is check
whether this string right here you say
starts with a goodbye which it does so
that it's going to create a new variable
called I say and set that equal to
hello so let's load this now to the
console I'm going to say console dot log
I'm going to use those template strings
that we learnt in the last tutorial so I
use the pack tips first of all and I'll
say you say and then use the variable
substitution to grab this variable right
here you say and I'm gonna say I say and
then use this variable right here like
that I say and then if I save that
refresh over here usig by I say on
define okay that's not what I wanted and
the error is this capital or right here
so now if I save it it's gonna return
true here you say goodbye I say hello
all right pretty cool so that was just a
quick example of how you can use that
kind of thing within if statements to
check whether something actually starts
with a particular phrase or ends with so
the last method I want to show you is
includes and that's very similar to
start with or ends with except you don't
need to check the start or the end of
the sentence or the string we just check
the entire string to see if it contains
that series of letters that you're
specifying so let's create a new
variable and I'll just say test I'm
gonna say that equal to my name is Ryu
and what include he's gonna do is just
check for this name right here so I'm
gonna say console.log and I'm gonna say
test dots includes and then I'm going to
look for name which isn't at the start
and isn't at the end but it doesn't
matter because we using this includes so
let's save that and a reef
and we get true if I change this to
names save it and refresh now we get
false all right so that guys is the new
methods available tools in four strings
in es6 any questions whatsoever feel
