thirteenth angular2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about two-way
data-binding
alright so in the last two videos we've
taken a look at data binding we take a
look at property binding and also invent
binding and in each case the binding was
one way either from the group's
component class to the component view or
from the component view via an event to
the component class so in one direction
only but we can actually do two-way data
binding in which case the data is
updated in both directions and I'm going
to show you what that means now so I'm
just in the home component and I'm going
to define an object in this class and
the object name is going to be ninja and
I'm going to set this equal to an object
which has two properties first of all
the name property and I'm going to call
that Yoshi for now and then I'll also do
a belt property and I'm going to set
this equal to black okay so now I want
to output this dude and these two
properties in the view so we know we can
do that via string interpolation so
let's just save this component class and
head over to the view and let's output
those properties right here so double
curly braces then ninja name and then
I'm going to copy this and paste it down
below and this time we'll do ninja belt
so if I save this now and refresh over
here then hopefully we should see the
name which is Yoshi and also the belt
color which is black and there we go
Yoshi and black but what I want to do is
give the user the opportunity to change
these values and when they change them I
want these values to update on the page
and for that we're going to need to way
data binding so what I can do here is
add an input field and then I'm going to
use ng model here the way we do that is
by a square bracket then a normal
parenthesis and say ng model this is how
we use two-way data-binding and what
we're doing is we're defining a model to
which certain data will bind to right
and the model is just a property like
this or some kind of variable that we've
defined
so I'm going to set this ng-model equal
to ninja name so I'll say ninja name and
then whenever a user adds text to this
input field what will happen is the
ninja name property on the component
class will update with whatever the user
has put into this input field okay so
that's one way data binding we're going
to the component and then in turn what
will happen once this has been updated
is that this will update anywhere where
the name is output onto the view so it's
gone back into the view so that's
two-way data-binding down what's going
from the view to the component then from
the component class to the view okay so
let's give this a whirl let's save that
and come over and refresh okay so now we
have that input field and by default it
says Yoshi and that's because this name
field right here is defined in the
component class which adds it here to
begin with this is the default value if
you like but when we update this if I
delete it and I say Shawn then you'll
notice this now updates as well on the
fly okay so that's two-way data-binding
in action I'm updating the model here
which is this property and then this
property is being updated here in the
component class and then in turn once
this is updated it updates anywhere
where that property is I'll put onto the
view as well so we could have this twice
and it would update both of them so if I
save this I'll refresh and then if I
change this again to sure you'll see it
updates on each case where it's
outputting the view pretty cool right so
let's just do one more for the belt so
I'll copy that dude and paste it down
below
and this time we'll say belt I'm just
going to put a little couple of labels
in so we know way to what so label here
is the rename and then dab it long
another label for belt save that and
let's try this okay so first of all
we've got the name which I've changed to
Shore and then we'll change the belt to
red and you'll see the belt update as
well so this is to wait
