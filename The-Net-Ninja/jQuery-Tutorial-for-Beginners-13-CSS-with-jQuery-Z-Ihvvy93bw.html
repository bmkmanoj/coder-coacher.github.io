jQuery for beginners lesson 13 and in
this video we're gonna take a look at
how we can control the CSS using jQuery
Wow all right then gang so there's gonna
be times when you're designing websites
that you want to change the CSS
properties of certain elements on your
web page on the fly for example if you
click a button you might want it to
animate in some way or other now to do
this you're going to want to use the CSS
method that jQuery provides us with and
it's pretty simple but there's a few
different ways we can use it so I'm
going to show you a couple of different
ways we can do that now now the first
thing I'm going to show you is how to
check the value of CSS properties
already given to certain elements okay
so we can do that by first of all
grabbing an element on the page I'm
going to do this one right here social
now so I'll do my domicile and in
brackets I'm gonna say I'm going after
the social now ID and then I'm gonna say
CSS that's the method name and then
within brackets all I need to do to
check the value of a property is put at
the property name in quotation marks so
the property name I want to check is d
position property and what I'm gonna do
is log this to the console so I'll write
console log so that we can see the value
down here when we refresh I'll save that
refresh and now we can see the value is
relative so it's got position:relative
cool I can also check and no third
property my top which is top I'll press
save and refresh and this time I get
minus 4 pixels cool so that's how we
check the value of a certain property
already given to that element now what
if you want to change it well all we
have to do is pass through and norther
value into this CSS method first of all
we Sayed the property we want to change
which is top then a comma and then we
pass through the value loop we want it
to be now I'm going to say change it for
all - 42 - 200 pixels press save
and this time you can see is scooted or
right up here I said console dot log
which is why it's logged this element
too
console we don't need that anymore I'm
gonna take that off save again just
refresh to make sure it still worked
and yet it's up here you can see now
that it was down here and it's zoomed
all the way up here that's because we've
give it this top of property of - future
pixels now we can chain these together
and we can do multiple different
properties I could say dot CSS again and
I'll give it a left property which
doesn't currently exist and then I'll
set this equal to 100 pixels so I'll
save this refresh over here and now you
can see it's moved to the right a little
bit okay so we can do this as many times
as we want I could say dot CSS and put
another property value pair in and this
is chaining in action which we've
already learned about so we can do this
on and on and on five six times if you
want but if you're going to change quite
a lot of values this is soon gonna
become quite tedious and hard to read
right it's not the best way of doing it
yeah if you choose you one or two values
it's fine but if you changing quite a
lot of values a better way to do it
would be to pass through an object to
the CSS method so let's delete all this
first of all and this right here between
the parentheses is where we would pass
the object with all those properties and
family pairs now just recap it back to
vanilla JavaScript if we were to create
an object in store it in a variable
would say something like X but my object
equals and then the shorthand for the
object is this notation right here the
curly braces and then what we do within
here is pop all of our property names
like height then the colon and then a
value which is I don't know 40 comma
next property would be speed and then
coal along the volumes can be hundred
etc so this is how we would write an
object in JavaScript right now if we
didn't store this in a variable this
object it would essentially look like
this right the object itself would look
like that
so this is the portion this is the whole
object that we'd pass in to the CSS
method so if we copy that off
cut it rather and paste it within here
that is how we would lay out our object
within the CSS method okay now obviously
height and speed are not CSS properties
so we can change these let's change the
top the height sorry to top because that
is a CSS property and we'll change this
to minus 4 bunch of pixels and we'll
change this one to left and we'll change
that to 150 pixels well add another or
say and opacity and we'll change this to
not point 5
darrel add another will say boarder top
whoops I will give a value of 4 pixels
solid and red to that and I think that
will do for now but we can go on and add
as many as we want downwards like this
and I think you'll agree that this is a
lot easier to maintain its laid out more
like CSS is laid out so if another
developer comes into your code or if you
go back to your code yourself it's gonna
be much easier to kind of maintain or
change all right
so let's save that now and refresh right
over here and now we can see right here
we've got a board the top of red we've
got the opacity kicking in which is why
it's kind of like opaque and then we've
got the left and top properties applied
let's just double check by inspecting
the element and go to the UL which is
right here and we can see all of these
Styles have been applied to that element
all right so that is the CSS method guys
if you have any questions about it
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise I'm gonna see you
in the next video where we're going to
take a look at the class methods so
until then if you like these videos
