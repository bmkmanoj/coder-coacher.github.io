24th PSD to WordPress tutorial and in
this video we're going to go through the
search template Wow are they guys so in
the last tutorial we made this page the
archive dot PHP which displays the pages
for things like the November link or the
category links whichever archive we land
on is going to look something like this
right however if we search for something
on the website let's just say hello
because hello world then the design is a
lot different at the minute and that's
because the search results page is not
an archive page it doesn't use that
archived PHP template it uses a template
called search PHP and that's the
template we're going to concentrate on
this tutorial so we can get this looking
a lot better
alright so I've got it open right here
in brackets and it is very much the same
as the other template files very similar
we get the header down in the section
and the main then we've got all this bit
here which is outputting the page title
dynamically by using these WordPress
functions then we've got the loop which
is outputting all the different content
for the different search results and it
uses this template part content and
search which we know is this and this is
outputting a lot of different dynamic
information as well like when it was
posted and the excerpt and the footer of
the entry all that kind of stuff we
don't need to worry about these
functions all you need to know is that
they're doing their job that output in
what we want for the search page ok just
looks little bits of information about
those posts so we don't need to do much
with this at all because that's just the
information but we are going to go back
into this search dot PHP page and we're
just going to add in a couple of divs
the wrapper and we're going to move that
sidebar over to the right well just to
match the other post pages that we've
done right and by the way all of these
functions like let me go in here again
content search all these different
things and if you come across one you
want to know what that does all you have
to do is either copy and paste this into
Google and it'll come up or just go on
the WordPress codex website and look for
this function
and it's gonna tell you what it does
okay and then you can use it where if
you like in your template files so I'll
leave the link by the way to that codex
down below just in case you want to go
off and check these because I know I've
been talking about all these different
functions and that we don't need to
change them and however you know I'm not
going to go into depth about what they
all do in this tutorial that's far too
many of them so and we'll leave that
link down below you can go ahead and
read about them and I'm gonna go over
the important ones and I've already gone
off for a few so far and so anyway let's
go back to this search PHP we've got all
the loop here outputting the posts right
then we've got the header we just need
to contain all this in a div so we can't
put it on the Left right and remember
that div is an ID of post content so
what I'm gonna do is first of all do our
wrapper so I'll say div ID or note ID
div class equals or wrapper just like
that and then I'll take the end div and
I'll paste it down here at the bottom
okay and then I'm gonna do another div
called post content this is an ID
I remember we already made this ID in
the previous template files so we don't
need to restyle any of this and just
reusing the same one will end that here
okay and then right about here I'm gonna
do the div with an ID of sidebar because
we're gonna put our sidebar here we're
gonna float the sidebar to the right all
this stuff is gonna be floated to the
left let's grab this dynamic sidebar PHP
function and drop it in there so that
all the sidebar stuff is gonna appear
within this div all right so let's save
that now and take a look at it in a
browser once again let's refresh all
right and this is looking a lot better
much like our archive page now so all
the search results are gonna go there if
I type something here which doesn't make
sense
like a young neon or whatever then this
is going to read
returned this little search form here
again let's say that nothing has been
matched all right so that looks good as
well so very much like the archive pages
hello so this is the archive page and
this is the search results page so very
similar so we've got that kind of
continuity through the website all right
then go so we also wanted to show you
this for a for dot PHP file and this is
the template file which gets loaded up
when you visit a URL on your website
that doesn't exist all right so say we
go to the home page and then we say
forward slash give me me or somewhere
stupid like that then we know that page
doesn't exist we're gonna get this 404
page instead and the 404 PHP template
file is what renders this okay so let's
take a look at that alright now first of
all I just want to scoot that over here
so we can go through it step by step I'm
gonna show you what's in this file so
first of all we've got the header at the
top standard then we've got this div in
the main oops let's get that back up and
then down here we've got the page title
which is here and we've got this little
bit of page content which is this
sentence then we've got this little
search form function and in WordPress
that's really useful so whenever you
want to use WordPress ease in built
search form functionality you don't have
to write a new form out in your HTML or
anything like that you just write this
simple function get search form and
that's gonna place this thing right
there for you then we can go in the CSS
and we can style this baby up however we
want so that's really cool then below
that it's gonna grab the widget and this
is another function it's going to grab a
widget from the backend of WordPress and
we'll talk about widgets later but in
this instant it's gonna get the recent
posts and display those there we've only
got one at the minute that's hella well
underneath that we're going to do a
quick check to see if we've got
categories in our blog and what this is
doing is gonna show us a list of all the
categories if the widget has multiple
categories right so it's only gonna show
them if you have them and down here is
where we actually show the categories
this function down here is called WP
list categories right and whenever we
use that function it's going to list the
categories in our WordPress setup
Flores on that page okay now it's got a
few different properties in here passes
through an array into the function you
have to worry too much about the cold
but know that it passes through a few
different properties alright and I
wanted to show you on the WordPress
codex what these things do so at the
WordPress codex and it's looking at
these WP list categories of functions
and it says it displays a list of
categories as link so that's what this
is doing and if we go down here this is
how we use it WP list categories and we
pass through this X variable and this
egg's variable it's just an array which
like we've got here we've not passed all
of these properties through to this
array just a few of them but we can pass
through as many as we like and the
parameters or properties are down here
okay so we don't know what one of these
things means or you want to insert some
new ones you can take a look at this to
see which things do what okay so the
first one we've got is order by which is
here and that determines how we're going
to order the categories so if we've got
five categories how we're going to order
them and you can pass through any things
here it says here sort categories
alphabetically by ID by the count and
these the values you can pass in we're
ordering and by the counts are the ones
with the most accounts are going to be
at the top and that's because of this
thing here order so go down to odd it
can be ASC or des see now this stuff's
for descending
this stands for ascending descending
means it's gonna show the ones with the
most posts at the top ascending means
that it would start with the ones with
the least post and go up all right
so we're doing it by count and it's
gonna be descending so this show count
down here is this one and this toggles
the display of the current counts of
posts in each category so say we want to
show how many posts we've got in the
meat category we put a little brackets
next to it I'll say 5 right so that's
one meaning that this is true okay so
one second you can see here if we pass
one through to this it means true every
passes a row it means false so we seem
true we want to show how many posts are
in that particular category in brackets
right next one is this title l-i which
is down here
somewhere there it is and here it says
we can set the title and style of the
outer list item default to categories if
present book empty which is what we are
so it's going to default the title of
this list above the list itself is going
to default to categories but we can
specify our own one there if we want it
to alright the next one is number which
is here and it says it sets the
categories number of categories to
display so we're gonna show ten
categories that's all this is
alright so let's go further down in this
page I hope you understand that a little
bit better now after that we've got the
end of then we've got the archived
content itself try looking in the
monthly archives then it's gonna put
forward another widget which is the
archived widget and it's going to have a
drop-down menu for that so that thing is
this right here
alright and then after that we've got
the tag cloud currently there's none
there because we don't have any tags
going on in our WordPress setup but if
we ask so then it would show them there
all right so that's another widget as
well like I will talk about those
widgets a little bit later on when we
come up with it so that is what the 404
page is doing that's how it's about
putting all that information now it
couldn't looks a little bit ugly we want
all this stuff in the middle instead of
well wittle left so all we really need
to do is add in that wrapper so I'm
gonna do that one roundabout here when I
say div id equals Rutter and I'll say
that closing tag and I'll just pop it
right at the bottom of the content is it
gonna be after the main is before the
main and is it before the section no
it's after the section okay around about
there just like that we'll save it and
view this in a browser once more give it
a minute and this still doesn't work
perfect
why is that that's because we've used an
ID and pop plus all right because in the
CSS we've used a class to style that
wrapper not an ID so let's review this
one more time and boom that is done okay
so that's what happens if your users
visit a page that is not on your website
if you wanted to you could put a funky
here a lot of companies do that with
some cool cartoon saying it made mistake
Costel this how you want you can just
right-click and inspect the elements to
find out which classes and ID's they're
using for example this widget title of
search which is a class of search form
you can style this how are you won by
finding out the classes and ID's right
here and what I normally do is just go
into sources find the style and I just
pop the CSS here copy and paste it all
like that control a control C and then
pop it right back in the style dot CSS
here paste it in there alright so that
is the search page covered and the 404
page covered it's been a bit of a
lengthy tutorial but I hope these are
more obvious to you know what they do
you have any questions whatsoever feel
