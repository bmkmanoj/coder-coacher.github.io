sixth of UX tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk about how we can use
mutations to change the data on the
store all right there so for the sake of
this tutorial I want to introduce you to
vgs dev tools which is really good for
debugging view j s applications
especially when you're using view x so
what you want to do is go to this link
i'm going to leave it down below and
click this add to chrome' it's going to
add it to your Chrome browser for you
then once it's installed if you go to a
website which is using that v UJ s then
this icon will color green like the view
icon and you'll be able to open up the
dev tools and click on this view tab at
the top okay so this pane right here is
going give us information about this
application such as the different
components we have app then we have got
this one product is - and we can see the
different data we using in each of these
different components so it's really cool
and we're going to use that in a minute
so once you've got that installed let us
now come over here and I want to talk
about how we'd make changes to our data
which is on the store how would we
change these products for example taking
one of the price of each item well I
guess what we could do is edit it
directly so we could place a button and
I mean product list one component here
by the way I'm going to place a button
right here first of all and this button
is going to have an event attached to it
and the way we do that is by seeing V -
on then it's going to be a click event
and we're going to set that equal to
some kind of function or some kind of
method that we're going to define down
here in a minute we're going to call
that method reduce price like so and the
text is also going to be reduced price
okay so now we need to define this
method right here down below in this
component object so after computed
property the letters come down here and
say methods and then within the methods
we want to define a method called
reduced price now the end of this
function right here is to edit the data
in the store directly and reduce the
price of all the items
want to say okay so how would we do this
well first of all this is a function an
inside this function we can access the
state on the store so I can say this dot
state or state dot product and then
we're going to do something with it I'm
going to use the for each method right
so we can use this on a race and it
cycles through the array and perform
some kind of action on each element in
the array so each item so each time we
go through the array and we cycle
through it we get access to that
individual item which is a single
product right and I'm using the flat
error function here by the way so we'll
add this arrow and then the function
itself and what we're going to do inside
here is we're going to take that product
and we're going to access the price
property on that product and we're going
to set it equal to minus 1 of what it
already was so we're saying minus equals
which means take one away from the so we
don't need a minus here take one away
from the current price okay so that's
what we're doing there so if I save this
now let's view this in a browser so now
we can see this button down here reduce
price and then we click on this we can
see it goes down time not point five but
that's just because we've got the sale
items on and it's reducing everything by
50% so even though we're taking one away
from the data it's actually showing it's
not 0.5 okay so this is working its
final and it's updating down here as
well and what we're doing right now is
we're editing directly the store data
but this is not the best way to do it
and it's not the best way to do it
because when it comes to debugging we
don't really know if which is using it
on the front end which function right
now or which method is actually making
this deduction we can't associate it
with any method in our application yeah
we know ourselves because we just added
this right here but if another developer
was to come here they wouldn't
necessarily know it's not great for
debugging this so what we tend to do
instead is use what are known as
mutations okay and these mutations are
responsible for editing the state
changing the data and they can be
tracked
unlike this thing right here which is
not being trapped right because we're
not tracking it here in the development
tools a mutation can be tracked so as a
developer when we're debugging an
application we can associate or
attribute a certain change to a
particular mutation we can see where
that change is coming from so how do we
make these mutations well first of all
what I'm going to do is copy this drunk
right here because we're going to use
this in a minute I'm going to also
comment it out because we don't want to
make that change any more from with
inside of this component instead we want
to define this mutation on these store
itself okay so underneath the guesses
I'm going to make another property
called mutations this is an object and
unsightly we can have as many different
mutations as we need again we're going
to call this reduce price and again this
takes the state as an argument using a
faster affliction right here and inside
this function what do we want to do what
we want to do this again we want to
change the product and again we don't
need to save Vista store because we have
access to the state directly this pasta
was hit so we can say state dot products
stop for each take the product each time
around and reduce it by one ok the price
so we're doing the same thing here in
this mutation we're accessing it from
the store and we're reducing the data on
the state ok now this right here can be
tracked in this pane right here okay so
it's much better for debugging and just
a general good practice when you're
developing a view X application so let's
save this now and before this is done we
need to go back into product list one
and we need to call that mutation from
here ok we need to commit it that's what
we call it committing a mutation so when
someone clicks on this button right here
they're activating this method and from
here we're going to say okay I want you
to commit a mutation
I want this mutation over here to fight
this which is private mutation ok so
inside here we can below
we can say this dot store.com it's for
committing mutations and what is the
mutation we want to commit it is the
reduced-price mutation okay because
that's the name we gave to this mutation
on the store right here so now this
should work the same if we click on this
button right here then it's going to
fire this events reduce price which is
then going to say okay this dot store
don't emit a mutation and the mutation I
want to commit is this reduced price
mutational right here which is going to
reduce the price of each item by one so
let's save everything now and let's view
this in a browser I'm just going to
refresh and now when I click reduce
price it's still working everything's
still fine but this time if I go to view
X this pile right here and refresh then
what's going to happen is we're going to
see as we click reduce price we can see
which mutation is performing that okay
now if I was to comment this out and go
back to the old way of just editing the
data directly from here if i refresh
over here and then click reduce price we
see we're not tracking it over here we
don't know which function or which
method is reducing the price we only see
that and it's only trapped when we use
this method instead in fact I want to
show you something else if we go to the
store and we want to use strict mode you
can say down here strict is true okay if
we restrict mode when we're using a view
X then it won't even stand for this
direct editing very fresh now and go to
the console if I try to reduce the price
and get an error it says do not retake
view X store stay outside mutation
handlers so it doesn't want us to handle
these changes outside of the store so it
wants us to do this thing right down
here at this mutation okay
so again let's go back now and let's go
to listing and comment out again
so instead we're committing a mutation
refresh over here and this time if we do
surprise we're not getting any error
whatsoever and we're also able to track
the states in this view pane as well
which is really cool so that's why we
use mutations to edit the data on the
store rather than editing it directly
