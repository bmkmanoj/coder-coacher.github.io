3 tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk a little bit about variable
scope okay so what I'm talking about
scope I'm talking about the scope of a
variable and the scope defines the area
of the zone that a variable can be
accessed in and it's going to be
something that you will run into at some
point so I thought why not let's do a
tutorial on so I think the best way to
explain this kind of scope is to go
through an example so what I'm going to
do is create a variable first of all
called my underscore name and set this
equal to array and then I'm also going
to define a function and this is going
to call print underscore name and the
sole purpose of this function is to
print out a name to demonstrate this
scope behavior so we're going to print
out a string which will say the name
inside the function is and then we're
going to tack on the name so my
underscore name so what output in this
name right here when we call a function
now outside of the function I also want
to do another print statement to say
what the name is outside of the function
so I'll say print and then I'm going to
say outside the function
the name is and then again check on my
name okay so we also want to call this
function because otherwise it's not
going to print anything out so I'm going
to copy that I'm going to paste it just
a book in so we're going to call this
function first print this statement and
then it's going to print this statement
so let's save it and run it
it's called scope dot py so run that and
it says the name inside the function is
Rio and outside the function the name is
right as well so in both cases were
accessing this variable and that's fine
and this variable is what's known as a
global scope variable meaning we can
access it from inside functions and from
outside the functions because it's
defined on the top level is defined
outside of the function therefore it's
global right but what happens if we
define this variable from with inside
this function well let's save it and run
find out so I'm going to run this file
again and we get an error and it says my
name is not defined and it's referring
to this instance of my name right here
when we output it outside of the
function because this now has local
scope we've defined it within a function
which means it's only available and
accessible in that function it has local
scope so we can't print it out out here
because we don't have access to it so
let's just remove that again and paste
it at the top and now what if we maybe
inside the function that want to
override this my name variable what's
going to happen then well let's try it
I'm going to say my name is equal now to
Yoshi
so this right here is going to override
my name but is it going to override it
globally so that down here is well
outside of the function it's updated to
Yoshi or if you're just going to
override it locally well let's find out
we're going to save it and run this
again and you can see inside the
function we get Yoshi and outside the
function we get Ryu
so this is only overriding it locally we
created this local scoped version of
this variable here so it's not going to
have an effect on this global one here
so what if we did want to override a
global one from within a function well
what we could do is we could say global
first of all and then the name of the
variable my name that we want to
override if you like so now when we
redefine this variable we're really
finding it on the global my name because
we've said we're using the global my
name there
so now if I save this and run it once
more you can see the inside the function
we need Yoshi and outside the function
we also get Yoshi so now we've added
this statement in global my name we're
overriding the global variable right
here so that when we come outside the
function and run this print statement
again my name is now updated to whatever
we sign it ragging all right so there we
go just a little tutorial on skull
because I think it will come up at some
point and it's one of those things that
if you don't know what's going on then
it will still get so in the next
tutorial we're going to move on now to
another data type called dictionaries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
