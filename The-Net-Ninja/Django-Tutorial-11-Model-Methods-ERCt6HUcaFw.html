11th django tutorial and in this video
we'll take a look at model methods okay
then so everything is looking pretty
good so far we've got our article list
right here and we're dynamically output
in those different articles in our
database on this page which is really
awesome but for each article so far
we've only done a little bit of content
so I want to go through an example where
we've got a lot of content in the
article and then creating a method
within this model just to show a little
snippet of that article because we don't
always want to show the full article on
an article listing page so to do that
I'm going to head over to the admin
section first of all which is one slash
had been forward slash and then in here
we're going to go through two articles
and we're going to create another
article
and this can be called whatever you want
let's just call it test the roof and the
slope can be test a room as well all
right let's just copy and paste a load
of junk in here this is just lorem ipsum
and i'm going to save that so now if we
go to forward slash articles again we
should see that on the front page as
well and we do like I said we don't want
to show all of this on the article
listing page with maybe just like to
show a hundred characters and then when
you click on the link it shows you the
full article then that's typically how a
blog works right or some blogs at least
so to do that what we're going to have
to do is create a model method that is a
method inside this model which is going
to cut down at content do some kind of
snippet and return a snippet that we can
show on the home page or rather the
article page right
so much like we made a function right
here we can make another function I'm
going to call this snippet so I'll say
def snip it and what this is gonna do is
take self which is the instance of the
article that's going to be using this
snippet function okay and then we'll
return self dot body which is this thing
right here
alright I remember we're showing the
body on the article listing page this is
what we're showing at the minute but
what we want to do is cut this body down
to size so that it's maybe 50 characters
long okay so to do that we're going to
use
this which is saying okay well take the
first 50
it's like saying from zero to 50 but we
don't need to put the zero in because if
we don't put it in it implies it's from
the start of the whole string so we'll
go from the very start of the string up
to the fiftieth character and we're
getting those 50 characters and that's
what we return it so now if I save this
and then head over to the actual
template instead of outputting the
article body what we can do is output
the snippet of each article so when
we're going through this fallish right
here we're saying for article in
articles and for each article we're
outputting the article title article
body at an article date well for each
article instead of outputting the body
we're gonna say article snippet right
now we don't need to call it as a
function or anything like that we just
say article dot snippet and what that's
gonna do is run this thing over here and
return this to us so it's grabbing the
body but just the first 50 characters
make sense so let's save this and a
refresh over here and now we just get
the first 50 characters of this body
thing over here and that's more in line
with what I want for this blog so that
if we do have a shitload of content in
one of the articles then it's only going
to show a little snippet of it now I
also maybe want to put a little dot on
the end there to say look this is
continuing it's not the end of the
article it's not only 50 characters long
so let's do that let's go into this
function again and we're just going to
concatenate on using the plus sign a
little string which is dot dot okay so
it's the first 50 characters plus dot
dot at the end so every refresh now we
can see that we get the first 50
characters Oh
dot obviously in the first one there's
no content so we're just getting dot dot
really exciting post alright so that my
friends is how we can create a model
method like this and then output the
return value of that model method inside
our template dead simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
