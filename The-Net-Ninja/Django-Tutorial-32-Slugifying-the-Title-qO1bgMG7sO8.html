your very last django tutorial and in
this video I'd like to show you one more
thing so I'm on the article create
screen at the minute and I want to show
you how we can automatically populate
this slug field dependent on what we
type here so if I type hello world for
example it comes back here and says
hello - world okay so we have this -
instead of the space and if it was
capitals in here we remove the
capitalization that kind of thing to
generate this automatic slug for you so
this is not Django code we're going to
be using in this tutorial just a bit of
JavaScript and if you don't understand
this I would recommend you to check out
either my JavaScript for beginners
tutorial on my JavaScript Dom tutorial
okay so I am going to assume you do know
a little bit about JavaScript to do this
tutorial so I've already created this
sluggy 5ks file in the assets folder
we're going to create our javascript
there and i've linked this up to the
article creation template right here
because that's this page where we want
to use it so the first thing we need to
do inside this slug if ijs file is to
grab a hold of this field right here and
this input field and store them in
constants because we're gonna manipulate
those fields in this tutorial so let's
store them both in a constant we'll call
the first one title and then input set
that equal to documents dot query select
all and inside here we want to look for
the input which has a name property
equal to title so if we right click over
here then you're going to see that this
input field has a name property of title
so we're going to grab that one right
here likewise this one has a name equal
to slug so we can equally just as easy
grab that so let's copy this thing
change it to slug input and then this
will be name equals slug alright so now
we have those two fields the next thing
I'd like to do is add an event listener
to this thing of here because when you
use the types in here that's when we
want to do the work we want to list
for that event and then populate this
field
so we'll say title import which is the
title field they'll be typing into dot
add event listener to add this event
listener the event we want to listen to
is the key op event and the cube event
is when the user presses a button then
lift the key op that is the cube event
all right so we're listening for that
event when that event occurs we're gonna
fire a callback function which takes the
event and this is an arrow function and
inside this function
we'd like to later on kind of slug if I
whatever is typed in here so if I type
in you know a bloody blind block it's
going to solidify that into some kind of
slug with hyphens so I'm going to
externalize this functionality into a
separate function so let's create a new
constant called slug if I and this will
be a function or a function again which
takes in a parameter Val and this value
will be the value of this thing right
here when it's cold so it's going to
take this value and inside the function
oops
when it can tab correctly inside the
function we'd like to take that value
and slug if I it so we're going to
return the solidified version at the end
of this or I'll say return then the
vowel which is passed through then we're
going to make sure that this is a string
by saying to string then we'll say dots
to lower case to make sure all the
capitals are reduced to lowercase then
we're going to trim any white space okay
so that's why it space from the ends
then what we'd like to do is a couple of
replace methods and we're going to use
reg X here so we're going to use reg X
to look for certain characters and then
replace them with different things so
for example if a user types in here and
ampersand sign like that then we're
going to replace that with instead
- and - okay because it's more
appropriate for a URL as well as other
things as well such as removing spaces
on non word characters so we'll say dot
replace and this first one is going to
be replacing the and signs so say /then
and then /g
then it's gonna be replaced with - and -
so that's the first one done let's just
do a little comment here - say replace
and with - and so we know what that does
now the next one replace is going to
replace all the spaces non-word
characters and dashes and it's going to
replace all of those with a single - so
inside here we want /then you square
brackets then inside we want backslash s
then backslash capital w then - and then
outside of the square bracket it's going
to be a plus sign then /g so that is
going to be replaced with a - and by the
way this might be confusing if you don't
know much about regular expressions and
if you don't don't worry I'm gonna do a
whole series of regular expressions in
the near future so stay tuned for that I
did cover regular expressions a little
bit in previous tutorials in this series
as well so feel free to skip back if you
want to refresh you on those so what
this is doing right here is replaces
spaces non-word cars and dashes with a
single - okay so we're doing all that
now and we're returning it when we call
this function so we're taking this value
in we're turning it into a slug by doing
all this replaced off and turning it to
lowercase and trimming it on all that
jazz and we're returning the slug okay
so we pass a value in we get a value out
so now every time there's a key event we
want to pass a value in whatever that
value of this title is and then return a
value to us so that we can input it into
this slug field automatically so the way
we're going to do that is by saying slug
input which is this thing down here
we're going to grab that and we're going
to set an attribute on this and the
attribute we want to set is the value
attribute which is just whatever is
inside it here and that value is going
to be slug if I which is the function
we're calling that and we're going
passing a value which is title in pots
dots value so every time now there is a
keep event on this thing over here so
now now now now it's going to take this
value it's going to run it through this
slug if I function return it to us and
it's going to set the attribute the
value attribute of this thing to that
value makes sense so let's save this now
and give it a whirl cross your fingers
and if I type in Hale o world then you
can see that this makes it into a slug
and if I do something like where's Yoshi
then it's going to turn it into this
thing right here and yet it's not
perfect but you get the general idea you
can tweak this to your own satisfaction
so there we go that is how we can
solidify our values and automatically
create these URLs for the user so I
really hope the friends you've enjoyed
this Django tutorial and I will be doing
other things with Django as we go
forward a lot of you have mentioned
flask in this series and it's something
I'm gonna be looking at as well so yeah
I hope you've enjoyed this and that you
have learnt something at least if you do
like the videos please my friends do not
forget to share subscribe and like that
really means a lot and I'm gonna see you
in the very next tutorial series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
