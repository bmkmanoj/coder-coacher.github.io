sixth PSD to responsive website tutorial
and in this video we're gonna start
styling up the header of our document
Wow alright then go so this is what the
website currently looks like in the
browser and all I did to get this was
click this little lightning bolt icon
right there it gives me a live preview
of the website so as I make changes on
the Left they automatically update on at
the right so this is what it looks like
in the browser at the minute pretty
crappy so what we need to do is apply
some style to this so it looks a bit
better so I'm gonna jump over to this
empty style dot CSS file and the first
thing I'm gonna do is to use the
universal selector to grab every element
on the page remember that's what the
universal selector does it grabs every
single element and it applies a specific
rule to each one of them so it overrides
any default browser styles applied to
them and we're going to give every
element a font family of trebuchet and
that's okay I think a spotlight
trebuchet ms' yet which is a web safe
fonts and it kind of matches this font
here and this one here so it's not
identical to the font in the PSD but
this tutorial playlist is not going to
be about web fonts that's for another
playlist in the future okay so that's
all I want to do for every single
element that I'm just gonna do a couple
of rules which is going to be global as
well so this is going to target all the
bodies throw the bow track all the URLs
and all the Li tags and I'm going to
strip off the margin because that
automatically comes with the body and a
good get rid of the padding that comes
with you else as well so we'll set the
padding amount into each one of those
elements to be zero next I just want to
apply a color to all the font on the web
page as well so I'm going to say P Li h1
h2 h3 and h4 and I'm going to give those
a color of 444 E and that's like a
darkish great color like that
alright so the next thing I want to do
is give the body a background of a
really light grey because it will look
in the PSD this background right here
which is going to be the body is f 7 f
7f 7 so I want to apply that background
color to the body itself so I'll say
body and then the background is gonna be
hash f7 f7 f 7 okay so just to sort of
change but we may as well do it and then
what I'm gonna do is style up that will
wrapper class and remember the wrapper
is the thing that keeps everything
within a central 1200 pixel column so if
we look at it currently it's all over on
the left and it goes you know probably
you can't see but if I inspect this
element then what will happen is this
header goes all the way I'll rather this
div within the header and this h1 goes
all the way across the page
there's no wrapper keeping it within a
central column okay so let's get rid of
that I'm gonna have to click this live
link again because they inspected the
element and what we're going to do is
tell that wrapper to keep everything
within a central column so to do that
what I need to do is apply in week first
of all I'm gonna give in 96 percent
weight right and then I'm going to give
it a max width of 1200 pixels I'll
explain all this in a second then a
margin or zero over top and bottom or
two left and right and then a padding of
zero on top of bottom and they're two
percent left the right so what's
happening is I'm saying look I want the
width of this wrapper element to be 96
percent and then have a padding of two
percent on each side which essentially
takes up the full hundred percent of the
page width right however if it reaches
1200 pixels stop there that's the
maximum width I want it to be okay so if
I just check this out now you see this
is the wrapper now it's keeping it
within the central column here okay but
as we get smaller the wrapper is a
hundred percent so this is always going
to match what the window width is going
to be because the padding Plus for 96
percent equals a hundred percent okay so
as it gets below to 1200 pixels the
wrapper is still going to be a hundred
percent in total width and that's the
width in the padding included okay makes
sense cool so the next thing we want to
do is style up the header tag
and if we look at the PSD this has a
kind of lightish gray background
let's just get the color of that it's
easy 5 V 5 V 5 so let's apply that will
say background b 5e v e5 ok and then
what we need to do also is just apply a
little bit of padding to this that's
gonna be on the top and the bottom so
it's 20 pixels top and bottom then 0
left and right then of what I'm gonna do
is target this header h1 right here
we're going to apply the the background
image to that so I'll say header h1 and
then first of all let's get rid of the
margin at the top so it seems up a
little bit then what I need to do is
text indent minus 10,000 pixels and
that's gonna make sure it seems right
off this way off the screen so we can no
longer see the text itself then I'm
gonna give it a background of the URL
which is gonna be an image so it's in
the images folder forward slash logo dot
PNG okay and I'm gonna set that to
no-repeat then I'm gonna set the width
to about 140 pixels the thing and
because currently it's 100% in width you
can see that by the blue outline there I
want to make it about this big here so
when I say width 140 pixels yeah that's
about right I mean we could reduce this
to probably about 1 3 6 or something
like that or even 130 to be honest yeah
cool 130 will do all right so last thing
I want to do is float it to the left
because that means I can get the main
navigation up here on the right so I'll
do that and then let's style up that now
then so header now that's the element
remember the nav element that we use for
this bit here and what I want to do is
float that to the right okay perfect
now you'll notice that the header the
height of the header has collapsed of
the height there it's just a padding
that you see in and it's collapse
because we floated all the content
either to the left or the
and we've not cleared our floats
afterwards and so it thinks that the
height is zero but I showed you this
trick in previous tutorials where we can
do something like this header after
which is a pseudo class which means we
can insert some content after the header
and we're going to display this content
as block and we're going to give books
we're going to give this some content
and it's going to be empty just like
that and then we're going to clear both
and it's going to clear the left and the
right and now we get the height back on
that element pretty cool right
all right there so let's style up the
rest of that navigation first of all we
want to get rid of this h2 so we'll say
header now h2 and then what we'll do is
say line height first of all zero just
to get rid of the height of that element
and then we're going to give it a margin
of zero to move it up and then we're
going to text indent - ten one two three
pixels so - ten thousand pixels again to
get rid of that h2 so visually it's not
there however it is still in the
document for screen readers and things
like that okay so that's pretty cool
next thing we want to do is just style
up these links right here so to do that
we're going to have to go after the UL
within the now so we'll say header now
ul all right and then within that what
we're gonna do strict up the magic in
fact we don't need to do that because
we've already stripped out the margin
and the putting up above so we'll just
go straight after the LI text will say
header now Li and then we're going to
give this a list-style-type:none and
this is going to get rid of these little
circles here okay like that perfect and
then after that what I want to do is
float them all to the left so they're
side by side then I'm going to give them
a margin to the left of each one and 20
pixels just to space them out a little
bit and then I'm going to also give them
a margin top of 10 pixels just to bring
them down and kind of keep them in line
with the center of this log okay so that
looks all right now okay so let us now
style up these
links themselves and changed their color
in one else so let's say header oops
spell it wrong header no Li a like that
it's gonna target the links within them
and then the first thing I want to do is
a text-decoration:none to get rid of
that one to line in all right and then
after that I'm going to give them a
different color and this color is going
to be the four E is it going to be yeah
40 40 40 okay so now they become that
data Greg similar to this thing here and
this text here that's fine then we're
going to text transform to uppercase
like that and then finally I'm gonna
give them a font weight off bold okay
now that's better stand out a little bit
more than now all right there so what I
want to do is give this first one which
has a class of current that green color
so let's say header nav Li a dot current
and then let's give this a new color now
I need to get this color from Photoshop
so let me just zoom in on this thing
right here and grab that color and there
we go we'll copy and paste that and
we'll pop it in this rule color there we
go so now the current one is this color
perfect alright so that's all the header
style for desktop just quickly want to
style up this planet as well as you can
see currently the banner if you've got a
full width screen like this it just
stops here and that's the size of the
image what we want to do is make that
image full width so to do that what I
need to do is go after the definition
and that is the main planet if that's
what the idea is and then within that we
have to go out of the image and we're
just going to set this to a width of
100% so I'll say width 100% and then if
we expand this now to full screen you
can see the width of that banner is 100%
okay however what I'm gonna do because
when it's 100% it's quite large it's
quite deep you see so it pushes all this
content down here so I don't want to be
that deep error
so what I'm gonna do is stay mean bonnet
I'm gonna give this a this is the div
that surrounds the image by the way if
we go to the index dot HTML you can see
that we've got a div of main banner
right there okay so let's go to the
style again and I'm gonna say give this
a max height of 500 pixels I'm gonna say
overflow anything that overflows this
height is hidden okay so the image goes
over high 500 pixels in height then it's
gonna be hidden in the CSS so now you
can see the bimah right here never goes
so deep yeah it goes fully across but
this content is a push down all the way
when we've got full screen okay and it's
still 100% width and that width browser
as well perfect so there we go guys that
is the header right there style for
desktop and also this banner right here
so in the next tutorial what we're going
to do is style up all this main content
right here alright so until then don't
forget to share subscribe and like guys
and I'll see you in the varnish tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
