JavaScript and the Dom tutorial and in
this video I'm going to explain how we
can interact with forms okay then so now
we're getting pretty comfortable with
events and reacting to those events I
think it's time we can move on to forms
and reacting to submit events on forms
but before we do that I just want to
show you one little nifty trick to query
the Dom to find the forms so currently
we have two on this up we have this one
at the top to search for books and this
one at the bottom to add books now a
neat little way to grab those elements
out of the Dom instead of querying the
Dom by tag name or something like that
is just to say document dot forms and
this is gonna return a hasty mail
collection of those forms you can see
this two here search box and add book
and if we want to access a particular
one we can use square bracket notation
and passing the index for example zero
let's go to grab the first one or the
way I prefer is to pass in the ID of the
form which I could say is add book as a
string and that is going to return that
form for us so it has to match up to the
ID of the form so now we know how to
query the Dom for forms let's move over
to the text editor so we can add in some
functionality for adding a new book to
the list so then I'll come down here
make a comment called add books and
underneath what we're gonna do is start
to flesh out the functionality to add a
new book to this list so the first thing
we want to do is add an event listener
to the form now if we take a look at the
form over here you can see it's an
import and a button and what happens
when we click the button in a form is
that the form itself emits a submit
event okay so we want to listen for that
submit event onto the form and normally
when this happens we provide an action
on this form which occurs okay now
that's the default behavior of a form to
fire this action and in most cases it's
going to refresh your page if you don't
have an action defined and you'll see
that if I delete some of these and then
click Add it's going to just refresh the
page right we don't want that to occur
we want to prevent that default behavior
and we've already seen how we can do
that using e
prevent default so we'll attach an event
in the forum to listen for the submit
event then we'll prevent the default
behavior so the first thing we need to
do is grab that forum so I'm going to
say Const add form is equal to document
dot forms and then in square brackets
add - book okay so I think that's the ID
of the form let's just make sure yep add
book cool so now then what we can do is
attach an event listener to this add
form so we'll say add four dot our event
listener and it's going to be a submit
event so we'll pass in submit right here
and notice we attach the event to the
form and not to the button itself it's
the form that emits the event when we
click the button
okay so we're attaching this event and
then we need to pass through a callback
function which is going to fire and take
through the event object as a parameter
when we submit the form okay so what do
we want to do first of all well we want
it prevent that default behavior so I
can say e dot prevent default
and ideally you want to spell this
correctly like so and that's gonna
prevent the default behavior then I want
to grab the value of whatever a user
types into this field so for example I
could type in a lot of garbage here I
want to grab the name of what the user
types in so we can add it to this list
later on so the way we do that is by
using the value property so first of all
or create a constant called value and
we're going to set that equal to add
form which is the form itself then we're
going to perform a query select all
method on that form so we're just
searching within the confines of that
form element and what we're looking for
is an input of type equal to text okay
here we have a look in the HTML we can
see that the type of this input is text
so this here is just a valid CSS
selector but looking for an input tag
and if we want to look for the
particular type of an input we can add
that in square brackets right here just
make sure you use the double quotations
for this and the single quotations for
this so they don't escape each other out
okay the next thing we want to do is get
the value of this input field source a
dot value this is the property we use to
grab the value of an input field and
what we can do is love that to the
console so I'll say console dot log and
we're gonna log the value out so let's
save this now and let's take a look over
here in the console so I'm just gonna
add a new book which is called cue one
nine eight four I'm not going to click
add just yet in fact a will because
that's what fires the event and now we
get this logged to the console cool and
it's preventing that default behavior of
refreshing a bit of the page and we can
see that if I delete some of these and
add the book again then we still get Q
one nine eight four and it doesn't
refresh the page cool
so now we know how to attach a submit
event listener to a form and then
prevent the default action and then also
get the value from any kind of input
field that we wanted okay so now we have
that in the next tutorial what we can do
is start to create new elements and add
those elements to the Dom right here in
the actual list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
