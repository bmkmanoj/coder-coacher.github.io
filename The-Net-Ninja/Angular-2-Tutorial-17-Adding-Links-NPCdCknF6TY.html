angular2 tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how we can add links
to our application
okay just quickly before we start I am
gonna in this tutorial add my Styles dot
CSS and my logo into the public folder
in this application right here ok so you
can see I've added the logo and in the
style store CSS I've added those Styles
they're both available on my github
repository right here angular to
playlist I've left a link in the
description down below if you want to
download those as well and pop them in
this public folder because now we're
going to start building that application
up and just by adding those styles and
the image it's already looking a little
bit better ok so once you've done that
pop it in the public folder and you'll
notice from a previous tutorial if
you've been following along what we did
was linked up to the style sheet right
here in the index.html file there so now
it's going to load in these styles and
that's why it looks different on the
page cool all right so now that's not
the way I want to concentrate on linking
drop the different states if you like in
your application or the different views
or components so let's get rid of those
two for a minute and if we go to the
application in the browser
these are our two links right here I'll
rather they're not working at the minute
but if we add a couple of links we'll go
to our app component view right there
and what we're going to do is add in our
links right here ok so currently it just
says a link but if we add in a couple of
anchor tags let's do the first one this
is how we know is it right a href equals
whatever URL ok and then for example
this could be for slash just for hole
and then if we do the same thing
underneath for the directory or paste
that in here for a slash directory and
call this directory as well then this
should work fine right I'll save that
and then when we click one of these
links because we've set up routing in
the last tutorial then this should work
so if we refresh now over here then now
we see these two links here hole and
directory ok
and they look like this because the CSS
takes care of it so if we click now on a
directory this should work and you can
see directory works and if we click now
at home there we go this is the home of
you but you're noticed one thing each
time we did that the page reloaded which
isn't great ideally we don't want to
force that kind of loading on to the
user what we would like is if it loaded
in automatically without requesting a
new page so we can do that by using the
router link directive and in the last
tutorial what we did is we added this
router directives in here and we
imported it and that means we can use
the router link directive as well as
this router out that one of the used so
instead of doing this H ref business
right here what I'm going to do is
delete those and instead I'm going to
use the router link directive and we
just do our square brackets and we say
router link and then equal that to
something you'll notice right here that
this is property binding we use the
square brackets when it's property
binding and the way we provide a link to
angular right here is by passing along
an array and in this array is going to
be all the different segments of our
particular URL for example if we go to
forward slash directory then this right
here is a segment and we pass it in here
if it was four slash directory forward
slash array you this is a segment and
this is a segment okay so we pass both
of them in here for now we've just got
one segment on each one directory for
directory and just forward slash for
home so all we can do is come here
and we can pop a string in now we can
either leave this blank for home I'll do
a forward slash that's either fine and
down here if we do the same thing I'm
going to grab that copy and paste it
here and set this equal to directory and
that's the segment for that URL so if we
save it now come over here and refresh
and you'll see if this still works if
I've got a directory click it still
works but now it's much much quicker
we're not requesting a new page every
time
from the server it's just loading the
component as we request it pretty cool
right so that is how we set up links in
angular any questions leave those down
below otherwise I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
