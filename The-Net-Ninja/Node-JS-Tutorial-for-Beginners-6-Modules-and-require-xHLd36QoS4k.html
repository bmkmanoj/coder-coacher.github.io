sixth nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about modules and
require four and then so when we write a
node.js application we don't typically
dump all of our application code in one
file like this app J s and just let it
run that will be a nightmare to manage
and for other developers to come into to
refactor or extend etc or even yourself
further down the line so what we do is
we split our code up into logical
modules so we'd have a different module
for a different bit of code which has a
certain functionality in our application
then we call upon those modules whenever
we need them so say we had a module that
was some kind of utility module that
counted things for us then we could go
ahead and create our module then call
upon that module when we need to
cancelled it okay so let's go ahead and
do something like that we'll right click
this folder and go to new file and I'm
going to call this County is and a
module is just essentially another
JavaScript file that's all it is so in
this file what I'm going to do is create
a variable called counter and I'm going
to set this equal to a function okay and
this function is going to take an array
as an argument so what it's going to do
is count this array cut the length of it
and return a string so we'll say return
and this string is going to say there
are and then we're going to concatenate
our dot length because this is just an
array so we can use the dot length
property on it and then let's
concatenate again and elements in this
array okay so let's go ahead and call
this function
we'll say cancer and we'll pass in an
array and this is just going to be an
array of ninjas so first of all Sean
obviously and then crystal and then
finally Ryu okay so we've called that
and we've passed in this array so hold
fully when we run this file through
nodejs it's going to return this to us
but what we need to do then is actually
love this to the console so we can see
it so let's say console dot log and then
pop all of this in parenthesis save it
and then let's run this file through
node so we'll say no count and then we
get the string there are three elements
in this array cool so we've made a
function which returns to us a string
and it counts things for us so what if
we want to use this functionality
elsewhere in the application for example
in this app KS well that's where we use
the require function and that is on the
global object in nogf so we can use it
wherever we are so we'd say require and
then we'd pass through a string into
these parentheses and this string is
going to be a path to the module that we
require in this file so the way we do
this in nodejs is first of all say dot
and then forward slash to say we want a
file in the current directory that's how
we do it and then we say the file name
which is count and we don't need to pop
a s on the end it automatically five is
that JavaScript file okay so now we've
required this module count in this file
so what do you think do you think that
now we can go ahead and use this
function in this file well let's give it
a whirl we'll grab all this cut it and
save this and go back to a PS and we'll
paste it down here and we'll save this
so what's going to happen when we run
this file through node now let's take a
look
node app and it's going to error and the
reason we get an error is because this
method is not available to us outside of
this module all this code is not
available to us outside the module and
that is intentional even though we've
required it okay so what we have to do
inside this module is explicitly say
what part of the module we want to make
available
to all the files which require this
module okay so the way we do that is by
same module exports and we set this
equal to whatever we want to be made
available outside of this module so I
want the council function to be made
available outside of this module so
let's save that now so when we call this
module here require account what's
happening is this thing right here is
being returned to us this module that
exports is what is being returned to us
when we require a particular module so
then what we need to do is set this
equal to a variable because it's
returning this value towards this this
variable here so let's create a variable
called counter in here and we'll set it
equal to whatever is returned to us on
the module exports property which is
this function okay make sense so now we
can use this counter function in this
file because we've required it right
here and when we require another module
it looks in that module for what's on
the module exports property it finds it
and then it returns it to us in the file
that we required in okay so we're
returning it and storing it in this
variable so now this variable is a
reference to this function right here so
we can call this variable we can call
this function right here and it should
work now so let's save it and give it a
whirl we'll say node app and this time
we get there are three elements in this
array okay so that's how we create a
module and that's how we require a
module in another javascript file any
questions feel free to ask those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in the next tutorial where we're
going to talk about modules a little
I'll see you guys up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
