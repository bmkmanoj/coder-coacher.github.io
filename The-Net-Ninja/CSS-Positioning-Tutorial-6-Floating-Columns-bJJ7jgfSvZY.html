CSS positioning lesson six and in this
video I want to show you how to create
content columns using floats ah all
right then go so I wanted to show you
one more practical example of where we'd
use floats to get a different design
result in our web pages and this
particular example is going to focus on
creating columns of content and we see
this all the time in web pages right so
what I'm going to do is underneath this
content div right here and by the way
this content div have just removed the
background color and I've set the margin
to 20 pixels top and bottom and 1% left
or right that's the only change it made
from the end of the last video so if you
want to do that to catch up feel free
then what we're going to do is put some
more content beneath this so what I'm
going to do is create a new div with a
class of columns and our columns are
going to be within this did so the first
thing you want to do is create a section
tag and then underneath that I'm going
to create an aside tag just like that
and these are two html5 tags and I'm
going to do a whole playlist on html5 in
the future so stay tuned for that
then within the section tag what I'm
going to do is put hate's to first
saying this is column 1 and then I'll
put P tag and then within that P tag I'm
just going to put some of some of this
lorem ipsum so I'll paste that in there
if I pop do another one as well another
P tag and paste again then down here in
the aside what I'm going to do is create
a P tag and the factor H to first of all
say this is column two then within the P
tag let's paste that lorem ipsum again
then underneath that I'm going to do an
image tag and we're going to use that
cloud image that I used a couple of
lessons ago so we just need to write in
cloud JPEG and I'm going to set the
width to be equal to 100% like that and
then that's going to set that image to
100% width of whatever width this aside
tag is and currently that width is 100%
so the image is 100% of that alright so
now what we want to do is
create two columns out of these so
instead of displaying the one on top of
the other have them left to right like
that so called one over here column two
over here and this is a really popular
technique on modern websites so let's do
that right now the first thing we want
to do is grab the section on the aside
right here in our CSS now what we're
going to do is float both of these to
the left and nothing has happened yet
and that's because there's still 100%
Lee Witt because they're block level
elements they're still occupying the
full space so we need to explicitly give
them a whip and I'm going to set the
width but both of them to 46% and now
they go side by side the reason I've
done 46% and not 50% each is because I
want to use the remaining 4% on each
element to give it some margin and
padding so I'll set the padding to 1%
all the way around and the margin to 1%
all the way around as well and now it
just spaces them out a little bit
finally what I want to do is give it a
background color of f2 f2 f2 which is a
really light gray can probably just
about see that there and there we go
guys we have two columns of content dead
simple to do dead quick and like I say
really popular on websites
it just makes reading the content a
little bit more easier right so I'm
going to do one last thing and this is
the thing I showed you in the last
lesson we're going to clear these floats
so that we can put more content
underneath this without it affecting the
margin or anything like that okay so
what we need to do is find the
containing element and that's why I put
this div right here so we can clear it
at the bottom using that after technique
so I'm going to grab this and go after
that and say after by the way guys I did
this in the last lesson in case you
missed it so if you want to return look
at this into a little bit more depth I
suggest you go back to the last lesson
and check that one out where we clear
floats so I'm just going to say
display:block content is going to be an
empty string and then finally we go
clear:both so now when we put content
underneath these two it's going to
resume normal document flow all right so
that my friends is how we create columns
of content using floats if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share and like and
I'll see you in a very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
