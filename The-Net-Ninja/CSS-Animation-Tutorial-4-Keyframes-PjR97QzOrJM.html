fourth CSS animations tutorial and in
this video we're going to dive right
into keyframes Wow again dope so
keyframes are basically the powerhouse
of CSS animations and they're going to
be where we define our animations and
tell CSS how we want the animation to
work which properties we're going to
change and when and how exactly they're
going to do it right so the way this
works is that we use a different
keyframe block every type of animation
we use on the page for example say we
want certain elements to drive on this
road right here then what we'd do
we'd create a keyframe block for that
drive animation we'd tell CSS how we
want that drive animation to work and
then we'd apply that keyframe animation
to different elements on our web page
right so if we wanted a some kind of
animation where we twelve different
elements then we'd make a keyframe block
for the twelve animation do the same
kind of thing tell it how we want to
animate and then applying that keyframe
block to different elements on our
webpage too so we have all these
different keyframes which I'm going to
control out different animations so our
rectly it's easiest just to jump into an
example and as you can see I've already
gone ahead and open up this Mario
examples folder and got out this index
file and the star dot CSS appear so this
is a dead simple HTML file you can see
I've just got this div for sky grass and
Road and then these lines in the road as
well just to make this kind of crude
Mario Kart can--it course and then what
we're going to do is we're going to add
a Mario onto this road because we're
going to animate him across from left to
right so what I'm going to do is add an
image tag down here I'm going to give
this a class of Mario so we can styling
up and then the source is in this images
folder right here so we'll say image for
slash and Mario dot PNG cool so save
that and refresh over here now we can
see that dude right there so let's go
into the style dot CSS and you can see
there's already some base styles here
that I've done for you this is just
styling up the sky the grass and the
road you can take a look through those
if you like but what I want you to look
at is these two comments right here
these are the elements that we're going
to animate right
here which includes things like this
dude and then down here we're going to
define all of our key frames so let's
pop Mario in here because we're going to
animate in and we just want to stand
them up a little bit better I'm going to
give in a position of absolute and then
I'm going to say top - 5 pixels this is
just going to nudge them up a little bit
on to that lady if you like alright and
then I just want to say left 0 just - to
be safe and then what I'm going to do
down here is make the key frames block
which is going to control the animation
and drive which we'll use on this dude
to drive from left to right so the way
we make a key frames block is by first
putting the outside and then saying key
frames and then what we do is we give
our animation and name and this one's
going to be called Drive right if we
don't give our animation a name then
it's going to be pretty hard to use it
on our elements we have to give it a
unique name then we open up the code
block and inside this code block is
where we're going to control what
happens in this animation right so what
we need to do is define different states
now there's a few ways we can do that
but I'm going to keep it and keep it in
its simplest form for now one that's by
using the - keywords - and from right so
what we need to say is - then a little
code block and then from sorry what a
runway realm from and then code block -
so what we're seeing is we want to go
from this state and we're going to
define that state in a minute - this
state that is the animation right we've
got two different states and yet there's
another way we can do this and I'm going
to show you that later as we dive into
more advanced tutorial to be like so
what I want to do right here is give
this a CSS property to animate and we do
all that in this little code block right
here so let's say we want to animate the
transform property which is going to be
translate x from 0 right so it's going
to start at 0 we're not going to
translate it anywhere and then - we're
going to transform translate x - about
500 pixels right so we want to transform
sorry I made this erm this dude right
here
from zero to 500 pixels along the x-axis
that way right so that's all this drive
is doing so now how do we apply this
keyframes animation to this element
well pretty simple all we need to do is
say animation - name and set it to the
name of this keyframe thing down here
which is dry right and then we have to
say also how long we want the animation
to take and the way we do that is by
saying animation - duration and then
setting that to like I don't know three
seconds or something yeah save that if
we refresh over here now we're going to
see that dude drive from zero to 500
pixels okay and we could increase this
if we want we could say 700 pixels
that's probably going to take us right
to the edge of this little screen right
here and yeah but it does pretty much
you'll notice at the end what it does is
jump back to the original position now
we're going to take a look at that later
don't worry but for now this is
essentially how we define our keyframes
okay we go from a set state to a certain
state and then we apply these keyframes
to these elements that we want them to
write okay so if you have any questions
feel free to leave a comment down below
otherwise guys I'm going to see you in
the next tutorial where we're going to
take a look at some more advanced
features where we can control these
keyframe animations further I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
