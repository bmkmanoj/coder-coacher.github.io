JavaScript for beginners lesson 8 and in
this lesson we're going to take a look
at the basic mathematical operators
that's coming up Wow alright so in
JavaScript there's five really common
operators and we've already seen the
first one and that's the assignment
operator this equal sign right here I
remember we use that when we assign a
value to a variable for example we'd say
var my var equals 5 that equal sign is
the assignment operator dead simple okay
the other four most common operators are
the addition subtraction division and
multiplication so we're going to take a
look at each one of these now in google
developer tools
alright gang so I just never get in
there over to the net ninja cot at UK no
particular reason I just needed a
website so I could get this Google
console up here I'm going to take a look
at those mathematical operators now I
said the first one was the assignment
one so we'll just go through that again
we'd say oops var to declare a variable
and my par equals five and that equals
sign right there is the assignment
operator so if we click enter now then
hopefully if I call my phone now it
should return five yet it's assigned my
father with the value of five all right
so that's the assignment operator dead
simple the next one is the addition and
operator so just like normal maths we
could say five plus five and it should
return the answer which is ten
okay dead simple and we can use
variables so we could say my bar plus
ten I remember my file is 5 because we
assigned it right here 15 however we've
not given my VAR a new value we've not
assigned it with that equal sign a new
value so if I still call my but it still
should be 5 and not 15 if we wanted to
reassign a new value we'd say my bar
equals my bar which is 5 plus 10 15 so
now when we call my file it's updated it
and it should be 15 and that's because
we assigned it right here
ok so that
is addition subtraction likewise we can
say ten minus five should equal five
perfect and we can say my bar minus
three should be 12 yep because it's 15
minus three and again we can assign new
value to my verb I see my articles my
bar which is 15 minus five so that
should give us 10 and when I call my bar
now it should be ten perfect all right
so there is addition and subtraction
multiplication exactly the same okay 10
times 10 100 okay
division and let's say 20 over 10 should
be 2 right perfect
and we can assign variables we can say
my var equals my Vlaar over 2 so my
power is currently 10 now I'm going to
reassign it 10 divided by 2 which should
be 5 so now when we call my bark it's 5
okay so they are the basic mathematical
operators now there's a couple of things
we can do with the plus one all right
we've already seen if we add two numbers
together like that 5 plus 1 5 it returns
the value 10 ok that's the product of
these two numbers what if we say 5 plus
string hello now what would you expect
there you can add really a number to a
string
can you does it really make sense so
what JavaScript does instead is it
concatenate those two values together it
turns this 5 into a string and then puts
them together so you get 5 hello all as
one string all right and that's because
it's saying to itself when you pass it
this formula well I can't add a number
to a string so the next best thing you
can do is concatenate those two things
together and convert the 5 into a string
okay so that's what's happened we can
say 100 plus hello and that should just
be 100 hello yep converts into a string
and we can also add two strings together
we could say hello
oops put in quotes hello
Plus David we get hello David but
there's no space and that's because we
have to specify that space so what we do
instead is say hello plus space David I
never killed never get hello David not
only so let's just do a some room oh no
we can't do that let's pull this down I
want to show you one more thing and that
is if we try to do something which is
not valid like for example what if we
try to send five times hello what would
you expect happens here well it returns
n a n and that stands for not a number
okay so it's looked at this and says
well I can't make any sense whatsoever
of that at all I'm just going to return
this value of n a n which is not a
number and we can use this n a n value
to kind of evaluate certain variables
later to determine whether they they are
in fact a number or not okay so we'll go
into that later on for now don't worry
about it too much just know that you
can't multiply a number by a string or
divide in on the by string or subtract
another by string the only thing you can
do is add a number to a string and that
concatenate the two and you can also add
strings with strings to concatenate the
two also so that about covers it for the
basic math operators if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those otherwise I'll see you guys in the
next video where we're going to take a
look at a couple of shorthand methods
for these mathematical operators I'll
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
