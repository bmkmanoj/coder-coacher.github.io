tenth flexbox tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about the property a
line item Wow
okay then dudes so in the last tutorial
we talked about the axis of the elements
and we said that when we set flex flow
equal to RO then the main axis runs
across in a row and the cross axis goes
downwards and we said that we can apply
properties that just affect the main
axis and properties which just affect
the cross axis and one such property
which just affected the main axis which
ever direction that may be going in
either across or down whether we're
using row or column one of those
properties that just affect the main
axis was justified content now we also
have a property which just affect the
cross axis which is on line items and
that does a similar thing but going in
the cross axis direction
so just to recap on justified concept
first of all you can see at the minute I
set my Flex flow to rope so that's why
these things are stuck in left to right
in a row and I've got a flex basis of
100 pixels in width and they're on 100
pixels high now if we use the justify
content property which like I said just
goes along the main axis and because
we're using route the main axis is going
across if we say justified content
center and it's going to align these
properties or not properties these items
centrally across the main axis yeah if
we say flex end it's gonna align those
items across the main axis at the Flex
end right now then if we change this to
align items this will now affect the
aligning of the elements going across
the cross axis instead at the main axis
so we could say something like center
and that's going to align the item
centrally going across the cross axis
instead of the main axis and likewise we
can add both we could say justify
content and we could apply that to
Center as well and that's going to put
the whole thing in the center so we've
applied it centrally go
down using alone items down the cross
axis and then horizontally using
justified content along the main axis
right so that's the difference between
them
this applies to the cross axis and this
to the main axis so let's just get rid
of that justified content another one we
can use on this a flex end and that's
going to put them at the bottom across
the the cross axis yeah let's get rid of
that for now and let's have a look what
happens when we change this to column so
when we change this to column remember
instead the main axis goes down and the
cross axis is going across and the
elements always follow the direction of
the main access so that's why they're
stacking one on top of the other now I'm
going to override this with default
width of 100% I'm going to say width is
now 100 pixels and the Flex basis is
still 100 pixels as well which is now
controlling the height of those dudes so
let's again try justify content first of
all I remember this flows along the main
axis and the main axis is now going
downwards because we've said column so
justified content censor and that's why
we get that effect centralizing it down
went along the main axis which this
applies to but if we now use instead
align items which works only on the
cross axis and the cross axis is now
going across then we'll put this to
Center that's going to centralize those
items going across the cross axis and
this way so all pretty confusing and
hard to keep your head around because
there's so many different things we can
do and ways we can achieve things so
it's just really a matter of studying
this making sure you know which way your
cross axis is which way your main axis
is and which property you use so just to
refresh we use justified content to
apply to the main accent
main access misspelled map okay so this
applies just to the main axis and this
applies just to the cross axis okay so
if you have any questions feel free to
leave those down below otherwise guys
