to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 9 and in
this video we're going to start styling
the banner Wow alright gang so as you
can see I've got the PSD open right here
and I just want to walk you through a
couple of things first of all what we're
going to do in this lesson we're going
to concentrate on this banner right here
and the first thing we need to do is
make that image full width because as
you can see it spans from the very left
to the very right so the thing we need
to do is contain this stuff within that
central column so we're going to use
that upper class to do that and thirdly
we just want to stand up this text and
make this green button right here now
I'm not going to be concerned about the
exact font family of this text or exact
font weight etc because I want to
concentrate on the process of doing this
rather than the technical details okay
so you can go away and tweet me myself
if you like or if you have a claim with
an end product you can get in perfect in
this video I want to focus on the
process so I'm gonna jump back over to
the code now and you can see here I've
got the HTML with a bundle right there
and this is where we left off in the CSS
down here so first thing we need to do
is if we expand this you can see it's
not full width we need to make that
image full width so to do that we need
to grab the lead bunner
div which is nothing right there because
that's where the image is contained and
then we want to get the image within
that source a lead banner image and then
we won't say that the width is gonna be
100% perfect that's all we need to do
with the image oops that's not worked
why is that lead oh that's why I spelt
lead wrong there we go okay so now
that's 100% width but he's a very deep
okay now throwing off on smaller screens
if it was say this width that will
define the right depth but when it's
full screen it's quite deep that I want
to contain that so that it and most it's
maybe this high right here it's
something like that so we can do that by
grabbing the lead banner div and we're
gonna give it a max height so let's say
lead
and then we'll say max height is 440
pixels
okay and then anything overflowing that
is gonna be hidden so now you can see
this is the maximum height it's ever
gonna be no matter how wide the screen
is cool the final thing I want to do to
this is give it a position property and
that's going to be relative because when
we position this stuff right here in the
text absolutely within this it needs a
relative div to position relative to
right so that's the last property 1/4
elite bummer
the next thing I want to grab is the
banner overlay and I want to just
basically position this absolutely
within that container so we need to give
it a top property of 20% that'll just
position a roundabout here and then
we'll say the width is gonna be 100%
because we want it to span across the
whole thing
and that wrapper is gonna keep it within
that central column so if we expand now
you can see the whole element is this
width right here but the wrapper is at
play keeping it within the central
column pretty cool yeah so the next
thing we need to do is start styling up
this text right here so we're going to
grab the banner title div which is right
here and I'm going to give that a call
first of all of white which is FSF in
Xcode and then I'm going to say text
transformation no text transform rather
not transformation and up the case and
then what I want to do is make this
aerial another aerial in the PSD like
say but I wanted to look slightly
similar it doesn't have to be the exact
font family in this kind of tutorial
series I just want to show you the
process like I said buddy I'm gonna make
it Arial to make it look a little bit
similar but the same goes for the rest
of the text on the page now rather than
giving each different element a font
from the attribute or property I'm going
to just go up to the body right at the
top up here and I'm gonna say
font-family:arial and that's going to
make everything within it area by
default get it in hair
style so I want to scoot back down to
the bottom here I'm gonna give this
butter title a font size up around 72
pixels make it nice and big cool and
then the next thing we need to do is
this P tag under here which is there so
to do that we need to grab a gain the
lead bummer and then the P tag within
that and we'll say color FFF we want to
give that a font size of around about 24
pixels and we'll say max width of 600
pixels that's going to keep it in this
little bit here because if you look at
the PSD that's exactly what it does
there alright so we've done that little
next thing we want to do is give a
margin top up around about 10 pixels
just to bring it away from that title a
little bit alright and once we've done
that we want to come down to this button
right here now if we look at the PSD you
can see it's got a slight gradient on it
right now yet we can write it from
scratch in CSS but it's easier just to
go to a website which can generate that
code for you okay because it's quite
long-winded so what I'm gonna do is
bring open this website right here
colorzilla comm forward slash gradient
editor I'll pop this link in the
description down below so you can go
there as well and what you do is you
just choose a gradient off here I just
choose a simple one like this here and
then you go to the start point you press
this and you put your hex code color in
I've got this from front with shop
already and you do the same for the
other end right here you put your color
in there and then it generates this code
for you right here it's a vertical
gradient just like the button is on the
PSD so we'll copy that code and then
what we're going to do is pop that into
our a tag right here so we need to say
leave bunner a and then we're gonna pop
this granny code right in there like
that I'm just gonna get all this and
scoot it across a little bit cool
alright so that should give it the
gradient we can't see
very much at the minute because it's
only very small but when we add out all
the styles we'll be able to see that the
next thing I want to do is say color
white we want to give this a display
property or block so that we can give it
that padding and margin or say the wick
is going to be 200 pixels and we'll say
the font size is about 18 pixels the
text-align property should be set to
center so it's in the middle then we're
going to give it a padding of 16 pixels
top and bottom but we don't need it on
the left and right because we've already
set a definite width so we'll say 0 for
left and right next thing we need is a
text decoration property and that's
going to be not to take away that
underline we want a border radius of
about 5 pixels to give it those little
corners and we want to say text
transform uppercase make them all
capitals then we want to scoot it away
from the text at the top so we'll give
it a margin top property up around about
30 pixels again this is not exact I'm
just kind of doing this if what I think
you know to look good if you've got her
an exact designer who wants things doing
pixel perfect then you don't have to go
into Photoshop find out how many pixels
are between each element and just pop
those in the CSS and but for now this
will do and then finally I just want to
give it a little box shadow and that's
gonna be one pixel one pixel six pixels
and then an RGB a so we can pass through
an alpha Channel we're going to say zero
zero zero and make it about not point
full all right then so if we make this
full width now you can see we've got the
title the text here button looking
pretty cool and this is full width but
not too high if we look at the PhD you
are going to notice some little
differences you know like the font size
font family the space between these etc
like say I'm not getting into the
nitty-gritty technical aspects of this
process I just want to show you the
overall
you can go in and tweak your CSS
properties dependent on your design all
right so that's the banner saw it guys
I'll show you this one more time and
there is so the next thing we're going
to do is jump down to this main content
and we're gonna style up these different
things here we're going to start that in
the next lesson so until that guys if
you enjoyed these videos don't forget to
