Django tutorial and in this video we'll
talk about URL tags and URL names all
right then so in the last video what we
did was set up this URL right here for
our article detail page and we captured
the slug that a user would type in here
right here in this named capturing group
and then we sent this slug variable
through to our views function here and
received it as a second parameter and
sent it back as a hasty TP response and
I said in this video we take this log
query our database to find a article
with the slug and then send it back to a
template but before we do that I want to
show you one more thing I want to show
you how we can hook up these links so
that if we click on this it goes to the
correct URL for example forward slash
articles four slash Django - rules or
forward slash Django analytic - opening
so how do we hook up that functionality
because at the minute in our article all
we do is go to this thing right here the
link goes to a hash symbol so we want to
output the different URLs right here for
the different articles now we can't hard
code this because we're output in this
code for each article that we send down
so this is repeating so if we hard code
it it will just repeat the same one over
and over so how are we going to output
the individual URLs or slugs inside this
thing right here for each individual
article well I think the best way to do
this is by using named URLs so how does
this work well we can assign our URLs
right here in name so for example I
could give this a name by passing in
third parameter called name and setting
that equal to some name of this thing
right here so if I call this list then
this URL is called list does that make
sense and also I could do the same thing
for this one or right here and call this
detail so now if I want to output this
URL inside a template then instead of
hard-coding that URL I could just say
okay use this URL right here
this list URL because that's the name of
it so let's test this one out first of
all and to do that we'll go into our
base layout and we'll create a link at
the top so right here first of all we'll
need a h1 then we'll need an anchor tag
and inside here we want to output a URL
now we're not going to hard code this
URL instead we're going to use our
template tags so if we just add those in
right here and then we say we want to
use a URL and then inside quotes right
here we say which URL we want this
anchor tag to lease to link to now we
want to link to the list URL so Django
will look at this and say okay well they
want to use a URL called list so I'll
find that over here and they say okay
it's this one right here this is the URL
they want to go to so I'll serve them
this view so this is what's happening
behind the scenes so if we add some text
in here called articles or something
like that save it and refresh over here
then if we click on this articles then
it will take you to the articles page
now instead of this I'd like to use an
image instead so we'll create some kind
of logo this will be an image tag and
the source is going to be equal to
something and before we set it equal to
something we'll need to dump it inside
our assets folder which is in here so
let's dump our logo inside there now the
logo can be found on my github
repository I've also got it in my folder
over here so let's just grab that and
paste it inside there so we'll use that
logo now and remember we can use static
files by saying template tags then
static and then which file we want to
load which is going to be logo dot PNG
so this is going to grab that image and
place inside the anchor tag which will
link to the list URL so let's save that
and refresh and now this logo will link
us all the time to this articles page
okay so that's how we use named URLs but
now
like to set it up for this one over here
detail all right
so how are we going to use this detail
URL inside our article list to link to
the individual details well it's going
to be pretty much the same kind of thing
so first of all let's create our
template tags like so then inside we
want to use a URL and the URL we want to
go to is going to be detail like so now
the problem here is that this detail URL
also is looking for this slug and we've
not passed any kind of slug in here so
it's not going to work yet but anytime
we're using a named capturing group like
this we can pass through this parameter
inside the URL itself dead simply we say
the name of that parameter and set it
equal to whatever we want to pass
through now we want to pass through the
slug of that particular article
remember we're storing that slug on the
article so we can say article does look
and then that will say okay well the
slug parameter that we want to pass
through to this URL is going to be the
slug on this particular article that we
received right here so if I save this
now and refresh over here then hopefully
this should work but we get an error so
I figured out that the reason it didn't
work is because inside the admin I
didn't have a slug setup for one of the
blocks so I just set up a slug and saved
it and now if you refresh it works so if
you hover over one of these you can see
right at the bottom over here the URL
denied and if I go to that URL then we
can see this is correct and I've got two
jungle rules this is correct so now
these URLs are outputting correctly
which is really good now there's one
problem with the way we've done all of
this and it's not really a big problem
for us at the minute but as you develop
your site it will become a problem and
that is because say for instance our
URLs we have a name called list right
here and a name called detail right here
now imagine we have a different app
which would be authors for example and
inside that authors app we also
have you are ELLs which will list the
authors and show the details of those
authors now we might also name those
lists and detail so when we output a URL
over here
how does Django know well I want to
output the article detail and not the
author detail well the way we do that is
by name spacing our URLs and we can do
that inside the URLs file itself so if I
say right here app underscore name and
set that equal to articles then we have
essentially name spaced this URLs file
so when we reference a URL now instead
of just saying detail we can say well
know get the articles colon detail now
if there were two detailed URLs in two
different apps Django knows to look in
the articles URLs to for the detail URL
itself does that make sense
so that's how we combat that problem and
we can just add in articles right here
as well like so save that and then
hopefully all of this will still be
working if i refresh over here then if i
click on one of these links it still
works and if you click on this icon at
the top it still works it goes to the
articles page okay so my friends that is
how we can link up our different blocks
using these named URLs so in the next
video we will be sending back then a
template to the user for these
individual articles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
