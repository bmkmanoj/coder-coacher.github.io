29th of UGS tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a first look at
input binding alright so I just said
we'll take a first look at input binding
but guess what I lied because we have
looked at it in previous tutorials as
well we use the v-model directive to
bind data to input fields and that's
pretty much what we're going to do in
this tutorial only at this time we're
going to take it a couple of steps
further and also apply it to some kind
of practical example now the example I'm
going to apply it to is to create some
kind of blog and we're going to start
that in this tutorial and then take on
fewer through future tutorials as well
so this blog is going to allow us to add
blogs lists blogs etc and we're going to
link it all to firebase eventually
in this tutorial we're just going to
focus on input binding and creating that
initial kind of form to add a new blog
so this file we just have this root
component this app top view and it is
pretty simple and empty at the minute an
empty template pretty much empty object
and also just this style at the bottom
with a margin of zero for the body and a
font family of new mito semi bowl now
you might have this on your computer you
might not doesn't really matter just so
it looks a little bit nice in the
browser that's all okay so that's all we
have at the minute just this root
component so we want to create a new
component now for our form to add a new
blog and that's where we're going to do
our data binding so let's create that
component in this component folder
create new file and we'll call this add
the log W then what I want to do is copy
all of this stuff out of here is empty
component template and paste it in right
there I'm just going to delete this body
style because we don't need the impulse
components all right so now we have the
kind of flesh of this component let's
import it into this up top view because
this is where we're going to left it
okay so let's import and we're going to
import add the log swamp and then it's
dot forward slash to say current
directory then in the components file
then /ab W ok so now we've imported it
let's register that component so we can
use in this one so we'll say components
this is an object and
inside this object will register our add
blog component so the tag is going to be
called add - the log and this is the way
I like to register components by adding
a - some people prefer camel case I
prefer - so this is going to be add blog
that we just imported right here and
let's place a comma after components so
now we can nest it right here so we'll
just say add - blog to nest that it's
okay let's save it now if we view this
in a browser at the minute nothing is
going to show because there's actually
nothing in this adblock so let's start
to flesh out this form in here so the
first thing I want to do is give this
div an ID and this is the V for
stylistic purposes later on so we'll
call it add blog okay after this we want
to have a Haiti - and the history will
say add a new blog post and then after
that we need our form so this is where
all the input binding is going to go
inside here now we're just going to have
two fields for now we're going to have
an input field for the title of the form
and also a text area for the blog
content so let's do a label for boat of
losers but also blog title forthe first
label and then we need that input field
which is to be of type equal to text
it's also going to be required and we'll
come back to this in a minute to do our
data binding that we'll need another
label for the blog content and
underneath that let's do our text area
like so okay so now we have these two
fields I also want to do a preview area
so we can preview what we're typing into
this before we post a blog so let's
create give with an ID equal to preview
and then inside this preview area we
want to be able to preview the blog so
as we type something in here it's going
to be in the preview section when we
catch something in the text area can be
in the preview section just so we can
see what the blog is going to look like
basically before we save it to the
database so let's have a h4 in some kind
of title to say preview blog and then
below that we want to output the blog
title plus ap and then blog title and
we're going to output that in a minute
and also we need a piece ID for the blog
content
and also we're going to output that in a
minute okay cool
so now we've kind of got this form
fleshed out let's just save it and make
sure it's on the page and it's all
working there it is okay so this
currently looks a little bit rubbish so
I'm just going to add some styles now to
make it look a little bit better first
of all so let's come down to the style
tags and all I'm going to do is copy and
paste it from my repository because this
is not a CSS course this is a via course
so for very basic styles so we're seeing
everything this is a wildcard selector
right there everything within the blog
gives this box size in border box the
add blog kind of like overall container
which is this thing here we're saying
there we want a margin of 20 pixels and
auto so it's going to centralize that in
the page Maps with 500 pixels and the
labels have exploded it's blocked with a
bit of a margin as well the input with a
type of text and the text area I display
this block width on your percent and
padding 8 pixels the preview area is
going to have some padding a border and
also some margin and the h3 is going to
margin top of 10 pixels so these are all
very basic standard styles and they
review it in a browser now it just looks
a little bit better okay so this is the
idea we want to now bind our input field
so that when we type something in here
it appears down here and we can store
that in the view instance everyone or
the component into this rather okay so
that's what we're going to do now we're
going to take a look at this data
binding so like I said we've already
done this kind of input binding in
previous tutorials and it was just using
a V model so again we're going to use V
model to bind to these data fields so
we'll say the model is equal to
something and then we need to give this
a name this model a name so we'll call
it title so then whatever we type in
here is going to be stored in this title
variable or property okay so we can also
add a remodel down here on the text area
so we can say V - model is going to be
equal to something else content for
example okay so now if we wanted to we
could access the title and content and
output right here so I could output
title and I could output content here
okay so I'll save this and let's just
review it in a browser so if I start to
type something here hmm nothing happens
let's click refresh title still nothing
happens and that's because we need to
add this thing right here and this thing
right here to the data and down here if
I would right click over here and go to
inspect and if we view in the console we
can see these errors right here we can
see title is not defined on the instance
content is not defined on the instance
so we need to add those two down here in
the data so let's just say title and
that's going to be just an empty string
to begin with and also content and
that's going to be an empty string to
begin with now if we save this view in a
browser as I type in here we can see it
down here in the preview as I tagged in
here we can see this down here in the
preview cool so just a couple of things
before we move on normally when I am
doing input binding like this if the
fields are related for example this is
related to this because they're both
part of the same blog then what I like
to do is store both of these fields on
the same kind of property the same
object so I like to do something like
this the log title then blog content
okay so basically we're going to have
one object right here blog which stores
all of these different related fields so
then we can keep all within that one
blog object and just like that to keep
all of the components of this form
together all of the moving parts right
so down here in the data we're just
going to update it so that we have
instead we'll copy that the log right
and this is going to be an object and
inside that we have these different
properties that way we're just keeping
everything to do with the blog in the
one object all right that's how I like
to do it so I'll save that I'll show you
that it still works it doesn't work yet
because I've not done a blog title there
and the log content there but if I save
now then check this out this works now
okay
cool so now I want to kind of take this
one step further
basically if i refresh over here as I'm
typing it's updating over here and as
I'm typing it or connecting over here
now I don't necessarily want this
behavior right I want to be able to type
something in here
not sure down here then when I tab to
the next input field then it shows okay
so I can do that by using an import
modifier so what's like we do in
modifiers on our events we can do them
on input fields as well so I can say V
model dot lady and that is going to do
what I just said so if i refresh now do
a start typing nothing that case down
here until I click tab and then it
appears that's a nice little feature I
quite like that okay so I want to also
add this to this one down here I want to
say lazy and then the same would happen
for this all right how about and it
appears down there now just one more
thing the blog content I want to place
underneath this right here so what I'm
going to do is actually come over here
and cut this from there I'm going to do
an another paragraph tag like so and
place that in blog content like so so
now when I add blog content in I'm just
going to copy and paste this quite a few
times so we've got a little bit of
content to see now when they are dying
it's down below here and it just looks a
bit better
again we can add a blog title in and it
appears there okay
so now we've seen how to add the v-model
to these different input fields so that
we can store them in a central object
the blog object in different properties
and we can output them to a preview area
in later tutorials what we are going to
do is take this content I'm going to
push it to a database but that's in the
future for now I just want to
concentrate on these input fields and in
the next video we're going to take a
look at checkboxes and binding data to
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
