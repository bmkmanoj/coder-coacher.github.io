third flexbox tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at the Flex
Grill property Wow
okay then dudes so this is where we left
off in the last tutorial we went ahead
and we created a Flex container and we
did that by giving this element a
display type of flex so that's our Flex
container then when we do that every
elements directly beneath it every
direct descendant becomes a Flex item so
that's what each of these boxes has done
it's now a Flex item and the default
behavior of those Flex items is that
they stack left to right and the
dimensions of these are coming from
these things right here the height of
100 pixels and the minimum width of 100
pixels so I said once we make this
container we put elements within it then
we can control the flexibility if you
like or the functionality of these items
things like the spacing the growth the
shrinking how they stack so that's what
we're going to do we're going to take a
look at one of those properties and that
is flex grow all right so currently
we're saying to these lock we want them
to have a minimum width of 100 pixels
and that's why they're these squares but
check this out there's tons of space
left in the container so what I want to
do is when there's available room left
in the container I want each of these
elements to grow into that available
room so how would I do that and you do
it using the Flex grow property all I
need to do is come under here and say
flex - grow and then I'm going to set
this equal to one at a minute and now
what's happening is each one of these
elements is growing at a rate of 1 and
that all grow and get the same rate to
take up all the available group in the
container now at the minute this number
is not going to be much to you I mean
this could be 100 and it would do the
same thing and the reason it's doing the
same thing is because this is kind of
like a growth rate and right now we're
giving all of the boxes the same growth
rate so they're all growing to the same
dimensions however this number is going
to make a lot more sense when we set it
to a different one on each of these
elements so let's get rid of it on there
and let's go down to each one of these
elements individually and give it a
different flex core grow
right so the first one I'm going to set
if flex grow rate to one and check this
out so each one of these is still
remaining 100 pixels in width because
that's a minimum width but I'm saying to
this red one this first one right here
look flex grow one this is the only one
currently growing and it's taken up all
the extra room that's why it's going
that big okay now if we come down here
and we say Flex grow I'm going to set
this to a rate of 2 now check out what
happens this one's still growing at a
rate of 1 but this one is growing at a
rate of 2 twice as big well not
necessarily twice as big but the growth
rate is twice as much ok so then we can
come down here and we can say flex -
grow if we can spell it 3 and now this
one is growing at three times the rate
of this one alright so you can think of
these growth rates a bit like columns on
a grid imagine we had say a bootstrap
grid and it has 12 columns right so
we've got 12 columns to play with we
could use this flex grow property as a
way of defining how many columns we want
an element to take up so we've got 12 to
play with in in total let's say we want
this first one to take up and four
columns right then we want this second
one to take up say six columns so that's
ten in total then we want this final one
to take up the final two columns that is
the same pretty much as using a twelve
column grid system and applying columns
to each one of these elements just by
using this flex row property pretty cool
right and I'm not great at math but even
I can see that what we can do is
simplify this a little bit by reducing
each one by half so this can now become
one this can become three and this can
become two and we're getting the same
effect all right so that is how flex
grow works we use it to expand elements
into available space and the rate at
which it expands into that available
space is governed by this number right
here so it's all relative to
other elements next to it okay so that
is flex grow you have any questions feel
