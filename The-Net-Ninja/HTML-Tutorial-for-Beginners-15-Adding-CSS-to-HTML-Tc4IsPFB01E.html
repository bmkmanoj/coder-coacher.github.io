and this is HTML basics lesson 15 adding
CSS to your HTML Wow now there's three
ways to add CSS to your HTML there may
be other secret ways that I don't know
of and if you know these ways then feel
free to comment below but from what I
understand there's three main ways to
add CSS to your file the first way is
through inline styling where we use the
style attribute directly in the tags
themselves the second way is within the
style types in the head of the document
and the third way is by linking up a
style sheet in the head and you're going
to kind of find out as we go through
this video that the first two ways
probably not the best ways to do things
and I'll explain why as we go along for
now we're going to jump back into the
code and we're going to start adding
styles to our document so here we are
back in the index.html file and we're
gonna start adding some styles to our
document so I said in the introduction
that there's three ways of doing it and
the first one was by adding inline
styles and basically that means we go
into the tags themselves in the document
and we add styles directly to them so
say for example I wanted to style these
links these eight tags up here I'd go
into the a tag and I'd add another
attribute remember we can have more than
one attribute on each tag and without
the style attribute and this is a global
attribute that we can add to pretty much
any tag in the document so we use the
style attribute to specify specific CSS
rules for this tag so don't pay
attention to the kind of rules that I'm
going to be putting down here this is
not a CSS course pay attention to the
method that I'm using to add CSS rules
to the document I am going to be doing a
full CSS course after this HTML one so
stay tuned for that but for now just
concentrate on the way I'm doing things
so we've got our style attribute and
we're going to add a couple of rules or
maybe just one rule and we're gonna
change the color and we'll make it red
so I'm gonna preview this in a browser
and we can see now the first link that
we added the style attribute to exchange
red so we can do this certainly we can
have these inland styles to tags however
imagine this say you had 100 links on
your page
and you wanted every link read that's
gonna be a long and arduous task to go
through every single a tag in your
document and add this style attribute
and then further down the line imagine
you wanted to change those links to blue
well it's gonna be even longer to go
through and delete them then add the
blue rules so probably not the most time
if you should way of doing things so for
that reason I don't really like adding
these inline Styles every now and then
I'd probably use one to kind of
overwrite a different style very
sparingly
I would probably hardly ever recommend
using inline styling but occasionally
and let me know they do have the uses so
a slightly better way of doing things
would be to go up in the head tag and
badly style tag which is within eolian
and within the style tag we can start in
rules to our document so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to target these attacks
here and again don't pay attention to
the rules I'm using this isn't a CSS
course I'm just showing you how we can
add them within this style tag here at
the top so I'm gonna find this
navigation ID here and I'm gonna target
up and then within that navigation ID
we've got these a link so I'm going to
target those and basically what I'm
saying here is every a tag within the
navigation ID give a color poverty so
I'm gonna save that and preview this
again in the browser and then we can see
we've got all red links that's because
the browser has looked at this style
rule in the style tag and it said okay
well I'm gonna apply this rule to every
a tag within the navigation region so
it's a lot quicker if you wanted to
change all the links on your page you
can do it within one line of code rather
than go through every single tag
however still not the best way and I'm
going to tell you why so imagine we had
50 pages and we wanted to change all the
links on every page to read we'd still
have to go through every page and that
at this style block into the head of
every page and then later again if we
wanted to change that to blue we'd have
to go into every page and change the
rule to blue in the head type so still
not the most kind of time efficient way
of doing things so what is the best way
of doing things well I'd say the best
way of doing things is by adding a link
tag here and we did this in one of the
earlier tutorials when I was talking
about the head we said that we can add
our CSS or references in the head which
is what we've done and we do this by
adding the link tag and we give it a rel
attribute which stands for relationship
and we're saying that the relationship
of this kind of document that we're
linking game is a stylesheet so we're
saying we're linking a stylesheet into
this HTML file the next attribute is
type and we're saying that the type of
this document will link it in is a text
slash CSS file so the browser knows what
to expect and the third attribute is the
age eight ref attribute and remember
this we used to specify the location of
whatever we're linking to and we've
given this a location of the CSS folder
jumps into that folder and then we're
finding the main CSS file now I've not
added that CSS file yet I was just kind
of adding this link in a previous
tutorial just to demonstrate how we do
it so I'm gonna add that CSS folder and
the main dot CSS file now and to do that
remember we right-click this kind of bar
in the left click new folder name is CSS
and within that folder we're going to
add a new file and we're going to call
that main dot CSS so that's opened up a
new kind of style sheet for us and every
time we add rules into the style sheet
which ever document has this link tag in
it it's going to apply those rules to
that document so this is the index
document we've also got the contact
document which is which has the CSS link
as well it's also in the how-to and it's
also in the lists
in fact every page within this mini
website we've done has this reference to
the main CSS final so when we make
changes in this it's going to affect all
of those pages at once we don't have to
go individually into the head of each of
those pages and change the styles right
then so again I'm gonna do let's have a
look first of all what have we got
comment each each page we've got H ones
there okay so we've got h1 in each page
so I'm gonna target the hip ones and I'm
gonna make these a color of blue this
time let's mix it up a little bit and
we're going to give it a
text-decoration:underline so we want all
these hate ones to be underlined and
then finally text chunks for all the H
ones to uppercase so let's save that now
and hopefully this should work we'll
view first of all the index yay and
there we go the h1 is not blue and
underlined let's go to the contact us
page which we linked up previously and
there we go it's also in that page will
try the price list that must be H 2
we'll find out prices now this is why
it's a good job I did this we're linking
to the CSS folder however we're in a
subdirectory and if you remember when we
talked about navigating directories to
jump up a directory first of all to get
us into the main directory we need to do
the two dots and then the forward slash
and then it's going to find the CSS file
here so now hopefully this should work
let's view it in a browser and there we
go that's blue as well
underlined so they have it there the
three main ways of adding CSS to a HTML
document you've got your inline Styles
which is probably not a great idea
unless from very specific rules then
you've got your style tag in their head
which is a better way but still
not the most kind of time effective way
of doing things and then the third and
best way is to totally kind of separate
your styles from your HTML in an
external stylesheet and link to that
stylesheet within the head of your page

lesson which is going to be about all
linking up JavaScript I'll see you guys
