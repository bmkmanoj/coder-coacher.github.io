Atmos Group six tutorial and in this
video we're gonna talk about the spread
operator Wow
alright thinking so the spread operator
is this nifty new feature in es6 that
can basically take an array and just
spread them into individual elements and
that has a few cool uses so for example
let's say I've got on a rake so I'll say
far meets equals and we're just going to
set this equal to a few meats the first
one I put ham salami and a little bacon
alright so I've got that a rate of meats
now and if we log this to the console
what are we gonna see well let's just
give it a world refresh over here and
you're gonna see these meats hum salami
bacon in a rake form right now the
spread operator is just three little
dots and we put it in front of the array
that was spread in so if I just put
three little dots like that it's going
to use that spread operator on this
array and essentially it's gonna spread
the array into its individual components
so let's give that a save and refresh
over here and now you can see it's been
taken out of the array and we see those
three components separately alright so a
few different uses of this we'll do a
quick example first of all what I'm
gonna do is create an array and I'm
gonna call this normal somewhat and this
is just going to be a set number it's
just one two three not though then I'm
gonna create another array oops
VAR illness or two and I'm gonna set
this equal to some ah number so I'll
just say four five six alright so what
if I wanted to add this array all of
these elements into the start of this
array well let's just take for just one
second less console.log normos - first
of all save that refresh so currently
we're getting this array right here yeah
so if I just go ahead and pop in norms
one there what do you expect to see well
if we refresh then we see an array
within an array okay so this array is
the first position
that's this whole array that's just
occupying one position in this second
array and within our area of 1 2 3 but I
don't want that I want them to be
individual components within that erase
it was just one dimensional the whole
array and that's where the spread
operator comes into play so we can just
spread that array right there using
those three dots and it's going to take
that array and spread it into its
individual components so now if i
refresh over here we get that one
dimensional array with that first array
spread at the beginning pretty cool
right so let's do another quick example
what I'm going to do is create a
function which is going to add some
numbers so I just call this advant
numbers and it's gonna add three numbers
together a B and C so we need to pass
three numbers into this function and
what it's going to do is just log to the
console the addition of these three
numbers a plus B plus C all right so
let's again create a variable which is
going to store an array so I'll saying
that numbers equals and it's just gonna
be three numbers so three five and seven
right and we want to add those numbers
now we want to pass those numbers
through to this function and we can do
that really easily using the spread
operator so if I say add nulls if I was
just a passing this numbers array well
it's not expecting that it's expecting
three variables three numbers to add
together so it's not expecting just one
array and if we save this and refresh
then we're going to get this undefined
right here right so what we need to do
is instead use the spread operator
before that that's going to spread this
array out into its individual components
here and pass them through to this
function so now instead we're going to
get three five and seven in the a B and
C slots so let's save that now give it a
whirl and we get an unexpected token and
that's because you've only only two dots
all right so three dots and now we get
15 which is the total of three plus five
plus seven pretty cool right so that is
the spread operator and we put it in
front of an array or an iterable object
where we want to spread the array into
its individual component
okay any questions feel free to ask
those down below otherwise guys I will
see you in a very nice tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
