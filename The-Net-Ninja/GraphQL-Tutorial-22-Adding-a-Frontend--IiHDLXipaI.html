now we have our Express up and graph key
our server built on nodejs and we've
hooked this up to MongoDB so when we
make test requests from the front-end in
this tool called graphical we're sending
those to the server and the result
functions over here going out to MongoDB
to retrieve the information we need
return it to the server which is then
determining what data to send back to
the user in the browser dependant on the
query that was made so this is all well
and good we've kind of taken care of the
right-hand side of this equation all of
the server and the database stuff but
ideally going forward we don't always
want to be just making requests or
queries from this tool called graphical
I imagine at some point what we'd like
to do is make an application in the
browser some kind of website and then
allow that to make queries to the graph
of our server over here and retrieve
data from it so it can show it to the
end-user using that website so we want
to replace graphical with some kind of
app we're going to use react to flush
out an app on the front end now because
graph QL query language is not
JavaScript although it looks like it is
not then out of the box it's not
understood by react or any other kind of
JavaScript framework on the front end
now to help us kind of bind graph QL to
our application we're going to use a
graph QL clients and one of those is
called Apollo so this is the thing we're
going to be using to help bind graph QL
to I will react app so that we can make
queries using graph QL to our server all
right so just to break this down a
little bit more we're gonna have our
react app we're gonna have a couple of
different components maybe even three
but it's gonna look something like this
we'll have a book list component which
will render a list of different books
then we'll also have an ad book
component which will be a form of some
description to add a new book to that
list so in both cases right here these
components are going to be making
queries right to the server this top one
to
get a list of all the different books
and this one right here to add a new
book to make a mutation so the way this
is going to work is we bind queries to
our components right and the way we do
that is by using this Apollo clients so
Apollo can help us create a query and
then bind that query to a component so
that when that component renders in the
browser automatically behind the scenes
Apollo is handling that query to the
server and returning any information so
that we can show it inside the component
and this works really well with react
and you'll see exactly how this works as
we go forward all right so when the
graph QL server receives that query then
it's going to go to M lab but get the
data and return it back to us so that's
basically how this application is going
to look now to flesh out this front-end
application we're going to be using this
create react app okay so you can find
that on github I'm going to leave this
link down below it's by Facebook and
it's really simple to use but basically
all we're going to be doing is creating
a react app using this command in our
console
so we're going to start doing that in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
