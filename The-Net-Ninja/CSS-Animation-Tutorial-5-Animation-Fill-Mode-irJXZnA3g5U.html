fifth CSS animation tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about the
animation film mode Wow Ellen Doakes so
in the last tutorial what we did was
create the swanky mario kart scene where
by this dude drives from the left to the
right but when he reaches the end of the
road he just goes pop back to the
beginning
like he's Darren brown doing a magic
trick or something now we know what not
to happen we want this to be a little
bit more realistic at least and what I
want to happen is for this dude to stay
at the end when he reaches the end so
how can we do that we do it using the
animation film mode property which
basically tells CSS what to do with this
dude or whichever element that we're
animating outside of the animation
window so before it starts animating and
after it and it can take four values the
first one is not which is the default
one we're seeing right here forwards
backwards and both so we're going to
look at each one in turn so currently
none it's saying do nothing outside the
animation window once he's finished
return this dude to its original state
which is right here
Mario top- for it left zero get rid of
these translates right here just do
nothing right now we can change this to
forwards and the way we do that is by
seeing animation film mode and we change
it to forwards like so and then if we
refresh now you're going to notice that
this dude is going to stay at the end of
the animation when it reaches it pretty
cool so that's more realistic so that's
what forwards doors it takes the last
kind of properties here and it applies
them to this element outside of the
animation window at the end of it all
right so that's good for making a state
at the end if you want it to we don't
want it to pop back to the start now to
demonstrate the next value backwards I
just want to give this another property
and that is animation delay and
animation delay basically just delays
the animation so when you first load the
page if you want there to be a
two-second delay before the animation
kicks in then we just use that there
that animation delay right so let's save
that and refresh and see what happens it
up so it starts there then it goes okay
pretty cool still but
we want to start the animation from say
200 pixels so I'm not from the very
start but from ran back here let's
refresh and see what this does now just
save it and this is the delay then it
pops to 200 pixels again and it goes all
the way over here so we want to get rid
of that pop as well and we can control
that we get the animating Fillmore - and
that's what backwards does it does the
opposite of forwards it says okay well
whatever the starting animation state is
I want you to apply that to the element
before the animation kicks in right so
let's try backwards let's say backwards
like so save that refresh now it's
starting here the delay starts and then
it goes to the end but then we're
getting that pop back to the end so
we've taken away four words and that's
no longer working so we can combine them
both get them all in one shot by saying
both and that's going to apply backwards
and forwards to this animation so if we
refresh now the backwards thing is
kicking in then the forwards thing is
kicking in so it's doing both in one go
so this is pretty cool
right so that is what the animation film
mode is for it decides what to do with
the element outside of the animation
window if you have any questions about
this whatsoever feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'm going to see you in a very next
tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
