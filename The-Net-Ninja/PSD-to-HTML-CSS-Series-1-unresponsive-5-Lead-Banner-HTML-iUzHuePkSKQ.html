PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 or lesson 5
and in this video I want to talk you
through the lead Bannen Wow all right
thing going so as you can see I'm
exactly where I left off last time in
the HTML we did this header section last
time which was the strip right at the
top now we're going to move on to this
banner section right here and we've
already created our div for that with an
ID of lead banner so everything we do is
gonna go off within here alright then so
first things first you'll notice the
image on the lead banner stretches from
left to right all the way across right
but again just like in the mouth we have
this inner column of content which is
holding all of this stuff within it in a
central column right so we're going to
use that wrapper once again within here
but first things first I want to just
put the image tag in to display this
image so what we need to do is write our
image tag say source equals and then we
know it's within our images folder
forward slash butter now it is to give
this an alt attribute of lead but it
doesn't really matter what you call it
at the minute and we'll stop there okay
so next thing we want to do is create a
div to contain all lists of it and I'm
going to call that banner - overlay all
right that's gonna pass a Punnett
overlay and then within that I'm gonna
do our wrapper div and I'm gonna explain
all this in a second give it a little
wrapper okay cool so this planet all the
way right here is going to contain
everything within here and I'm going to
use a position:absolute property on this
banner overlay so that it kind of goes
over the image and it's gonna have a
100% width stretching from left to right
okay now this wrapper right here is
going to be what's keeping this content
within a central column now you might
say why not give this a class of wrapper
and do it there and I prefer to do it
this way because it's much easier to do
it in the CSS this way when we use a
position:absolute on this div right here
it becomes a little bit tricky
keeping it within a central column and
learning it up with everything else all
right so that's the way I like to work
things now that within this wrapper we
need to pop our title first of all so
we'll give that a div give it a class of
banner - a title and that is we know web
design and just a couple of things that
guys the reason I'm giving these things
plus he is you see like this here and
this here is because at the minute yeah
there's just one banner there but quite
often websites like to have sliders
where you show one banner for a while
then it slides over shows another banner
so I'm making this with the future in
mind so that if they did want all the
banners in the future they could use
these classes again even though there's
only one at the page one on the page at
the minute sorry in the future that
could be multiple so this is just the
way I work where I think there may be
more of these dips in the future and
give them classes second thing I want to
tell you about is this right here I've
written it just as a would a normal
title not in capitals now a lot of web
designers write this in capitals I
prefer not to and this is why I can
control this in the CSS so I can use a
text transform property and say
uppercase and that's going to make this
like this right here
but if in the future they have a change
of heart and they don't want it
uppercase they don't have to come into
the HTML and change every banner title
they just have to change that one
property in at the CSS and it reverts
back to this pretty cool yeah all right
cool so what next this bit of text right
here and I'm going to pop that in a P
tag so let's do that and then I'm going
to scoot all the grammar text tool and
copy all this right here ctrl C and then
I'll paste it within that Peter perfect
and the last thing we need is a button
right here so I'm going to do that as an
a tag because it's going to link
somewhere href attribute doesn't really
matter and then it's review our work and
same again I'm not doing capitals even
though it is of here we'll control that
in the CSS now then a lot of designers
also
kind of chopped this button up in
Photoshop and I'll use an image here
instead again I prefer to do everything
in CSS where I can't because it reduces
loading times of the page and we can do
all this stuff in CSS the rounded
corners the little shadow around it
everything on this design we can do in
the CSS which is really cool so that's
why I'm using an a tag and we'll start
up later alright then guys so this has
been a pretty quick lesson I just wanted
to focus on this banner right here and
get that out of the way in the next
lesson we're going to concentrate on all
of these three sections right here so
