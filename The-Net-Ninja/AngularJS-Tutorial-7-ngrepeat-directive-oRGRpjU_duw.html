seventh angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to go over the
directive ng-repeat Wow dudes so in the
last tutorial what we did was initialize
some data using this ng in its directive
right here we've got some data in there
and then we output that data to the
browser using expressions so we're going
to do something pretty similar in this
tutorial but I want to change the data a
little bit and this time I'm going to
create an array called
and Minges so in here I want to play
some cool and means your name so what we
got we can say Yoshi crystal not sure
how much of that is but it'll do Ryu and
then obviously shot all right so there's
our four ninjas right now and what I
want to do is output each one of these
to the screen in an li tag so we could
do something like this we could say ul
and then we didn't have to do an li tag
for each ninja and I just want to grab
the zero index first of all and then
I'll copy and paste this bad boy a few
times like that and I'll just get each
ninja by referencing the index right
here so one two and three and then if I
say this is going to output each and
India right there on its own and I type
all right because this one's referencing
that this one's referencing that etc now
this is okay but there is an easy way to
do it I want you to imagine if you had
200 ninjas right and you want a list of
200 ninjas output there on your page
this is going to be pretty tiresome
doing it this way doing a separate Li
tag hard-coded in your file for every
ninja so there's an easier way to do it
and that is by using the ng-repeat
directive so let's get rid of those for
now I'm gonna do one Li tag and then
within that Li tag I'm gonna give it the
ng-repeat
directive and what that is going to do
is repeat this Li tag over and over for
however many ninjas there are okay but
in order to link it up to this ninjas
array is data right here what I need to
do is say ng-repeat equals and then I'll
say mins
in Minges okay so this right here ninjas
has to be the data that we want to grab
which is this variable right here and
this is a keyword that we need to
specify we need to say in we can't
change that but we can change this this
could be X or Y or Z or whatever you
want it to be all right
I'm going to say ninja because it makes
sense because each one that we deal with
is going to be a ninja all right so now
what we need to do is output in curly
braces the ninja so what it's going to
do is it's going to go through this
array right here this data and it's
going to output an li tag for every
element it finds in that array okay and
then each element each time around is
going to be referenced by this word here
whatever we put there okay so I put a
ninja so that I want to just output that
ninja so it's going to go through each
one and it's going to output the ninja
all right so let's save that and yeah we
should get the same effect over that now
if I just inspect this element then we
should see if I bring it over here if I
go into the body and then the e well now
we can see all of those Li tags right
there let me just zoom in a little bit
for you guys okay so you can see each Li
tag there okay
and it's outputting there a different
ninja each time because it's working its
way through
that's array here okay so that is how we
use ng-repeat and that's really useful
for when we have large amounts of data
it's going to take too long to output
manually by writing the code over and
over all of her to do here is one line
and it doesn't matter whether there's
four elements in that ray or 400 it's
going to output every single one so
pretty cool right
so there we go guys that is ng-repeat if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys don't forget to share
subscribe and all that stuff and I'll
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
