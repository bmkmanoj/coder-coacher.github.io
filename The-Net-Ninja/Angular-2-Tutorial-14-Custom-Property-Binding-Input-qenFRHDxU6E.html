fourteenth angular2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about the
input decorator and custom property
binding alright then so in the last few
tutorials what we've been doing is
passing data between the computer the
component class and the component view
and we've done that via property binding
and event binding and two-way data
binding as well now in all cases data
has just been flowing within the same
component we've not been going from one
component to the other just from the
class and the view in the same component
well that's cool but what if we want to
pass data from one component to the
other say for example we want to pass
data from this route component the app
component down into the home component
well we can do that using a custom
property binding and the input decorator
so that's what I'm going to do and I'm
going to show you that right now so
first of all let's open up the route
component which is this app component
and this is the class right here and
what I'm going to do is define some data
on this class that I'm going to pass
through into the home component I've
already copied that Summa clipboard so
I'm just going to paste it in it's a
simple object called ninja with a name
and a belt so I save that dude right now
and then I want to head into the app
component HTML father view for the route
component and this tag right here app
hole is where the home component is
getting loaded in and it's dumping all
this home component view stuff now we
want to pass this data that we just made
up on the route component class into the
home component and we do that via the
root component view here so we know when
we use property binding we can bind from
the component class into the component
view so that's what we're going to do
but this time we're going to bind it to
a custom property not already made HTML
one okay so let's do that let's make up
property and we'll call it ninja and to
use property Banyan we're going to use
these square brackets like that I'm
going to set it equal to a value and
that value is going to be this thing
that we just made up on the root
component class so let's copy it and
paste it in right here now we're going
to save it so now what we're doing is
saying whenever
we get this app whole tag and you're
loading the home component I want you to
also bind some data to this tag using a
custom property ninja and we're going to
bind that ninja object that we made on
the root component class right there
okay so we're passing this in now to the
home component but that's not enough for
us to use it in the home component just
yet first of all we need to use the
input decorator so when a component is
taking in data from another component we
need to use the import decorator to say
to that component look we're happily
going to take data from another
component we're going to have it input
to us okay we need to do that so the way
we do that is by going to the component
which is receiving the data in this case
it's going to be the home component and
we go into the class right here and we
use the input decorator by doing at
stand capital I input like so and then
the name of the object we want to expect
and it's just going to be the ninjas or
rather than ninja okay
so we're expecting to take in a variable
and it's going to be the ninja so now we
can use that ninja within this class but
before we do that we need to import
import as kind of like a dependency on
so we'll say input up here and that's
the only way it can use this input
decorated out here okay otherwise it
won't work
so now let's save this and let's go to
the whole component view and what we
want to do is output that ninja in here
but before I do that I've just noticed
an error and I think it's because I've
not added on the parentheses right here
yeah we need parentheses on that for it
to work and if I save now then hopefully
this error is going to go within a
second anyway after you've done that
head over to the home component review
and now we want to output this ninja
data you can see by the way the error is
gone now so let's just clean this up a
little bit I'm going to get rid of all
this stuff and I'll get rid of this
stuff as well
now let's output that ninja so we'll do
this in AP tag and what we'll do is use
string interpolation so we'll say ninja
dot name okay and that's right you
remember so ever save that now and view
this in a browser refresh it now we see
a ryu output right here and we can do
the same with the belt if i copy this
dude and paste it down below and change
this to belt ninja up belt we should see
red over here
cool there it is red awesome so now we
have passed data from the root component
where we initialize that data on the
class and we passed it down into the
hong coppola and then we could use it in
the home component so just to quickly go
over the steps we took to do that again
first of all we initialized our data on
the route component right here
that's simple then in the root component
view we used a custom property binding
to pass that data through into the app
hole component okay then in the home
component we used at input like this to
say we're expecting a variable input
into this component and that's called
ninja and we requite it there open the
import statement input then in the home
component view we just output it as
normal using string interpolation pretty
awesome so that's how we pass data from
one component to another and how we use
the input decorator in the next tutorial
i'm going to show you the opposite
director direction using custom events
binding so we can pass data from the
home component back up into the root
component any questions so far leave
those down below otherwise I'll see you
in the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
