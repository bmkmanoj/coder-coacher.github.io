sixth react tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you a quick way we can
cycle through data alright so in the
last tutorial we had a look at state and
we defined some data on the state object
and we output that in these a light X
right here now typically we're not going
to know how many different items are in
a particular array or something like
that we don't want to output data like
this we don't want to hard-coded in
because there might be five items or
there might be seven and we won't know
how many to code so we need an elegant
way of cycling through this data and
outputting it so we'll show you how we
can do that now I'm going to get rid of
these things and then what we're going
to do is create our own function right
here to manipulate the data and output
it differently we can do that in the
render function so to do this we're
going to use the JavaScript map function
and what the map function does is take
one a rate changes it in somewhere other
and then outputs it to a new array so
say for example we wanted to create a
new array based on this one where it
took the items within the array and then
put an exclamation mark on the end of
each item like this well we can do that
using the map function the map function
cycles through each item alters it in
some way and outputs that item to a new
array so let's do that
to output the data so it's all going to
be complete once we create this function
so first of all what we going to do is
create a variable within this render
function right here right and this is
going to be called to do so I'm making a
local variable a local version of this
data right here so I'm going to set that
equal to this state dot - duze okay so
this now is a local version of this data
we can manipulate it because we don't
want to change this we want to keep this
as is so below that what I'm going to
say is - duze equals - duze dot map this
is where we're going to map this array
into a new Bob and the map function
takes through another function as an
argument and these item and index are
two arguments of this function so this
is the actor so it will be the string
each case and this is the index of that
item in the array sub 0 1 or 2 ok so
each time we cycle through an item in
this array we want to do something with
it we want to return something to the
new array so I'm going to return and
this is going to be some hexed emails
from Jo sexy VI and it's going to be a
lie and it's going to be item so without
putting the item in those curly braces
because it's the reference to a variable
and the item don't forget is this thing
right here so each time we go through
one of the elements we're going to
return Li and then the item okay so this
is now being mapped to a new array where
it's going to be Li item close Li Li
item close ally etc alright so that's
how a new array now so now what we can
do is just simply output the two dues
like this copy that right here because
this now contains all the Li tags make
sense so now it doesn't matter whether
we've got three items in here or 30
items in here it's going to use the map
from function to cycle through each one
and output them into a new array with
the HTML tags included so now when we
reference it here it has all those Li
tags included cool right so let's save
this dude and make sure it's worked
check it out in a browser and yep it's
still working and now let's add another
what we'll just say by flowers let's
save that and as we save it it's going
to reload and yet we can see that as
well pretty cool so now this is all
working fine so there we go that's how
we cycle through our data and output it
to the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
