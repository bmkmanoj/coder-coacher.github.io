I'm mrs. HTML basics lesson eight
default browser styles now I know that I
said in the last episode that we'd be
covering images in this lesson and we
will very shortly I just wanted to do a
very quick lesson about default browser
styles because I know I've mentioned it
a couple of times in previous tutorials
I certainly will be doing again in
future tutorials so I want to make sure
that you understand 100% what I'm
talking about when I say this so it's
going to be like three minutes tops
and it's going to be really beneficial
to know this so I'm going to jump back
over into the file that we've been
working on and here I am back in
brackets and this is the HTML document
that we've been working on all the way
through this tutorial it's not changed
one bit since the last episode so all I
need to do is open this back up in a
browser and we'll do this in Google
Chrome and there we go we've seen
exactly the same web page that we saw in
the last episode and we can see our
heading at the top it's quite bold and
then we've got a paragraph tag that tag
we've got a h2 here a couple of h3s some
more paragraphs and you can see that
it's all got these this kind of default
styling to it I'm going to say that I
mean that this h1 is very large and very
bold this P paragraph is quite small
just large enough for the user to read
because it is just a paragraph then
we've got the h2 which is slightly
smaller than the h1 and then the h3
smaller again and so forth so what this
is is the browser looking at the
document and it's saying okay well I've
got all these different tags here now I
want the user who is viewing this he
heir of this webpage to know the
difference between each tag so it's
looking at the h1 and it's saying well
this is an important heading so I'm
going to make this really bold and big
which it does and we've got that right
at the top then it's looking at the
paragrafix saying well you know this is
just a paragraph so I'm going to make
this kind of like standard sized text
and it does that and then it's looking
at the h2 it's saying well this isn't
quite as important as the h1 so I'm
going to reduce that font size just a
little bit and same for the h3 and for
the rest of the tags that we use so this
you can think of this is like the the
browser having this default CSS
stylesheet and all these default Styles
within this stylesheet the things that
are giving these elements the different
kind of variations the the different
font sizes the different font weights
the spacing between the elements that
kind of thing so that if there's no CSS
the user can still look at the webpage
and it's very readable and every browser
has its own kind of default styles this
is Google Chrome's
Firefox has their own version so does
internet explorer and so on however
they're all pretty much the same there's
not much that kind of varies between
them so there we go and this has been
default browser styles I hope you
understand that now and if you don't
just give me a comment down below I'll
answer all your questions if you like
these videos make sure you subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next lesson
where we will be doing images see you
guys then
