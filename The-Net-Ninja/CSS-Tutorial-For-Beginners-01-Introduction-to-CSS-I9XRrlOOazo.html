and this is CSS for beginners lesson 1
ah so in this video I just want to talk
about a couple of things the first one
is what you need to know before you
start this course and secondly just a
brief overview of everything we're going
to be covering in this course so first
of all what do you need to know well not
a lot just a little bit of HTML and this
is not exactly necessary but it's going
to benefit you a lot as we go through
this course now I've done it course on
HTML basics I'll pop the link to that in
the description below so you can click
that and perhaps maybe go through this
course before you come back to this one
so what are we going to be covering in
this course well first of all we're
going to take a quick look at what CSS
actually is and the part it plays in
creating websites next we're going to
take a look at CSS syntax and it's
pretty simple so you're going to grasp
that pretty quickly and then we're going
to dive into the different types of
selectors we use in CSS now there's tons
of selectors and we don't have time to
cover every single one but we're going
to take a look at most of them next
we're going to look at formatting some
text we're going to look at colors and
backgrounds different things like that
and then we're going to take a closer
look at the box model which concerns
things like padding and margin that kind
of thing finally once we learn enough
we're going to put it all together and
we're going to style up a complete HTML
or web page so that's about it for this
introduction video I hope you're ready
to take this course we're going to take
your skills from zero to ninja in about
35 or so lessons don't forget to
