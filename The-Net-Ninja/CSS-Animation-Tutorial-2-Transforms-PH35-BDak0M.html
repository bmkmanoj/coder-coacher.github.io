CSS animation tutorial and in this video
we're going to briefly talk about
transforms ah okay then gang so this
tutorial is primarily aimed at those
that don't know what CSS transforms if
you've got a good understanding of them
then feel free to move on because I'm
probably going to be going over old
ground for you guys but if you don't
know what they are then transforms
pretty much do what they say they do on
the tin
they just transform your web elements in
all kinds of weird and wonderful ways
right so we can use transforms to either
stretch the element or change the
coordinates of an element skew an
element or rotate it and we can do all
this without ever having to alter the
normal document flow so it's super
flexible and we can make good use of
them when we come to make our own
animation so what I'm going to do in
this tutorial is just bring you up to
speed if you don't already know about
them cover a few basic examples and then
we're going to use those in later
tutorials when we talk about custom
animations alright so as you can see
I've opened up this index.html file
right here and all I've done is added
this image right here of a cloud which
is borrowed from the Mario examples
folder here alright so just stick that
in medium for now then we'll zoom over
to this style dot CSS file right here
and the first thing I want to do
actually is just give a background color
to this product because I cannot see
that cloud so I'm just going to say
background is like blue much like the
sky here in Manchester I wish so the
next thing you want to do is say text
align and I'm going to take Center just
to centralize that cloud pretty cool
alright so now let's apply some
transforms to this cloud so I'll just go
after the image because that's the only
image on this page so it's just going to
target that and the CSS property we want
to use is transform and that's it all of
our transforms will happen within this
CSS property alright so there's quite a
few different options and I've not got
time to go through them all in this
video but I'm going to go through a few
of the more basic ones that we're going
to use in the animations and to be
honest if you understand these then
you're going to understand everything I
do later in the tutorial
series all right so the first thing I
want to show you is translate and
translate just means move the element
from one position to another on the
webpage so if I want to translate it
across to the right I can use translate
X okay if I want to move it along the y
axis I can use translate Y so let's take
a look at those I'll say translate and
you can see these translate X&amp;amp;Y among
these other options are already there so
I'll say translate X and I'll say 200
pixels and that's going to take a cloud
and it's going to shove it 200 pixels
over to the right okay and I recently
stun it to the right is because this is
a positive integer and it's gone along
the x axis to the right if I made this
negative it's going to zoom to the left
all right
so positive to the right negative to the
left all right let's change this to Y
and see what happens
now it goes down to Gepetto's instead of
going right okay and saying goes if I
change this to a minus it's going to
zoom up off the screen pretty much going
upwards all right so that is translate
and if we take away the Y or the X then
it can take two values if you just put
one value in it's just going to
translate it along the x axis but if we
put two values in so I'm saying man is
240 x-axis if I say now 200 pixels for
the y axis that's going to zoom down as
well so we can control the x and y in
one fell swoop
all right so that is the transform or
sorry the translate value in a nutshell
the next thing I want to show you is the
scale value so let's say scale and what
scale does is just scale the element
okay it makes it bigger or smaller so
again we can do scale X or scale Y I'm
going to do scale X to begin with and
that's just going to kind of stretch it
or shrink it along the x axis depending
on what we put in it if we put in one
it's going to do nothing this is saying
we want a one-to-one scale all right but
anything above one is going to stretch
it anything less than one down to zero
is gonna shrink it so let's do first of
all three that's going to make it three
times as big all right if we say no
point five that's going to make it twice
as small all right
and we can do the same with the y-axis
as well so we'll say scale Y and that's
just going to shrink it along the y axis
again if I make this a positive integer
over 1 that is going to stretch it along
the y axis off the page in fact all
right and much like we could combine
them with the translate value we can do
the same thing with scale we take off
the Y and if we just pass in one number
that scales it along the X and y this
time okay so it's three times as big on
the x axis and three times as big along
the y axis if we pass in two numbers
it's the X first then the Y okay so that
is the scale value we use that to either
shrink or stretch and element and the
next thing I want to show you is the
rotate okay and again we can have x y&amp;amp;z
now these are quite hard to see when we
use x and y so if I say rotate X right
what this is going to do is rotate it
along the x axis so you imagine a line
going across right here
okay and it's on the x axis now you know
when you see those things where they put
a pig
on one of those kind of roasting poles
and they turn it that's what will happen
if we use rotate X it's going to kind of
rotate it along the x axis imagine it
turning into the page so we can't really
see 3d so the only effect we're gonna
see is the height of this getting
smaller essentially right so we might
put in 60 degrees and we say deg is
going to get smaller because it's
starting to rotate along that x axis and
the portion that we can see straight on
reduces essentially okay all the way up
until a 90 degrees which is virtually
impossible to see now because it's just
a flat shape that's rotating along the x
axis that's all it would take this above
90 degrees it's going to start to appear
again the other way around as it comes
around okay something similar can be
said for the y axis if I put in Y here
then we're going to start rotating along
the y axis which is downwards so again
it's just going to shrink this way as we
go up to 90 degrees so if I put in 60
shrinks a little bit as it starts
rotate around the y axis which runs this
way remember and then as I get to 90
it's going to be virtually impossible in
fact it is impossible and as you'll get
a bullet out here it starts to show
again and the further we go up the more
it shows okay so that's rotate Y finally
we can use rotate Z as well and this is
a better kind of visual effect the z
axis runs in and out of the page like a
3d pole like skewering into the page and
coming out of it right so when we rotate
around that it's going to rotate either
clockwise this way or anti-clockwise
this way depending on the value that we
give it if we give it a positive value
saying 90 degrees it's just going to
flip this 90 degrees clockwise if we say
180 degrees is going to basically turn
it upside down all the way up to 360
degrees where it's going to bring it
right back round to the start pretty
much right if we do a minus number we'll
say minus 45 is going to move it around
oops not fortune 50 around to the left
going anti-clockwise minus 90 brings it
that way etc etc you get the point
okay so we've applied a few different
transforms here and we can actually
apply more than one at a time so we've
used so far translate we've used scale
and rotate what if we want to do all
three and one go well we can just kind
of chain them together so I'm saying
first of all I want to rotate it by
minus 90 degrees then I want to
translate it along the y axis by today
200 pixels and then finally and by the
way because we've rotated it first of
all translate Y now moves this way okay
if we didn't rotate this let's take this
out it's going to go down here but
remember the the z axis runs through the
middle and when we translated it along
the y axis by 200 pixels the axis point
is still here
the beginning point right and we've
moved it down now the z axis running
through the point here is being turned
by minus 90 degrees okay so it's moving
or minus 90 this way so
that's why it does that so let's pop
that back in rotate Z if I can spell it
right something like that okay rotate Z
and minus 98 degrees okay so that's why
it's like that it's rotated from here
open there like that and then we can
also use a scale one and we'll say two
okay so now we've chained these three
together just in one line like that and
it works sequentially so the first thing
to happen is this and then this happens
on the result of this then this happens
on the results of this so forth
alright so order does sometimes matter
so there is your whirlwind tour of
transforms and pretty much we're not
going to be doing anything other than
what we've covered here and if we do I'm
going to tell you about it at the time
but if you do want to read more about it
then this is a pretty nice website for
it w3schools
so I'll leave the link to this down
below and there's a few nice examples
and some more information about
transforms on this page so I'll feel
free to go I've read through that and
then I'll see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
