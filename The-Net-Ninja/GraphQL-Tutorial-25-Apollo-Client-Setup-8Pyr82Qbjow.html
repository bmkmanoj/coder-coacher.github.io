with graph QL on the front end and be
able to make graph QL queries to our
server we'll need to use what's known as
a graph to our client so the graph QL
client we'll be using is called Apollo
so much like when we're making HTTP
requests to restful api so we could use
a front-end library like Axios or even
jquery to help us make those requests
when it comes to graph QL in order to
make queries to the server we'll need to
use a graph QL client Apollo and it
doesn't matter that we're using react on
the front end here
it could be view GS or angular instead
we'd still need a graph to our clients
help us make those queries from the
front end up to the graph to our server
so in our react app here will be
creating queries much like we did in
graphical before and then feeding them
through the graph QL client Apollo which
will send the request to the server the
service then going to respond feed the
data back to our graph cue our client
Apollo which will then pass it back into
our react application so you can think
of the graph QL client as the thing
that's in charge with a passage of data
between the front end and the server
right like a data pack horse or
something now there's a few different
clients we can use like I said the one
we're going to use is called Apollo
client which is very widely used and
quite well documented as well so then
let's take a look at the Apollo website
to see how we can set it up inside our
react up alright then so I'm here on the
Apollo graph QL website and this is kind
of like a QuickStart installation guide
so I'm gonna leave this link down below
for you to check out but essentially
this is how we get started with Apollo
and react now we have to install a few
different things here right and there's
two different options we can either do
NPM install Apollo clients plus all of
this other different stuff as well and
save those all we can do NPM install
Apollo boost which includes several
different packages we're going to need
and bundles them together including the
Apollo client we just talked about and
it also wants us to install react Apollo
which is kind of like a glue layer to
buying Apollo
react and also graph QL which is the
JavaScript implementation of graph QL so
those three things right there this is
the option we're gonna do so I'm just
going to copy that dude and open up my
console and I'm gonna cancel out of this
process for now pressing yep and I'll
paste this in so I'm gonna install those
three packages right here okay so now we
have those installed we can go ahead and
start setting up Apollo in our react
application so let's head over now to
the code and open up our routes
component right here at Jas and the
first thing we're going to do is up here
imports Apollo clients which we just
installed from Apollo boost right
remember Apollo boost was that package
that bundles certain different things
that we need together and one of those
things is the Apollo client okay so
we're importing that first of all and we
need to now set up our Apollo client so
if I will do that below components down
here so a little comment and I'll say
Apollo client setup all right so let's
create a constant and call this client
and set this equal to a new Apollo
client like so and this Apollo client is
going to take some options one of those
is a URI so this is going to be the
endpoint that we're making requests or
queries to okay remember we set that up
in the first half of this series and it
was localhost 4000 forward slash graph
QL that was the supercharged endpoint
that handles all of our graph QL queries
so let's pass that in here so HTTP
double dot forward slash localhost and
it was colon 4000 forward slash graph QL
like so okay so now that's pretty much
it we set up our Apollo client now
Apollo knows that we're going to be
making requests to this endpoint from
our application all right but we also
need to do one more thing inside this
app JS file to set or
Apolo and that thing is first of all to
import the Apollo provider from oops
react - Apollo alright
so react Apollo is the thing that's kind
of binding Apollo to react it helps
react understand Apollo on what it's
doing right and we need the Apollo not
prove the Apollo provider to wrap our
application and inject whatever data we
receive from the server into our
application right so the way we do this
is by surrounding all of our template
right here with a tag and this tag is
going to be the Apollo provider type so
Apollo like so provider and then if we
need to say what client this is going to
be using and it's gonna be this one
right here that we just created so we
can just copy and paste it up down here
like so but we have to output it not in
quotations
but dynamically using these little curly
braces this is how we dynamically output
data in a react component right so let's
place that in there and then close this
off we need to also put a closing tag at
the end so close that Apollo tagged
Apollo provide attack if I can spell it
all right Apollo provider like so we're
just gonna scoot this up a little bit
just to get the indentation roughly
right now okay that'll do whatever so
now we have our Apollo client created
right we're registering that on the
floor intent here to say we're making
requests to this endpoint from this
application then what we're doing is
importing the Apollo provider from react
Apollo which is surrounding our entire
app here right and that is what enables
us to get the data from this endpoint
and inject it into whatever is inside
the Apollo provider ok so it's taking
the data from Apollo when it receives it
from the server and injecting it into
our application right so we can use it
inside here so there we go now we have
Apollo set up in our application on the
front end and we
in the next tutorial let's move on a
start to actually create these queries
from the front end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
