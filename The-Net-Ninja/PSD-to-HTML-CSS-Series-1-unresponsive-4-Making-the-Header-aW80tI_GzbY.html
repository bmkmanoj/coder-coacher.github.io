PSD to HTML and CSS series 1a lesson 4
and today I want to talk about the
header and how we can create this in the
HTML Wow alright then guys so in the
last lesson we ended up with something
like this in HTML dead simple
we created the general structure which
consisted of a header for this strip at
the top the lead banner for this thing
here the main content div which
contained three sections which represent
these three sections here all right so
what I want to do in this lesson is just
concentrate on this strip at the top
which is this header so let's open this
up a little bit and the first thing I'm
going to do is create a div with a class
of a wrapper and I'm going to explain
this to you in a second okay so you see
this design right here the black strip
goes from the very left edge here to the
very right edge but the content within
it this bit the logo and the navigation
is contained within the central column
yet that's what this did with a class of
wrapper is going to represent it's going
to keep all this content within a
central column so we're going to use it
throughout the document we'll use it in
the header here we'll use it in the lead
banner for this stuff here and in each
of these sections from the content here
okay so that's what the wrapper is all
about next thing I want to do is create
a h1 for this logo and the reason I'm
giving it a h1 is because it's kind of
like the header over the whole page this
tells us what this page is is green
design yeah so it deserves a h1 tag
let's give that an ID of a logo and it's
got an ID because we're only using it
once on the page and then within the h1
I'm gonna say green design and right now
guys you're probably thinking what the
hell is this dude on this is an image
not text why is he writing queenly sign
and the reason is this I'm doing it for
screen readers if a screen reader views
your web page it's not going to see
images it will read text however so this
is for the benefit of that in the CSS
for desktop users we can hide the text
and replace it with an image in the
background property for the h1 so we
kill two birds with
on stones I'd prefer to do it this way
other people prefer to the other way
inside of your choice this is how I'm
gonna do it
all right then next thing I'm going to
do is create a nav element and that's a
html5 element that's kind of new to HTML
and within this we're going to do a ul
time now before that in fact I'm going
to do h2 and that's because normally in
html5 the nav element expects a head
within it again we can hide this in the
CSS because it's not on the design but
again it's beneficial to screen readers
we'll just give this a text property or
the text inside of main navigation cool
now this UL is going to contain our
links in each li tag we'll do our a text
for the links and we're not going to
give this a hate ref value because we're
not going to make any of the pages so
this really doesn't matter at the minute
but we will write in the text and also
guys if I had these guides you're gonna
notice these little green things right
here yeah in fact I'll zoom in for you
okay blah blah blah zoom in can you see
these little green things right here I'm
gonna contain those within a span tag
all right so it can style or separately
later on now I'm gonna zoom out so I can
see what these links are all right then
so let's copy this one and we need to
paste it in another four times and we'll
just change the text of each one so
that's about this is portfolio next one
is clients got lots of them and the
final one is contact all right perfect
so there we go guys that is the header
complete in the HTML get simple right
and all we need to do now is stand this
baby up in the CSS we're going to do
that later but in the next video what I
want to do is concentrate on this lead
Bunner I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
