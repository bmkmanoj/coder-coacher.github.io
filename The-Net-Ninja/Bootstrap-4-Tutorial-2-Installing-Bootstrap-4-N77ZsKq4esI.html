second bootstrap 4 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how to
install and get started with a big
truffle ok so the first thing you want
to do is head over to the bootstrap 4
website at this link right here I'll
leave that down below and then you want
to click download bootstrap so there's
various different ways we can download
and use bootstrap in our project because
you have package managers such as NPM
rubygems composer and all the
instructions for these different things
are on this page or we can download the
files directly so there's two options
here we can download the bootstrap CSS
and J's libraries that's the compiled
finished libraries or we can download
the source files which includes all the
different sass files so I'm just going
to show you the difference between those
two downloads I've already done that for
you and you can see the top option
this one right here download bootstrap
this gives us the compiled libraries the
finished product here alike so we've got
three different options in the CSS
folder right here we can use the
bootstrap whole CSS file or we can use
just a bootstrap grid or just the
bootstrap reboot so we can include those
in our projects as we like or the second
option which was to download all the
source files and that gives us access to
all these different sass files and each
sass file basically comprises of the
rules for one particular component if
you like on one section of the bootstrap
library for example the Jumbotron or
forms or grids etc so you can access all
those independently then just load them
into asset pipeline as you wish ok or
the other option and by far the easiest
option to get started is the CDN so we
can use this link right here for the
stash II and this link right here for
the JavaScript because we need to
JavaScript with some of the more
interactive components of the bootstrap
library so what I'm going to do is
actually none of these I'm just going to
head to the top again and go to
introduction and if I go to start a
template right here you're going to see
this HTML that gives us and this is kind
of like a little template to get us up
and running with bootstrap really
quickly so I'm going to copy all this go
to assume
I'm going to create an index file first
of all polish index dot HTML and I'm
going to paste all this in here so just
quickly what's going on we've got a
doctype and hit star x then we're going
to add a lesser meta tag right here now
this one here is the viewport tag and
that's going to make sure that
everything we do is bootstrap renders
correctly on mobile or smaller devices
okay
then we've got the bootstrap Seafarer
CSS right here and this is so we can use
all the bootstrap classes for grid
layouts utilities that kind of thing
then we've got a body and h1 and then
down here at the bottom we've got three
script tags and notice we've got jQuery
first then tether then bootstrap so
these here are third-party libraries
jQuery and tether and we need to use
them before the bootstrap one because
some of bootstraps JavaScript relies on
jQuery and terror so the bootstrap one
has to come afterwards okay so once
you've got this index file all set up
then we're ready to start using
bootstrap and we're going to start in
the various tutorial by taking a look at
the reboot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
