CSS positioning lesson 9 and in this
video we're going to talk about
absolutely positioning elements Wow
alright then going so this is exactly
where we left off in the last lesson we
gave each one of these boxes here a
position of relative and we just nudge
them down a little bit to give this
stare effect and that's what we said
that position relative can do it can
tweak the position of the elements to
the top left bottom or right we also
said that it had another use and that's
what it's being used in conjunction with
the absolute position property now when
we say a element is positioned
absolutely it means just that it means
we can position it absolutely anywhere
on a page right and the way it works is
this we position it absolutely relative
to the parent element which has a
position relative attached now that
might sound like gobbledygook at the
minute so I'm going to do an example to
demonstrate this what I'm going to do is
jump up to the top right here above the
services and I'm going to create a
banner so just a div tag with an ID of
banner like that and then within that
we're going to do an image which is
going to be that cloud image I used a
few lessons back so it's just cloud JPEG
is right here and the width is going to
be 100% like that and then underneath
I'm gonna do h2 I'm just going to say
blue sky thinking don't you just love
that quote alright okay so what I want
to do is take this h2 and position it
over this banner so it's somewhere here
right so it's like the banner although
the text is part of the banner now to do
that I'm going to use the
position:absolute property but before I
do that I just want to neaten up this
banner a little bit so I go after that
banner ID and I'll say max height is 300
pixels and the overflow to the hidden
now you'll see it's only this high and
the bottom of the picture
the h2 is currently hidden then what
I'll do is give it a margin of one
percent just to neaten it up a little
bit like that
alright then so now we're going to
position this h2 so same again I want to
get the banner and target h2 within it
and I'm going to give this a position of
relative and the first thing you're
gonna show me not relative absolute the
first thing you're going to notice is
that it's now there you can see it right
we've taken it out of normal document
flow whereas position relative remains
rather it keeps an element in normal
document flow when you position
something absolutely it removes that
element from normal document flow okay
so now if I was to say top zero and left
zero that's going to position this h2
absolutely relative to the edge of the
document like this because the top we're
saying zero from the top and zero from
the left and there is this little space
at the top but that's just a margin of
the h2 if we say margin zero is going to
remove that okay
so we're absolutely positioning that
currently relative to the document
itself but what I want to do is position
it relatively to this banner okay and I
want this to be the top zero and left
zero point make sense right because I
want it in the middle of this bundle so
what I need to do is give this banner ID
a position of relative and now when I
give this a position of absolute it's
absolutely positioning it relative to
this banner because that's its parent
element and it has a position of a
relative okay make sense now then we can
get rid of that left property because we
don't need that and what I'm going to do
is say I want it 30 pixels from the top
and then I'm going to set its width to
100%
like that and I'm going to text the line
it to the center so it scoots over to
the middle and then color it's going to
be white alright then guys that is it
now we have our h2 in the middle of the
banner and isn't that just the best
banner ever seen
I mean that's brilliant so guys that is
how we position something absolutely I
remember when we position something
absolutely it removes it for normal
document flow alright so if you have any
questions about this whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next video where we're going to be
taking a look at position fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
