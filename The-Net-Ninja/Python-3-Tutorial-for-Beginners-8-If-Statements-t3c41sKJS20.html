eighth titan-3 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about if
statements alright then so what is in
this statement and why the hell would
you want to use one well in basic terms
an if statement allows us to control the
flow of our code based on certain
conditions for example if that condition
is true then it won't perform this bit
of code if it's not then I don't so it
follows this cause and effect model and
this happens in real life as well if I'm
tired I go take a nap
if you defecate in public you get
arrested so we're taking this cause and
effect model and we're pushing it or a
write into Python and we're saying okay
at some point during this program I want
to check a certain condition for example
is the age variable equal to a number
that is 10 if it is then I want you to
execute this portion of cold if it's not
then I don't want you to execute that
portion of code and we'll do something
else instead so it's putting a fork in
the road if you like and branching off
into two different directions based on
certain conditions so that's what if
statements are all about and we're going
to do a couple of examples now so the
first thing we want to do is get the
user involved I'm going to ask the user
for that age and store it in a variable
so we'll say age is equal to inputs to
ask the user something and we're going
to ask them to enter your age all right
now remember when we entered eight over
here in the console it's stored in this
variable as a string by default now we
might want to use it as an integer and
that makes sense because age is a number
so to do that we need to perform a bit
of typecasting and we know how to do
that we know how to turn something into
an integer we just use the Imps method
so take int and then open our brackets
and close our brackets after this thing
so anything within the brackets ie the
results for this import right here is
going to be turned into an integer then
it's stored in this variable cool so now
we have our age let's do some checking
if age is equal to something or greater
than something so the way we do an if
statement is by saying if then we place
our condition or our exploration
here what do we want to evaluate well we
want to check if the age is less than 10
so this is going to return either true
or false right here if it returns true
then we're going to execute a portion of
code if it returns false we're not okay
so that is the expression now what we
need to do is place a colon after this
to denote this is the end of the
expression and now we're going to enter
a code block that will execute if this
is true so the code block goes right
here what code do we want to run and now
is this thing the code block is indented
it's not flushed to the left this
wouldn't work in plighted person expects
the code block in an if statement to be
indented okay so now what we're going to
do if this is true if age is less than
10 all I want to do is print a message
to the console so I'll just say you are
young strange one all right so let's
give this a whirl what I'm going to do
is say title and then I'm going to rule
the eve underscore LS py file so enter
your age I'll say nine then we get this
message back you are going strange one
and that's because this has evaluated to
true because nine is less than ten so if
we enter something that's over ten let's
run this file again we'll say it 11 now
we don't get that message printed to the
console and also if we enter 10 itself
we still don't get that message because
10 is not less than 10 makes sense cool
so that's a basic if statement now
there's more to it we can add on
something called Alice all right so what
does this do well it lets us check
another condition so if this is false
and this doesn't want then we can move
on to check another condition okay and
this is different than just coming down
here and saying okay well I want to do
another if statement just imagine this
scenario we'll take out Ellie for now
we'll check if age is less than 40 right
and then underneath here we do something
so imagine we enter an age which is five
then we're going to run this code and
this is verifying way to true and it
will print this then it's going to
evaluate this and it will print this as
well it would do this now what if we
only want one things happen either this
or this this won't work right so that's
why we'd use an Aleph
so we're saying right here if we type in
Elif then we can say age is less than 40
now what's going to happen is if this is
true then it's going to print this and
it's not even going to move on to this
it's just going to skip it and carry on
down the code down here okay but if this
is false then it moves on to the next
condition Elif which stands for LC so
what we're going to do in here we're
going to print something else out we'll
say print the fire in you is strong
strange one do not ask me why I'm doing
the oldest alcohols
do not know so let's run this now we'll
enter our age to be 11 and now we get to
sign a new be strong strange one so this
is false skipping it and this is through
their fault printing it okay
now there's one more thing I want to
show you which is an else all by the way
you can add up as many elif's as you
want you could say LF age is less than
60 you know do something else you can do
as many as you want but for now I'm just
going to say else and this is the third
little keyword I wanted to show you so
what does this mean well it means if
this is false and literally false well
I'll tell you what I just want you to
default to this code block right here
this is kind of like a catch-all right
else so if none of these conditions are
true we're going to execute this in one
of these conditions are true we don't
ask you this so in this control we're
just going to print something out here
we're going to assume that over 40 and
we'll say something like you are wise
beyond the spell yet doubt 3-1 all right
okay so let's run this again this time
I'm going to say 45 which is over 10 and
over 40 now we get this message you I've
wives beyond doubt strange one and I'll
just run this one more time and
se6 and we still just get the one
message cool let's just clean this up a
bit that's a clip okay cool so that is
an if statement right a basic kind of
if/elif/else statement I want to go
through one more example now so I've
come in all of the out and in fact will
comment this age out as well up here and
now what I want to do is check if a user
is a meat-eater on up so I'm creating a
new variable called meaty and say is
equal to input and then I'll say do you
eat meat and a 1 an answer which is
either going to be yes unnoticeable let
them know we're expected of Y or in it
all right
so either Y or n is to be stored in here
now then we'll do another if statement
to check whether a user enters Y or not
so we'll say if and then me T is equal
to Y remember we have to say this in a
string because it's stored in the string
we can't just say is equal to Y that
doesn't really mean anything it has to
be a string so which active meat is
equal to Y and this equal to is a
comparison operator so before we had
greater than but that doesn't make sense
or rather less than but that doesn't
make sense in this example we're
checking if what they've entered is
equal to Y and it's to equal size to do
that it's not just one equal sign
because this is an assignment operator
which say something like age equals 5
right that's an assignment when we use
one equal sign to check if something is
the same we used double equal signs so
that's our condition which is going to
return true or false if is true then we
want to do a code block right here
so we want to give them a meat menu
based on this because they've entered
yes they do eat meat so save print and
then here is the meaty menu all right
now we can just do an else and it can
presumably put know or something else
but hopefully know if this is not true
right here because they're not interred
yes so now down below we'll just say
print and here is the veggie menu okay
so let's run this and see if it works
oops not click item if lfd you eat yep
here it deletes menu and we're going to
get do you eat meat
nope here is the veggie menu okay so
there's two examples now of Eve
statements now I said to you before and
I just run through a few different
comparison operators with you and show
you what they are so let's do a comment
up here called operators and then down
here another comment so we've only seen
less than right to check if a value is
less than something we can also use link
to them as well as that we can use
equals which is this thing right here
we've checked in a value is equal to
something we can also do the opposite of
this which is not equal exclamation mark
and then an equal sign so this right
here means is me t not equal to Y so if
I entered Y in there and meet it is
equal to Y and this would be false
if I am said n in here then meeting is
not equal to Y this will be true make
sense
cool we can also use is equal to or
greater and we can also use is equal to
or less than so for example if this R is
equal to or less than if we entered 10
then this would be true whereas before
if we just did this then it wasn't true
so there we go those if statements in a
nutshell we have to be using them more
frequently as we go through the rest of
this playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
