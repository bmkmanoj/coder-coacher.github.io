23rd bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at panels
Wow alright then guys so bootstrap gives
us yet another way to kind of display
our content and that is via panels now
if we use a panel essentially what we're
doing is just kind of boxing our content
into some kind of panel like a box and
it can look pretty nice so I'm gonna
make these things right here you see
these four little things I'm gonna make
these into panels but we'll start with
just the first one now what we need to
do this is all this
HTML right here each one of these divs
is one of those things you can see when
I highlight a div it kind of highlights
over it yeah so we're just gonna start
with this first one over here this ninja
one and essentially what we need to do
when we use a panel is place all the
content that we want to be in the panel
within a div right so we'll put a div
first of all and we also need to give
this a class equal to panel right as
well as giving it the panel class we
also need to give it a contextual class
remember contextual classes of those
things like a default or warning or
danger or primary those kind of things
I'm just gonna go with default so it's
panel - default like that okay
so we'll close that off and we'll put
the end div tag
right at the bottom over there okay so
now this is in a panel and it looks
pretty cruddy so far just like a border
around it basically no spacing inside
but we also need to add some additional
dips as well now first of all we need to
add a div around the title or rather
this is optional I like to do this okay
so the div we need to add around has a
class of panel - heading okay then we'll
pop the end tag after the h1 because
this is the heading and scoot this in
okay so now you can see we get that kind
of gray background and it's padded out a
little bit but I think this is too big
and too spacious so we can add a class
onto the h1 which kind of reduces this a
little bit so let's give this a class of
panel - title oops
there we go and it just makes it a
little bit smaller like that now this is
all kind of preference if you wanted to
you could keep it big and you could just
reduce the padding in your own styles
I'm just going to use this panel title
class in this tutorial so next thing we
need to attack is this body tech because
currently it's got no padding so what we
need to do is place the body of our
panel inactive and we'll give this a
class of panel - body so let's close
that off and put the closing tag all
right at the end of the content all
right and now you can see it's just kind
of spaced out a little bit inside give
it all a bit of planet which looks
better now there's one more thing I want
to show you and that is the panel footer
so we're go ahead or a heading rather we
can also have a panel footer so I'm
going to do it quick give give it a
class equal to panel - footer like that
and then within this game what I'm going
to do is just a simple anchor tag each
graph equals whatever and then I'm going
to say moral info so this is if the user
wants to come here and click more info
about this they can just do so here
that's kind of you know what a footer
would before in this panel case it looks
very similar to the header but when we
change the contextual plus it does
change a little bit alright so that is a
panel guys let me in fact just change
that contextual class so you can see I
change this to primary like that and now
you can see the header changes to blue
and the border but this footer down here
stays great so there is some kind of
differential differentiation there now
I'm going to apply this to the rest of
these things right here but I'm not
going to do it to each one I'm just
going to copy and paste this thing right
here so everything within the column I'm
going to copy and I'm going to replace
these things here with that so one do
and
cool alright so there are puddles now if
we wanted we could give each one a
different contextual classlist just do
that so make them look a little bit
different so where's the first one the
first one is somewhere here panel
primary second one is here so we'll
change this to panel danger that's a red
ok well I say red black pink the next
one down here will change to warning
which is some kind of faded yellow ok
and then we'll change this last one to
success why not alright save that and
let's take a look alright so I mean in
this website doesn't particularly look
great but you get the idea you could use
this in your website somewhere else for
example if you've got a staff page it
could list each staff member and also
when you use things like tables and list
items within these panels they look
pretty nice as well because bootstrap
takes care of a lot of the styles for
you alright so there we go guys that is
how we make panels we have any questions
feel free to ask down below otherwise
guys don't forget to subscribe and all
that jazz and I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
