2015 3 tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about decorators okay now
so way back when we had looked at
classes we came across these strange
dudes right here where there's an that
symbol then a word class method and down
here as well at static method now at the
time I said do not worry about these
we'll talk about them at a later time
and that time is now so what happen well
these things are called decorators and
in Python decorators basically extends
the behavior of a function then it's
used on without modifying the function
itself and they used a lot in web
frameworks like jungle so you're going
to come across them at some point so it
makes sense to understand at least what
they are and the kind of things they do
so in this example this decorator is
going to be extending the behavior of
this function and this decorator is
going to be extending the behavior of
this function but they're not modifying
the function itself so to better
understand this what I want to do is
create our own decorator and use it on
our own function so I've gone ahead and
created this decorators py file and the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
function we can create a decorator to
use on so let's define that function and
I'm going to call this question and all
this function is going to do is ask a
question it's going to print it to the
console so let's do this print statement
and why should we ask for say can you
give me a discount on that so some
cheeky bugger is asking this question
now we're going to apply a decorator to
this function which means that we're
going to be extending the behavior of
this function but we're not editing the
function itself okay so if we use the
function without the decorator it works
fine as well so to apply a decorator to
a function we add it on top of it it
sits on top of the function so it starts
with that symbol and then we give this
decorator a name I'm going to call this
cough Dec for decorator so you know
sometimes when you ask a question but
you coughed before and after it like can
you give me a discount bit of an
embarrassing cough that is what this
decorator is going to do so now we need
to create these decorators so that it
can apply this kind of functionality to
this question
so let's create that okay so a decorator
is basically just a wrapper function
right it's a function itself so we
create a decorator by creating a
function and we're going to call this
cost underscore deck that is the name of
the decorator
it matches the name of this function
right so this right here takes in a
function and this function is going to
be listing down here the thing that it's
used upon so detecting this function and
it's going to wrap some extra behavior
around it make sense so in this function
what we need to do is actually define
another function and I'm going to call
it Foulke underscore wrapper right now
you can call this what you want but this
is the wrapper function that's going to
wrap around this function right here so
inside this what I will do is do a
little comment first of all I'm going to
say cold before function so before this
function runs we can apply some code
then what we're going to do is actually
fire the function itself by invoking it
that's the function we're passing it and
that's this function right here okay so
we can also run some code after function
down here okay so what do we want to do
well first of all what we want to do is
add a little cough before the question
so I'm just going to do a print
statement which is going to output and
it know something like this cough and it
needs to be in these dude right here and
the wife then the semicolon instead
alright so now we have this print
statement I also want to do the same
thing after the function so we're
coughing on both sides of the function
itself so what I've saved that now and
this isn't enough what we need to do is
return this thing right here this
function right so when we're using this
decorator on a function what happens is
this decorator of this function gets
called and the functions the decorator
sits on is passing right here then what
we're doing is we're defining some kind
of wrapper function and inside this
function we can wrap code around the
actual function it sits on this thing
down here
okay so we're extending the behavior of
this functionality everyone so once
we've done that then we need to return
this function right which is going to be
fired down here so that is now return
the func
underscore wrapper okay so this gets
returned so that when we use this
decorator we're basically firing this
func a wrapper function make sense and
we're applying this behavior on both
sides of the function now we don't have
to apply code before it or after it we
can do just one or the other if we want
to but we can do both so let me give
this a whirl what I'm going to do is run
this file in the console it's called
decorators p1 so when I run this and
we're not doing anything at the minute
because we've not called our function so
you can live so let's call that down
here question so now we're calling this
function right which has this decorator
applied to it so save that I'm running
again and now we get that cough cough on
either side so this decorator has been
applied now if we didn't have this here
then I save that now and from it we
don't get that behavior okay and the
cool thing is we can apply now this
decorator to any function it doesn't
have to be just this one term right here
so let's create a new function I'm going
to create one called
answer now so say def answer and inside
here we're going to do another print
statement and the print is gonna say
it's only 50 P you cheapskate alright so
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
do is use double quotes right here so we
don't escape out the string and what I'm
going to do is apply this decorator to
this function as well so now if we call
the answer after the function after the
question function then it should apply
this to both of the consecutively so now
we can see the cough cough above the
question and the cough cough of both and
below the answer so this is really cool
we're just defining this decorator once
creating this wrapper function which is
surrounding our function which we pass
in and then
can use this decorator on which ever
function we create from then on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
