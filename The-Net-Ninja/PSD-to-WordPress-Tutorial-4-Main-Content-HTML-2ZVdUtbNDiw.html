PSD to WordPress lesson 4 and in this
video we're going to start making the
home page HTML Wow alright the gang so
we left off here in the last tutorial we
did all the header section and we did
the footer section down below and we put
these comments in the middle which is
telling us where we're going to put the
main content for the whole page so
that's what we're going to do in this
lesson and the first thing I want to do
is create this banner right here now to
do that I'm going to create a div tag
with an ID of main - banner and the
reason I'm giving this an idea not class
is because there's only one of these on
the page typically when there's only one
of something on a page you can give it
an ID and when there's multiple of
something on a page you would give it a
class ok so we're given that an ID of
main banner and within that we need that
image which is stored in the images
folder and then forward slash banner
that's it right there we'll give this an
alt attribute of I don't know welcome to
a resto something like that and then
underneath that in fact that's done
that's it that's the main banner done
then we need to do this section right
here this menu section and I am going to
use a section tag for that now that
there my friends is a html5 tag and
basically we've use this whenever there
is a distinct section on a web page
now I'd call this a distinct section
because it's just all about the menu and
nothing else alright so we'll give that
a section tag and we'll give it an ID of
menu in fact we'll give it an idea of
whole - menu all right now like Navitus
the section tags expect a header
so we'll do a h2 and call this menu now
this hates - right here is going to
represent this thing here and yet this
is an image but we're going to do
exactly the same thing with this h2
right here as we did or we will do for
this logo h1 and so we're just going to
hide the text in the CSS and we're going
to replace it with a background image
which is going to be this but this my
friends is useful for screen reader
okay you don't see images so let's move
on to this menu then what we need to do
is create a new belt type now some
people would look at this and say okay
we're learning to ul tags one there and
one there but to me it's all one list
because it's all the same thing
essentially isn't it you've got 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 things they're all in the same
menu if these were two different parts
of the menu then perhaps I do to
separate you else but because they're
all kind of one thing I'm going to do
one ul and I'm just going to float these
elements to the left so this tag left to
right like that okay so one ul and then
within that we've got the alt text and
the first thing we need to do is a spam
tag with a class of dish and this is
going to be the dish name right there so
I'll pop that in which is vaalu envelope
tart a cilium or sillim foo yet i can't
pronounce that
Fuki but apologies for my Latin guys
that sounds beautiful anyway whatever it
is all right so the next thing we need
is this span with a class of price
that's gonna be this thing right here
and we're going to float that to the
left so let's give that three dollars
for now the next thing is going to be
this little description right here so
we'll do another spun and we'll give
this a class of description all right
and let's copy that text cheese tomato
mushrooms and I mean you know what that
does so pretty good actually
all right so that is one whole a my tag
now I'm not going to do that for every
single one because like if I already
establish guys I'm pretty lazy so I'm
just going to paste this down here four
times and another four to three or now
we've got eight and tall okay so we've
got our menu items right there I'm not
going to do this load more button
because to be quite honest
my restaurant is pretty small I've only
got one cork and he's not very good so
the most you can do is eight dishes
alright so we'll leave it at that for
this section all right the next section
we want to do is this featured dishes
section and again I'm going to use a
section tag for it because it kind of
stands alone right so let's give that an
ID of featured right and these things
right here are going to link to blog
posts and each blog post is going to be
essentially just a dish
tell you a little bit about that dish or
maybe a recipe or something or other
right which corresponds to these
thumbnails so we're going to hook all up
hook all this up later when we do the
blog and the WordPress side of things
but for now I'm just going to make an
unordered list just a UL tag and then
each one is gonna be an ally and then
within that Li we need an image with a
sauce we're not going to put that source
attribute in just yet because we're
going to control this dynamically later
through WordPress so there's no point in
is putting it in just yet
and in fact I'll tell you what I'll just
put one in and images and then form one
right I will just use the same one for
each Li tag for now right so the second
thing we need to do is a link
h/h sorry a href equals we don't need to
put a link in just yet and then the name
of that dish another since alright then
we need the price so we'll create a span
and put the price in $3 and then finally
we need a rating so we give this a class
of rating and then this is where our
star rating is going to go I don't need
to put anything in yet because again
this is going to be controlled all been
done I click via WordPress later on
alright so what I'll do is just copy and
paste that now so we've got four and
total all right so there we go
that's it guys we've done the home page
content as well or at least I
HTML so what we're going to do now is
dive into the CSS and we're going to
give everything we've done here some
style so it's start to look like this in
a browser close to be honest if I do
this right now
I just click this little link icon right
here which opens up a browser and it's
going to show me what we've done yet
this looks absolutely amazing so what
we're going to do is style all this up
in the next tutorial and yeah don't
forget to subscribe to catch all the
updates I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
