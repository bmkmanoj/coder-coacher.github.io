second grunt j/s tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna show you how we can
install grunt j/s okay there so who want
to start working with grunt then we're
going to have to go through a few
different steps to install it properly
and this might seem a little bit
daunting at first because there are
quite a few steps but believe me it's
only gonna take a few minutes so the
first step is to install nodejs
on our computer I remember I've left a
link down below if you want to check out
the playlist no just for beginners where
I'm going to show you how to install
that it's that simple I just got to know
JSO odd and download that from that so
install that and that's going to install
the NPM as well so we can use that now
to install the grunt CLI globally now
the grunt CLI is the grunt command-line
interface which means we can use group
commands in the terminal okay so we're
going to do that first in a minute then
we need to create a package.json file
because that's going to track our grunt
version and all of the group plugins
that we install then we're going to
install install groups locally into our
project so we're installing grunt CLI
globally so we can use the group
commands and then we're installing grunt
locally into our project so we've split
into two okay routes your I and then
group itself so that's so we can kind of
grunt if I our projects and use a grunt
file if any if you like so once we've
done that we'd go ahead and create a
grunt file JS file and this is going to
control all of our tasks we're going to
register tasks to run here and we're
also going to set up a configuration and
load plugins into this file you don't
have to understand much about it just
yet I'm going to explain this when we
come to create one and then finally it
we can install plugins to add the
functionality to our group file so that
we can do things like concatenate files
or minify files that kind of thing so in
this player this we're going to go
through all of these steps and we're
also going to go through some plug-in
examples so the first thing you want to
do like say install notes yes then we're
going to install the group CLI globally
so I'm going to come to my terminal by
the way this terminal is a plug-in or a
package for the Atem text editor which
I'm using here so if you want to
download that package it is called
platform a Oh IDE terminal okay so go
ahead and download that you can work in
there like me or alternatively you can
just open like PowerShell or CMD you
command prompts and you can work in
there as well okay just navigate to your
directory of your project and do that
using the CD command and then we can do
the same commands as we would here
alright so let's go ahead now and
install a grunts you lie globally so to
do that we just say NPM install grunts -
CLI and then I'm gonna do a little - and
a cheat and that means install this
globally
meaning we can use this wherever we want
on the computer we don't have to install
it every time we create a new project
so go ahead and do that and that's gonna
install ok so now we've done that we can
successfully use grunt commands but
first of all what I want to do next is
create a package.json file and if you've
seen my node series you'll know that a
package.json file just tracks all your
dependencies and other information about
your project so I'm going to install so
I create a package.json file by typing
in npm in it and this is going to throw
up a series of questions I'm just going
to speed through all of these in a
second so the name grunt playing this
that's fine 31 the description note
entry point we'll call this up got J s
in fact what I'm gonna do is just delete
these lowboys now because we don't need
these anymore
okay so apt is he's gonna be my entry
point test come on we don't have one get
rid box recapping bothered keywords no
or for me license fine this okay yep
okay so now we have created a
package.json file you can seen up there
now and if i open this you can see two
properties right here dependencies and
dev dependencies so we're gonna track
all of our grunt packages in this def
dependencies property okay and i'll show
you how we do that later on but let's go
back to our list we've done a
package.json file now now we need to
install a grunt local it so let's go
ahead and do that I'm going to say npm
install
glutes and I'm gonna pass a save flag
and a - death so what this is gonna do
is install grown into our project okay
it's gonna save it in this package dot
JSON file right here and it's gonna save
it in the dev dependencies okay because
I passed through that - dev flag or
option as well okay cool so now you can
see that group has been installed into
our project and it's listed as a dev
dependency right here currently we're on
those your 1.0.1 cool so let's go back
to the list we've created package.json
file installed locally now we need to
create a group file J s and the group
file j s is where we control the
configuration of our plugins that we
install and also where we register tasks
that we want to run and I know this
might not be making much sense just yet
but as we dive into that file it's gonna
make a lot more sense
I promise yes so I'm just gonna right
click up here go to new file I'm gonna
call this grunt file with capital letter
J s okay so this at the end of the day
is just going to be a module right and
we're going to export everything that's
in it but I'm not going to create this
file I'm not going to write anything in
it just yet I'm gonna do that in the
next file the next step is to install
plugins after we've create this current
J's file and we've kind of padded it out
a little bit and again I'm going to go
into that later on so now this doesn't
look as daunting that was all pretty
simple install node installed grunt EMI
create a package.json file and install
grunt locally we've created file and in
the very next tutorial we're going to
Pat this out and start running some
custom tasks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
