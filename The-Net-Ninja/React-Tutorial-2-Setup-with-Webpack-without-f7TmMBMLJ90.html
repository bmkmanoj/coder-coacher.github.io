second react tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how to install
react in particular with webpack so
before we install anything I just want
to briefly touch on how we're going to
be working with react because when we
write a react application we're actually
writing in JSX
or in some cases es6 or es2015 now most
browsers by default don't understand
these things so we need a way to
transform this code into vanilla
JavaScript which browsers will
understand and the way we're going to do
that is by using a tool called Babel
now babel takes our code transforms that
into normal javascript and then gives
that to the browser to work with because
it does understand the resulting
javascript so there's two ways we can
set up react with Babel the first way is
a quick and dirty way and that is to add
reactant beta scripts to the head of the
HTML document much like we would with
jQuery or something then whenever we
want to write react code we just have a
script of type text ford slash babel
because that way babel know is to
transform the code that we write into
normal javascript and if we want to
reference an external file we use the
source attribute as normal
so that's cool if you want to get up and
running quickly with bagel but I prefer
this way which is not so quick and
that's to use NPM to install react and
able the node package manager that and
then we also install web pack and use
that to configure babel and the
transformation of our code so then
that's all going to run automatically
after we've set it up and the great
thing about using webpack is that we can
also use some of the other things it
comes with such as style loaders or sass
transpilers or the web pack dev server
so we're going to look at all that as
well so for those of you who want to get
down and dirty really quickly with react
there's a really good getting started
guide on the official Docs I'll leave
the link to this down below but if we
have a quick look then you can see in
the head of our document is telling us
to add to script tags once in the react
library the main library
the other one to the react Dom library
so when you both with those really four
react to work now the third one down
here is for Babel and that's going to
help us transform the JSX or es2015 code
into vanilla JavaScript so it's those
three tags in the head and then down
here you can see where we've got a
script tag and we're making a little bit
of react code it says text forward slash
babel for the type okay now if you want
to reference an external script then it
just looks something like this
so again script type equals text forward
slash babel then the source as normal so
there we go that's how you set it up
quickly now for the rest of us I'm going
to go through how we set this up with
web pack so there's going to be a few
steps with this first of all I want to
use NPM to install react and react dot
then I want to use it to install all the
babel packages that we're going to need
the different loaders to transform
Junior sets code and es2015 code that
kind of thing and then finally I want to
install web pack and the web dev server
using NPM and configure web pack so that
everything runs automatically so we're
going to go through those three steps
now so by this stage I'm assuming you've
got no js' installed already because
we're going to need it for the node
package manager if you've not had often
nodejs to org and download that first
okay cool so let's get started so the
first thing i want to do is say npm in
it this is going to initialize a
package.json file for us and that
package JSON file is going to keep track
of all of our dependencies that we're
going to install like react or babel so
it's going to ask you a few questions
just click through these you can give it
a description if you want or some
keywords for the most part you can leave
it blank and the licensees MIT is this
okay you betcha
so that's created our package JSON file
for us and if we have a look in here you
can see we've got a lot of different
things that it's tracking for us now one
of these things that's not there at the
minute is the dev dependencies and the
normal dependencies so we're going to
save some things to our dev dependencies
that we require as a developer and we're
going to save some things to our normal
dependencies which are going to be
required for the app to run okay so the
first thing we want to install
is react and the reactant packages so
I'll say NPM not there npm install react
and react - dot so that's going to
install both of those packages now I
want to say - - save and that's going to
save it to my normal dependencies okay
cool so that's reacting installed so now
we can use that in our application later
and if you scroll down here you're going
to see dependencies right here and it
should say we act and react on so it's
tracking those for is now so the next
thing I want to do is install all the
babel packages that we're going to need
and there's a few of them so I'll say
npm install and then the first one is
babel call that's the core library then
i'm going to say babel loader then I'll
say babel preset es2015 so this is going
to be the preset that helps us transform
es2015 code into JavaScript and then
I'll say babel i've been preset react
and this is going to help us change
react code or JSX into normal JavaScript
now we can save all of these to our dev
dependencies this time so I'll do save -
dev because they're just a developer
dependency when we're developing the
application we need okay cool so that is
our babel stuff installed and you can
see all in the dev dependencies right
there so one more thing to do and that's
install web pack and the web pack dev
server so again I'm going to say npm
install and this time it's web pack and
web pack dev server and i also want to
save these to the dev dependencies as
well okay sweet so that is now
everything installed that we need so now
we can crack on and create our web pack
config file which is going to control
how babel converts all of our JSX or
es2015 into vanilla JavaScript and where
to put that output JavaScript okay so
now we can go ahead and create our web
pack config file and configure
everything so to create that file all we
need to do is right-click in the root
level go to new file
and I want to call this webpack convict
Jas this is a JavaScript fight okay cool
so now I could write all this out but I
don't want to bore you so I prepared a
gist on github and I'm gonna leave the
link to this down below so this is
everything we need so just grab that and
copy it and I'm going to explain it as
we go through so just paste it in here
and save it so this is not going to be
an in-depth web pack tutorial if you
want to learn more about web pack check
out my web pack series it's only six
videos long and it is going to benefit
you a lot you'll understand this a lot
more however I'm going to quickly walk
you through this now so first of all
we've used required path to give us the
path module provided by nodejs and that
allows us to get the current directory
as well as other things and we use them
in doubt here in a minute
so everything else is within module
export so we're exporting this object
right here and this is all of the
settings if you like for web park so
what web pack is essentially going to do
for us is look at all of our source
JavaScript or JSX or es2015 that we
write it's going to look at it all it's
going to combine it all together into
one file to reduce HTTP requests and
it's also going to transform any JSX or
es2015 code into vanilla JavaScript for
us it's going to output all of that into
one file where we specify and we're
going to specify that down here and as
well as that it's also going to look at
CSS and use some style up this book I'm
going to explain that later in the
series so the first thing we're doing is
supplying an entry point where can it
find the first javascript file the kind
of route javascript file if you like of
our application and what I've said is
say okay path resolve this is that path
module we're using and then I've passed
through underscore underscore do a name
and that says get the current directory
where you are at the minute then I want
you to add on the source folder so look
in the source folder which is here okay
and then once you've found that tack on
this bit at the end /up forward slash
index GS so this is where our index
jas our main javascript file our entry
point if you like is going to be so it's
not there in a minute so why not create
it right click new folder up and then
I'm going to create a new file called
in-depth is cool okay so now we've got
that entry point sorted so when we're
working in that index J s we might say
things like require and then some other
JavaScript file from somewhere else and
that might be in the app folder as well
so what web pack is going to do is look
at that file and it's going to bring all
of those different requires together and
bring them all in into one file so
instead of having maybe six or seven
JavaScript files it's going to combine
them all into one and output them as one
file so this is where we're configuring
the output we're seeing the path so that
output is going to be again puffed up
resolve the current directory then look
in the distal der which stands for
distribution then add on forward slash
up so it's going to be in the root
forward slash dist
forward slash up down that's not there
currently but that doesn't matter
because when web pattern runs it's going
to automatically create this folder
structure for us okay so the file name
that we want to output so it's called
bundle J s so it's going to create a
bundle J s file with all of our code
transformed in one file in this
directory make sense now this public
path right here this is saying well ok
even though our index J s is going to
live in forward slash dist
forward slash up then index J s we don't
want that to be the public path we want
to reference this index file as just /up
forward slash then index J s okay so
when we reference it in our index file
we're just going to say localhost
whenever poor then forward slash up
forward slap at the forward slash index
J s instead of adding the dist folder
into as well so that's what that's all
about there cool so that's how we're
packaging up a Java Script and
outputting it the next bit right here is
for configuring our Babel stuff as well
as the CSS so this is to do with all the
loaders that we installed for react code
and es2015 code so like say what we want
to do is transform JSX and also es2015
into normal javascript so this load is
property right here is in a rake and it
has different loaders in it each loader
is an object you can see we've got two
one for CSS and one for Jas so inside
this one for JavaScript we're saying
which files we want this loader to work
on okay so that's the test property and
then this is just a regular expression
looking for any file which has a
JavaScript j/s extension so it's going
to compile or convert those files it's
going to test them and if they contain
JSX or es2015
then it's going to convert them into
normal JavaScript so we're also saying
which kind of directory we want to run
this loader on because we don't want to
run it on all of our directory so I'm
saying I want you to include the
directorate of puffed-up resolve current
directory then the source folder so any
JavaScript in this source folder it's
going to test and run it on ok the
loader we using it is the babel loader
then this query property right here is
going to say which presets we want to
use now if we just want to change react
code we just put react in here if we
just want to change es 2015 code we just
put that in there if we want to look out
for both of them and where they appear
change them both into normal JavaScript
we have to put both of them in so that's
what that's doing and that's that load
it configured right there it's going to
solve all of our yes 2015 or JSX code
and convert it into normal JavaScript
pretty cool right so this one down here
like say is for CSS so again it's just
testing for CSS files and we're going to
use the style loader and the CSS loader
pipe together and we'll talk about that
later because I've not installed those
loaders just yet ok cool so that is the
web pack config file in a nutshell so
now we've created this config file how
would we run a web pack to do all these
conversions to combine our JavaScript
and output them where we said we wanted
the outpointing well we could come down
here and we could say web pack and
that's going to route for us however I
also want to run the web pack dev server
and platic some options so we don't want
to type all
is out every time I want to run them so
instead what we can do is utilize our
package.json file to create some scripts
to kind of shortened what we have to
write so at the minute is just a test
script but what I'm going to do is put a
comment there I'm going to paste in a
couple that I've already prepared so the
first one is called start and the second
one here is called built just move that
in so the build one is saying okay I
want to run web pack and I want to run
the web pack dev server and these are
the options I'm passing to it first of
all I'm saying where the content base is
because if we run a server for this
project then automatically it's going to
look in the root level for some kind of
index file right now our index file is
in the source folder directly in the
source folder so we want to tell the web
pack dev server that that's where it is
the index file so that's where we say
content base and then we say source okay
then I'm saying inline and hot and these
two are for hot reloading so when we
make a change on a component later on
and save it it's going to automatically
reload that in a window for us then I'm
saying what port I want to run this
server on and I've just passed it one
two three four if you don't specify this
and you don't have to then it may not
work if you already have a port with a
program running on it on your computer
under the default port of this web pack
dev server so I like to specify it so
that's going to run whenever we say
build but I don't want to write npm
build every time so I'll just pop that
in a start script so I'm just going to
say NPM start and that's going to run
this build script for us okay so let's
before we run it I'll save it let's just
test this I'm going to pop something in
the index jet file I'm going to say
Alert just a message it works okay and
then I'll save that we're not linking up
to the JavaScript anywhere in the index
file so what we need to do is link up to
it now we're not linking to this
index.js file we're going to link up to
the bundle J's file which is going to be
output when web pack runs so I'll say
script
source equals and now remember when I
said the public path was forward slash
up forward slash whatever file you're
after that's where we put this forward
slash up forward slash and then the file
name so it's bundle a s so we don't have
to write forward slash dist forward
slash up for it's less bundle just this
that's the public path so now we can
save that dude so if we run this now it
should all output in a distribution
folder however there is a little gotcha
and that's to do with atoms so this is
in my settings if I run this I'm not
going to see a distribution for the
right hit because it's essentially an
ignored file from get and atom is it's
showing-up 12 so I'm going to hit ctrl
comma just in case you have this and
problem two all you need to do is go
into your packages look for this package
tree view and go into the settings for
it and then come down here and unclick
hide VCS ignored files so if I don't
click that now you can see node modules
is there and this little git thing is
there as well okay so unclick that first
then I'm going to run NPM and then a
start script and this is going to run a
web pack for us and the web pack dev
server and all those options okay
awesome so now we can see that
distribution folder right here that it's
created for a slash app then we have our
bundle Jaso if we double click that
you're going to see our alert down here
okay cool so we'll link into this file
in the index dot HTML file right there
so if I navigate to port
one-two-three-four pre-cancer then
hopefully this should work and it does
cool awesome so now we have set up
family web pack with react and Babel etc
so that now we can start writing react
code and all this other stuff is going
to be taken care of automatically behind
the scenes we'd have to worry about it
now cool so in the next video we're
going to move on to creating our very
first react component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
