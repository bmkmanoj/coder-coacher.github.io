regular expression right here for a
telephone number but at the minute it's
not really doing anything it's just
sitting around in space
chilling out what we want to do is hook
it up to this farm field right here for
the telephone number so that when a user
starts to type in a number what we're
gonna do is grab that thing that they
type in that value and we're going to
test it against this regular expression
to see if we have a match and to see if
that field is valid make sense okay cool
so just as a heads up there is going to
be a bit of JavaScript in this tutorial
so if you feel like you need a refresher
on any of it I'm gonna leave two links
down below for different playlists one
is JavaScript for beginners and the
other is JavaScript and the Dom so they
will both probably help you okay so
let's start so there's a couple of
different steps we need to take it the
first step is to grab a hold of all
these different input fields and attach
an event listener to each one of them
okay so the event is going to be a key
of event that is when a user clicks a
key and then keys up okay that is when a
user has typed something into it so we
want to listen out for that so that we
can see what they've typed in and see if
that field is a match make sense
cool so we're going to attach an event
listener to each one of these different
things then what we're going to do is
we're gonna find out which regular
expression is associated with each field
so that when a user types in a
particular field we test it against the
appropriate regular expression now to do
that we're going to be using the name
attribute of each of these fields you
can see right here we have a name of
username the name of email a name of
password etc so when a user types in a
field we'll say okay well find the name
of that field telephone then what we'll
do is we'll look at that telephone regex
and try and match it against that makes
sense cool so first of all let us now
grab ahold of these different inputs so
to do that we'll say Const inputs this
is where we're storing them oops I
cannot type so Const inputs okay and
that is going to be equal to document
dot query select all
all because we want all of them not just
one thing and in here we need to say
what we want now we just want the input
this is a CSS selector if we did this in
CSS it's going to stamp all inputs if we
do it here it's going to grab all input
fields okay
so now we have those stored in here and
this is a HTML collection now we need to
add an event listener to listen for a
key event to each of these inputs now we
can't just do this inputs dot add event
listener etc because this right here is
a collection of elements and we can't
use this an event listener method on a
collection of elements we can only use
it on one element so what we need to do
is cycle through the inputs and attach
the event listener to each one and to do
that we'll use a for each method so
inside this for each method we're going
to fire a function I'll be using an
arrow function which looks like this we
have our parentheses then an equals then
the arrow then the code block but you
can use a normal function if you wish
so we're cycling through these inputs
and each time around we have access to
the individual item or if you prefer to
call it an individual input all right
so now we need to take that input each
time around and add an event listener to
it so we'll say add event listener now
the event we want to listen to is going
to be the kkeok events so that's the
first parameter right here we're
listening for that event the second
parameter is again it going to be a
function I'll be using an arrow function
as well we take the event object as a
parameter then our equals an arrow then
the code block
okay so we've added an event listener to
each one of these inputs now so let's
just test this out by logging something
to the console or console dot log
whichever input was clicked in or typed
in so like you said we'll use these name
properties right here and the way we can
get those is by saying well we'll take
the event right here then what we want
is the target element which is the
element that that event occurred on so
we can say e dot target then we want one
the attributes of that target remember
it's the name attribute so we can say
dot attributes then the name attribute
then we want the value of that name
attribute okay so what we're doing here
is we're logging out this thing here
username email password telephone etc so
let's just give this a whirl save it
refresh over here in the browser I'm
also going to open up the dev tools so
that we can see and currently it's on a
different screen but I would do this
then it's going to go to the right over
here so let's go to the console and zoom
in a little bit so you can see now when
we start to type in something you can
see right here it's saying telephone so
we know we're typing in the telephone
field up here if we start to type it
saying username email password and slug
alright so now we know which one we're
typing into so we know when we're typing
into a specific field which regular
expression pattern to test against all
right so the second step is to make that
test so what I'll be doing is creating a
validation function to do this so
function and we'll call this function
validate this is just my own function
and making it up now this function is
going to take in two parameters the
first parameter is going to be the field
that we're testing so it's going to be
whatever field this is right here so
we'll pass through either telephone user
name email password etc the second thing
that we're going to test is going to be
the regex that we want to test against
so which one of these properties up here
so we'll type that in there let's open
up this function and inside what we want
to do is see if something is valid now
the way we test something against a
regex pattern is by saying regex
whatever the regex is dot test and then
the value that we want to test right so
it's going to be the field dot value
like that oops
can I spell note the field value so what
we're going to be doing down here is
when someone
types into a particular field we're
going to be grabbing that input field
and we're gonna be sending it into this
validate function right here we're also
going to be grabbing this reject pattern
and we're gonna be sending it in here as
this parameter so we're going to take
this reg X then we're gonna test it not
text it then what we're gonna do is
we're going to pass in the thing we want
to test it against which is the value of
this input field that we passed in does
that make sense so first of all let's
just log this to the console so let's
combine all of that and then down here
we want to call that function so let's
comment this out and instead we'll say
validate and we want to pass in two
things here the first one is going to be
the input field so a target that's going
to grab that particular input field
right that we typed in then what we're
going to do is pass in the regex pattern
which is going to be this thing now to
get that will say patterns which is the
object name that in brackets we want to
pass in essentially this telephone right
now we know we can get access to
telephone or whatever the name of the
field typed in is by using this thing
right here we just logged that to the
console so instead of typing telephone
here because it might be the name or the
password we instead pop that in right
there and that's going to get whatever
value of the name property on each of
the input fields is when we type in them
and it's going to pass that in to the
patterns object and find that regular
expression so now we're passing in the
target element and the regular
expression for that element makes sense
all right so once we're passing those in
we're taking the regex right here and
we're testing it with the value in that
input field so this is going to return
either true or false it's going to
return true when a particular field is
valid and it's going to return false
when a field is not valid so let us test
this out refresh and over here I'm going
to start to type in a number and you see
we have false because it the minute this
zero
is being tested against this regular
expression and we don't get it much so
it's returning false it's only going to
return true when it's eleven digits long
according to this reject pattern so
let's carry on typing out numbers you
can see we get false is false is false
is etc all the way until we get eleven
numbers then we get a true so now we're
saying okay now this is a much cool so
we're passing here
however if I type another one then it
goes to false again delete it goes to
trim again
so we're successfully now linking up
this form field to this regular
expression and we're testing it right
here so we know when a particular field
has passed this test when we get a match
so we don't want to do this we don't
just want to log out true or false what
we want to do is check whether the this
field is a match or not whether it
passes validation so we'll do an if
statement then inside we're going to
test that reg X again so we'll say reg X
which is what we pass in then don't test
then inside the brackets we're going to
pass in the field dot value all right so
we're checking if this is true or false
if is true then it means we get a match
and it's passed validation so what we
can do is add a class to this thing
right here in the field
so we'll say field dot class name is
equal to valid just like that so now
when we get a match it's going to give
this input field a class of valid when
it's not a match so we'll do an else
when this returns false right here and
we don't get a match what we'll do is
say field dot class name is gonna be
equal to invalid like so so let's give
this a whirl if we go over to the form
and refresh what I'm gonna do is head to
the elements instead and inspect this
element we can see this input field
right here at the minute has no class
it's now the valid or invalid because
it's not been touched yet but if we type
in a number which is not valid but you
can see now class equals invalid so at
the minute
this form is invalid and it's going to
remain invalid until we type in eleven
numbers now you can see this switched to
a valid class so that is pretty awesome
we're now using this regular expression
we're hooking it up to this farm field
right here so that when a user types in
it it's going to test it it's going to
decide whether we get a match or not by
testing that regex pattern with the
field value when we get a match it's
gonna add that class name of valid when
we don't get a match is gonna add that
class name of invalid that is freaking
awesome
by the way if we carry on adding numbers
here it's going to go back to invalid
all right so now we have this general
structure in place and no it was
probably maybe a quite a lot to take in
in one tutorial I just wanted to get
this structure in place so that going
forward we can create these different
regular expressions and no matter which
one we type into over here it's going to
detect that and test against the
appropriate regular expression I hope
all this makes sense if it doesn't feel
free to rewind and watch it again or if
you struggling with the Java Script like
I said check out my JavaScript and the
Dom tutorial series that will really
help you with all of this kind of stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
