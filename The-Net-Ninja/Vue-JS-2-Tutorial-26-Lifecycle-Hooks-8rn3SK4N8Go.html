your 26th of ejs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
lifecycle hooks okay so when we create a
new view instance or component it goes
through a specific kind of a lifecycle
it has a journey that it goes through
and along this lifecycle we have access
to certain functions or methods that
fire at certain points through this
lifecycle okay so these are called
lifecycle hooks and the what we're going
to look at in this tutorial so when we
create a new instance first of all the
first life cycle hook that is fired is
before create so this is a method that
we can put stuff in and fire any code
before the component or view instance is
created okay
then after that one runs the instance
observes any data so before this we
don't have access to any data like this
thing here we just have access to
nothing but we can run some code
prior to it being created then it
observes the data okay and initializes
any kind of event to do with the
component or the instance then after
it's done that we get another life cycle
hook these things here in red are
lifecycle hooks and this one is called
created and this function fires when the
component has been created so if we were
to execute any kind of code after the
component has been created we can throw
it into this function okay and it will
execute after this data and event store
has been set up and in this function
right here this created one we can have
access to this data to this stuff that
we pop in here okay so if we go through
the down do we have an L option no okay
remember L is that property on the view
instance here if we go to main guess
listing right here if we don't then when
VM mount L is called we do this if we do
does it have a template option this is
just kind of assessing how the instance
is set up etc but they all kind of lead
to the same result so basically what
it's going to do is compile the template
either way and then when it's compiled
the template that we've specified
such is this thing right here this
template once it's done that then it's
about to mount the Dom so it's not
mounted the Dom yet the component or
instance has been created but it's not
mounted the Dom it's not going to appear
in our browser just yet and before it
does mount the Dom we get access to
another life cycle hook called before
mount so if there's anything we want to
do just before it mount to the Dom we
can pop it into this function and you're
probably very rarely user so anyway once
it has mounted the doll then would get
access to another life cycle hook and at
this point we have access to that code
in the Dom okay because it's been
mounted so if we wanted to reach in and
manipulate the Dom in any way shape or
form we could do that here we couldn't
do that before here but we could do it
here okay so when it's been mounted then
there's a couple of different things
that could happen we could either update
the component or instance by changing
the data in it we change the state and
when it happens we get another life
cycle hook called before update so if
you Jess detects that we're changing
some data before it updates the Dom with
that new data we get this other life
cycle hook code before update and we can
fight any code there that we want to
before the component updates ok after it
does and its output to the doll and it
will be rendered and then we get this
other life cycle function called updated
and we can find any code there and
access the updated Dom in this function
ok so that's one thing that could happen
after it's been mounted the other thing
is it could be destroyed
ok so if we want to get rid of the
component or incidents completely we can
destroy that component and then before
it's destroyed we could pop any colored
in this lifecycle hooks that we want to
do before it's destroyed then it's going
to tear down any kind of components
event list is that kind of thing
anything associated with that component
or instance and then once it's done that
once it's destroyed it then we get
access to this final lifecycle function
call destroyed so we could do any kind
of final cleanup ourselves that we
wanted to ok so I want employees to have
a lot
at this lifecycle diagram and read
through this is just the official
documentation for view the link is down
below so what we're going to do now is
just have a look at a few of these
lifecycle hooks and place them in one of
our components to see what happens okay
so if we come to this Minges dot view
what we're going to do is add on the
lifecycle hooks to this component right
here so another node is more because
that's it before ever bought I'm going
to go through just a few of them so a
place to come after the message and a
little comment saying lifecycle folks
and the first hook was before to create
so if we want to use a lifecycle hook
all we do is pop them in this object
right here okay and that can open up and
this is very much like this thing here
data and it's essentially just a
function okay so this function will run
before it's created so we can just alert
something here and say before created
because that's the name of this hook
right so I'm going to alert the name of
the hooks as they happen so we can see
them on the screen so after that we'll
do creative and again just a function
and inside here will alert created so
this occurs when the component has been
created then after this will do before
mount and by the way this part here
we've created would be a good point to
go out of fetch any data if you need any
data
okay from a database or something like
that a lot of people use mounted to do
that both probably better to do in the
created lifecycle hook okay so anyway
before mount this is before the
component is mounted and this is a
function again we'll alert before mount
in here okay and then the next one we'll
do is Mount it which is a function of
using capitals and we'll alert mounted
so again this is a good place where you
can go in and manipulate the Dom once
it's been mounted this component okay
after mounted will do before update so
if view view gets a change it is going
to occur in this component and it will
run this before the change is updated
okay in the job so we'll alert here
before update and then finally we'll do
updated so this occurs after the Dom has
been updated and it's been rear-ended
okay so all load update it and we'll
just leave it at that fit out so we'll
take a look at this in the browser so
save that now and if we view that over
here and refresh we have an error and
that's because we've placed this
semicolon inside your learn function so
let's check it out save it again and
refresh and at this time you can see
before create run so nothing is on the
screen at the minute they look at all
and this is running before the component
has been created if we click OK
we get created now still nothing is on
the screen because although the
component has been created it's not
actually been mounted to the Dom that
doesn't happen until down here okay so
okay before mount again we've still not
mounted anything so this is running
before we see anything on the screen
again so we've got plenty of opportunity
to do things that we need to before it
showed on the screen here when we click
OK again it's mounted and when I click
after this it's going to show in the
browser or place or mounted shows you
the browser all right
so now then we also have before updates
and updated and some data needs to
change to do that so what I'm going to
do is come down here and delete a ninja
ok and when a ninja is deleted because
we're accepting that as a prop right
here it's going to change the data of
this component and so hopefully these
two are going to run so let's try that
delete ninja and we get before update so
this is running before anything's
changed in the browser
and then press ok then we get updated
and even
we can't see in the browser just yet it
has updated okay and at that point we
can't access it in the dot so there we
go
they are your lifecycle hooks and the
key points are probably created right
here good for fetching data mounted
right here good for manipulating the Dom
once it's been mounted same for this
thing right here updated okay so there
we go that is lifecycle hooks in a
nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
