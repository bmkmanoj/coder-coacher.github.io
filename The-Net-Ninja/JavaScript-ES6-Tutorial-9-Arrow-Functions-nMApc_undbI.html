knife at my script six tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
arrow functions also known as fan arrows
Wow okay then dudes
so in es6 we can write our functions and
a slightly different we're using what's
known as arrow functions or fat arrows
and basically they do two things for us
the first thing they do for us is they
save as a little bit of time because we
don't have to press as many keys when
we're creating some functions yadda
yadda yadda okay that's not a great
benefit but the second thing they do for
us which is more useful is they bind the
this value in JavaScript lexically which
I'm going to show you later on alright
so you can see right now in this window
dot onload function I've got this
function called ninja greeting which is
using es5 color to do this we're setting
it equal to a function and then inside
that function we're logging this message
to the console hiya then we're just
calling that function down here so if I
save this now and refresh you're gonna
see this higher message in the console
cool now
how do we create an arrow function well
I'm just going to change this function
right here into an arrow function the
first thing we do is we get rid of that
keyword there function we don't need
that anymore and the next thing we do
after the parenthesis which we still
need is we just do an equal sign then
the great another sign that's like a
fatter or now and put it there so now
this is what's known as an arrow
function anyway
refresh this is going to do exactly the
same thing so essentially what we've
done is create a function without
writing as much or pressing the keys as
much on our keyboard right now if we
were to just have one line of code in
this function much like we do here then
we don't need these two curly braces
either we can just pop that right up on
that line like that and we can express
it like this which is better again and
we still get the same result so this is
now a nicer looking function than all of
that function keyword that code block
etc so that's looking pretty nice so say
we passed in a parameter into this
function let's just call it name right
and I'm going to pass through a name
right here as well and call it mark and
what I want to do is print up the name
here as well so in
and of using a normal string I'm going
to use a template stringer to do that we
need to back ticks remember so I'm going
to replace those quotes with back ticks
then I'm going to output the name and
variable that we've got so name and then
I'll say say is hi-yah
okay so let's save that now and refresh
and this time we get Max's hi-yah
so all we do nice we're popping that
parameter in the parenthesis right there
but here's the thing if we only have one
parameter that were passing through we
don't even need the parenthesis like
that we can take those away and save it
and refresh we're still going to get the
same thing all right so this is all very
well and it saves us keystrokes likes a
little bit of time but it's not exactly
groundbreaking and the better feature is
that the new arrow functions combined
the this file you in JavaScript Lexi
clay so that's what I'm going to show
you now so what I'm going to do is just
get rid of all this junk for now delete
that and I'm going to create an object
so this object is going to be called a
ninja and it's gonna be equal to just an
empty object to begin with like that
then inside this what I want to do is
first of all give it a name property and
the name is just gonna be Ryu they'll do
and after that I want to define a
function so with the way we can do that
is just by saying chop like that and
then say n equal to a function like that
this is the new way we can define
functions within an object I covered
this a tutorial or two back so in this
chop method what we're going to do is
we're going to send interval and every
second say we're going to log a message
to the console to say that rayo has just
like correct chopped T's enemy okay and
we can do it X amount of times so we're
going to pass in a variable called X
into this method and when we call this
method we're going to supply a number of
times that we're going to chop or karate
chop the enemy okay
so within this method the first thing we
want to do is say window got a set
interval like that and then within that
I'm going to fire off a function which
is going to fire every 1000 milliseconds
so every second basically right
so within this function what I need to
do is first of all check if X is over
zero so I'll say if X is greater than
zero then we're going to log a message
to the console and take one away from X
so I'll go through this again in a
second let me just write it first of all
console dot log then I'm gonna say this
dot name which refers to Ray oh yeah and
then concatenate chopped the enemy like
that and then what we're gonna do is
take one away from X each time so
essentially what I'm doing is every
second I'm calling this function right
and I'm checking that X is greater than
zero so say we passed five through to
this method well X currently is greater
than zero it's five so it's going to log
this message to the console then it's
going to take one away from X so the
next second when it calls it X is gonna
be four it's still greater than zero I
applied a plan it's going to log this
message again until X is decreased to
zero
whereby it's no longer greater than zero
and it's not going to log the message
anymore all right so if I save this you
don't expect this to work yeah you'd
expect it to say Ryu right here because
that's this name chop the enemy but this
isn't going to work because this right
here doesn't refer to Ryu this refers to
the function that it's within which is
this okay and I can demonstrate that by
refreshing over here oh no we need to
call the method first of all an injured
up shop and I'll just pass five through
so if i click save and refresh then if
you check this out we still get chopped
the enemy and you can see it's
increasing in the amount of times that
its output to the console here because
it's doing it every second but we don't
get the name this name is not printing
out and that's because like I said this
right now refers to this function that
it's within it's not referring to this
name it's lost its Stoke essentially so
how we would previously combat that if I
I do it something like this we'd say
outside of the sorry
not there outside of this function which
say var underscore this equaled this
then we're making a ref
to this at this point so that there we
can reference this variable and this
here will refer to this at this point
which is this okay
so if I save now refresh then you can
see Ryu chop the enemy now what we can
do with arrow functions is lexically
bind that the value of this so that it
will refer to the object itself so we
can get rid of all of this I'll take
that out change this back to this and
then remember with arrow functions we
don't leave that function keyword and we
keep the parentheses and then we popped
up fat arrow in afterwards so now if I
save this and refresh we should still
get the name okay because now we've used
the error function it's buying the value
of this lexically and this still refers
to the ninja which kind of makes more
sense so that is how we can use the
arrow functions you have any questions
