directing us to this chat component with
the name so this is the component which
will actually show the chat window and
the messages inside it so let's start to
create the template for this component
so we'll go over to our chat dot view
component over here and we'll create the
template inside the container now I want
to get rid of what's currently inside
this h2 right here because we don't just
want to output the name up there that
makes no sense
instead we'll call this ninja chat and
what I'll do is give this a class as
well and the class is going to be equal
to center to essentially align this X to
text and also teal - text so make it
that blue green color okay so the next
thing we need to do is a div with a
class of card like so and then inside
this we need some card content so again
another div with a class of card -
contents then inside this div what I'd
like to do is output the messages now
since there's going to be a series of
different messages it makes sense to
create a ul and loads of different Li
tags inside of it
one for each message so we'll do that
will create a ul and this is going to
have a class of messages and inside that
we'll do an li tag and by the way this
class right here this is nothing to do
with materialized this is our own class
we might use to style these things up
later on so each message will be an li
tag and eventually we will use v4 to
output a different Li tag for each
different message but since we don't
have those messages yet we'll just
create some dummy
HTML for each different message so
inside this Li tag we're going to have
three things we're going to have the
name of the person that sends the
message we're also going to have the
message content and then final it will
have the time the time that the message
was created so for each one of these
different things I'm going to do a span
tag so first of all we'll do a spun for
the name and this is going to have a
class of teal - text and we'll just
place name there to begin with since we
have no dynamic data yet
and the second one will be a span with a
class of gray - text and will say text -
darken - three so that's going to take
that gray text color and darken it by
three steps okay and inside this will be
the actual message content again we
don't have dynamic data so we'll just
place message there for now and finally
spun with a class of gray - text again
and also it's going to have a class of
time because we'll starless up slightly
differently later on and we'll use that
class to do that and in here we'll just
say time but we will output the
timestamp there format it in some way
shape or form later as well okay so
that's the kind of HTML I want output
for each different message we have and
later on like I said we will use V - 4
on this Li Tech to cycle through each
message and output this stuff for each
different message we have in the
database alright then so now underneath
the card content over here
I'd like to do another div with a class
of card - action again this is a utility
class provided by materialised
and this is just going to separate a
little bottom part of the whole car for
us and this is where our form will be
for a user to add a new message now for
now I'm just gonna do an input box with
a type of text and leave it at that and
we'll come back to this shortly alright
so that's the basic template done over
there the next thing I'd like to do well
first of all we'll preview it in a
browser so this is what it looks like at
the minute and this looks okay but we
still need to style this up a little bit
to begin with these three things are
sitting next to each other and they
shouldn't really do that they should
probably sit on top of each other or at
least the time should be done there so
we'll sort that out and a couple of
other things as well so let's go down to
the style tags and inside here first of
all we'll say chat which is the div at
the top we gave that a class of chat and
then we want the h2 inside of that and
the font size of this H 2 will be 2.6
m/s okay and the margin bottom just to
separate you from the chat window itself
will be about 40 pixels
alright then so we also want to grab
each of the span tags inside those
allies so these things right here and
since they're the only span tags in the
chat over here we can just say chat spun
and for each of these I'd like to give a
font - size of 1.4 m/s alright and then
finally like one more rule will say chat
time so that's that third span tag where
we output the time itself we want to
display this as block because we want it
to go on to the next line and block
level elements do them so display it as
block and the font size will also be
about 1.2 m/s so let's save this and
view this in a browser okay I think that
looks a bit better now we have the ninja
chat separated from the window and also
now the time is going to be displayed
below these two things right here where
the name and the message is plus it's
also a little smaller which I think
works well as well cool so that is our
chat window created right there now we
also have this input field right here
and we did that or right here ultimately
in the next lesson what we'll do is
separate this section this little farm
into its own component just to keep
everything modular because this
component right here this will be all
about receiving data from firebase
whereas this component right here the
new message component that will be all
about taking data from a user and
pushing it over to firebase so they have
two different roles really which is why
it's nice to keep them a little
separated from each other to avoid any
kind of data confusion so we'll look at
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
