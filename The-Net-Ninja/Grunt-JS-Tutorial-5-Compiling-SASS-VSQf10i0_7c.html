fifth grungey tutorial and in this video
i'm gonna show you how we can compile
sass into CSS all right there so for
this tutorial I am going to assume that
you know it's essays and you've probably
worked with it before and you understand
that we have to compile sass into CSS in
order for a browser to understand it if
you don't know a thing about sass and
you want to learn about it I've got a
whole playlist on suss on this channel
so I'll leave a link to that down below
anyway I've got two sapphires right here
mix-ins and styles and these files are
on my github page if you want to go
ahead and download them they'll link to
that down below as well and the first
thing I want to do is import this
mixings file into the start file so I'm
going to go ahead and do that at the top
right here I'll say that's import and we
want to import the mixes ok now I want
to use this mix in in one of these rules
and it's gonna be the heading right here
so I'm going to say @include and then if
we go to the mix-ins file you'll see
we've got this mixing called ninja link
which is just gonna stay on some links
for us and it takes for variables for
different colors so let's copy that dude
and paste it down here change is to
include and then we'll go ahead and add
a few different colors compete whatever
you want this is gonna be blue red pink
oops we don't want and a red pink and
then purple okay cool so now we'll save
that and what we want to do is compile
all these sass files into CSS so let's
get rid of those and the way we want to
do this is by creating a CSS file which
is gonna sit next to these two called
styles dot CSS so we need to install a
plug-in to do this for us like we
installed a plug-in to concatenate up
files we need to also install a plug-in
which is going to convert our sass files
into CSS now we've got a couple of
options and I'm going to head over to
the grunt website here and if we type in
sass into this box right here you're
gonna see we've got can't rip - sir
and such now this one here is officially
maintained so you think okay well we'll
check that one out however for this one
to work we means have a Ruby installed
and it says that somewhere right here if
we come down a little bit this should
attach requires you to have Ruby
installed so I don't want to use this
plugin for this tutorial because they
don't want to install Ruby so what I'm
gonna do is instead use a different
plug-in this one right here just called
suss and we don't need to install Ruby
for this one we just need to install
another plug-in called node sass and
that's much easier so I'm just going to
install that first of all and this isn't
a grunt plug-in this is just a node
package so I'm gonna say NPM install no
- sass kind of gonna save this to my
deaf dependencies and while the installs
I'm just going to show you the actual
plugin we're gonna use which is called
the grunt sauce and down here you can
see this is how we install that so I'm
gonna copy that as well just so when
this is finished on the Left we can
install it let's make this fullscreen
again okay cool so once that's installed
we can just paste in the other thing we
want to do so I'm just going to right
click and go to the paste and we're
installing grunts us this time so this
is the grunt plug-in and we're saving
that to our dependencies also okay so
once that's installed let's check out
our package JSON file and we can see
right here we have node sass installed
now like I say this is not a grunt
plug-in hence why doesn't have grunt in
front of it this is just a package for
node which enables us to convert sass
files into CSS that kind of lets us do
it gives us that functionality if you
like whereas this one
grunts us this is the plugin that we're
going to load into the grunt file which
is actually going to perform the task of
converting sass into CSS okay so that's
why we've installed those two different
things ready okay so once we've done
that let's go ahead into our rope file
and load in the plug-in so I'm going to
copy this dude first
all taste it and I want to change this
into grunts - sus remember that's the
plug-in name groups s okay so once we've
done that we know we have to configure
these plugins and we're going to do that
up here in this init config method so
the first configuration object we had
was Vulcan cat so now we need to do
another one
for the SAS one so let's comment up
create a new one called SAS remember
it's anything after so in this case is
SAS in the other one it's can capped so
assess and we're going to pass through
an object here and then the first thing
I want to do in here is create a
property called build all right now this
one is just the task name much like we
had task names here for Jas and CSS etc
this is the name of this task right here
and basically that's just kind of
representative of when we deploy our
website I'll build it then it's going to
go into this build task right here okay
so what we need to pass through here is
a property called files and this is
going to be an array of objects okay and
we're only going to have one object in
this array and each object has two
properties the source property which is
going to be the source of the SAS file
we want to compile in this case it's
going to be in the CSS folder and /ss
forward slash styles dot C s CS robot
can't do it s CSS okay cool then we want
another property called nest which is
the destination of our compiled CSS file
and that's gonna be in the CSS folder
/if styles.css so it's going to dump it
right next to these two files right here
okay cool so let's save that now and if
we come down here we can run it we can
say groots SATs
run that and hopefully is going to
compile those CSS files and output that
stars dot CSS right now which he does
okay pretty cool so then what we could
do is go ahead and run another test
which is going to concatenate all of
these three CSS files and we do that
using this plug-in right here remember
but before I run that task I want to
just jump back to it and you can see
where we've asked them to go out and
grab all of the CSS files by using this
little Asterix right here now this is
not paying attention to the order of the
CSS files and in a lot of cases we might
want to pay attention to the order of
them for example when we run this it's
going to concatenate them by putting the
bootstrap styles before the reset styles
now probably we want to put the reset
styles at the top of the file we do care
about the order so instead of just using
this kind of wild card right here I'm
going to specify them all individually
and then it's going to concatenate them
in the order that I specified right here
so the first one is going to be the
recess data source eights in the CSS
folder forward slash research CSS the
second one is going to be the bootstrap
framework so CSS forward slash and
bootstrap dot CSS and the third one is
going to be the styles we've just
created all right there so I'll say CSS
four slash Styles dot CSS cool so now
let's go ahead and run this job as well
so I'll say grunt and then if you
remember we created a specific job for
the CSS so we'll say grunts claps - CSS
and that's going to concatenate all of
these CSS files hopefully and don't live
in this build for right here so now if
we look at this and we go to the bottom
we're gonna see our sass compiled CSS
right down at the bottom okay cool so
that is how we compile sass any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
