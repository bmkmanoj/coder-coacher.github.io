tenth get and get up tutorial and in
this video I'm going to introduce you to
a github okay and so what the hell is
github well basically it's a service
that's going to let us set up hosted
repositories or as they're known remote
repositories and that means that they're
stored online by github so anyone with a
computer and internet access can go and
then see this repository online and see
the code in it right now this is really
cool because it means we can really
effectively work in teams on a project
so imagine this scenario there's four
developers and we've each got our own
computer in the office or maybe we're
all remote workers I don't know either
way we all want to work on a project
together so we decided to set up this
project this repository for this project
online in github okay so now we have
this kind of central repository which we
can all access from our own computers
and what we can do is clone this
repository into our own computers so now
we all have a local version of this
repository and we can all work on that
code in our own time now imagine one of
us person one over here starts to
develop a new feature so they develop it
locally on their computer in the local
version of their repository then when
they're happy with it what they can do
is push their goes up to the hosted
repository to update the code right here
and merge it to the master branch in
this repository then these are the three
people they can take a look at this code
and say okay well I'm going to now pull
that code down from the hosted
repository to update my local version of
it so now they have the new feature on
their local computer so we'll all stayin
in sync with the main code base and it's
a really good way to collaborate this
way so we can all work on features in
our own time push up the code and the
other developers pull down the code and
we can work together really effectively
all rather so if we're going to start
using github then I guess it makes sense
that we need a github account Sarah you
want to head to github.com to create one
you need to choose a username
an email and a password then just click
this button right here that my friend is
going to take to some kind of welcome
screen which doesn't look like this
because I've already signed up and I've
already got 25 repos on the go most of
which I just cause files for playlists
on this YouTube channel anyway we don't
care about any of that what we want to
do is make a new remote repository right
here on github right I'm going to show
you two ways we can do that now the
first way is going to assume that we
already have some kind of local
repository set up or some kind of
project on our local computer with a
repository in it and we might get midway
through that project and then decide
that we want to collaborate with the
wider world or the developers now we
want to upload all of that code to
github to a local er to a remote
repository so that these other
developers around the world can view
that code
download it onto their computers and
work on it as well so that's the first
case scenario assuming we've already
started a project and have a local repo
already the second case scenario is
going to assume we don't have a local
repo and we've not started the project
yet so then what we do is create the
repo on github first a remote one then
clone that to our computer before we
start work on it and this I think is the
better option if you've not started a
project yet create it on github first
then clone it to your computer anyway
I'll show you both methods just in case
so first of all we already have some
kind of project and repo set out on our
local machine which we do because we've
been working on it in previous tutorials
so it's this get one repo right here
this is what we want to push up now to a
new remote repository on github so what
I'm going to do is click on this new
button but if you just signed up you
might not see this new button you might
see a welcome screen with a bigger
button that says create your first
repository either way click it because
all roads lead to Rome or rather all get
four buttons lead to this page and we
need to give this repo a name and I'm
going to call it get one just for
synchronicity because that matches up to
what our local one is called now we can
give this a description everyone however
I'm super lazy and a can't be bothered
so this can either be public or private
now public means that anyone could see
this repository
so if that's the case then just be
careful about what you upload to get up
we can also have a private one if we
have a premium account now that cost
about seven dollars a month well for now
we're just going to keep this public
anyway we can initialize this repo with
a readme file if we want it now a readme
file might be some information about the
repository that you might find on other
people's repositories for example a
library it's going to tell you about
that library and how to use it we don't
really need one for now so I'm not going
to add one anyway we can also add a dot
git ignore file remember I taught you
about those in a previous tutorial and
it comes baked github with all of these
different options for a geeky ignore
file for example if we have an old
project then we can use the node get to
ignore file I'm not going to do that
though we don't need one so we can also
add a license if we want but again can't
be bothered with any of that I'm just
going to create this repository okay so
this is going to set up that remote
repository for us on github
now it's going to direct you to this
page and give you some kind of quick
setup instructions you can follow those
or you can trust me okay so this here is
the URL to your kind of git repository
online I'm going to copy that because
we're going to need it in a bit to do
that just click this board okay now what
we want to do is go to our local
repository now the aim here is to push
all of this code here this local
repository up to our remote repository
and we can do that really easily first
of all I'm going to make sure that I've
not changed anything and there's nothing
left to commit to do that I'm just going
to say git status okay everything's
clean fine we're good to go now to push
this code up to the remote repo what we
need to do is say git and then push
that's the keyword for pushing code up
then we want to say where we want to
push to now I'm going to paste in this
URL because that's the repo that were
pushing to right then we want to say
which branch we want to push up we're
going to push up the master branch now
you can push up other branches as well
and we're going to do that in later
tutorials
so now let's just push up this master
branch so if you click enter now it
might just take ten seconds or something
like that to gather all of your code and
push it off to github alright
then we get this feedback message or
right here which is basically saying
that everything is done and we've got
this new branch now master on the remote
repository cool so that's all gone up
and if we take a look now at this remote
repository then we should if we click on
the repository name right here then we
should see all of that code cool so now
another developer could come to this URL
right here see this repository and they
could see this code and if you wanted to
see for example the index file it could
just click on it and you can see that
HTML and also if they wanted to clone
this to their computer they can come to
here and clone it and I'm going to show
you how we can do that in a second we
can also see the commit history so when
we push to github we all support the
compare push to commit history which is
really cool so we can see everything
we've done in the past and we can click
on each one of these commits to see more
information about it also we can see the
branches if we just click on get one
again we can see the branches currently
it's just one branch which is the master
branch okay we can also access the
branches here as well and like I said
we'll cover branches in probably the
next tutorial for now we have basically
pushed all of our existing code in our
existing repo or to a new remote
repository ok which is really cool now I
want to show you something
say for example we want to make some
changes and then push up the changes to
this repo
let's do that let's just add something
in h1 for example h1 and say what else
right ok really original now then what
we want to do is say git add first of
all to add ease to the staging area
we're still committing in exactly the
same way to our local repository first
of all so we'll commit this with a
message and added h1 then what we're
going to do is push all this again so
remember it's git push then at the repo
name now I could copy or rather just
paste that in again and then say we want
to push up the master but you know what
every time we make a push I don't want
to be typing in this thing right here
does it make any sense to keep this
copied to my clipboard all the time
instead what we can do is we can set up
an alias in this repository to say what
this URL is going to be so we only have
to type out one little word instead of
all of this big URL so I'm going to show
you how to do that so the way we do that
is by saying get remote write this down
to our remote repositories and then we
want to add a remote repository then
what we're going to do is give this
remote repository an alias now the
default one in github is Origin and many
people use this so I'm going to use it
as well so this is going to be a leus of
this repository then we need to type in
the repository name so I'll just paste
that in click enter and that is going to
add this alias to this local repo so now
instead of typing git push and then the
whole URL I can just say git push origin
which is now associated with you with
this URL because this is the alias for
it and then I can say which branch
master so now it's going to do exactly
the same thing but it's just easier to
push now ok so again it's pushed
everything up and if we check this out
in github and refresh we should see now
that there's nine commits and we've just
added a new commit which is added hate
one call and hopefully the index should
have updated as well yep what else
therefore we've pushed it up to this
remote repository and other developers
viewing this can see those updated files
as well cool right okay so I did say I
was going to show you two ways of doing
it and the second method assumes we
don't already have a local repository so
let's now create a new repository so I'm
going to go to my profile first of all
and then we'll go to repositories and
create a new one again so it's all
starting in the same way so again we
need to give this a repository name so
I'm just going to call this crap -
portfolios alright cool again not going
to give this a description it's going to
be public and this time I will add a
readme file ok so I'm going to create
this repository this time and adding
this readme file because I'm creating it
from scratch I'm not got anything
on my computer so when I sink this to my
computer and cloning then it's going to
download this readme file as well so
everything is going to be in sync now
we're going to create this repository
it's going to do exactly the same thing
mr. McDermott's me here and you can see
we've got this readme file first of all
and that's just a one commit the initial
commit to add this readme file so that's
the only history just the one branch as
well which is master so now what we want
to do is we want to clone this
repository to our computer so we can
start work on it now then to do that
click this button clone or download and
again this is the URL right here to this
remote repository so you want to click
this button to copy it to your clipboard
now if we go down here to the code what
I want to do is close off this I'm just
going to click off the index file as
well I want to go up a directory because
we're creating a new repository now I
don't want to create it within this
existing one so I'm going to say CD for
change directory dot to go up a level
then I want to clone my repository right
here okay
so how do we do that dead simple we say
get close and then we paste in this URL
that we just copied this is a remote
repo we just made so if we click enter
now you can see it's saying cloning crap
portfolio cool so now we have a crap
portfolio locally so I can navigate into
that by saying CD crap - portfolio and
now inside this repository locally now
we've cloned it so it's now local on our
computer ok so what I'm going to do over
here is just add this project directory
so I'm going to go to file and then add
project folder go to recording and then
go to prep portfolio which is just
created by cloning and now you can see
this repo right now has a readme files
as well ok cool so now let's make some
kind of commit to this and upload it so
what I'll do is right-click over here
and add a new file this is absorb index
dot HTML and let's just make the bare
bones of a hickie ml title we'll call
this crap portfolio and save it
and then down here what we want to do is
add this now and commit it locally first
of all source a gets add to add it to
staging then get commit with a message
and the message is going to be added
index file then what we want to do is
push this up to the remote repo now
remember last time we had to specify an
alias for the remote repository we had
to say git add remote and then origin
and then the link to the repository now
we don't have to do this this time and
that's because we've cloned it down from
github so this repo already has set up
the origin alias for us that happens
when we clone it right I'm a can tell
that by saying git remote and then - V
and that tells us right here I'll just
expand this a little bit we can see
right here we've got origin for fetch
and pushing so pushing is what we're
doing to push up Lexi what you do to
bring the code down sometimes okay so
now what we can do is push up to the
origin because it's already stored here
so I can say git push origin and we want
to push off the master branch so this is
going to take this master branch and
push it up now to the remote repository
so it might take a second okay cool it's
done that and let's check out the repo
over here and if we refresh now we
should see that updated commit now we've
got two commits and we see that index
file right here cool so everything is
working so there we go my friends that
is how we set up remote repositories on
github so in the next tutorial what
we're going to do is take this one step
further and I'm going to show you how we
start collaborating on Google imagining
there's two or three developers working
on a project how we're going to push
code up in different branches and pull
that code down again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
