tutorial and in this video I want to
talk about events okay so I'm pretty
sure you know what Dom events already
are things like click or mouse over
events and we can react to those in
JavaScript right your normal JavaScript
now in this video I want to show you how
we can react to those different types of
events in it the UJS right so say we
have a couple of buttons and we want to
react to click events we'll show you how
we can do something like that in the UJS
so right now I've just empty not this
div right here and inside the instance
I've just got this one property in the
data which is age and I'm going to
output this now to the browser so I'm so
going to a P tag and then inside here
I'm going to say my age is double curly
braces age right so this is going to
output now the age to the browser which
is currently 25 okay cool so now what I
want to do is create a couple of buttons
which is going to either add one to this
age or subtract one from this age right
so let's add those buttons inside this
one I'm going to say add a year and down
here I'm going to do another button
which is going to say subtract a year
okay so if we click this button I want
to add one to this property if we click
this button I want to subtract one from
this age profit how we're going to do
that well we need to listen to these Dom
events these polygamists and the way we
do that in view j/s is by using the
directive v - on okay so remember a
directive is just something with popping
here like an instruction
this time it's V - cod then we give a
colon and say what type of event we want
to listen to is this a mouse-over event
is this a click event a double click
event etc and there's a whole list of
different Dom events I'm going to show
you where you can get those for later on
in this case I just want to do a simple
click event right then I'm going to set
that equal to
and then the quotations and we'll fire
some code within these quotations right
so whatever we put in here UJS is going
execute when this bot is clicked so I
can access the age right here this
variable inside here and add one to it
so I could say change plus plus just
like that and I could do something
similar down here if I copy this and a
click events of this button this time I
want to take one from the age - - which
takes one this should work let's have a
look in a browser if we add a year yep
it's going up if we take a year yep is
going down so this is working this code
is being fired when we listen for a
click event and we do that using the V
on directive now we don't have to fire
the code inside these quotations right
here we can kind of externalize this
code we can add the code into methods
right here on the view instance so say
for example we want to fire a method
called add and we want to fire a method
called subtractive when these buttons
are clicked then we can do that let's
just save this and create these methods
right here on the instance first of all
add this is going to be a function and
it's going to do exactly the same thing
it's going to access the age so I can
say this dot age and then I can say plus
plus right that's going to add one to
the age I'm going to do the exact same
thing for subtract and this side it's
going to be a list of age - - okay so
that's going to take one away from the
age now if we try this out in a browser
then refresh then it add one yeah it's
still wear that so subtract doesn't work
and that is because so we've spelt
incorrectly so save that now subtract
works cool okay so we don't have to
write our code here we can just
externalize our code into the view
instance itself then we can just call
these different methods from here and
notice I do not have to add on the
parameters sorry the parentheses right
here right
the UJS knows that when we get a click
event is going to fire this function all
right it expects some kind of code to
execute so it's going to look for that
function we now
adding these parentheses right we only
have to add the parentheses is we're
just outputting the result of a function
right here so for example test right
then we have to do it but in this case
when we're attaching it to the event we
don't have to worry on okay cool so what
if now we want to react to a different
kind of event let's say we want to react
to a double click I'm going to create
two more buttons and down here I'm going
to say on DB l click right so these are
double click events DB I'll click and
this time I want to add ten years or
subtract ten years okay so when these
buttons are double clicked we either add
10 or subtract 10 from the age now we
could make new method here saying like
add 10 and subtract 10 and place them
down here but I don't see the point
I just want to keep these methods right
here so what we'll do is just add on the
parentheses to pass through a parameter
right so in these cases we're adding or
subtracting 1 so we're passing through a
parameter and in these cases we're going
to add or subtract 10 like so that makes
sense right and then we can call the
same functions and just pass through
these different values which we can take
right here so we'll either take an
increment by DC right so we're taking
that value that we want to either
decrease by or increment by so instead
of doing plus plus we'll say plus equals
i NC and then minus equals i NC so this
is either going to be 1 or 10 and 1 or
10 so it's going to either add 1 or 10
to the age or minus 1 or minus 10 28 so
this now should work if we check it out
so this still works this doesn't work so
that's not working let's check out what
happened subtract 1 let's have a look
subtract this oh that's why because we
need to say Dec so subtracting it still
works as one now if we single click on
this doesn't do anything if we double
click
absurd subtract attempt at all so this
all works that's fine now I want to show
you one more event and that is going to
be a mouse move event and this time what
I want to do is just add some more HTML
down here I want to add a div and this
ID is going to be equal to canvas right
here okay
now what I want to do is quickly add
some styles to style this canvas so I've
already got these on my github I'm just
going to copy them and paste them in or
right here you can get them from the
repository as well just adding a width
some padding text align and a border and
if we view this in a browser you going
to see it right this thing right here so
what I'm going to do is track the
movement of my mouse with inside this
canvas Kanak box and I want to output
the coordinates of the mouse relative to
this box in the center right here so
let's go to the index first of all and I
want to output two variables these
variables are going to be called x and y
now I've not created these just yet so
let's go and create them let's go to the
app and add them in the data property so
X is going to start off at 0 and Y is
also going to start off at 0 so if we
check these out now we're going to see 0
and 0 in the box I want these to update
as I move the mouse around so how the
heck are we going to do that well let's
add a event listener right here to this
canvas so we do that by thing V odd then
the event site which is going to be
mouse move so whenever the mouse moves
over this counter canvas right and this
is going to be people to a function
which we're going to call Bob gates X Y
so if I save that now we need to define
that function right here so I'll say
update X Y which is going to be a
function right now that to output the
coordinates I need access to the event
object right so when we perform a Dom
events like a click event or a move
event then we get an event object we get
access to it and we can pass it through
right here right we don't need to
explicitly pass it through here we don't
need to say event or anything like that
we get that automatically when there's
an event
so what we can do is log this to the
console just to have a look at it and
see what properties we've got available
whistles I say console dot log then and
I'm going to just check this out there
browser so that when I move over this
you can see this event it's a mount
event and if you expand one of these
things right here all these different
properties we have access to now the
ones I want and the offset properties
offset X and offset Y which are the
coordinates from this top left down
corner right so I can access that by
saying event dot offset X dot offset Y
so let's update those X&amp;amp;Y properties
with this information let's go back here
and say list dot X which is going to
refer to this thing right here is equal
to the event dot offset X and then this
dot y is going to be equal to the event
dot offset Y make sense so now every
time we move our mouse this event is
going to update and we're going to set
the X profit and the Y property equal to
the new offset X and offset Y property
on that event and it's going to update
therefore in the canvas the numbers that
we see so let's save this and check it
out in the browser and now when we move
around it's updating those properties
right there ok pretty cool so just very
quickly one more thing to want to show
you we don't have to write V on all the
time we can just say apt click or at
double-click right so it's like the
shorthand for the V on coop right there
now I'm not going to do this I'm going
to use V odd just so it's explicit and
what I'm going to be doing all right and
there's no confusion but just let you
know you can use that instead so there
we go I'm just going to save this and
show you in fact that this still work so
if we add one still working at said
still work it all right so let me know
what that is events in a nutshell
in the next tutorial we're going to take
these events one step further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
