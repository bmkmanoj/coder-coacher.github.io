REST API tutorial and in this video I
want to talk about HTTP methods and API
routes okay so first of all HTTP message
of what the heck are they well they're
basically just a way of telling the
server what type of request we are
making we're going to be looking at four
main types get requests post requests
pop requests and delete requests now to
talk about these a bit further I want to
delve into the kind of data we're going
to be using in our API so the idea of
our API will be to provide the list of
ninjas available for hire in your area a
bit like uber but instead of hiring
taxation going to be hiring ninjas
alright so you might have a front-end
application or mobile app somewhere with
a form of you input your area write your
postcode or your longitude and latitude
and then that mobile app is going to
take to that longitude and latitude
perform a get request through our API
and our API is going to receive it so
hey I'm going to get requests I want to
return a list of ninjas in JSON format
which is within a certain radius of the
locale that they've provided and we're
going to return that Jason to the mobile
app so they can display it on their
screen to their users so that's the idea
about a plan so obviously we're going to
need a list of ninjas or collection of
ninjas we're going to store that in our
MongoDB database right so we'll have a
list of ninjas in here and each ninja
could have some properties such as a
name the rank and its availability right
so the idea is that went from a
front-end application or third-party app
we make a request it's going to come
into our API it's going to deal with it
grab the data we need and return it to
the third-party app now the four types
of requests post get put and delete we
typically post requests when we're
creating new data so in this case if we
want to create a new ninja and store it
in this collection for example if a new
ninja has signed up to the service and
wants to offer their availability then
we can make a post request send that
means your data with all these different
properties to the API that's going to
store it in the database right so that's
a post request to create new data
to read data or to retrieve data in this
case retrieve a list of ninjas from this
database then we use a get request so
like we just said is on a mobile
application you put in your longitude
and latitude press n is going to make a
get request come to the API the API is
going to deal with it and it's going to
get the data it needs and return it to
the application the third party app
correct and that's a get request to read
data to update data or edit existing
data we use a put request so there might
be a meander in there that wants to
change its availability currently it's
true it wants to take itself off the
radar for a week while it does broad so
you want to change it to false you're
editing existing data for that we use a
pot request we send the updates to the
app updates in the database and it could
return the updated data to us all right
and finally to delete data we use a
delete request so in this case if we
want to delete they certainly enjoy if
they're broken the rules they've killed
a client we want to delete them from the
database we use a delete request and the
app deletes whichever ninja we specify
and maybe it returns that deleted ninja
to us right so that's how these
different request types work so if you
look at these you'll notice the first
letter of each one creates read update
and delete spells crud and you might
have heard of that acronym thrown around
a little bit no it doesn't mean that
your application is crap it means create
read update delete the for based
operations we use on data so now we know
a little bit about HTTP methods and what
we use them for I just want to take a
few minutes now to talk about our API
routes so what do I mean when I say API
Rance well when communicating with an
API we have to make requests to certain
routes or endpoints if you like that the
API exposes to us for example if we want
to retrieve a list of ninjas we make a
get request in our code to reroute like
this it represents a specific resource a
list of ninjas right so this is going to
be the route to
go out and get those ninjas if we create
a new ninja if we want to make a post
request we're going to use the same
route because again we want to add to
this collection it's the same resource
we're just interacting with it
differently here we're getting all the
data here we're adding to the data right
so it's the same route it's the same
endpoint but it's a different type of
request for the put request we might
have a round like this for it slash API
forward slash changes then /id
right and the ID would represent the
specific ninja or record that we want to
edit or update remember put requests are
used to edit existing data so because
it's existing it must appear in the
database somewhere with a unique ID that
could be this ID and then we're adding
it right so this would be the route this
would be the request route or endpoint
for this pot request to do a ninja it
would be the same as a pot request we'd
send a delete request this time to the
same endpoint the same route fall slash
ID at the end because we're deleting an
existing ninja it already exists in the
debate in the database right it would
make no sense to send me delete
requested this route right here because
right well which ninja do you want to
delete we send it to this one where
there's a specific ID now because these
two routes are the same and at least
your rats are the same if we send
request to the same route how does the
application how does the server the
Express app know how to differentiate
between them right how does it now to
delete in one case and update in another
or send back a list in one case or add
in another well when we make these
requests we say what type of request
we're making so for example this is
using jQuery if we want to make an AJAX
request to post data to create a new
ninja we send it to the endpoint right
here this is the URL the resource and
the method we're specifying in this Ajax
request we're saying it's post so then
when this reaches the server the server
the application know is that this is a
post request and it can take the data
that comes
with it and it can add it to the
database right so now acknowledging
support request is distinguishing itself
from a get request which even though has
the same URL has a different method
attached to it so now the server knows
watch what and it knows what to do with
the request so there we go
now we understand a little bit more
about HTTP methods and our API routes
let's start designing and coding our API
in the next tutorial we're gonna set up
our express up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
