app is looking a bit like this very
simple and it's just one component at
the minute the root component so now
what I'd like to do is introduce another
component which is going to be
responsible for listing our books on the
page so let's head back to the code and
create this component first of all I'm
going to right click source and create a
new folder called components which is
where all of our component files will
live and then inside there let's create
a new file and I'm going to call this
book list so capital B capital L is
alright so we have now this book list
component file and what I'm going to do
is just grab all of this here and I'm
going to paste it inside here because
the general structure the boilerplate of
a component is going to be more or less
the same right so what we're going to do
now is change this thing here to book
list all right and then we'll change
this export down here it's book list and
now we have this component right so this
component is going to be a div first of
all and then underneath or rather within
that diff we're going to have a ul and
the ID of this ul is going to be book -
list all right so inside this ul we're
just gonna for now output one Li tag
right eventually what we'll do is
dynamically output several Li tags here
depending on how much data we have but
for now since we're not actually
querying any data and we don't have any
data to output we're just going to do
one little Li tag so book name or
something like that right so close the
Li tag and save it so now we've created
this book list component very simple and
what we want to do is render it on the
page so to do that we're going to nest
it inside the app KS file right here
right we want to nest it down here
somewhere so the first thing we need to
do is import that book list component so
down here I'm going to create a little
comment saying components like so and
these are going to be the components
that we import and nest into this route
component
so to do that I'll say import book list
from and it's gonna be the correct
directory forward slash into the
components folder forward slash book
list like so okay so we've imported that
component now so therefore we can render
it anywhere inside this component so I'm
going to do it underneath the h1 and the
way that we do this the way we nest
another component is by opening our tags
and then putting out the name of the
component which we just imported then
self closing tag so this was the name
book list and we've just added it into a
tag right there so react is going to
look at this say okay well I want to
render now the book list component under
the h1 so it's going to grab that
component and it's gonna render all of
this underneath that h1 alright so let's
just make sure this has worked I'm going
to save everything and then head over to
the front-end and we can see now we have
book name right here alright so now
we've created our route component and
we've also created our workbook list
component so I think in the next lesson
we can start to set up Apollo on the
front end the Apollo clients so that we
can start interacting with our graph to
our server making queries receiving data
so we can finally start outputting data
on the front end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
