JavaScript for beginners lesson 41 and
in this video we're gonna look at the
window onload event ah alright then guys
so in the last lesson you saw me do
something a little bit like this where
we had a show more button which when
clicked expands this content and then we
can click it again to zoom that back up
now I want to change one thing in this
HTML which is going to have a drastic
impact on this functionality and that
one thing is to take this script which
is currently at the bottom and pop it in
the head now I've always said pop your
scripts at the bottom and the reason is
because when your HTML loads it loads in
order from top to bottom
and you want to make sure that
everything in your HTML is loaded before
your script is loaded because your
script may go into your HTML and try and
find elements all right so let's save
this now it's in the head and refresh
over here you see now it's not working
and the reason is as this HTML is loaded
it finds the script jumps into that and
then right here we're saying document
get element by ID content and that isn't
there yet not been loaded because in the
HTML were only up to here and the
content div is right here so that's why
I always say put these down here but in
some cases that's not possible and in
other cases you just like to pop your
scripts in the head I don't know even
sometimes though when you have this
right down at the bottom by the time it
gets here
sometimes your HTML could still be
loaded as it loads down more resources
when you get larger HTML files alright
so what I'm going to do is show you how
to overcome this by introducing the
window dot onload event all right so
let's jump into the test dot J s and
let's say window dot onload and we'll
set that equal to a function like that
and that my friends is saying grab the
window object in JavaScript and the
window object just represents this
browser window and we're saying when
that window has fully loaded so when all
HTML tags have been loaded in then
fire this function but until then do
nothing all right so it's going to fire
everything within this function after
everything in the HTML has loaded so
what we could do if we wanted to is grab
all this and we could copy and paste it
into that save that refresh you're here
and this should work yeah it does but
this is not the way I like to work I
think this is a bit untidy
and if you have many things firing on
the onload of them then you can have
different scripts down here I like to
keep things organized so I'm going to
take that back out again and paste it up
here and what I'm going to do is create
a new function and I'm going to call
this and set up events and this function
is primary purpose is to set up all the
events that I have on this web page
right and right here we're setting up
these events on the button and the
content well just the button but we're
going after the content after the window
has loaded right so we'll grab all that
and we'll paste it in here just like
that so that when this function is
called then it will go out and grab
those elements and then set this event
on the button now we don't want any of
that to happen until the window has
fully loaded so what we do is we come
down here to this function when the
window has loaded and we call this
function that we created at the top set
up events that's all I'm doing I'm just
calling this function after the window
has fully loaded and then it's going to
set up all our event for us which is
this one on the button right here okay
so that's the way I kind of like to
organize things when I'm setting up
events in JavaScript so I'll save that
refresh over here and now it still works
and everything is nice and organized in
our document okay so that is the window
onload event guys and we use it to make
sure that we don't find
javascript until the window has fully
loaded you don't have to use it for
every single bit of JavaScript that you
write only when you write JavaScript it
depends on all the elements being loaded
in like this alright so there we go guys
