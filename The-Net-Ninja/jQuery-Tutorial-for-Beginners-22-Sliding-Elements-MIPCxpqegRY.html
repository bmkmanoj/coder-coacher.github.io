jQuery for beginners lesson 22 and this
video is gonna be about sliding elements
Wow or I think going so jQuery gives us
two methods called slide up and slide
down and despite their name they don't
actually slide elements anywhere on a
page
they're just variations on the methods
fade in and fade out or show and hide in
that they remove content from the
document and then reinsert content to
the document and the duties of either
height property so the slide up method
reduces the height to zero and it
animates that the slide down method
restores that height to whatever the
original value was okay so let's take a
look at these two methods now you'll
notice first of all these two buttons
that have added right here
they are simply div tags like that
they've got a class of slide button up
and slide button down now I've stabbed
these in the CSS to make them look like
that I'll show you that briefly and if
you want to copy this you can just pause
right here and you can take down all of
these different rules okay and then once
you've done that we'll zoom back over to
the j/s and we'll start attaching events
to these buttons so I want to attach the
slide up so the click events of this
button right here so that inside this
function we can slide up this banner
right so what I'm going to do is copy
this class then a ctrl C over that and
then I'm gonna paste it in here the
period first then control V paste it in
now when we click this button this
function is going to fire and in here I
want to slide up this bonnet now I need
to get the ID of this banner to slide it
up and it's right here this one here so
I'm going to copy that and then I'm
going to paste this with inside the
jQuery wrapper just like that okay
now I can use the slide or method and
that's all there is to it guys okay so
now when I click this button here it's
going to slide up this button you like
that pretty cool yeah and we can do the
exact opposite by using the slide down
method so we're gonna copy this right
here copy and paste it here I'm going to
change this to down because that's the
class of this on
button right here so when we click that
all the button we want to slide the
ballot back down so I'm going to change
it up to down there also save that and
first of all we'll slide it up then
we'll slide it down pretty cool yeah
awesome right now we can't pass through
some parameters here it can pass through
the speed or the duration of the
animation so for the slide I'm gonna
make this about 100 milliseconds that's
not point one seconds so really quick
and then down here we'll say 4,000 so
about four seconds for the slide down
animation so save that and we'll try
this again this is gonna be really quick
going upwards yep zooms up and then
slides really slowly all right so we can
also pass through a callback function if
we want and we know how to do that we
can say function like that and then in
here do some kind of callback method
whatever you want to do don't do an
alert this is really how much I'm just
doing this as an example I'm gonna say
animation complete put a semicolon at
the end save this and refresh so now
when I slide up
there's no callback function there but
when I slide down we have got a callback
function so what it finishes it should
throw this alert up so let's do that
slide down really slowly and just in
case you've missed it there it is the
animation is complete just in case you
didn't know that happens all right so
let's click OK now there's one more
method I want to show you and that is
slide toggle right so we're slide up and
slide down slide them up and down
irrespective of what they were before
slide toggle will slide it up or down
depending on what it is before okay so
I've deleted that other event right
there on this slide down below button
I'm just going to use the slide toggle
method on this button right here so when
we click it the first time is sure to
slide up and then when we click it the
second time it should slide down because
it's like toggle it slide up or down
depending on what it currently is yeah
let's change this to a thousand as well
so it's not so quick and do that all
right there we go perfect and like the
other method methods we can pass through
a callback function just the same way
like that we can say
it's animation complete like that and
then this is gonna throw it alert up
every time an animation completes okay
like that so there we go guys
that is the slide methods in jQuery have
