PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 just a
simple build and this is a lesson 1 Wow
alright then guys I'm actually really
really really excited to give you this
course and the reason is because I pride
myself a lot on this skill you would not
believe the amount of people that come
to me asking me to convert a PSD design
into a website I had a lot of money of
this service and that's because I kicked
some freaking out of it so that's what
I'm going to teach you to do when I
teach you to kick ass at turning PSD
designs into prototypes and fully
functioning websites so to get the most
from these courses and by the way this
is the first of many different courses
I'm going to do on this they're gonna
get more complex as we go along but to
get the most from them you're gonna need
to know just a few little things first
thing you need to know is about
Photoshop hopefully you've got that
installed on your computer and hopefully
you know your way around it just a
little bit you don't need to create
masterpieces in Photoshop that's not our
job here you just need to know your way
around and know where a few of the tools
are I'm gonna come up what we need to
know in this course it would just be
nice if you had a baseline understanding
of it
second thing is HTML and CSS and again
don't need to be a wizard or a ninja you
just need to know enough to create
simple websites we're going to cover the
rest as we go along if you need help
with that I've got two courses on HTML
for beginners and CSS for beginners you
can check both of those out I'll leave
links to those in the description down
below third thing you need to know is
just how a website works in simple terms
you need to know that you have to go to
a browser type a URL that requests
information from a server which brings
it back to your desktop computer on your
browser and displays a web page that's
all you need to know ok then class so I
just wanted to give you a sneak preview
of what we're going to be making in this
playlist it's just a simple one-page
bill just this page here it's got a logo
it's got a nav a banner a few elements
down here so not much to it hopefully
we'll get this covered in just a few
lessons I'm using Photoshop cs5 for this
course and
you might be using CC I've got CC on my
other computer and that's got some cool
new features but I wanted to do one on
cs5 first of all because I know a lot of
you guys still use this and if you're
using CC then to be honest not a lot has
changed in terms of you know cutting up
images and saving them there are some
cool new features like I say for CC that
make this process much easier but you
can still do this in CC - alright then
so how are we going to approach building
this website from PSD well this is going
to be the workflow my friends first of
all we're going to go into Photoshop and
cut up all of our images that we need
for the website alright second thing we
need to do is decide on some kind of
structural layout where the header is
going to be the main content the footer
etc then we're going to code up our HTML
and then finally we're going to start up
maybe up by using some CSS so that's
what we're going to be given in this
course the very first stage is going to
be coming up right next where we're
going to dive right into Photoshop so
make sure you subscribe to get all the
updates from this playlist and I'll see
you guys in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
