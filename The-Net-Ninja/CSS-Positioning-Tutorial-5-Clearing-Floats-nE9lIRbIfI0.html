CSS positioning lesson 5 and in this
video we're going to start looking at
clearing floats Wow
alright then gang so you saw in the last
lesson that when we floated an element
it took it out of normal document flow
and then whatever was under that element
scooted upwards all right because the
floated element no longer occupies any
height in normal document flow now to
demonstrate this point what I want to do
is surround all of these service divs
with a div in itself so let's give this
a class of services and then set that
closing tag and put it at the end all
right so now if I click on this services
div you're going to see this blue line
over here now that has got no height
right and that's because these things
right here essentially have no height as
well in normal document flow they've
been taken out of normal document flow
so all of this essentially has no
heightening all right which is why this
is showing as 0 height as well okay so
let's imagine we have more content under
these three services let's do another
div with a class of content then within
that age two and then we'll just stay
content and then I'm just going to pay
some lorem ipsum down here within P tags
oops not that let's grab it from over
here all right copy that stuff all right
perfect
now what I want to do is give this a
background color this div all right so
this content class right here will grab
and copy it paste it down here and we'll
give this a padding of 20 pixels and
then all 10 pixels rather and then a
background of let's just say CCC all
right now that you can see here guys
that this content box right here is
stretching to the top of the
services right the text is underneath
browsers are clever enough to work out
that we've got floated elements above it
so we don't want the content to be
hidden behind it but the element itself
which is great this background color of
CCC is zooming up behind those services
now I don't want that I want the grey
box to start here all right and to do
that we have to clear those floats we
have to say to the normal document flow
hey there's floats above us which we
want to clear and we're going to restart
normal document flow after those floats
alright so that is the clear property in
CSS so what we could do is say the
content clear:both right and that's
going to clear both left and right
floats now if I just wanted to clear
left floats
I'd say play left and if I just wanted
to clear right floats
I'd say clear right right now there's no
right floats here they're all floated
left so it's not clearing anything at
the minute which is white jumped back up
here but if I put this back to left then
it comes back down alright so that is
how we clear those floats and resume
normal document flow now this has a flaw
right imagine now I wanted to put a
margin at the top of this element I
could say here right margin top 50
pixels but that's not doing anything
whatsoever and if I inspect this element
right now let's come down here and
expand this services content you can see
this margin there is at the top in the
orange but it's not starting at the
bottom right I could even change this to
or 100 save that and refresh and this is
still not giving it any additional
margin the margin is just stretching up
behind those services okay and that's
because this has not fully worked yet it
clears the float to some extent that was
so that we can restart normal document
flow and the element under it kind of
starts beneath it rather than go behind
it but we can no longer apply a top
to it all right so there is a technique
or rather a couple of techniques that we
can use to solve this problem the first
one and the slightly old one and more
crude one which a lot of people use is
to put a div or an empty element below
the floated elements like this and say
div style equals clear:both like that
right and then if we save that and
refresh now we get that margin all right
so we've got this empty div which is
just sitting under these services and
it's saying hey clay both left and right
right now so that I can resume normal
document flow so now this content right
here is having that margin applied to it
because the floats have already been
cleared okay now I don't particularly
like this method because it just means
we're entering unnecessary code into our
HTML I don't want ice on semantics so
what I'm going to do is show you another
way and what I'm going to show you let's
save that and refresh over here first
what I'm going to show you is this thing
right here that I did with the wrapper
right but we're going to do it to this
services class so what I'm going to do
is target that services div and then I'm
going to say after which is a pseudo
class I remember that means that after
this services diff is going to place
something right here right we're going
to say content is nothing but if I
wanted to I just to demonstrate this
outside hello I'm going to save this and
refresh over here now you can see
afterwards the content is Hello that's
been placed right here now I go through
this
after pseudo class in CSS for beginners
so if you want to check that out I'll
leave a link to that video down below
but essentially what I'm going to do
guys you just put some empty content in
right there and then I'm going to say
display that as block and then
clear:both so essentially we've kind of
dynamically added something in right
here which is going to clear all of
these elements right here all of these
floated elements right so let me save
that now and I'm going to reopen this
link and now we can see that margin is
there that 100 pixel margin right here
yeah so if we change that to 50 no
reduced to 50 so now we can use that
margin there's no extra code in here and
also guys if I click on this services
now you can see it's got the full height
and that's because we did this thing in
the CSS right here we kind of injected
some empty content here which is cleared
all of these floats
okay now empty content is coming at the
very end of this services div it says
after right here but actually in the
code if I inspect the element let's come
down here below the glass services you
can see this is the services thing right
here yeah we've got these three dips
right there one two and three and then
this is the after pseudo class that's
where we put in the code okay and we say
give it some empty content display as
block and play both so it's clearing all
of these three elements within that
services wrapper so now the services
shows a full height if I was to delete
this right here can we get rid of it no
but let's let's just get rid of all
these things right here okay now the
after is gone and if we hover over this
it still got zero height okay so that is
the power of this rule right here and
this is the way I like to do things so
that is clearing float skies it's a
little bit complex at first so if you
have any questions feel free to drop a
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'll see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
