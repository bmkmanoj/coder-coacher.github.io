bootstrap full tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about bootstrap
nouns so with no stuff or we can easily
make navigation sections on our website
with a variety of built-in styles and
shit with bootstrap for a few added
flexbox utilities so first of all I just
want to check out the documentation to
see if example nosey at the different
kind of nouns we have on offer so if you
go to now under components and click now
there then you can see we've got this
base now then we've got horizontal nose
vertical mouth tabs pills dropdowns etc
so let's just take a look at what tabs
look like these things right here like
tabs pills look like this etc so we can
use all of these different things all of
these different classes to create a now
that really simply on our website so I'm
going to show you how to do that now so
if we jump back into the code right here
this is underneath the cards that we
created in the last lesson what we're
going to be doing is creating a list of
speakers with some placeholder copies at
each one so the speakers names they're
all going to be links in the nav bar and
when you click on one of them it's going
to show the appropriate information
about them so the first thing we're
going to do is create a title for this
section first of all h2 with a utility
class of display for remember those
display utility classes control how that
text looks on the page display for is
just going to make it look quite large
so let's create that h2 so also h2 plus
equals then display - 4 and then that
will say meet the speakers so let's
first of all preview this in a browser
come down here you can see meet the
speakers right there so a couple of
things I want to do with this first of
all I want to move into the center and I
want to give it some padding so it's not
squashed up to these things right here
so we now to do the central alignment we
just so texts - Center we've done that
in a previous tutorial and then to add
padding we can use some different
padding the utility classes as well
the way this works is by saying hey
first of all the padding then the
direction Y is up and down X is left on
right
okay so why
because we won't open down and then
we're going to do - five so we can add a
number after this to kind of control how
much pattern we want to give it and that
works a lot better we could be the
service margin if we want we just do em
for margin again we can do X or Y - at
four for example save that and that's
going to add a bit of margin for us as
well pretty cool so there's our title
now let's get on to the actual mouth so
the way we do this is pretty simple I'm
just going to create a now and this is
going to have a class equal to now okay
so that's all we're going to do for now
then inside this now we're going to have
a bunch of anchor tags so a and then
each anchor tag is going to have a class
of nav - link that tells bootstrap that
this is a link it's going to give it the
appropriate style for enough okay so
let's give this a class of now - a link
and then let's also give this an H ref
equal to something doesn't matter what
that is yet but we're going to do that
later and then it let's close this off
and the nest Ninja is going to be our
first speaker that's me and then we're
going to copy this and we're going to
create a couple more so once in three
more as well nav links and let's just
paste some different copy in here so the
next one is going to be the web wizard
and the one after that let's just delete
this to do first of all is going to be
what Tim code and really original with
these names and the last one check this
one this is my favorite the angular
Avenger alright cool so these are the
four speakers right and now we have
created our nav and if we check it out
in this browser right the bottom there
okay not looking great but was not to do
anything yet automatically bootstrap has
made this basic navbar for us and I
think it looks okay for some kind of
simple maps but we want to make it look
a little better so first of all what I
want to do is justify this content so if
we make this larger we can see it's all
on the Left right here we could justify
to the right or the center I want to
justify to the center so we've done this
in a previous tutorial all we need to do
come up to the surrounding element right
here than now and we can say justify
content and then - either end to go to
the right or Center for the middle this
is thanks to bootstrap force select
properties so if we save this now and
check it out in a browser we're going to
see all that centralized that one's a
little bit better so far okay what next
I want to make them look like the pill
so remember on here we could see we
could do pills they look like this we'd
like this blue box around an active one
well how do we do that all ready to do
is add this class of nav pill so let's
copy that paste it in here as well save
it and check this out in a browser
let's see what's happened absolutely
nothing why is that well because it's
only really the active one that looks
like a pill right and it's active
because it's got a class all active so
let's copy that and add a class of
active to our first one minute ninja
right here so ever save that now and
check this out in a browser this time
we're going to see that pill effect
okay so already this is starting to look
a lot better we've got our navbar right
there with the pills what I want to do
is show you this when it kind of goes to
a smaller screen so you can see it's
four columns right there yet and as we
go to a small screen let's have a look
okay they're just getting squashed and
that no longer looks very good ideally
what we want this to do step up on this
small screen don't wait so how do we do
that well we can use a flex utility
class on this mouse so we can say flex -
column and that is going to display them
in a column right so if we see this now
that looks better for mobile but that's
going to also happen for all screen
sizes so we make it larger it's still
going to be in this column because right
here we're not specifying any screen
size and just think flex column and it's
going to take effect for all sizes from
the smallest upwards what we want is
when we get to medium size screens we
want to then display them in a kind of
roll X to each other again
well guess what we can do that we can
say flex - MD for medium sized screens
and upwards -
wrote so now if we save this and check
this out okay there are oh there let's
make it smaller and now they should be a
column pretty soon run about that cool
so now we have a nice responsive flex
now right there so there's one thing
missing right the information about the
speakers so when we click on one of
these we want to display information
about the speakers down here so we need
to do that next so to do that we need to
create another element down here to
contain all of that information in so
I'm going to say div and this is going
to have a class equal to tab - content
right I'm also going to give it that py5
for padding up and down so it's got a
little padding on this tab content div
right so now pretty strap knows all the
contents for these times these kind of
linked right here is going to go inside
here so each one of these really needs a
different element to contain content for
it so we need four different elements in
here each containing content which
corresponds to one of these dudes so
let's do four different elements or same
diff and each of these different
elements is going to have a class equal
to
oops that's right yet is equal to tab -
pain okay
so now what we can do is put some
content in here we'll do h3 the first
one is going to be the net ninja and
then let's play some lorem ipsum down
here so let's head to this to your
website again over here let's grab a
little bit more this time so I don't
know like that much okay and paste it in
or right here so if we save this now
then we're not going to see anything at
the minute okay let's just do out all
this first of all then we'll come back
to it so let's just copy this and paste
it three more times alright save that
and do we see anything no we still not
see missing why not well because none of
them are active bootstrap knows it by
default we don't want to show these only
when we click on one of these kind of
items in there now
we want to see one of these but we can
default one of them to active and since
the net ninja is active appear it makes
sense to make this one active right here
to let add a class of active that one
save it and now here in a browser now we
see it so only the tab pane with a class
of active associated to it is going to
show on this thing right here cool so
that's really nice but what we want is
when we click on one of these things not
just to refresh the page what we want to
show the different content right here so
bootstrap has a lot of JavaScript which
controls this kind of functionality we
just need to edit the HTML a little bit
so that it knows what to do so the first
thing we want to do is come up to these
links and add in a data
- toggle attribute to tell it what this
is going to do okay
so we'll say date set - toggle and
that's going to be equal to tab so now
bootstrap knows that this is some kind
of tab navigation and when you click on
one of these it knows what to do to show
some content so let's copy that for each
one paste it in there and there and
finally there okay save that now that's
not the only thing we need to do we need
to associate each one of these links
with one of these panes the new strap
doesn't know which one of these links is
associated to one of these panes it's
not going to guess you need to tell it
and the way we do that is by adding an
ID to each one of these first of all so
I'll say IP equals we'll call this first
one at ninja this second one is going to
be the widget so we'll say ID equals
wizard the third one is going to be the
captain so we'll say ID is equal to
captain the fourth one is going to be
the angular Avenger so let's call this
one Avenger ID equals Avenger okay so
we've got the IDS of the panes now we're
just need to associate them with these
things right here and the way we do that
is by using the H ref attribute right
here so we can just pop in whatever ID
we want to associate with these links so
I'm going to say ninja for that one for
this one I'm going to say wizard and
it's important that you add in the hash
for the
I D which one is going to be captured
and then this final one is going to be
Avenger I'm about this right Avenger
okay so let's save that and now if I
view this in a browser let's try
clicking on these things okay as I click
on them different ones become active and
we can't see these content changes but
that's just because they've not changed
the content from each one so let's just
do that we'll call this one the web
wizard the next one is captain code and
then the one after that is angular
Avenger I really like that name all
right cool and you like Avenger if
anyone's going to make a youtube channel
about angularjs I strongly advise you to
use this name angular Avenger otherwise
I'll go at some point right fair one so
anyway save that and if we view this in
a browser now if I click on this we can
see the content is now change it awesome
so that is how we can create a map this
is a really simple example right I
advise you to have a go at this yourself
seems a little complex at first because
there's a lot of different classes and
things going on but once you get a hang
of it that easy I mean there's no
JavaScript involved and this is all very
responsive as well very good so that
when we click on one of these in a
mobile it still does the same thing but
yeah I decided to play around and then
go check out the nav section of the
documentation because there's a few more
things we can do with them like this for
example you can add dropdowns all right
and yeah a bit more markup but again
really simple when you get the hang of
it
so there we go that is NASA in action in
the next tutorial what we're going to do
is actually add enough are right at the
top of the website OPA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
