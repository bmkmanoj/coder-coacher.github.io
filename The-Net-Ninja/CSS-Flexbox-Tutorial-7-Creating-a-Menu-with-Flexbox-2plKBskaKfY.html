seventh flexbox tutorial and in this
video we're going to go through our
first example and create a flex menu Wow
dogs I've got a head and opened up this
example one folder and I'm going to be
working in this menu dot HTML file which
you can see right here and also this
style dot CSS file which is linked up in
the head here so in this menu HTML file
you can find a div with a class of
wrapper keeping everything within this
central column there we've got some
pretty standard markup a nav elements ul
and then some allies within it
containing a tags so that's pretty
standard when it comes to creating a
menu in HTML so what we're going to do
is jump to the Stars and we're going to
star this up using flexbox and some
other kind of base styles so I've split
this into two first of all I've got
those Styles right there which is just
sterling the body in the wrapper etc
then I've got a comment right here
saying menu based ounce this is where
we're going to do things like the color
the font weight the padding that kind of
thing
and then down here we're going to apply
those flex styles so that they align
properly all right there so let's start
off by grabbing the nav element so I'll
say nav open this up and what I'll say
is background 333 I'm just going to zoom
in one more because it looks a little
small okay then I'll go after the UL
within the nav so I say nav ul and what
I'm going to do is give these a list
style type or not and that's going to
get rid of those little blobs that you
saw to the left of them I'm also going
to get rid of the padding on those okay
then I want to style the links
themselves so I'll say nav a and then
the first thing we want to do is take
away the underlining of them so I'll say
text decoration is not then I'll say
text align is going to be Center and
this will kind of come into effect later
in fact I'll leave that one off for now
I'll just comment it out then I want to
say they're all going to be white so
call it FFF and I'm going to display
them
and a block so then I'll take up the
full width by default and I'm going to
give them a padding as well of 10 pixels
like that okay now I want to do a quick
hover effect on the e so I'll say now a
pseudo hover and all I'm going to do is
change the background color to five five
five which is a slightly lighter gray so
there's our menu to begin with and this
is typically how it would probably log
on more battles something similar to
that and maybe we could include a
drop-down menu I'm not going to do that
now but the point is on mobiles it's
always going to revert to some kind of
stepped design all right now what we
want to do is make the Flex menu for
slightly larger screens so what I'm
going to do is a media query first of
all I'm going to say media screen and
oops the minimum width is going to be
768 pixels so only when the browser is
larger there's 768 pixels are these Flex
properties going to come into play for
all browsers less in size then it's
going to look like this static version
and we'd apply like I say some kind of
drop down menu to it alright then so
let's open up this media query and
ourselves a bit of room all right there
so the first thing I want to do is grab
the UL tag because that is going to be
our Flex container remember these right
here are going to be Flex items and for
those to be Flex items we need to make
this a Flex container so let's get that
ul so I'll say enough ul and we're going
to give that a display type both flex
like that and then look what happens
they all now line up to each other left
to right pretty cool right so we can
either keep it like that or we can apply
some kind of flex grog to it so let's
just try that I'll say now if Li these
are the Flex elements within it remember
and we'll say Flex is one one and zero
so now they're growing
to all the available space and they're
taking up the whole navigation and if we
had more links then they would too so if
I just kind of copy one of these and
paste it in again you're going to see
that they're all going to be the same
size they're all growing at the same
rate to take up the available space
pretty cool right so that has been done
just using these couple of flex
properties right there how simple is
that now I would previously kind of do
floats clear those floats and mess
around a little bit to get this to look
how I wanted it to this is so much
easier and before when I said text align
and a commented out I wanted that to
have an effect right now because that
looks a little bit nicer so I want to
show you one more thing and to do that
I'm going to comment out this flex for
now and I want to show you a property
which we can apply to the Flex container
which is the UL and that property is
called justify - content all right and
there's a few different properties we
can use for this so the first one is
Center so let's try that see what it
does and it's going to Center
all of those flex items in the container
all right dead simple and the next one
is flex and and that's going to move
them to the opposite side and notice it
doesn't change the order if we used to
use floats because home was the first in
the list Homewood offered flow over to
the far right and then kind of go
backwards this way using this property
right here justified content and
specifying flex and it doesn't do that
it keeps them all in the same order so
that's really cool the other one I want
to show you is the Flex start and that
is kind of the default behavior weather
all on the left over there and then
finally I want to show you these two
here space around and space between so
to demonstrate that I'm going to give
these a tags a different background
color I'm going to say background color
will be about 777 so it's quite light so
we can see them now all right so now
just your five content I'm going to say
space around and check that out it
spaces them around equally and it adds a
little bit of space on this side so
we've got space here
space on the edge and then we've got
space doubled up between them as well
all right so on each side of each
element there's space that's what space
around does and it spaces them equally
the other one I want to show you is
space between and that just gets rid of
the ones on the edges so now there's
equal space in between them all there
all right what I'm going to do is just
keep this at flex start because that's
how I want my navigation I'm going to
take that background color off them as
well because I don't want that for now
and to be honest I'm not sure I'll keep
this flexing let's have a look yeah
we'll keep that flexing for now that was
pretty cool all right so that guys is
how we make a simple navigation menu
using flex and these are the only flex
properties we've used how simple is that
so if you have any questions feel free
to leave a comment down below otherwise
guys don't forget to share subscribe and
like and I'll see you in a very next
