your very first step in becoming a
regular expression and ninja now before
we start I'm gonna put it out there
regular expressions are a part of coding
that a lot of programmers don't
particularly enjoy and in some cases
just outright a void and I don't blame
them it can be a boring as hell and
cumbersome topic but nonetheless it is a
very very important one how many times
have you been on a website and filled in
some kind of form only to get back an
error saying that hey this is not a
valid email address or this is not a
valid password choose a different one
well the mechanism behind this checking
from the website is in no doubt using so
form of regular expression to do so and
that's essentially what they allow us to
do in a nutshell regular expressions
allow us to check a string of characters
like a password or email address for
matches to make sure that it conforms to
a pattern described by that regular
expression that we create for example we
could create a regular expression to
check for a email address in a
particular form field on our website and
we put in that regular expression that
it must have an @ symbol at a certain
position and it also must end in an
extension like com
org or colon UK among other things as
well so this is the kind of stuff we can
do with regular expressions and right
now I'm going to show you an example
that have already made in preparation
for this course alright then so let's
just go through a couple of simple
examples right here I've got a form that
I created earlier and it's asking for
some user information like the user name
email password telephone and profile
slug now we will be creating this form
later on in the series I'm going to show
you how to do all of the validation with
regular expressions but for now let's
just test them out so if I go into the
email field and start to type something
and then you can see goes orange and I
get some feedback below which says email
must be a valid address eg me at my
domain comm so until I type in a valid
email address it's gonna remain orange
and give me this feedback bought the
mini
I type in a valid email address such as
me up the net ninja code at UK and then
it goes green and right now I'm saying
hey this is fine
but this isn't okay so it's not
validating yep now it is so I'm using a
regular expression to check this to
check that this is a valid email address
so let's do a telephone number I'll
start to type a number and you can see
at the minute I get feedback because
currently it's not the correct format
it says telephone must be a valid UK
telephone number in brackets 11 digits
so so far there's four let's do another
seven to make it 11 and now I get the
green light so this is working okay so
these are just a couple of examples of
how we can use regular expressions to
check that farm fuels are being entered
correctly and like I said I'm going to
show you how to do all of this as we go
further into this series so hopefully
you can see the importance of using
regular expressions in programming to
provide this kind of feedback to a user
but what does a regular expression
actually look like well it looks
something like this yeah so this might
look like the most random string right
now but by the end of this series I
promise you you'll know exactly what
each character in the string represents
and you'll also be able to make your own
regular expressions yourself as well so
in this series we'll be taking a look at
the basic regular expressions to begin
with and working our way upwards to
create a form similar to what we saw a
minute ago where we can check different
fields and provide feedback to reuse it
now I also want to point you in the
direction of the course files for this
playlist which can be found on my github
repository called regex
playlist the link to this is gonna be
down below and in here you're gonna find
course files for lesson 10 - lesson 16
we don't have course files for the first
half of the series because we're going
to be using an online tool to test all
of our regular expressions to begin with
but if you want to see the code for any
of the other lessons down here you can
select the code over here where it says
branch and you can
find all the regex stuff invalidation
yes I also have the HTML and the styles
up there as well so there we go there's
your whirlwind introduction to regular
expressions I hope you enjoyed this
series and by the way guys if you do
enjoy these videos please don't forget
to share subscribe and like them as well
that really doesn't mean a lot and I'm
gonna see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
