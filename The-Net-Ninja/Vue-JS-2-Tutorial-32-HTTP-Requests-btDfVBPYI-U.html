32nd vjf tutorial and in this video
we're going to start making HTTP
requests
okay there's so far we have this form
right here which allows us to add in a
new blog post and so far it's working
well if we have content then it appears
down below in this preview section which
is cool right but eventually we want to
take this data and do something with it
like store it in a database or something
now to do that we're going to have to
start making HTTP requests get requests
post requests that kind of thing
so there's a few different ways we can
do this in UJS we could use jQuery if
you wanted to or the fetch API I'm going
to show you a way using this plug-in
called view resource now in the early
days of a few GS this was kind of like
the official way to make and handle
these requests so I'm going to show you
how to install this now and how to make
and handle these HTTP requests with view
resource so if we scroll down a little
bit we can see to install it we need to
do this thing right here NPM install
view resource so I'm just going to copy
this and open up my terminal make sure
you're in the correct directory I'm in a
view GIS playlist and then just paste
this thing in and at the end of it oops
NPM install view - resource and at the
end just do double - save that's going
to save it to our dependencies okay cool
so now that's installed let's just check
our package JSON file to make sure it's
in our dependencies and we can see it
right there
cool okay so now how do we use this
plug-in well first of all we need to go
to our main J's file and import it this
is the file that gets kicked off when we
first start our application so we need
to import it here and tell the UJS we
want to use this plug-in so to do that
I'm going to say import and it's view
resource front view - resource ok and
this is going to be stored in the node
module so a view GS is going to be
clever enough to work out where to get
that from okay so now we've imported it
now we need to tell the users we want to
use this in a lot of applications and we
do that by saying you don't use
and then view resource which is this
thing or right here okay so we're now
using this plugin in our application and
we can go ahead and start using HTTP
requests now how's this going to work if
we take a look at our form we've got all
of these different fields right when
they filled it in we want some kind of
button for them to post it then to a
database so let's add that button first
so if we go into our add blog component
we want to come to the end of the form
which is right here and just inside that
we want to add a button so we'll say
button and we want to attach a click
event to this so to do that we'll say V
- on and it's going to be click and it's
going to equal to some kind of function
right and we'll call this
I don't know post so post right there
and the button will say add blog now
when we click a button in a form like
this we want to prevent the default
behavior okay we don't want it to go off
the page anywhere so we're going to tap
on it now an event modifier prevent and
that's going to prevent that behavior
all right so now we've created this
button what we need to do is create this
method down here which is actually going
to grab our data it's going to take it
all and do something with it posting
right so let's go down to the object out
here and inside our methods we'll have a
post method which is a function like so
so this is where we're going to start
using the HTTP capabilities of a few
resource so first of all what we're
going to do is say this okay to refer to
the component and then now we've
installed view resource we can say
dollar sign HTTP right we can't use that
beforehand but we cannot now we've
installed that plug-in then if we want
to say what type of requests are making
it's going to be a post request because
what we're doing is grabbing the data
that the users input to the fields and
we're going to grab all that and post it
to somewhere right
so parentheses and in here we need to
say where we're posting to now if we had
some kind of database setup we could
post to that database and we're going to
do that in future tutorials
set this up with firebase and post to
our own no SQL database but for now I
just want to use a service online called
adjacent placeholder and this basically
gives us a very simple REST API to
interact with so we can make post
requests or get requests to these
different resources right here and what
we're going to do is make a request to
the posts right so you can see right
here the route is this URL and then it's
just forward slash posts if we want to
make a post request you see posts so
we're going to do that now so what I'm
going to do is just copy and paste the
URL we need from my github repo I'll
leave the link to that down below and
I'm just going to paste it in here so
we're making a post request to this and
again this isn't going to do much we're
not going to see where this data goes
we're just kind of getting used to using
this HTTP method right here okay so
later on when we do come to use firebase
we're going to change this URL right
here to be the URL of our firebase okay
so the second parameter we need to pass
through is an object and this object is
going to be what we want to send okay
now if we take a look at this REST API
kind of thing here JSON placeholder you
can see we need certain different items
in the posts so we'll click on posts and
you can see we have a user ID a title
and a body right so let us now go and
add those things so I'll come down here
and what I'm going to do is specify
those different properties in this
object so the title we want to send is
going to be this blog title because
remember this thing right here when we
enter something into that form this is
populated so now we can grab that once
you've entered something and we click
that button and we can grab it and store
it here in this object that we're
sending okay
so the next thing we need to add is the
body and that's going to be this blog
dot content
that was the textarea okay and then
we'll also pass through a user ID and
because we don't really have a user ID
we just have these names right here
where are they
these things then what I'm going to do
is just leave this for now I'm just
going to put in one okay and when we
hook this up with firebase we'll add
this improperly okay cool so we're
making that post request and that's
going to post data to that fake Jason
server okay so what we can do then is
tack on the then method because this is
a promise it returns to us a promise
right here which means okay this is
going to take some time to complete this
action when it's complete then I'll fire
whatever function you pass through to
the then method alright so we're going
to pass this function through and we
receive the data but and the data that
we get back is typically going to be the
data that we send in a post request so
let's just log this to the console and
see what happens we'll say console that
log and the data okay so let's save that
and check it out in a blizzard and if we
go to our form I'm going to open up the
console just so we can see what's
returned to us and let's enter some
details okay that's blog now when we
click that we get a response right here
we can see the URL you went to status is
201 it's okay everything's fine it's
been created and we can see the body
takes we get back is listing right here
which we entered okay and if we open the
body we can see the different properties
are right there so everything is
absolutely fine
this has all work so we've successfully
now made a post request
now just one little thing I want to do
to finish up this tutorial before we
move on is to add some kind of dynamic
behavior into this so that when we add a
blog then we get a message saying thanks
for adding your blog and also this still
hides right so let's do that we're going
to use V to do it so the first thing I
want to do is add
a new property right here called
submitted and what this is going to do
is keep track of whether the form has
been submitted yet so to begin with it's
going to be false right because it's not
been submitted yet but when we click on
the button to submit it's then going to
be true so we have submitted it so we
can use this now to use a couple of V if
statements up here
so for example if we successfully post
then we want to show some kind of
success message right so we'll add in
the low default div and this div is
going to have the directive at V if and
that's going to be equal to submitted so
when submitted is true then what we want
to do is show this message so inside
here we can output some kind of simple
message I'll do 83 and I'll say
something like thanks for adding your
post okay now we need when we click this
button down here we need this submitted
to turn to true so that then that shows
so underneath here we'll say this does
submit it equals true okay make sense
because when this equals true then we'll
get that kind of feedback message so
let's save this check it out again and
add blog now we get this message right
here which is cool one more thing I want
to hide this form when we've submitted
as well so we can add on a V if
statement for that so it's going to be
the opposite of this thing right here we
only want to show the form when
submitted is false so what you know the
same thing V if equals submitted but
just add in this thing so it kind of
negates it okay so what after on the
form or say V - if is equal to then it
the Gatien operator submit it save that
and let's check it out
refresh and now if we add in a lot of
stuff
I've blog now it hides the form and we
get this message right here so that's a
little bit better okay cool so there we
go that is how we use a few resource to
make HTTP requests this isn't the end of
UCAV resource but also going to make get
requests in the next tutorial and later
on down the line we're going to hook
everything up to five ace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
