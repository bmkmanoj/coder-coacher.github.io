11th nodejs tutorial and in this video I
just want to talk a little bit about
clients and servers or are they gang so
we're getting to the point in this
tutorial series where we want to start
creating a server in nodejs and serve it
up some files but before we do that I
just want to take a few minutes to talk
about what actually goes on behind the
scenes and when we serve those files and
how we request them because I think
having an understanding of this is going
to serve you better when you're writing
your applications so when we browse a
website we're browsing it in a browser
like Google Chrome hopefully and
sometimes we might do something on a
website like ask for some data right at
which point the clients which is the
browser sends a request to the server
and then the server will handle that
request and send a response to the
client which will update probably what
we see ok but how do the two sides
actually communicate with each other
well that's where protocols come into
play so a protocol is basically just a
set of communication rules which two
sides agree on when they communicate
with each other ok so for example we
could have a German guide and an Italian
dude and they want to speak to each
other for some reason but when they
start talking to each other in their
mother tongues you know the Italian
speaking Italian and the German speaking
German then they can't really understand
each other and nothing happens nothing
gets communicated between them but they
might both know English as a second
language so they agree with each other
to speak in English and then they can
communicate with each other ok so that's
similar to how it works on the Internet
the client and the server can agree to
communicate via a particular set of
rules known as a protocol and that way
they can communicate easily so they just
follow a set of rules that they can both
understand ok so you probably already
know that each computer or server can be
identified by its own unique
i PHX right and it looks like all these
numbers here so if we want to
communicate between the two computers if
a client wants to make a request to the
server then it will first need to
connect to this IP address and it's
going to open up what's known as a
socket between the two computers which
is essentially just the channel down
which information can be sent okay and
the information that sent is structured
via different protocols for example HTTP
or FTP and these protocols are like the
different languages that our German and
Italian guys can speak for example they
could both speak English or they might
both speak Spanish so they could choose
which language to communicate and each
language is structured in a different
way so depending on what the client on
the server is trying to communicate with
each other we use a different protocol
to structure the data or information
that's been sent so FTP is for file
transfer and it stands for File Transfer
Protocol so the P always tons of a
protocol and hit TTP is used for
websites so when the structure of the
information that's being sent has been
decided on for example HTTP the
information is then sent down this
socket between the two computers via a
protocol called TCP okay
so although the data is structured in a
particular way and that's going to be
either HTTP or FTP or something like
that
the way that it's sent from the server
to the client is via a protocol called
TCP and what this essentially does is
split up the data into smaller little
sections like this and transfers them
along the socket and these small little
sections are called packets so all of
this functionality is built into our
computers and then nodejs gives us the
ability to access this functionality to
open a connection between two computers
and send information between them so if
we run nodejs on a server we can tell
node what information we want to send
out
means when they make a particular
response and that's what we're going to
be doing in the next tutorial we're
going to create a server and we're going
to respond to requests made by the
client or the browser if you like but
before we do that I want to just all
have one more thing first and that is
ports so when we send a request to a
server which nodejs is living on how do
we know that the request was meant for
nodejs itself and not some other program
which is also running on the server
instead like an email program for
example how do we know that we want
nodejs and not the email program or any
other program to deal with that request
and the answer is that no js' and other
programs running on the server or listen
to a particular port number so if a
request is sent to an IP address to a
particular port number on that IP if
nodejs is listing out for requests on
that port it will respond
otherwise it won't so that's how we
route our requests to no js' okay
and a typical port will look something
like this on the end of an IP address so
there's the IP address okay
and on that computer could live a
variety of different programs and then
nodejs might be listening to a
particular port 3000 so if we send
requests to this port 3000 then it's
going to be listening into that port and
it's going to send a response to us so
that's how it all worked and we're going
to be looking into this in the next
tutorial when we go ahead and create a
server and send some response to our
requests so any questions feel free to
leave those down below otherwise guys
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
