tutorial and in this video I want to
talk about data binding
okay so we've already seen how we can
output data from our view instance tooth
doll but what if you wanted to do
something slightly different just
imagine this example I'm going to create
another property on this view instance
and this is going to be called website
and it's going to be a link to a website
let's just go to HTTP and then the net
ninja doctor using it okay so say for
example we want to output this link
which is stored on this view instance in
a hate RIF attribute on a link right so
what can we do can we do this H ref
equals and then can we output the name
of the variable here for example website
well let's see what happens if we do
that two times I subscribe to the next
ninja right there I'm going to get rid
of this name as well we don't need that
anymore so if I save this now and check
this out the browser we have this link
right here but if I inspect this link
then we're going to see the hey tres is
just equal to website and that's not
going to go anywhere if we click that
right so it's not grabbed the dynamic
website property and put it inside here
well you might be saying well what if we
put it inside curly braces save it does
that work well no you can see the H ref
right here is still that and even if we
take off these quotations this is still
not going to work if we save that you
can see it's still not there so how the
heck did we do this well we use what's
known as data binding so if we want to
die a bind our data to any kind of
attribute like this H ref attribute what
we need to do is use a directive called
V - bind and the V stands for view and
then we say call to say what we're
buying into so this is known as a
directive and instruction that tells of
UGS to do something and in this case the
V bind directive is telling the UJS to
bind this attribute right here to some
dynamic data that we
have stored on our web view instance
right here okay and we don't need this
curly brace so we can take those off but
we are going to put this inside
quotations like so so now all we need to
do is output the name of the property we
want to bind to this attribute and the
name of that property is just website as
specified right here so this time new JS
v GF sorry is going to bind this
property right here to this 8 ref and we
can see now we have an href equal to the
nettinger
value K for this links and that has
worked so that's how we bind our data to
different properties ok and there is a
shorthand sirness it's just a colon so
we can say : and the property name and
then equal to whatever okay so that's
the work however I'm going to use the
title bind for the majority of this
series just to be explicit in what I do
it alright and it's not just the heat
ref attribute that we can bind to we can
bind to different attributes as well
so say for example we have an input
field right and I want to bind something
to the value of this input field because
remember if I say let's just say it was
text at all
and if I say value equals I don't know
Shawn
right then this is going to output in
the browser the value of Shawn right so
whatever the value is is output inside
that field that an input type so what if
I want to dynamically buying data to
that while we can do the same thing we
can say V - bind and instead of passing
through Shawn we're gonna pass through
the main property remember that name
property is right here okay so if we
save this now it's not going to output
name in here the output Shawn which is
stored in the main property likewise
this could be job growth so we're
binding our data to the different
attributes on a element right so I want
to show you one more thing before we
finish up in this tutorial and that is
another way to output a dynamic link
using a different directive instead of V
bind so if I come to our view instance
I'm just
store in here and another property and
this is going to be called website tag
right and this time I'm going to store
the whole string I'm going to store a
HTML string so the a link itself and the
hitch rack is going to equal two double
quotes because we don't want to escape
out of the single quotes and it could be
the same one as this so let's grab that
copy and paste it inside here and then
we'll close that off I will say ninja
website or something other than editors
website all right so if we close off
this a tag now save that and what we
want to do is output this link to the
screen well how do we do that because we
can't just do this we can't just come
under here and say website
types right because if we do that all
it's going to do is output this as a
string to the web to the browser right
what we want to do is output it is HTML
to the Dom so that this is a link how do
we do that well pretty simply all we
need to do is create for example a P tag
right and then we're going to use a
directive called V - HTML and then this
is going to be equal to whatever HTML we
want to render now our HTML is going to
be this thing right here which is stored
on this and variable so let's take that
verbal and put it in here
so the ujf now will say okay within this
P tag I know that you want to have this
HTML because we've used this VEC mile
directive right so it's going to place
it with inside here all of this HTML so
let's save it and make sure it works to
set the browser and now we get this link
and if we inspect it you can see it's
going to the right website so now it's
out put this HTML to the browser okay so
there we go that is how we bind data to
different attributes in the next
tutorial what I want to show you is how
to react to events like click events on
the doll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
