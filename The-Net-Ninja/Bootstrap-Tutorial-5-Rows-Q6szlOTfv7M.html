bootstrap 3 lesson 5 and in this video
we're going to talk about rose Wow
alright so we already saw in a previous
tutorial the bootstraps grid system is
split up into rows and columns just like
any other kind of grid okay
so we've used a row when we want to
create a new row of extreme elements on
the grid for example we could have a
strip of 3 elements that we want to
place in a row next to each other right
which is like the second row here so
we'd put those 3 elements within a row
and each one of those elements would be
inside a width in column values so
they've all got our width here for
columns and they're equally spaced apart
ok so that's how rows work now a row can
have up to 12 elements in it just like
this 1 2 3 4 blardy blar up to 12 and
each element is taking up one column in
width right or it can have as little as
one element in the row and it takes up
the full width which is twelve columns
in width now to use a row we have to
place it within the container in a fluid
or fixed and we covered containers in
the last tutorial so if you're not
checked that out gone I'm looking at
first we have to put it in a container
and then when we make a row we'll
obviously need to add columns inside the
row to divide the content horizontally
like this here okay so let's have a look
at an example alright then guys so I've
just got up a simple example right here
and you can see what I've got here is
first of all we'll start the top of the
body tag
this is just a div that I've made
opening to do with bootstrap and I've
just given a max width of 12 which it
picks off to keep everything within that
and margin of 0 Auto so it's central and
then just a little bit of padding around
the side now within that I've got the
bootstrap class container fluid which
means I want a fluid container right and
remember that's the the one that's kind
of fluid between great points it expands
to the full width of its parent element
so that's going to add a bit of viewport
or this thing here for viewports ladder
level or larger than 1200 pixels and so
within that container right there we've
got two rows we've got this one here and
this one here so they've both got the
class
roll now that is a bootstrap class and
we use that class whenever we want to
make a new row okay so two rows now in
the first row I've got two columns and
each one of those is a div now we don't
need to worry about this at the minute
all this junk this is all the column
kind of classes I'm going to talk about
those later all the way to know is that
these here are the different elements
and I'm assigning them column widths
basically okay so the columns within the
rows which is in the container so
secondly I've got another row here and
in that there's six elements right there
and I've given each one of those
elements some classes as well to give it
widths in terms of rows in terms of
columns sorry so key point container
surrounding the whole lot then we have
rolls okay so there's two rows of
elements so let's take a look at this in
a browser all right here we are on this
awesome website again and we've got the
top row here which has two elements and
the second row here which has six
elements right so this is it these are
just the rows and imagine the grid
overlaying this this would be eight
columns in width so there's eight
columns going down like that okay and
this one here would be four calms him
with and that adds up to twelve columns
so each row always adds four to twelve
columns in width right so same with
these each thumbnail is two columns in
width so 2 times 6 is 12 so that row is
added up to 12 as well so if we just
make this a little bit smaller okay now
you can see what I've done is move these
onto separate lines like that now that
is not a separate row these are still in
the same row in the HTML it's just that
for smaller screens bootstrap does all
the responsive work for you and when it
needs to okay it splits the the elements
on two different lines because what I've
said is each element right here on small
screens I want 12 columns wide and this
one is 12 columns wide as well so you
can't physically have them next to each
other okay in the same
wrote technically speaking but in hasty
mouth they are still in the same row all
right so that's what rows are all about
we use rows to make a new line of
content or HTML elements and then within
those rows we place elements which we
apply column widths to and we're going
to speak about columns a little bit more
in the next tutorial so I'll see you
guys then if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave those down
below don't forget to subscribe share
yada-yada and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
