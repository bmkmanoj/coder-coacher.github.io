yoga's what's going on and back once
again with the CSS video lesson 21 so
let's all get busy oh that was awesome
right anyway in this lesson we're going
to talk all about first and last ciao
pseudo classes that's coming right up
ah okay so hopefully my Rapids not put
you off and you're still watching if you
are thank you very much okay so first of
all I want a quick recap on the last
lesson and we said that in the last
lesson dynamic pseudo classes can be
used to target behavioral state of an
element now this might be the hover
state or the active state on a visited
state they're the three most common I
would say and this could be on any
element but primarily it's used for
links or buttons or anything that's a
bit more interactive on your web page so
in this lesson I want to talk more about
structural pseudo classes and how they
can help us target complex structural
elements that we wouldn't normally be
able to do with ordinary selectors so
I'm going to jump back into the goal the
code and see you guys there Wow alright
guys so here I am back in the HTML and
we're back on the articles page here and
I've changed it up just a little bit
I've got some lorem ipsum dummy text in
here we've got three paragraphs sorry
four paragraphs and in the final
paragraph we've got a little link tag
saying if you were read more click here
and it's the same for both articles okay
so what we're going to talk about in
this lesson is the first and last child
super classes now what does that mean
well we already know that children are
elements that are nested within parent
elements so let's take this article
check for an example and by the way this
article tag is a new html5 semantic
element and I'm going to do probably a
course in the future about html5 and
those kind of semantics so stay tuned
for that for now don't worry too much
about it just take this as the parent
element this is the one that's
containing all these P tags now the P
tags are children elements okay so we've
already learned that and these are the
kind of relationships we can build upon
using structural pseudo classes so say
we want the first child of this parent
now the first child would be the first
one that comes directly beneath that
parent so that would be this PTAC here
this the first chat the first child
second child third child and this would
be the last child or fourth child okay
and it's the same for both so we can
target the first child and the last
child directly without adding any
classes on so we don't have to get
anti-semantic or anything like that and
um yeah I'm going to show you how to do
that so the first thing we do like any
other pseudo classes first of all have
our normal selector and in this case
we're saying P we want to go out to the
P tax and at the minute this is
selecting all of the P tags on the page
okay and we can be more specific we can
say article P because we know about
descendant selectors this is a
descendant of article and now it's just
grabbed in the article selectors which
is still all the P tags on this
particular page anyway that would be our
normal selector than P tax so how do we
add these first or last child
pseudo-classes off well like all pseudo
classes we have the colon to say that
there's a pseudo class criminal and then
we put the keyword now pretty
self-explanatory all it is is first -
child that there my friends is going
after this first child here because it's
the first child of this parent element
so now we can start this one on its own
without hitting any of these and I want
the first paragraph to kind of catch
your I want it to be bold so we're going
to say font-weight:bold okay and that's
all there is to it we've got our pseudo
selector here our pseudo we're a
structural pseudo collector a first
child and it's getting the first child
and styling it bold
alright so likewise we can do a less
child pseudo class and we do it the same
way we'll say article Pig last child and
then do our Declaration and this one
here is a sentence telling us to click
here for more information and I want
this to stand out as well this time I'm
going to color it red this might look
pants my friends but I don't care I just
want to use this as an example so I'm
going to save that off now and I'm going
to open it up in a browser
Google Chrome all right there we go you
see we've got these P tags here this is
an article and this is an article and
the first one first child is bold and
the last child is red with exception to
that link because don't forget we've got
default browser styles or providing that
inherited style of read so the browser
is calling coloring this blue and it's
the same here first child bold less
child red so cool
that's how to use first and last child
pseudo elements if you have any
questions about these whatsoever feel
free to leave a comment below I'll get
back to you as soon as it come with all
of those and if you like these videos
please like subscribe comment share
whatever and I'll see you guys in the
next one where we're going to look at
some more structural pseudo classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
