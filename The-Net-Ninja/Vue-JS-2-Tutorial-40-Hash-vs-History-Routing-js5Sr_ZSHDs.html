40th of UGS tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about routing modes
okay there so in the last tutorial we
set up this new view router instance we
registered our routes and then we pass
those in to our view instance ok so we
can use URLs such as this hash /add for
this blog post form or just hash it
forward slash for the home page or blog
listing okay now this is really nice
but this hash thing right there it
doesn't look very clean so ideally what
we'd like is just /add for adding a new
blog post and then just forward slash
for this page right here now to do that
we're going to have to use the history
mode for viewer routing but before I go
any further I just want to explain a
little bit about how this works and when
we're making requests so if we go to a
website and then we go to forward slash
and say something like hole that is
making a request to a server if we go to
forward slash when it's old that is
making a request to a server it would go
to forward slash whatever that is making
a request to a server and then a server
is going to look at that request and
decide what to do with it a return the
appropriate resource like a page called
whatever or hole okay so the reason that
view uses this hash in front of the
request or the URL rather when we say
add is because this right here this does
not make an additional request to the
server okay you may have seen on
websites when you click on a button and
it drags you further down to the bottom
of the page or vice versa what they're
doing is they're targeting an ID on the
page so something like ID and that's
what the URL becomes when you click on
it okay so when you click on that a tag
it's not making a request to the server
it's just taking me to a different part
of the page and that's how she's worked
we don't make requests to the server
therefore when the UGS runs in the
browser these routes it's using these
hashes so it doesn't have to keep making
requests to the server but that's right
does it now if we want to get rid of
this
then what you need to do is set up your
server so that no matter what you put
after this no matter what page or
resource it always returns the
index.html file and that is this file
right here okay so this index dot HTML
file is where we have this div with an
ID of up and this ID right here is being
controlled by view j/s in the main dot
yes we say the element is this app right
so everything that we've done so far all
these different components are all
running on this index dot HTML page and
there's UVs in this hash HTTP version is
controlling the different components
that again output to this index page
right it's controlling all this routing
in the front end so if you want to use
history routing so we don't have that
hash you need to set up your server so
that it always returns this index file
no matter what you put in after v-fold
slash that way when it gets the index
file view j/s can run in the browser and
say ok I'm going to take care of the
routing from this point so whatever is
placed after the forward slash I can
deal with that ok now I can't show you
how to set up your server to do that it
depends on your server etc but if you go
to the view router documentation there's
a good guide on how you can get started
with that right here so I'm going to
leave this link down below and you can
check it out but fortunately for us our
development server that we're using
review J's here automatically does that
it's going to return the index page to
us every time so we can use the history
mode here locally and all we need to do
to do that is go to the main dot J's
file and then in this router instance we
created underneath these routes property
we add in a mode property and currently
by default it's set to hush that is the
default behavior if we want to use
history we do this history save it and
that's all there is to it so you sort
out your server and you change this mode
history now if we try this out if we go
to /ad then this is going to work
/my it's old this works now if we've got
two /add what happens is we're actually
getting the index file back to us
great away from the development server
and then view Jerry's taking over it's
looking at this URL saying okay this odd
path matches up to where I want to take
it this component that's what's
happening okay so you're going to see
the in bit file it loads in and then we
get the add component okay cool so there
we go that is the difference between the
two
routing versions hash and history</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
