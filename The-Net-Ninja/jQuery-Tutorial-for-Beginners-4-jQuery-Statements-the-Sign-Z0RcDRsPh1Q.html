jQuery for beginners lesson 4 and in
this video we're gonna explore jQuery
statements and what the dollar sign
means Wow okay then gang so pretty much
every jQuery statement starts with a
dollar sign or the jQuery keyword that
interchangeable doesn't really matter
which one we use I'm lazy so I use the
dollar sign if you want to use jQuery
that's fine so for example in vanilla
JavaScript if we wanted to grab a
specific ID if from the Dom we'd use
something like this document get element
by ID and then within brackets the ID
name now to do exactly the same thing in
jQuery we'd start the statement with a
dollar sign that says hey guys we're
using jQuery then we use the CSS
selector name to grab that element
within brackets now don't worry about
this bit for now we're going to cover
that later in other tutorials I just
want to focus on this here and what it
means for now now these two do the same
thing but there is one subtle but very
important difference and we're going to
explore that in the code ok then guys so
I know I downloaded all my code to work
with for this tutorial series but for
this one lesson I want to just work in
the console so I've come to the net
ninjanomicon at UK and I'm going to show
you that sort of difference between
using a jQuery statement and vanilla
JavaScript so if I wanted to grab this
element right here in normal JavaScript
I would say something like document dot
get element by ID and then pass through
the ID name which is page - title and
that's going to return to me to that
object that HTML object right now in
jQuery I'd do something like this I'd
use the dollar sign to say hey I'm using
jQuery then I pass in the CSS selector
that I want to get which is hash page
title and it's a hash because it's a an
ID return and then that's going to
return to me the same element right
there but this time it's in an array you
can see that because of the square
brackets now this looks like a normal
array however it's a jQuery object and
the jQuery object is based on the array
type so it has all the properties of an
array but it returns it looking like
it's just and all
right okay so what this means is that no
matter what we asked for in the DOM
using jQuery or what we do within the
jQuery statement will always return back
a jQuery object that represents that
element and this guy's is because jQuery
objects have many many methods and
properties attached to it that we can
use such as the animation ones of CSS
and that's what makes jQuery so easy to
do things
so essentially you can see jQuery MIT a
bit like a sweet wrapper all right so in
this example the sweet would be an
element for example this h2 right here
or multiple elements if you wouldn't
have to say all the h2s on the page okay
that would be the sweet on the sweet now
when we grab something using jQuery
right to grab these elements it wraps
them up in a wrapper and it returns to
us the full jQuery object which has
access to all the jQuery methods and
properties right but at any point we can
unwrap that sweet or element and return
to ourselves the normal HTML burn like
this here without the wrapper or in
essence a vanilla JavaScript object all
right so while an element is wrapped up
in a jQuery wrapper like this while if
you turn tools like this it has access
to all the jQuery methods and properties
but when we unwrap it and get this again
then you just have access to those
vanilla JavaScript methods and
properties right so I'm going to give
you an example then I'm going to store
this in a variable right I'm gonna save
our heading equals then we're using
jQuery so we use that dollar sign and
then it's hash page titled so now we've
got that variable right so now we can
say heading dot CSS and we'll give it a
position of relative you have to worry
what all this means at the minute I'm
just giving you an example this right
here is a jQuery method so we're
changing the CSS using jQuery right in
essence we're just saying this here is
that so we're just saying page title dot
CSS position:relative yeah
so we can do that and now it gives you
that style right there and now I'm gonna
do is use the animate method and this
time I'm gonna pass in left 100 that's
going to scoot it to the left to the
right rather 100 pixels because we're
saying we want it 100 pixels from the
left so let's have a look at that now
you can see animated right over here
over this way 100 pixels now that is the
element when it's wrapped up in a jQuery
wrapper and you can see each time we're
performing these methods it's still
returning to us that object in the
jQuery wrapper because these are all
jQuery statements right and you may say
well these don't start with a dollar
sign but they do because this heading is
just that so each of these is starting
with this yeah okay so now let's unwrap
it
so how do we unwrap it well it's like an
array remember so say we've just got one
element in here this is the zero of
position but if we have three elements
in we have the zeros first and second
position right so we can just say
heading zero we're using array notation
to grab that object right there and that
element and if we press that this time
it returns it to us unwrapped now if
there were multiple elements we just use
the index that we want to grab whichever
sweet or element we want to unwrap and
now heading 0 if we do that heading 0
this doesn't have access to things like
anime because we've unwrapped the the
the object of the element so if I try to
animate something to the left and other
20 pixels this isn't gonna work
right this time we get animation which
is just an object it's not gonna mean
anything to you that so when it's
wrapped up we can use those methods when
it's not we can't use those methods
alright so that is what jQuery
statements are all about they start with
a dollar sign or a jQuery keyword once
we've used that it wraps the elements up
in a wrapper therefore we have access to
all the jQuery library methods and
properties but we can also
all right those elements whenever we
want and just gain back our initial
JavaScript object where we just have the
inbuilt JavaScript methods and objects
to and properties to use on it okay
