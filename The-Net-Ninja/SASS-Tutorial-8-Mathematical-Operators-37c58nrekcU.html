your eighth SAS tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna talk you through the
different math operators we have
available to us incest Wow okay then
dude so incest we have available to us
the addition subtraction multiplication
and division mathematical operators I'm
going to talk you through these and do a
couple of really simple examples in this
tutorial then look at do something more
complex in the next tutorial
so right now you can see here these Li
tags in the navigation I've given them a
width of 14% but instead of just saying
and what needs to be 14% I could pass
through here a mathematical equation if
you like to work out the width so I'm
going to do that in some brackets and
inside the brackets I'm going to do a
simple equation I'm just gonna say 40
pixels times that's the Asterix 2 and
this is gonna equate to 80 pixels so now
if I save this then each one of these
are going to be 80 pixels in width now
don't ask me why the hell I'd want to
pass a width through like this this is
completely random I want to do this I'm
just demonstrating that we can use these
different mathematical operators so if
we change that to division and save then
each one of these is now going to become
20 pixels in width if we change it to a
plus and then make this 20 just so the
effect is a little more notice for them
save it
these are going to become 60 pixels in
width and if I change this to a minus
these are all going to become 20 pixels
in width all right so let's do something
a little more worthwhile because that is
absolutely pointless I'm going to save
that 14 percent again now currently this
is how it looks but what if I want these
links to take up the full room of the
navigation all right
the full 100% and I want that room to be
shared equally to each different element
so what I could do is work out how many
elements that are in the navigation and
then work out what percentage I'm going
to need for them to be equal in length
and take up the full amount of space but
instead of me working that out I could
lets us work that so I could do a simple
formula and say 100%
/ however many elements are in this
navigation now there's six in here so it
can just say divided by six it's gonna
work that out for me and it's gonna
space those equally in the navigation so
that's a little more cooler all right so
let's do something similar with these
things down here
I want to style those up so I'll come
down here just under in fact I'll come
under these things right here okay and
then I'm going to add some styles for
these bad boys so if we take a quick
look in the HTML we know that this
section right here has an ID of services
yeah so we want to grab that first of
all so let's go into the CSS and we'll
say services like so and we're going to
nest some styles in here now each one of
these is an li tag so we'll grab those
first of all we're going to nest that in
the services
and we want to flow each one of these to
the left and we want to give it a box
sizing of border-box
and that's just going to take into
consideration the padding when it works
out the width of these elements okay
it's not going to add extra on for the
padding or anything lined up next I want
to say text align to be Center okay
now then down here I'm gonna target the
image tags these things and I'm gonna
say image width is gonna be 60% and
margin is going to be 20 pixels top and
bottom then 20% left and right because
then 24 the left 24 the right that's 40
plus 16 so that's a full 100% yeah okay
cool
now let's target these anchor tags so
again we'll just nest an 8 in there and
then we'll say text decoration is gonna
be not I'm going to give them a color of
the deep blue variable but we declared
right here now variables this thing okay
and then what I'll say is font weight
it's gonna be bold and then I'm gonna
give it a pseudo class I'll say and
hover used in the upper some that we
talked about and I'm gonna give this a
color
of red for now okay then we'll save that
in fact I want to do one more thing and
that is grab the UL like that and I'll
say and ampersand after in fact I won't
do that what I'll do is just say
@include and we made a mix in if I open
up this mixing in one of the previous
tutorials to clear the floats so we'll
just include that thing right there so
let's go here again I will say it
included clear fix like so okay then
what I'm going to do as well is come
under here in fact we'll do this at the
top and give you some margin at the
bottom of about sixty pixels all right
so let's save this and see what it looks
like at the minute that's what it looks
like currently now there's more of a gap
on the right than there is on the left
so what needs to be spaced out equal it
again so the way we're going to do this
is by applying a width property to the
Li tags much like we did with these
things up here and again I'm going to
make SAS do the calculation for me just
in case I change the amount of elements
I out here I can just do a simple
calculation instead of working out all
the percentages myself so I'm going to
say width again in parentheses then 100%
and this time there's just three
elements so I'm going to divide it by
three and save it and there we go they
have spaced out much more equally now
okay so that is how we can use
mathematical operators in SAS and all
these are two really simple examples so
far but I wanted to introduce you to
them now so that we're ready for the
next tutorial where we're going to
create a grid using mathematical
operations which is a bit more complex
so you have any questions so far feel
free to I suppose down below otherwise
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
