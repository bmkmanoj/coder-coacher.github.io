PSD to WordPress lesson 22 and in this
video we're gonna go through these
single dot PHP template file alright
guys so in WordPress there's essentially
two types of content to begin with
you've got the single post content and
the page content right now the static
page content is what we concentrated on
in the last tutorial where we developed
this page PHP template file so that was
for things like your about page alright
or you contact us page or whatever you
want to call them now the other type of
content is the single post page for
things like blogs on news items right
things that come with time so you might
post a new one every couple of days or
something and for that we have a
different template file now if we look
down here we've got the single post page
and we're doing blog posts but have not
created any of these yet so we want to
stab this thing right here blog post and
you're gonna see that the first file
WordPress is going to look for to
display that page is the single - post
dot PHP template now we don't have this
in our theme directory but we could
create it if we wanted to I'm not going
to do that because we can just use this
single dot PHP template file to display
those posts so that is what we're going
to do we're going to concentrate on this
single dot PHP template file now in the
admin area of WordPress the posts are in
the post section if you go to all posts
it's going to list all of the posts it
comes with this hello world post already
written for you so we can take a look at
that and view it in the browser and it
currently looks something like this so
you've got your post content and then
the comments down here as well so we
need to style this up a little bit so
let's have a look at this single dot PHP
file which we've got opening right here
same as the others it's got this get
header and it's got these two tags here
the div and the main then we've got the
loop going over right here to get all
the posts content and display it by
calling this content template part which
is again in here for the posts content
single so which all this stuff right
here okay
and if we go back to the single dot PHP
after that
got the post navigation which is all the
things like the tags or the category so
it's gonna list all those kind of things
and then after that it's going to
display the comments if we have any and
then it's gonna have the sidebar and
footer at the bottom now I want to do a
few things on this first thing I want to
do is get all this within the single not
the single the wrapper div so let's
create that wrapper div class equals
Rutter and this is going to bring all of
that content within that central column
remember get rid of that and put it at
the end over here
we just need to scoot this stuff in do
it again and bring that back out cool so
now all the content is within the middle
but if we have a look at this again and
refresh it we've got saved it let's save
that okay let's refresh now cool so it's
all within the central column now but I
don't want this down here what they
spoke at the top over here so to do that
what I'm gonna do is create a couple of
divs the first thing I'm gonna do is
create a div surrounded all of this
content stuff right here so div called
post content all right so that's the ID
and then I put the closing div right
about here like that after that we're
gonna put the sidebar I don't want to
contain this within a div as well so
I'll say div id equals sidebar for this
one then within that I'm going to drop
this function so that all of the sidebar
code is dumped within this div all right
so let's take a look at that again
nothing will have changed but now we're
gonna use those IDs to style this stuff
up a little bit alright so let's
right-click and inspect the elements and
what we'll do is just open up the
stylesheet and go to the bottom okay
cool
and the first thing I want to do is grab
all of this post content right here
I'll say post content and I'm gonna
float it to the left and I'm gonna give
it a width of about 70 percent I think
like that now you'll notice over here
it's going right up to the top can you
see right up against that resto local I
don't want that so I need to clear
preview floats by saying click both and
it's gonna scoot down below that okay
cool so the next thing I want to do is
Starla sidebar and I'm gonna float this
to the right give it a weight of about
26 percent not 30% because I want to use
the remaining percent for padding or
margin in fact I'll give it a padding of
1% and then it's still going to leave
that 2 percent gap right here okay and
then we'll give it a background of EEE
this is a like array and we'll give it a
margin top off so that's funny pixels
just to bring it down a little bit like
that and that looks okay to me let's
have a look at that page now okay so
that's fine
maybe we can style up this comment stuff
a little bit so let's just right-click
over it and inspect what's going on okay
so we've got the comment meta stuff
right here so let's grab that and I want
to give this a light gray background so
with a couple pier where I did the entry
footer stuff I'm just gonna make a
comment and put the new class in as well
so it's going to get the same styles
same here
comment metopes comment letter a that
will do and then this stuff right here
will just edit a little bit let's have a
look a comment metadata let's have a
look what's going on a comment list
yeah well get rid of that so if we copy
this class over here come to the bottom
what I'll do is say list style type
not that get rid of that little number
there because I didn't want with a
little one next to it and then we'll
give it zero planning just to move it
back over to the left like that and I
think that will do guys I mean I don't
want to go too deep into this we could
stand it however we wanted to that's
what no that's not what this course is
about we're all about just making this
theme and then you can go off a stand as
you wish all right so now we've got the
content at the top sidebar on the right
and then we've got all this stuff down
here the comments all right so that's
okay for a post page again if you have
any questions about this whatsoever feel
free to drop a comment down below in the
next video what we're going to do is go
on and style now the archive page so if
I click something like this then
currently it looks like this we're going
to style this up in the next tutorial so
I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
