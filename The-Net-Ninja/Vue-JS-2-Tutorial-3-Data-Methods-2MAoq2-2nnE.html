third view jst tutorial and in this
video I want to talk a little bit more
about data and methods including so in
the last tutorial we created this data
name called Shawn and we output it right
here and we can see that in the browser
and we can output as much data as we
want inside this div right here but this
story's much everyone here so for
example I'm going to create another data
property called job and naturally this
is living in India so what if I want to
output this as well well I can do that
I'm just going to come down here and
click a key tag and I'm going to say job
is job right so we can output multiple
pieces of data with inside this div
right here and in fact I'm just going to
change this to AP tag so they both look
the same and I'm going to say Nate okay
so without putting both of these two
here and that's absolutely fine now I
also mentioned we could add methods on
to this instance so we're going to
create a method now and a method is just
a function so this is an object as well
and it inside this object like with data
we can store as many different methods
as we want so first of all let's give
our method a name we'll call it greed
and what this is going to do is output a
greeting to the Dom so this method is a
function right and when we output
something to the Dom it's going to
return something that can be output to
the Dom so not an object a string okay
we're going to return a string so let's
return good - okay so if we save that
now and then we want to output the
results of that function to the Dom all
we need to do is call that function from
within side this view active and the way
we do that is by just saying whatever h1
then clearly braces it again and then
the name of the function which is great
and then curly braces because this is
how we call functions right in
JavaScript so then that is going to call
this function on this instance it's
going to return to us this string which
will then be output here inside the h1
and if we see in the browser we can see
that cool now we're
also pass through parameters inside
these functions so say I want to pass
through the time of day right say I want
to say good afternoon instead of good
morning well I can pass that through as
a parameter right there and it's in
quotations because this is a string
right this afternoon then I can output
this right here I can say we're going to
take a parameter I want to call this
parameter time we can college whatever
we want but it makes sense to call it
time because it's the time of day right
so instead of saying good morning
I want to say good and then whatever
time of days so we can tack on the time
right here that we pass through to this
footing so if we save this now we see
good afternoon and we can change this if
we like to good night and this time it
should hopefully say good night cool so
that's how we pass three parameters
these don't have to be strings either it
can be numbers if we're doing some kind
of calculation in here okay
it can be whatever you want so within
these functions we can also access the
data with inside this view instance now
how would you think we do that well the
this keyword refers to this view
instance right now you will think to
access the main property we would have
to say this dot data first of all
because it's within the data project
then dot name but we don't have to do
that the user s takes all of these
different properties we have in the data
object and it proxies them to the top
right up here of the view instance so we
can just say this dot name and that's
going to give us the name that we store
inside here all this job and that's
going to give us the job so that's
pretty cool right we can access all this
data with inside this function so let's
say we want to also tack on the name
right here of the person onto this
return state so let's tack on this name
so it's going to say good and then
whatever time of day we pass through as
a parameter and then the name which is
Shawn so let's save this checking out
the browser and now we get good night
Shawn but there's no space between here
so let's just add on
space and then this donate this time and
get a space okay cool
so that's how we create methods and how
we can use them in our template all
right now I want to show you one more
thing before we stop this video and that
is what happens if we try to access any
of these functions or data outside of
this div now remember we said right here
this L property is this view up div this
is what this instance is going to
control so anything with inside here now
it doesn't control anything outside here
so if we try to output say the name here
then view GS you're not going to know
what to do with that and we're just
going to see this kind of template
syntax outputs in a Dom right so we
can't access all of this data and all of
these methods outside of this cliff
right here because it only controls this
div all right so I just wanted to show
you what happens if we try and do that
just be careful because that's a gotcha
for when you first start using vue.js so
anyway there we go that is data a
message in a nutshell we are going to be
using them much much more as we go along
through this tutorial so don't feel like
this is the end of that you're going to
dive much deeper into them but in the
next tutorial now I want to move on to
events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
