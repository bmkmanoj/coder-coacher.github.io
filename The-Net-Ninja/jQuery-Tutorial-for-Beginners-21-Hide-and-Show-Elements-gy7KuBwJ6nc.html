jQuery for beginners lesson 21 and in
this video we're gonna go through the
show/hide and toggle functions Wow all
right in class so in the last lesson
you'll remember I showed you these three
methods right here fade in fade out and
fade too now we will show you three more
in this tutorial hide show and toggle
now they're quite similar well first two
are anyway but they differ in some ways
which I'll show you in a second so let's
delete this aim do a little example so
I've still got this event wired up by
the way attached to the HT to this click
event so when we click this we're gonna
do some magic right here and the magic
is gonna be these events are these
functions rather I've just shown you so
let's grab this again wrap it in the
jQuery wrapper and then we'll use the
hide method first of all now if I save
this without any parameters
watch what happens I'm gonna click this
here and poof it just goes off the
screen completely now this is kind of
the equivalent of changing the CSS to
display:none
it's not really animating at all right
but I can pass through a value here
which is gonna say how long that
animation is going to take so I could
pass through 1000 which is 1000
milliseconds or just one second and then
it's going to animate that hide over
that period of time yeah so if I click
now you'll see it zooms out to the left
it shrinks in width and height and it
fades out okay so where is the fade out
just fades out and it doesn't move or
shrink this does all three it shrinks it
moves and it fades out all right so that
is the difference now as well as hide we
have shock so let's just attach that
using chaining again if you've not seen
chaining go back and check out that
tutorial I'll leave a link to that down
below so what we're going to do here
guys is first of all hide it over one
second then when it's hidden completely
we're going to show it that is the
opposite function to hide all right so
let's save this and give this a twirl
we're going to click here it seems out
then zooms back in and fades in all
right pretty cool so what was the other
function I wanted to show you it was
toggle so let's delete those
and replaced a weak toggle now do not
refuse do not confuse this rather with
toggle clasp toggle clasp changes the
clasp of an element this fade in or fade
out depending on its current state so if
it's currently in then it's gonna fade
it out and also zoom it and shrink it
out if it's currently not showing its
gonna show it and it's going to do that
by expanding fading it in and zooming it
in from the left alright so it does that
show and hide functionality depending on
which state it's coming in so I'm gonna
pass through 1000 here again because
that's gonna be the speed all the time
rather which is going to do that
animation over I'm going to click this
so it's correctly show it so it should
fade out yeah and it does cool now
obviously I can't click it again because
it's zoomed out so we can't see this
toggle in action we can't see it fade
back in but what I can do is attach this
event to something else and I'm going to
attach it to this map so you can see
right here it's an image with an altered
map so we can use that to grab it using
jQuery its image and then we use our
attribute selector with the square
brackets and the alt is equal to map so
that's going to grab that right there
and attach this click event to that now
we need to change this as well because
if we click the map then it's going to
refer to the map right it's not going to
refer to the hate to anymore so what we
need to do is put back in here section
h2 and we're using this because it's a
direct descendant of the section right
so now when we click that map it's going
to toggle this h2 meaning it's going to
show or hide depending on its current
state so let's save that and give this a
Chinese World I'm going to click here
I'm sorry not there because we move the
event I'm going to click the map and
it's gonna zoom and fade out if a cliff
again it's gonna come back in and we can
keep on going all day long if we wanted
to because this is so much fun alright
so that is the toggle method guys if you
have any questions about any of these
three methods whatsoever feel free to
drop a comment down below otherwise guys
I'm gonna see you in a very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
