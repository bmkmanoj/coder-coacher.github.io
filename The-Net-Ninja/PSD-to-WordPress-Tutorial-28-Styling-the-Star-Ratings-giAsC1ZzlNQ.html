PSD is a wordpress lesson 28 and in this
video we're gonna style up the star
ratings on the home page Wow okay then
going so in the last tutorial what we
did was make this custom loop right here
where we're going into the menu items
category and we're getting these posts
and displaying them on the front page
and from each post in that category
we're going to display the thumbnail the
link and the title right here the first
custom field which was the price right
here and then under that we've got
another span with a dynamic class which
is being driven by that second custom
field the rating so each one of these is
going to have a class of rating that's
going to be the same for each one and
it's also going to have a dynamic class
of star - whatever the rating is so
that's one two three four or five okay
so what we're going to do is style up
this spam tag in this lesson so that
these stars show underneath we're going
to use a background image to do that and
the image we're going to use is in our
images folders from the PSD this star
thing right here okay very small there
so I'll open this up I'll show an
explorer and you can see here if i zoom
in it's this thing right here this start
we're going to use as the background all
right so let's jump into our style dot
CSS and the first thing I want to do is
style up the rating class because that's
global to each one of these things right
here okay so what I'll do is make that
rule right at the bottom and then within
that rule the first thing I want to do
is give it a height of 12 pixels because
that's how high the start picture is
okay so they're all going to have a
height of 12 pixels
next thing I want to do is give it a
background and that's going to be a URL
it's gonna be in the loops URL it's
gonna be in the images folder forward
slash star dot PNG like that it's going
to automatically repeat so we don't need
to set that property and then we're
going to set the float to
none and that's going to be important to
override another rule which may have
floated it in the past then what I want
to do is display as blocked because
currently a spawn sack is being
displayed as in line so we'll override
that now save it and refresh over here
and you can see all of these things
showing all of these stars now currently
they're behind this text we don't want
that we wanted to come down here and
that's because these things are floated
right here the text and the price so we
need to clear those floats so we'll put
clear:both and then we'll save that and
refresh and now they go underneath which
is a lot better so all we need to do now
is control the width of these ratings so
for example if it's got a one star
rating then the weight will just be this
12 pixels and that's just gonna show one
star if it's got a 2 star rating then
the width could be 24 pixels and that's
going to show two stars and hide all
these here and so forth depending on
what the star rating is okay so that's
how we're going to control which stars
are shown now to do that we're going to
have to use the dynamic classes so
remember if we go back to the front page
the class is star - then whatever the
rating is so start out in one style - -
star - three have it four or five and
five so let's jump back here and make
those styles let's give ourselves a
little bit of room like that and the
first one we're gonna do is top rating
dot star five and you don't have to use
this bit right here I am just making it
a little bit more specific in case we
choose to use these classes elsewhere in
fact you know what we'll get rid of that
because we're not going to use elsewhere
we'll just do star five and what we'll
do is give this a width of 12 times 5
because they're all 12 pixels in width
so that's 60 pixels like that we'll save
that if we've got any star fives on here
yeah there we go now 5 stars 1 2 3 4 5
stars are showing on that one so we'll
do the same for each
different rating so the five in total
four and then this is going to be 48
pixels in width then three and this is
going to be 36 pixels in width then two
and this is going to be 24 pixels in
width and then one which is going to be
just the 12 pixels in width save that
and refresh and this should do the trick
guys you get voila cool so now we've got
the star ratings underneath controlled
dynamically pulled out of those posts
and then style to suit like that okay
pretty cool so that's it for the blog
post down here we've got everything
sorted so we can move on now to be
honest the website is looking pretty
good in good Nick as it is so let's just
have a look through them we've got all
these different pages and the news which
is latest blogs and stuff if we click on
one of those it's looking all right
maybe in the next lesson what I'm going
to do is just go through this sidebar
right here and talk about widgets so
until then if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to drop a comment
down below otherwise guys don't forget
