second Olaf tutorial and in this video
I'm gonna give you a deeper look into
the OAuth flow alright so in the last
video we had a quick look at how this
whole Olaf process is working and this
was a really simplified look but it went
something like this a user lands on our
awesome website and they want to sign in
with some kind of social provider like
Google or Facebook so for example they
want to sign in with Google they click
on this big red sign in with Google+
button we then redirect them to the
Google service where they're going to
find this consent screen right here and
right now this consent screen is saying
to the user look the website that you
just came from they want to access your
profile information with Google do you
want to allow them to access this
information so they can use it on their
website and sign you in if they click
allow then we're going to redirect them
back to our website where we now have
access to their Google profile
information so we can take that
information now and we can store it in
our own database to make our own record
for that user and the reason we might
want to do that is so that we can expand
on the data we have on that user for
example on our website each user might
have a points associated with that user
so we can add them to our database it's
nothing to do with Google just our user
all right so we're grabbing that
information and we're storing it in our
own database so that that user can then
log in and use our website so this is a
really simplified version of what's
going on I want to dive in a little bit
deeper now to take a look at what's
going on behind the scenes a little so
same again first of all a user is going
to start off in the browser and it's
going to sign-in with Google for example
now before we redirect them straight
away to the Google or consent screen
what we're going to do is redirect them
to another page or another route on our
application right and we can call this
route whatever we want I've called it
forward slash auth forward slash provide
it and provide it it's just a
placeholder for whatever service they
want to sign in with for example
Facebook or Google so in this case it's
going to be forward slash forward slash
goal and we're gonna handle that route
on our application so this big
right here this represents our node
application and we're gonna handle this
route forward slash forward slash goggle
when they click on this button and we're
going to say to ourselves at this point
okay so this user wants to log in with
their Google profile therefore I'm going
to redirect you to the permission screen
for Google which remember looks
something like this
so they're there now and they're going
to grant us permission to use their
profile as soon as they do that we
redirect them to a custom route and
again we can make up this route we
decide what it's called I've called it
off forward slash provider again this
will be Google in this case /cb for call
back because this is a car back route so
they redirected to this route and we now
have access to their profile information
now at this point what we want to do is
work out whether this user has been to
us before or not if they have been to us
before we might have some details about
that user in our own database right if
they have not been to us before we won't
have you details about that user in our
own database so we're getting
information from their Google profile
and what we're going to do is look up
that information in our own database if
we find the user that matches that
information we're going to retrieve that
user from our database and any extra
information we might be holding on them
if that user does not exist in our
database we're going to create a new
record for them in it all right
but either way at this step right here
what we're going to do is we're gonna
have our old version of that user record
right so once we have that record we
need a way to tell the browser look we
know who this person is they're logged
in to our application and any subsequent
thing a request that they make for
example to their profile page which
requires them to be authenticated
we want to show them their profile we
want to authenticate them simply without
going through this whole process again
so the way we're going to do this is by
at this point when we have our user our
own version of the user we're going to
create a unique cooking and we're going
to send that cookie to the browser and
this browser is going to store that
cookie so that any other requests it
makes for example to see the profile
page then it's going to send this cookie
back with the request we can retrieve
this cookie and decode it and say hey
I know who this is this is ex user or Y
user so I'm going to show you your
profile page your authenticated right so
we're going to create these cookies to
create a session so that a user can
easily authenticate on different pages
of our application for example a profile
page right so this is kind of the whole
process and again this is slightly
simplified but it goes into the whole
process a little more deeper if you like
but at certain points especially over
here and down here there are going to be
extra things we need to do and we're
going to go into those when the time is
right now I said we're going to be using
passport to kind of help us with this
whole authentication flow and we don't
just say hey we want to use passport in
this node application take care of
everything for us doesn't work like that
at all unfortunately but what we are
going to do is use it at various
different points in this whole process
so I've highlighted these different
stages in yellow right here so at first
when we're interacting with Google we're
going to use it then when we retrieve
information back from Google we're also
going to use passport it's going to help
us do that then when we serializing and
deserializing users later on when we're
using these different cookies we're
going to use passport again there so
these are the different stages we're
going to use it now some people don't
like passport because they don't feel
they know where to use it and the whole
flow is a bit mishmash so that's the
reason I've created this diagram right
here and showing you where we're using
passport and so that everything's kind
of logical in your head when we come to
code it and I think I'll saw different
tutorials
they don't write into the code and they
start using passport but you then you're
like well I don't really know what
you're doing here at the different
stages they're all kind of mixing
together so we're going to be referring
back to this diagram time and time again
to show you at what stage we're up to
and where we're using passport along to
whole or worth flow okay so I don't
expect you to remember this whole thing
now but I would expect now that you do
have so tired of basic understanding of
how we're gonna structure this and how
we're going to work in right and the
whole process if you like but like I
said we will be coming back to it so
don't worry if you don't fully
understand it just yet but
now we've got this out of the way in the
next video I want to dive right in and
start to create our Express application
in nodejs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
