WordPress lesson and in this video I
want to give you a quick overview of the
WordPress admin area why are they guys
so basically this is gonna be a
whirlwind tour of the admin area so if
you've used WordPress before and you
know your way around you might want to
skip ahead because otherwise it's gonna
be pretty boring may not learn anything
new however if you've not used WordPress
before or you've only just used it a
little bit and you're getting into it
then you might want to stick around
because I'm going to show you how to add
new posts or any posts pages change the
theme that kind of thing alright but it
is just gonna be a whirlwind top you
know whiz through these fairly quickly
so this is the dashboard guys this is
what WordPress throws up at you every
time you log in and it's just got the
basics here you can see how many posts
or pages or comments you've got on your
side the recent activity you can make a
quick draft that kind of thing and you
can even move these around how cool is
that okay so typically if I want to add
a new post I'll come to posts and that's
what we're gonna look at first all right
so this here is gonna list all your
posts and to begin with there is one
there and this comes along with
WordPress when we do a fresh install
called hello world now the Edit link
takes you to the edit screen quick edit
just lets us edit a few different things
but there's no need to load a new screen
so that's why it's called quick edit the
trash link takes it to the trash to a
trash can and the view if we open this
up in a new browser to view that here
let's just see it in the website how it
looks alright cool so if we click on it
we go through to the edit screen and we
can edit the title we can edit the URL
right here we can edit the content of
the post and this right here is the
WordPress WYSIWYG what you see is what
you get and we've got things like bold
italic and all these different tools
here but if you want to enter HTML into
this portion then you just click text
and you can do it right here also we've
got these categories things here so if
you want to apply a category to your
post or put your post in a particular
category we can do that currently
there's only one category that comes
ship with WordPress that's on
categorized but we can add new ones here
if we wanted to and apply it to those
categories you can do the same with tags
we just write them here separate them
with
and click Add and the featured image we
can apply an image to this post which
we're going to use later on so I'm going
to talk about categories and featured
image a little bit later on and we are
going to make some new posts as well for
now let's have a look at this categories
link this is where we can add new
categories as well as in adding a new
post we can add them right here so the
slug is just the URL basically the name
of the category the parent you can
assign it a parent category give it a
description then all your categories are
going to be listed here when you've
saved them same for tags pretty similar
now the media section is where we would
upload images to use in our blog posts
alright our pages
that's pretty similarly just click
simple you just click on this add new
button render the pages is similar to
the post link however a post is used for
more blog post can things on news items
or other things that are time irrelevant
pages are typically used for constituent
features on your website such as and
about what page right so same again if
we click on that we get a sample page
with WordPress then we can edit
everything here as well alright the
comments is where we can just review all
the comments that people leave in our
blog and we can either approve them or
we can mark them as spam there or trash
them whatever you want to do we can do
it there with the comments the
appearance tab is where we control which
theme we use it which by default is this
2015 theme which WordPress ships with
all right we've also got the 2014 and
the 2013 which the old versions of
WordPress shipped with as well currently
this 2015 one is active but when we
create a new theme what we're going to
do is say add new theme and we're going
to upload ours alright so we've got some
other sub options right here to share a
couple of them widgets is where we
control the widgets on the sidebar
things like a search box all the recent
posts I'll show you a little bit more
about that later the menu section is web
can control the different menus on our
site again I'm going to show you all
this later when we create the menu for
our blog then the editor is where we can
edit the
theme files I prefer to edit the theme
files in the text editor just because it
looks nicer it's easier to code and I
prefer to do it that way however you
can't edit them here if you wish to now
the plugins tab lets us install plugins
and plugins are essentially packages
which extend WordPress ease
functionality we're going to be
installing and using a plug-in later on
in the series so I'm going to show you
all about that later on WordPress ships
with these two plugins by default and it
tells you a little bit about them there
if you want to read it but we can add a
new one by clicking add new like I said
we'll do that later the users tab
letters are new users who can have pages
so we can add a new one up there
also shows you the current users on your
site this is me ninja admin or ninja man
rather but I can go to your profile if I
want even I can change some different
things about my profile I can change the
color scheme change it to midnight
that's pretty cool and it changes the
color of the backend for you we can also
change my name our details of a bio
create a new password and then just
click update profile to save everything
alright so now I've got this new color
scheme pretty cool the tools lets us
import or export posts so that's good if
you're moving from another blog or CMS
system we can import all those blogs or
posts that we've got on our old site
into this one or likewise we can export
them if we're moving to a different
content management system and then
finally guys the settings just lets us
change the general settings of the site
the title the address blardy blardy blar
a few different things here the
permalinks is one we're going to dive
into in the very next tutorial because
that lets us changed the URL structure
of our posts all right so that's your
whirlwind tour of the backend like I say
I wasn't going to go into any great
depth in this tutorial so there's no
real need to I mean as we go through it
I'm going to be going into more depth
into little areas as we use them so yeah
that should give you a brief overview of
what everything does
I have any questions at all feel free to
drop comment down below otherwise guys

updates and I'll see you in the very
