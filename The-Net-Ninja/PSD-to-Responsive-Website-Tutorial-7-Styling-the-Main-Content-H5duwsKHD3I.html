to your PSD to responsive website lesson
seven and in this video we're gonna
stand up the main content Wow are they
gang so this is where we left off the
last time if we just make this
fullscreen you can see we've done the
logo the navigation in the header and
this banner so now we want to style all
this stuff right here so if we look in
the PSD file we're gonna see these are
in a row of full going across then we've
got three going across there and we've
got this little quote there so that's
what I'm gonna concentrate on this
tutorial so let's start with these
things at the top alright then so what
we need to do is target these things
let's have a look at the rules or the
the HTML so we can target them properly
you've got an ID of selling points so
let's copy that right there that's the
containing element and so let's pop that
right there and first thing I want to do
is give this a margin at the top so
capitals managing at the top of 60
pixels okay just to bring it down a
little bit then that will do for that
rule then what I want to do is say
selling points li because all these are
allies remember each one of those and
we're going to flow all of these left
votes to the left and then I won't give
them a specific width and that's going
to be 23% now I'm not giving them 25%
because I want to give them a 1% and
padding on each side of the spaced out a
little bit okay so we'll do that now
we'll stay padding and it's gonna be 1%
all the way around so it's top and the
bottom and left them right like that
okay then the thing I want to do next is
give this a text align the property of
Center and that's going to bring
everything to the middle just like that
which is pretty cool and then I'm gonna
give it a list style type oops
of not and that's going to get rid of
these little circles right there and
then after that we're going to give this
a line height which is going to catch
every element within it and the line
tight it's going to be one point six and
and that's a relative measurement so
depending on what the text size is it's
going to be one point six times that
amount and that's going to be the light
right there
so it gives it a little bit of spacing
between the text all right
so I think that will do for these Li
tags then what I'm going to do because
we floated all of these remember as with
the header the height of this
surrounding element the selling points
if I just hover over that you can see
it's got no pie on the right it's just a
blue line that's because the Heights
collapse because we've used all of these
floats and with not clear those floats
so let's use the same technique as we
did above and that's using the Aptus
superclass and we're going to display
this as blocked then we'll give it some
contents of an empty string like that
just in edit it and then finally we're
going to use this to clear both left a
right all right perfect so we have done
this section right here that's looking
pretty cool next thing we want to do is
jump over to the latest work part so
let's grab that I know it's got an ID of
latest work the surrounding div if we
look in the HTML I'll show you that so
it's down here somewhere where is it
that's the quote there should be a
section here yet latest work so this div
right here contains all of these Li tags
so let's jump back over to the styles
and give this a few style so latest work
I want to give a padding top of around
30 pixels I'm giving this a padding and
a margin so I'll show you why in a
minute and then I'm going to give it a
boy the top of 2 pixels solid and then
efore before before which is the color
of the text we've been using so now you
can see this boiler here and it's got
space at the top of it and space below
it and the space below is the padding of
30 pixels and the space above it sorry
the padding of 30 pixels and the space
above it is the margin of 30 pixels
which is here so that's why I've applied
both of them like that all right so
let's dial up this h2 within the latest
work so we'll say the latest work h2 and
then inside it we need to give this a
text transform
of uppercase to make it all capitals
then I think the font size is slightly
too large so we're going to reduce that
a little bit to 20 pixels like that and
then I'm gonna give it a margin bottom
about 40 pixels just to spread it out
from these thumbnails that we're going
to do so latest work h2 is all sorted
now let's go after these Li tags so
again latest work Ally and in here what
I'm gonna do is say give it a width of
30% remember there's only three of these
so 32 times 3 is 96 percent so we've got
4 percent to play with in margin and
whatnot so we'll do that in a second I'm
going to float these to the left so
they're all left to right like that and
then I'm going to give these a list
style type of Nod to get rid of those
little circles perfect now with the
margin that we want is going to be in
the middle remember so if we take a look
at this right here we want there to be a
bigger gap here and a bigger gap here
now we don't need to apply a margin to
every single element for that to happen
we just need to apply and march into
this middle item right here so it's got
margin left and ammaji right and that's
gonna space after now correctly so
that's what we're going to do so what I
need to do and first of all just going
to go after these images right here I'm
gonna say latest work image and I'm just
gonna give that a width of 100% to make
sure they don't overlap perfect ok then
I'll go after this middle Ally so to do
that I need to say latest work then Li
then use a pseudo plastic hold and this
is all in my CSS for beginners playlist
so you can check out that I've leaved a
link to that in the the description down
below so the child is the second child
so I want to put number two in here and
then what I'm gonna do is just apply a
margin to this child only and the margin
is going to be zero top and bottom and
then two percent left or right because
remember we had four percent to play
with 32 is the width of each one times
up by three that's 96 and so 100 take 96
is 4 so that means we can have 2% margin
on each side of this element and that
adds up to 4 right so now
we've got that spacing and that looks
pretty good all right so let's style the
text a little bit what I want to do is
first of all in fact we're going to do
that play fixing
I'm gonna save latest work after because
we floated all of these elements and
you'll notice when I do this this
thing's coming right up here this quote
now that's because we've not cleared the
floats within this element and if I
click on this latest work you'll see
it's lost its height because we've
floated all these things within it so we
need to clear the the floats and we do
the the pseudo-class after to do that
remember
so it's display:block content just empty
and then clear both and then that is
gonna give it its height back if we
hover over lakes work again now you can
see it's the full height and this quotes
drop down below all right so now let's
dial up this little bit of text here so
the first thing I need to do is go after
this h3 so I'll say latest work h3 and
then within this I want to give it a
margin bottom of zero just to bring
those tags up a little bit but the tags
themselves also have a margin so what
I'll do is say P tags that's going to
grab these P tags right here and then
I'll say color about BB because it's
that great catechol it in the PSD and
then I'll say font size 14 pixels just
reduce that a little bit and then
finally I'm going to take away that
margin at the top or just reduce it at
least to 5 pixels or like that so now
it's nice and snug up to the h3 alright
then so we want to also grab these P
tags here so I'll just say latest work P
I'm going to give these a line height of
1.6 again just to spread them out a
little bit and that will do guys okay so
that is that section pretty much done
okay let's take a look at that it's
looking pretty good so far so
we just need to do this quote section
and that has a surrounding div with an
ID of quote so that's what we're gonna
target now first of all let's give this
a margin at the top so I'll say margin
top just to bring it down a little bit
of sixty pixels like that okay and then
the width of this is gonna be sixty
percent going across the screen because
remember this is not going all the way
across the screen if we look in the PSD
this is only going across this far okay
so we'll make it sixty percent of the
way it's but we need to centralize it so
what we'll do is give it a margin left
that's when it sorry a padding left of
20% and a padding right of 20% so I'll
say padding and the top and bottom is
going to be about 40 pixels and then
left and right it's gonna be 20 percent
that centralizes it like that so let's
also give this a background and that's
gonna be the URL and it's gonna be that
quote picture that's gonna go just above
here like that so deep RL is images
forward slash quote dot PNG okay and
then what we want to do is say no repeat
and then you can see the image right
there and then we'll put it in the
center and also about let me think about
20 pixels from the top so it's going to
be about there that's perfect
all right now so now what we need to do
is give it a background color all of
this thing right here so the background
color is going to be the f ef ef and
i've just got that from photoshop using
a little color picker tool alright now
then let's style off this bit of this
text right here so we'll give it a text
color of efore for you for just to make
it oops I've done that wrong sorry it's
the other way around for e4e 40 that's
why and then what we'll do is give it a
font size of about 20 pixels and the
line height of about 1.6 m/s again like
that and then I think what I'll do is
text the line this
to censor like that and I think that
should probably do okay so there is the
main content done guys so look at that
we've got the top stuff done now up
there then we've got these things right
here then we've got these ladies works
and then the crops are the only thing
left to stand up is the footer and we're
going to do that in the next lesson by
the way guys and now I'm moving quite
quickly through this CSS and that's
because I want to get to a stage where
we're just going to make this responsive
and I'm going to show you all those
techniques and what I'm going to do at
the end of this tutorial playlist is I'm
gonna supply you with a link to my
github account and you're gonna be able
to download from one of my repositories
the source code so you can play with
play around with that yourself so you
don't need to worry so much about
keeping up and doing things exactly the
same as I am all right so I'll see you
guys in a very next lesson if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
leave those down below otherwise I'll
see you in the next one where we're
going to style up this footer right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
