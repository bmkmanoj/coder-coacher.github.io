REST API tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how to set up no yet
and MongoDB on your computer okay there
so in this video I'm going to be walking
you through setting your a development
environment with no GS and MongoDB so if
you're already comfortable doing that
and you understand how all the moving
parts interact feel free to skip to the
next lesson where I'm going to talk
about HTTP methods for the rest of us
the first thing we want to do is install
nodejs
to do that personally as to all and
download by clicking this button right
here okay so once you've done that just
walk through the installation
instructions keep everything the same at
and that's going to install node as well
as NPM the node package manager on your
computer okay so to make sure that it is
installed correctly just go to your
command-line tool I'm using Commander
and type node space - V subversion that
is going to come back with a version
installed on your computer if successful
okay
so there we go there's no js' installed
the next thing we want to do is install
MongoDB so I've gone to MongoDB comm and
I'm going to click this download button
in the top right this is going to take
you to the download page for your
operating system so you want to download
and install that as well now that's
downloaded onto our computer but it's
not configured to run on our computer
once it's downloaded there's a couple of
things we need to do to make it work
right so you want to head to your
command module again I'm using commander
and navigate to your C Drive right here
the root level and do that using CD ok
change directory or you can use the file
explorer to navigate to it instead once
you're in there I'm going to list the
contents by typing dir and then you can
see the data for the right here now you
probably won't see this in your C Drive
this is a folder I've created so that
MongoDB has somewhere to store its data
it's going to look into this folder by
default okay so you need to create it
data folder on your C Drive first of all
now once you've done that navigate into
the data folder I'm going to do that by
seeing
the data and I'm going to say dir again
to list the contents and you'll see this
on a folder called PB again you're not
going to see this one either you'll need
to create this DB folder for the
database contents of MongoDB alright so
once you've created those two folders
then these configured but it's not
running yet we need to run it as well so
to do that I'm going to head to the
documentation and you're going to see
this start MongoDB sitting right here
and this command right here you can
execute this Mongo daemon executive on
fire for us and that is going to run
MongoDB for us okay so you want to copy
all of this including the quotations and
a quick caveat you see this
three-point-four thing right here this
is the version number so if you've
downloaded a different version you're
going to need to replace this number
right here with whatever version you
have downloaded okay so copy that head
to your command line tool again paste it
right in hit enter and this my friends
is going to run MongoDB in the
background that might look like a load
of junk but believe me this is now
running and you can see here it's
waiting for connections on port two
seven zero one seven so that is waiting
so that is running sorry I'm waiting for
connections to it so for the rest of
this series I'm going to assume that
you've got this MongoDB running in the
background otherwise some of the code
that we write when we communicate with
the database is not going to work
alright so now we have no jeunesse NPM
MongoDB uninstalled and MongoDB is
running in the background listen for
connection requests okay so let's head
to awesome now and what I've done is
just open a folder called
REST API playlist this has got nothing
in it so you can create a folder or
download life with github and open it in
your text editor this one's atom and the
first thing you want to do is create a
package JSON file in this directory so
the package.json file is going to
contain information about our project
and also track our dependencies so any
third-party packages that we install
like Express or Mongoose later on is
going to track those for us okay so to
create that package JSON file I'm going
to go to this thing right here
and I'm going to create a new terminal
or new console or start and then
currently this is in this directory I
want to be in this directory so I'll
right-click over here go to copy full
paths and then head to listing again
type cd' paste that toughing and it's
going to navigate to this directory then
to create this package dot JSON file I'm
going to say NPM in it and then I'm
going to pass it the black flag which
basically means that it's going to
autofill our package JSON file for us
and you can see that file right there
and it's also been created over here so
if we double click we can see the name
of it the version the description this
index dot J is going to be the entry
point for our application we're going to
create that file later on and other
information as well now there's no
packages installed yet so it's not
tracking any packaging just yet but when
we install packages later is going to
list those down here as well now just a
quick
Gaja here if you're using my course
files if you download for example lesson
7 it's not going to download any
third-party packages that we install so
to install those once you've downloaded
them you're going to have to run NPM
starts oh sorry NPM sorry installed and
that's going to install all the
different packages for you that you
require for that particular lesson that
stage in the project ok so then we go
we've got no GS installed we've got our
package JSON file and we've got MongoDB
running in the background now before we
go any further I just want to take a
quick look at how all the different
parts of our API are going to work
together so we're going to be making an
application on nodejs using express to
help us do it now Express is a package
we can install on no TS which is going
to make things such as listening to
request and handling them much easier ok
so we're going to have our node Express
app or running a server here listening
for requests from the outside world
right we also have MongoDB running over
here in the background as well and that
is waiting for our no GS Express up to
communicate with it so the idea is that
these two components are here these
things are going to make up basically
our API and our API is going to be
running waiting for requests to be made
to it from another application
to the front end of listing or a mobile
application awesome or the website so
for example this or the website right
here this could make a get request to
our API using this end point right here
ninja go to come forward slash API for
slashing ninjas this is just a name of
made up its in the hub real website this
is like a fictitious name for my API
right so this other website is making a
get request to this endpoint right here
this resource so it's going to send that
get request to the X press up the
Express app is going to look at it so
hey look this is a get request to this
endpoint so I'm going to deal with this
to give it the resource it wants it's
going to communicate with MongoDB get
the list of ninjas bring them back and
send them back in JSON format to this or
the website this is a website receives
those ninjas in JSON format and then can
cycle through them and display them in
their own web page or however they like
to the end-user so now we have
everything set up and ready to go but
before we write any code I want to take
a few minutes in the next lesson to talk
about the different HTTP verbs or
methods we'll be using to talk to this
API which has get post put and delete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
