eighth angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at modules
Wow okay the gang so right now we're
just using angular only in this HTML
file but as we build big applications
we're gonna have to start adding
different JavaScript files into our
project to control different things
within our content and because it's
always nice to keep things within some
kind of logical structure in an
application we're going to use angular
modules and controllers to divide our
code into manageable chunks now an
application could have one module or it
could have many that depends on the size
of your app and how you as a developer
like to organize your code so right now
we're just going to define one module
and that one module is going to contain
all about applications code right so
what we're going to do is come up with
to this app folder right click and add a
new file this file is going to be called
a PJs and within this app J's file is
where we're going to define our module
so let's store it in a variable I'm
going to call it my ninja up like that
and I'm going to set this equal to a
module and to do that I'll say angular
dots module and then within these
brackets we're going to give this module
a name now I'm going to call it again my
ninja app and this doesn't have to be
the same as this variable right here
this variable is just holding the module
it's a reference to it and this is the
name of the module I like to do them the
same just to keep things simple okay so
once we've given our module a name then
we need to pass in the dependencies in
an array now right now there's no
dependencies but later on if we need to
inject some kind of dependencies into
this module we want to use additional
features then we would pass them through
here and I'll show you that later on as
we use some dependencies so that's it
that is our module created and by
storing it in this variable what we're
doing is essentially namespacing the
application so that all the scripts and
variables outside of angular don't
interfere with our application code
because all of our application code now
is going to reside within this
jool okay so now that we've created our
module we need a way for angular to know
that this module is what will be control
in our application and we do that by
going through to the index and coming up
here to the ng app directive now we set
that equal to the module that we want to
control this app so I'm going to set it
equal now to my ninja and this right
here has to be the name of the module
this one right here not this even though
there's the same if this was different
it would have to equal this not this
okay so now that we've linked that up
this HTML this application is now going
to be controlled by this module and all
of our application called code is going
to reside in this module okay so now we
can add all the components to the module
so you can think of a module as a
container for all these are the
components like controllers so all of
our controllers are going to reside in
this module
likewise our config and Rud methods are
going to reside in this controller in
this module okay
so the way we do this is by saying my
ninja up all right and then we'd say dot
conflict all right and then we could
pass a function through to this config
and the config method is just a function
that will fire before your application
runs so any kind of preparation that you
need to do would go in here all the code
would run just before your application
runs okay so things like routing and
we're getting to config later on we
could also do my ninja up dots run and
then pass through a function here and
this function would fire when your
application runs okay so this conflict
is before your application runs and this
run one is as your application runs all
right we could also declare controllers
by say my ninja up dot controller and
we're going to learn about controllers
and a little bit later on but
essentially the point I'm trying to make
here guys is that everything we're doing
is within this
module okay all of our controllers the
rod the config factory services they're
all going to reside within this module
and it's going to provide us with a way
to kind of structure our code into
logical chunks all right so that is what
a module is all about and if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
drop a comment down below otherwise guys
don't forget to subscribe share and all
that jazz and I'll see you in the next
tutorial where we're going to take a
look at controllers I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
