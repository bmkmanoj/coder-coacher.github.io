in the dull tutorial and in this video
we're going to go over check box events
okay then so I want to show you one more
thing when it comes to adding event
listeners and that is the change event
so the change event occurs when a form
element for example changes and that
could be when we select a checkbox or
when we press a radio button those
things are changing the state right so
what we're going to do is create some
kind of check box down here to hide all
the books and when we check it and it
has a little tick in it I want to react
to that change event to hide the box and
then when we on tick it I want to react
to that change event to show the books
again all right so the first thing we
need to do is add in that HTML so I've
come down to the bottom form here at
book and I'm going to add in a new input
field and label so I'm just gonna paste
these in and it's an input type of check
box with an ID of hide and also a label
for hide which associates the two
together and the text is hide or box now
I'll save that we also have a couple of
styles for these elements right here at
book hide it gives it a width of 30
pixels and this label has a line height
of 52 pixels so dead-simple now if we
check this out in a browser then we're
going to see this thing right here so
what I want to happen is when we check
it to hide the books when we uncheck it
to show the books so let's add in that
functionality so let's go to app j/s and
I've just minimized these two functions
using these hours right here and we want
to hide the books this time so how are
we going to do this well the first thing
we need to do is grab a reference of the
check box so I'll create a constant and
I'm going to call this hide box and I'm
going to set this equal to document dot
query selector
and the element I want is the hide
element that's the ID of the import
field so we have a reference to that now
now we want to add an event listener
which is going to listen for that change
event and remember the change event is
going to occur whatever this changes so
when a ticket and what it won't ticket
is changing right so it's going to
listen for that event and then we can
fire a callback function so let's add
that event listener I'm going to say
hide box dot add event listener and then
the event we're listening for is the
change event then we pass a callback
function
we'll just passing the event object as
well and down here we want to do
something so what do we want to do well
first of all we want to check if the
checkbox has been checked or unchecked
but both change events and we want to
distinguish the two so we can do that by
using the checked property on a checkbox
so we have the checkbox right here so we
can check if this is checked by saying
if and then in brackets hide box dot
checked now this is going to return true
if it is checked and it's going to
return false if it's not checked so if
it's true it means we've checked it and
we want to hide the box if it's not true
it means we've unchecked it and we want
to show the box again so let's do the
true case first of all when we've
checked it we want to hide the box now
the books are in this ul right here and
we already have a reference to that ul
pit we have this list constant so let's
grab that and paste it down here and
what we want to do is change the display
of this we want to change a style and we
know how to do that we can say dot style
and then the property we want to change
I'm going to be display and we're going
to set that equal to not so when we
check this it's gonna hide that ul then
we'll add on an else statement and
underneath this time what we want to do
is show the list so we'll say list dot
style dot display
and then we want to set this equal to
initial or block you like both of those
are going to show it so if we save this
and check out in a browser now if we
click this we're hiding the box when we
unclick it we're showing the books so
we're reacting to this change event on
this farm field right here and it's not
just in this farm field which has a
change event a lot different farm fields
have that event so it could be a radio
button or something else well that's how
we react to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
