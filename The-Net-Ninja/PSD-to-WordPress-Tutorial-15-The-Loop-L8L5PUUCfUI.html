to WordPress tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at what the
loop is in WordPress oh I think guys so
the loop in WordPress determines what
content to display on the page that
you're visiting in the browser and that
content could be a post a page multiple
posts or some other custom content than
you've got for example if we had a group
of posts that were in say a news
category we could use the loop to cycle
through all of those posts and display
the title the link and a small snippet
of each one of those posts on our home
page and then when you click on one of
those links it takes you to the actual
post alright now because this is
WordPress is way of displaying dynamic
content on a website the loop is gonna
be really important to you it's gonna be
at the heart of pretty much any theme
you develop so it's vital you understand
how to use it
and we can customize it to our hearts
content to cycle through pretty much any
content that we want and output that to
the screen now in this video I'm not
going to dive too deep it's about making
complex custom loops and I will be doing
that as we got further into developing a
theme particularly when we come to
create a portion of the website which is
going to bring in some menu items
however in this video I've created a
simple stripped down version of the loop
sorry I'm going to walk you through that
now I've just created this loop in a new
page that I've created called loop dot
PHP this is not part of WordPress theme
files this is just for the purpose of
this tutorial ok now there's two steps
to displaying content on your website in
WordPress the first step is to retrieve
the content that you need for that page
and WordPress does this behind the
scenes this is the first step it
retrieves the content it needs behind
the scenes and stores it in a global
variable the second step is to use the
loop to cycle through that content and
output it to the screen okay so this
first bit here how does it determine
which content to bring back well it's
really clever and by default WordPress
uses the URL structure of the page that
you're visiting to determine which
content you need ok so say for example
we
visiting a category page and the
category is ham all right so now if we
learned on that page WordPress is gonna
know to go out find the category of ham
and retrieve all of the posts within
that category and bring them back and it
stores that data in a global variable so
that then we can cycle through those
posts in the loop and output data from
them okay that's how it works
likewise if we go to just a single post
like hello world WordPress is going to
look at this and it's going to know to
go out and get the hello world post
bring it back and store it in that
global variable so that we can go into
the loop and output it onto the page all
right so that's the first step it grabs
the data from the database and we can
then loop through it which is the second
step now we can override the default way
that WordPress goes up and grabs data so
that even if you're on this page or some
other category page we can customize
what it brings back right but that's a
little bit more advanced we are going to
do that later but for this tutorial I
just want to go on to the loop now so we
just leave Lee B so that WordPress grabs
the content it needs based on the URL
and then we can cycle through that
content in the loop okay so the first
step of the loop is this if statement
right here and this is all PHP code by
the way so this is saying if you have
posts so if this was successful if
WordPress went out and it found that
post and brought it back all those
number of posts then this will be true
so if we have those posts then we can
start the loop which is a while loop
okay if we don't have any data if you
didn't manage to retrieve any post for
example if we went to category ham or
category News or something and it found
that there was no posts in that category
it wouldn't bring anything back then we
this would be false this half posts and
we wouldn't do this loop okay so first
thing it checks they successfully got
the posts or got the content that it
needs now once we've got that we do a
while loop and this is just a loop that
looped through all of the posts
that it retrieves out all of the
contents so say it brings back five
posts from the news category yes we have
posts so we're going to the while loop
and it checks again while we have posts
yet we have five posts then we'll load
the post data so we're working on the
first post
out of those five posts that we've
retrieved and we're calling this the
post function which is a wordpress
function and this just sets up the
content or the data for us to use in the
loop okay so basically this lets us
output data from that first post like
the title or the content or the featured
image that kind of thing right so once
we've done that function here the loop
content goes here which comprises of
various HTML things and other template
tags now template tags are the things we
use to output the data of that post the
first one I've got here is the title so
that will go out and get the title of
that published the second one is the
content and that will go out and get the
content of that post okay so for each
post what we're doing is were looping
through we're setting up the data of
that post so that we can use the
template tags and then we're outputting
the data of that posts then we'll go
back do we still have posts yeah we have
four left so we'll do it again we'll set
that post output the title output the
content go back up do we still have
posts yeah there's three left do it all
again two left do it all again one left
do it all again nothing left so the
while loop ends and it comes out of the
loop so now we've successfully displayed
all five of those posts on a page we've
got the title and the content of all of
those posts but if we wanted to we could
have the link to each post on a page or
the image to each post on a page or the
something else the date or the author of
that post okay so we can output whatever
we want of those posts so there are tons
of these template tags and remember
that's what these are called these are
called template tags and they are the
functions which output the data to the
screen there's tons of those and there's
far too many for me to go through in
this tutorial but what I'll do is I'll
leave a link down below so you can click
that link and go check out all the
different
Playtex that we have access to in
WordPress and the different data we can
output so yeah that's the loop for now
what I want to quickly do is go into the
index file which is somewhere out here
why did I never find this there it is
and then just want to show you this is
the loop also it's a little bit more
complex because we've got other things
in there but essentially it's doing the
same thing right so this is the home
page so the home page is going out and
it's grabbing all the posts that it's
gonna show on the home page all the
latest posts right so it's gone out and
grabbing those and then it's doing that
if statement
do we have posts yes okay cool so then
it's doing some other dynamic content
here which is not part of the loop it's
just outputting h1 and then it's
starting the loop here it's saying while
we have posts ok yeah we do have posts
set up the post data and then what it
does the only thing in the loop is get
this template part okay and this
template part is right here so now it's
outputting the data of each post using
these template tags like I said this is
the ID of the post this is the content
okay
this is the title and various other
things that it's outputting yeah it's a
little bit more complex and it's using
all the tags or the template tags and
other PHP functions we don't need to
worry too much about that now all we
need to know is that we're going through
the loop we're cycling through each post
and outputting data using these template
tags okay and we can only use those
template tags because we've used this
function first of all within the loop
for each post which allows us to use
them okay so like I say might be a
little bit complex at first but once you
get your head around it it is quite
simple guys and we're gonna go into loop
a little bit more as we set up our own
custom loops later on so yeah that's
pretty much it if you have any questions
guys don't be shy feel free to comment
down below and I'll answer as many as I
can
otherwise don't forget to subscribe
share alike and I'll see you in the very
