tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about grid areas so arguably one
of the coolest things about CSS grid is
that we can have grid template areas and
instead of me trying to explain what
this means because I probably fail
I just want to dive into an example
which hopefully will show you how to use
them because they are freaking awesome
right so the first thing you'll notice
is that I've still got this deal with an
ID of content that's a grid wrapper then
we have these six tags inside a header
main section aside now footer now the
styles are pretty much the same as all
the other videos when we start
displaying grid on the content div right
here and then anything within that
content div anything that's a direct
descendant is giving a background of
this blue color and upon the 30 pixels
so we have a grid kind of set up but at
the minute everything's stuck in one on
top of the other now I want to create a
grid that maybe has say four columns
that are all the same width right so let
us first add in the grid
- template - columns property and this
is gonna be a repeat function we want to
repeat something four times and it's
gonna be one fraction each so each
column is the same width the next thing
I want to do is give each row a certain
height or a minimum height so I'll say
grid
Auto rows and by the way I generally
just do this so that the rows are big
enough so that you can see there's no
other particular reason I'm giving it a
min height of 100 pixels or something
like that but anyway we'll say min max
and then oops don't know what I've done
there open the get panel let's get rid
of it and inside here we want to say 100
pixels for the minimum and auto for the
max in cases any content inside one of
them alright cool so now we have that
row height and we want to start placing
these different elements inside this
grid in different places now the way
we're going to do this is not how weird
generally do it over the past few
tutorials where we've said grid column
star or grid column is 1 to 5 or grid
row is 1 2 3 etc we're going to use grid
template areas so the idea is that we
give each one of these different
elements that we're going to
on the grid a Greek area name and then
we positioned that grid area name inside
this grid so first of all let's give
each one of these a grid area name and
we do this via CSS so we'll say header
and give this a property of grid
- area and we're gonna set this equal C
whatever we want to call this area that
we're putting it in right and this is
all gonna make sense in a minute now
we're gonna have to pass this into
quotations like a string or anything
like that we just call it right here
header right so I'm going to call this
grid area for the header tag Heather
makes sense right so I'm going to do
exactly the same thing for the other
things down here so I'll say main and
this is gonna have a grid - area of main
and same thing for section grid area
section and then same thing for what if
we got after section we've got a side
now that and footer so I'll say it aside
and then a grid area it's gonna be a
side and this might not make much sense
at the minute but I promise you in about
60 more seconds it's all gonna click
into place of grid area for this it's
gonna be cold now so I'm just calling
them the names of the tags here but you
don't have to call them that you can
call them whatever you want for example
this one here footer I could say grid
area is called my grid area but you know
whatever you want to call it so I'm just
calling them the same names as the tag
because it's easier for me to remember
but anyway now what we've done is
assigned each of these different tags a
grid area name right so now we can place
these kind of grid areas onto the grid
where we want to and the way we
distribute these different grid areas
onto the grid is pretty simple so all we
need to do is come up to the grid itself
the grid wrapper and we're going to use
a property called grid template area
soap or say grid - template - areas okay
now our grid has four columns right and
however many rows that we need
so what we can do now is spread out
these different elements over these four
columns now what I'm going to do is a
string for each different row right and
on each row what I'm gonna do is say
what I want to appear in each column
right so there's four columns so if I
want for example the header to go all
the way across the top right so over
each of the four columns then I can say
in here for the first row header header
header and header so each one of these
is a column right something saying I
want a header in the first column header
in the second head it in the third
header in the fourth so now I can go on
to the second row and I can say well
okay what do I want in the second row
well on the left
I want the aside and I love the aside on
the left again so the first two columns
we have asides which is this grid area
down here right then after a side I want
the main and the main so on the right
side of the second column we have the
main so let's save this so far and see
what happens
so we can see header header aside main
right now it doesn't look brilliant yeah
and you're gonna find out why that is in
a minute just because we've not finished
assigning these different things but
next we'll go into the next row and I'll
say on the left
I'd like the nav then I want the nav
again then main then main so the main is
going over two rows right here it's
going on the right side of the second
row and the right sign of the third row
okay
underneath NYX I want another row and
this time we'll have a section section
section and section I remember these are
the grid areas of putting in right here
whatever we've named it right here so
this section refers to this and we're
giving that a grid area name of section
and then we're placing that name in this
row right so I don't just want this over
one row or what over two rows I'll do
another for rofl of sections section
sections section section okay and then
underneath that we'll do one more row
and this is gonna be for the four
and we'll spun that across the whole row
as well all right so now I'm going to
put a semicolon at the end of this
because it's just a CSS property value
at the end of the day we put semicolons
at the end of them right and I'm going
to save this and let's see what happens
over here so now you can see we have the
header at the top then we have the aside
on the Left nav on the left the main
section of footer I'm going to just add
a great gap into this grid so you can
see this a little more clearly so a grid
gap is going to be ten pixels all the
way around
save that okay so now we can see this
take shape wherever we've placed those
grid areas inside this thing they appear
on the screen which is freaking awesome
so we're essentially dictating our
layout using these grid templates areas
we can visualize the layout right there
how simple is that
that is awesome now say for example you
want to leave a certain space I don't
know without any content in it okay so
vacant you'll be like well the way we
can do that using these grid template
areas is instead of assigning a
particular column a grid name like a
side here we can place a period or a
full-stop however you want to call it
and we can do the same down here so
instead of the aside and now being in
the second column now there's just gonna
be a space it's not going to be filled
so we can save that overview over here
and now we get that gap right so that's
how we add blank spaces if you like into
the grid so I don't know about you but I
think this is absolutely amazing the
fact that we can control the whole
layout using these grid areas we'd have
to position anything float anything
start messing around with the margin or
position relative to offset anything
we're just dictating the whole layout
using these strings right here so the
reason we have four again the four names
is because we have four columns but if
we want we could have eight columns and
we could carry this on you know eight
times so with eight headers at the top
or six mains and two sides
you know so they all add up to eight
each row right we've got four but that's
the basic premise and then each row has
a new string inside quotations I lay out
like there because it looks easy on the
but you can start it up here of your
wish but I always go down to the next
line and keep it looking nice like this
so there we go that's how we use grid
areas to create a layout in a web page
in the next tutorial we're going to take
it one step further and see how we can
adapt this kind of grid layout for
mobile devices if you're like our
smaller screens so that it changes
depending on the width of the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
