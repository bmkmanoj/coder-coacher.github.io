last responsive design video and in this
one I just want to talk about what's
coming up next uh I think I so first of
all I want to say a massive thank you
for sticking with me during this
playlist I hope you have learned at
least a little bit during the last 11 or
12 lessons off so if not then sorry guys
I'll try and improve but if you want to
learn more about responsive frameworks
and responsive design what that suggests
you would do is maybe first of all read
about responsive frameworks of course
you have practice with media queries and
whatnot first but then if you want to
take it a little bit further and start
making things a little bit easier if
itself look at some responsive
frameworks we've already had a quick
look at bootstrap okay but skeleton is a
really easy one to start off with
because there's not much to it there's a
grid and there's just a couple of extra
features so that's really cool for small
websites and just learning basically you
can also look at foundation which is a
little bit more advanced got quite a lot
of features in there and then bootstrap
as well so as well as that hey I'm going
to be doing some more responsive
tutorial series on this channel fairly
soon coming up pretty soon it's gonna be
a PSD to responsive website tutorial
where I'm going to take a PSD design and
code that up in HTML and write the CSS
for that as well I'm not going to use a
framework for that I'm going to use all
my own responsive CSS so you can see how
I do that from scratch so stay tuned for
that I'm also going to do a bootstrap
tutorial series which is going to go
from start to finish looking at
bootstrap the grid system all the
different features it offers and that
kind of things and then how I approach
the type of website and bootstrap so
we'll take a look at that and then
finally I am also at some point going to
do a responsive WordPress theme tutorial
I've already got a PSD to WordPress
theme tutorial in this channel but I've
got to do another WordPress theme from
scratch
and make it responsive as well maybe
using a framework I don't know we'll see
all right so thanks once again for
watching this series hope it has helped
if you have any questions feel free to
leave those down below I'll answer all
those and I'll see you guys in the next
tutorial series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
