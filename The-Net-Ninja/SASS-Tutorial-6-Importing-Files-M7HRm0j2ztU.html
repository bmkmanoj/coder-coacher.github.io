sixth sass tutorial and in this video
we're gonna look at how we can import
external sass files into our main sass
file Wow alright then guys so everything
is going swimmingly so far except now we
have our variables on this sass file we
have our mix-ins here on this as well
then we have our main CSS files and it's
all getting a little bit too long for my
liking I like to kind of modular eyes my
sass files so that each different thing
has its own file essentially so what I'd
like to do is have a file for my
variable to keep them all in one place
have a file for my mixings keep them in
one place a fire for that main style etc
so what we're going to do is take a look
at importing external files into our
sass file and it's really cool sass when
it comes to this because it doesn't take
much work what's a weapon first thing
I'm going to do is go down here and
create a couple of new files in my CSS
for them so I'm going to right click and
I'm going to go to new file and we're
going to create a file for our variables
first of all I'm going to say the
variables dot s CSS all right cool then
we'll do another file and we're going to
call this mix-ins dot s CSS and then I'm
going to create one more right here and
I'm going to call this reset dot s CSS
and this is going to be for our CSS
reset if you like alright cool so now
we've got those external files right
there the first thing I want to do is
bring up this processor right here and
what we don't want to do is for when
this file is compiled I don't want you
to auto compile these as well into
different CSS folder files so don't want
to create a mixing this dot set our CSS
file or a reset dot CSS file or a
variable stock CSS file so we need to
kind of unti these things right here
this auto compiled box on these files so
it doesn't do that and the only one that
we want to compile is this Styles dot
CSS so we're going to leave that one
ticked all right cool so now we create
our files let's go ahead and start
transferring some stuff across so I'm
going to grab the variables
cut that out and paste it into the
variables right there and save that get
rid of that then I'm going to come to
the mix-ins and I'm going to grab all of
this stuff right here cut it out and I'm
gonna paste that in the mixing this dot
s CSS like so save that and we'll get
rid of that and then this reset is
currently residing in this CSS file now
I'm going to pop it into this s CSS file
this as well because I want to keep all
my Styles within the sass and then also
we can have one less request right here
but can just request the Styles then
instead of requesting this as well so
let's get rid of that and then save that
then come to the reset dot CSS grab all
of that and cut it out save it and crush
it off
then come to reset over here and paste
that stuff in alright cool so now what
we want to do is just import all of
these files into this main sass file and
we'll do that at the top right so this
is in order whatever we import first the
styles to those are going to be at the
top so whatever we need first is what I
generally import first now I'm going to
just import the reset first so I'll say
at import this is how we import an
external sass file and then I'm gonna
put it in quotes like so and I'm just
gonna say reset like that plus a
semicolon at the end and that's going a
lot for another sass file called reset
which is gonna find right there now it's
in the same directory so we don't need
to do any kind of path like this or
anything like that it's in the same
directory as this sass file so we just
need to type the name of the file itself
we don't need support dot s CSS it's
just going to automatically look for
that if you were importing the CSS file
you could put dot CSS but for this we
don't need it ok then so the second one
I want to import is going to be the
variables because we're going to use
those in the mixings
and also in these Styles right here so
we'll say import again and then this one
is called variables
and then finally we want to import
that's import the mix-ins alright so now
it's good to go out it's going to grab
all of these dudes right here all of
these files and it's going to dump them
at the top of this sass file right here
okay so I saved that now we should see
this look exactly the same as it was
before but this time we've kind of
modular eyes our sass file so it's much
easier to work with now so if I want to
create a mixing I'll just come on with
you if I want to create a variable I'll
just cut it here if I want to cutter the
reset I'll just do it here and then for
the rest of the Styles I can just pop
them in here it kind of keeps things
nice and clean and it's just easier to
update this way especially as your files
get bigger and bigger but when we
compile it it's just going to compile
exactly the same to the Styles dot CSS
so we still have all of those in one
file okay so that's one of the really
cool things about sets we can have
multiple sass files that we just import
into one file and then all that is going
to compile into one CSS file right here
pretty cool yeah so there we go guys if
you've got any questions on this feel
free to leave a comment down below
otherwise I'm gonna see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
