ninja and this is CSS for beginners
lesson two what the heck is CSS ah now
CSS stands for cascading style sheets
and the thing you have to remember is
that it's all about presentation
CSS controls the presentation of HTML so
you may have joined me on my previous
course on HTML basics where we made a
simple HTML document simple web page and
at the end of that course I showed you
the web page and it looked pretty cruddy
it was just a lot of text everywhere a
big image at the top there was no kind
of design or aesthetics to it whatsoever
now this is where CSS jumps in it grabs
all of that content and it styles it to
however you see fit for that website so
it gets it looking really good and
another thing you have to remember about
CSS is that the have constantly changing
standards currently we're in the kind of
css3 period and it's developing all the
time and the thing is CSS and css3 are
the same thing people sometimes confuse
these and they think they're separate
things they're actually one on the same
it's just that css3 is the current
standard it was like kind of or
rebranded as the whole kind of package
along with html5 as a new kind of web
standard so exactly the same thing you
just have to bear in mind that there are
constantly evolving standards when it
comes to css3 and there's varying
support when it comes to one browser to
the next now a lot of the browser's have
started to catch up and there is some
kind of a unity between them all now so
that they all have these kind of core
standards built in but you just have to
be wary when it comes to certain parts
of CSS and we're going to cover that
later in the course kind of browser
testing and things like that so what I'm
going to do now is dive into a web site
and I'm going to show you the impact
that CSS has okay so here we are on the
net ninja code at UK website and you can
see here that it's a absolutely
brilliant design
flawless couldn't fault it now you can
see that there's loads of different
design elements in it you've got text
weight you've got this little kind of
star ninja star throwing thing above the
text we've got lines under the
navigation you've got the navigation
position in certain areas different
colors this is all CSS at work and to
illustrate this I just want to open up
Google development tools and I'm going
to go to the sources tab and find the
CSS which is here and I'm just going to
delete all of this CSS and watch this
there we go now this is the website
without CSS and I think you'll agree
this looks really ridiculous and no
one's going to want to come here to
learn about CSS or HTML because I'd be
like well you don't know where you're
doing so that's the website without CSS
if we pasted that back in you can see
what a massive effect CSS has so this is
really important it's a really important
branch of kind of front-end web
development so you want to master your
CSS skills there is no substitution for
great CSS skills and you don't want to
be one of those people that just kind of
fudge it
you know I'll learn just enough to get
up to get along and I'll play with some
different properties and numbers and you
know try and get it looking good without
really knowing what's going on this is
one skill you want to master because
especially in the advent of different
devices you've got mobile screens tablet
screens desktops Smart TVs this is kind
of highlighting the importance of CSS in
responsive design you want your website
to look good on all devices so this is
an area that you really want to get good
at and this is what I'm here to do I'm
here to teach you all the core
essentials of CSS to make sure you learn
properly and can develop at your own
pace so that's about it to this
introduction to CSS hopefully now you
understand the importance of it and
where it sits in the web development
arena if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to comment below
I'll answer all of those don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we're going to have a
quick look at default browser styles
I'll see you guys then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
