CSS positioning lesson 1 Wow alright
then gang so by the end of this tutorial
series you are going to be an absolute
wizard in laying out HTML elements on
your web page using different CSS
positional properties right but to get a
most from this playlist you're going to
need to know a couple of things first
thing you need to know is HTML because
after all that's what we're positioning
on a web page right the second thing you
need to know is just a little bit of CSS
things like selectors properties and
values now if you don't know any of this
that I've got two playlists on this
channel already CSS for beginners and
HTML for beginners so I'll leave the
link to those down below so you can go
and check those out first so is a quick
look at what we're going to be learning
in this playlist first of all I'm going
to review the box model things like
padding margin border disgust all those
kind of things then we're going to take
a quick look at the normal document flow
now that is the arrangement of elements
on your webpage before we start applying
any positional CSS to it then we're
going to dive right into floats which is
one of my favorite techniques when it
comes to positioning things on a web
page then we'll look at the position
property now you've probably heard
things like position absolute relative
fixed so we're going to take a look at
all that jazz then we'll dive into the
stacking order of elements on your web
page and the z-index then we'll finally
take a look at what happens when your
content overflows and we'll look at text
columns so there's quite a lot to get
through but I'm going to try and
condense all of this within about 15
lessons of so so I'm going to show you
one more thing before we get cracking
and the other thing my friends is
brackets now brackets is a free pretty
cool text editor and that's what I'm
going to be using it to write all my
coding for this course much like my
other playlists also so if you want to
follow along with me you can download
this at brackets dot IO just press this
big blue download button right there and
then we'll get cracking in the next
lesson I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
