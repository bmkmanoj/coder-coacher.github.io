twelfth angular2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about invents
binding okay so we've seen already two
ways that we can pass data from the
typescript component the class itself
into the view I'm going to do that
through string interpolation and also
property binding now what if we want to
wait to pass information back from the
view into this component logic the class
itself and say we want to do that for
example when the user interacts with the
view and clicks a button we then want to
send something back into this component
logic and do something with that data
well we can do we can do that using
event binding and event binding
basically just lets us bind events to
HTML elements and we can do this two
ways we can either bind to native events
such as click events or key press events
and we do that by attaching the event to
the element itself so example we've got
a button and we attach a click event by
surrounding click in parenthesis and
then setting it equal to a function
which can then be handled in the class
itself of that component all it combines
a custom events that we make ourselves
such as this update event which I've
attached to the app hole directive and
then when we trigger an update event
this function is fired right here now
don't worry too much about this down
here it's a little more complicated
we're going to talk about that in a
later tutorial
in this tutorial I just want to talk
about binding to native events such as
this click one right here all right so
I'm back in the home component view
right here and what I want to do is
create a button element and I'm going to
attach a click event to this element and
like I say there's many more events that
are native to these HTML events which
you can use such as key press etc and
I'm going to leave a link to a list of
all those different events so you can
try to make yourself for now we're just
going to stick to this click event and
we're going to set that equal to some
kind of function in a minute I'll just
say click me here ok so this function
I'll say I don't know alert me okay and
what this is going to do now is when a
user clicks this button is going to find
this function
and then fire it but right now this
function is not defined anywhere so what
we need to do is define this on the
class itself because remember this view
has access to this class and the data
within it so let's define that function
right here it's called alert me and then
what we're going to do is just alert
something when a user clicks that button
and I'll say here there so if we save
this now and go to a browser I'm just
going to refresh in case it didn't catch
that change okay and if I now click this
then we get this alert right here so
we've interacted with the view and then
the view has triggered this function
here on the classic itself now what if
we want to pass data through into that
class right here and do something with
it
what we can do we can just pass data
right here and I'll say I like B I'm
going to pass that through into this
function right this string so I'll save
that and then what I'm also going to do
is give this a parameter here so this
Val is going to be equal to whatever
string we pass through here and then I'm
going to output this valve in the alert
so I'll save that now and let's
hopefully see this refresh over here
okay cool so now I'll go ahead and say
click me and this time we get an like
beef so what we've done there is
essentially passed data but from the
view into this class and we can do
something with it now this is not
exactly something that we do in a real
life application but you get the idea
here we can have a click event or any
other kind of event and then set that
equal to a function and pass through
some data into that function back to the
class where we can do something with it
and that is what event binding is all
