tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about standard input Oakland and
serve from here on out I think what
we're going to start doing is moving
away from directly messing around in the
Python shell I'm going to start making
some Python files in a text editor and I
think you're going to find this much
more fun because we can start to build
up some projects and then run those in
the console over here so I've gone ahead
and opened up a theme which is my text
editor of choice hopefully yours too and
I've created a new project folder called
Tyson through in playlist in here I've
got the first title file called area
underscore Kalki Y and dot py is the
extension of Tyson files so whenever you
create a python file always give it a
dot P wiring extension over here on the
right I've still got my console open I'm
using commander and in this same
directory so make sure you actually
because that's going to be important
when we consider on our Python files in
it if you don't know how to change
directories navigate around in here
dead-simple CD for change directory
space goes up a level takes you out of
the current folder and to go back into a
folder you say CD then the folder name
in this case I want to go back into
plankton - three - playlist and that's
gonna bring me back in ok so that's how
we navigate around there make sure
you're in the same directory then that
this is in over here ok so before we
start making any kind of programs I just
want to go over a couple of things so
first of all comments you can't start a
new programming language without knowing
how to comment in place and it's really
simple you just do a hash and everything
after this is just a comment and it's
already grayed out and ignored by Python
right so we've used comments just to
remind us of certain things to do with
the code just in case you forget what
we're doing it later on
so there's coming for you the second
thing I want to talk about is standard
input so in Python we can ask the user
of our programs for some kind of
feedback or input we can have some
questions for example in this console
and the user can type in data numbers of
strings and we can take that data into
the program and do something with it
and the way we do that is by using a
function called inputs all right that
simple so we're calling this function
using parentheses and inside here we
pass in a string and this string is
going to be output to this console so
the user knows what they're expected to
type in for example I could say
something like this tell me your name
thunk and then if I run it remember to
run it we say Python and then the file
name so it's area underscore calculi
it's going to run this file and it's
going to ask me this question so this
thing that I wrote here is going to
print out here and I can offer some
input and I'm going to say Sean and
press Enter and the minute it's not
going to do anything with that because
we're not doing anything with that data
in here we're not taking it in and doing
something with it but what we can do is
store this data by posting right here
into a variable so I can say name is
equal to input and then the question
wherever I type in here when I click
enter is stored in this variable okay so
I could then if I wanted to print this
name back out to the console and the way
we print something to the console is
very simple we just say print okay she's
magical and then we can output the name
which is this variable which we stored
this thinking okay so if I run this
again I'm going to click Save and then
run it so I say Tyson area underscore
calc and tell me your name is Sean then
it's going to print Sean back out to MIT
you can see right here so I'm printing
this variable back out and by the way
you can print whatever you want out here
you can print a number or you can print
just a string and I could print a
concatenated string so I could say hello
and then concatenate the name so I have
a save this now and run this file again
it's your name Sean it's going to say
hello shell pretty cool right so let's
take in another variable this time it's
going to be age that's going to be equal
to input again and I'll say and your age
so ever save this now run it again over
here then it's going to ask me from a
name
Shawn then my age as well so to type
that in now we're not doing anything
with age at the minute so we're still
just printing hello plus name but we can
print out the the age and the name if we
wanted to so how do we do that
well let's get rid of this first of all
I'm going to print out the name right
and if I want to print out multiple
different things on the same line I
could concatenate them if I want to I'm
also going to be able to use a comment
right so it's going to print out the
name first of all then I can print out
some closure string which is going to
say do you are we don't need to put a
space there because when we use a comma
it automatically adds a space in between
each individual thing that were printed
out so I'll add a comment again and then
I'm going to print out the age so be
name you are age so let's save this and
run this one more time Tammy no boots on
age 30 and this is going to say Sean you
are 30 as if it didn't already know
thank you so let's clear this that is
how we use input and print so we take
data in and we can print data out to the
console cool right so now what I'm going
to do is just comment all of this out
and if you want to comment out multiple
lines in item at least all I do is hold
down control when I select offers
control and then forward slash that's
going to comment all of that out if we
do it again
it's going to uncomment it just a nice
little shortcut alright then so this
time what we're going to do is create a
small little program to calculate the
area of a circle talked about sometimes
okay
so count the area of a circle so just a
little comment there now the first thing
we need to calculate the area of a
circle is the radius remember the
formula is ty R squared
don't know whether you remember that for
mass I did so first of all we need the
radius we're going to ask the user for a
radius right then we're going to work
out the area based on that radius so to
ask a user we say equals input and then
we ask you questions I'll say enter the
radius of your oops your circle and this
is really in meters and we'll just let
them know that
and then when we've got that radius we
need to do something with it we need to
calculate the area of the circle
so we'll say area is equal to three
point one four two that is the value of
pi right so two PI R squared so we need
to tie with this now by the radius to
the power of two that's squared so in
total the area equals PI R squared right
so now what we want to do is print out
back the area of this circle so I said
prints and I say the area of your circle
is and then we're going to print out the
area so I can say Connor and area right
so what do you think is going to happen
agent this is going to work let's try it
out so pison area underscore kalki why
enter the radius of your circle it's
just in test and now we get an error
right so basically this error is saying
that we can't multiply the radius right
here by these numbers and that's because
when we enter data in it's asking us for
this number we enter 10 when it takes
that 10 in and stores it in this
variable it stores it as a string so not
as the number 10 but as extreme and like
that and obviously we can't multiply
this string by 3.14 to and squaring that
doesn't make sense whatsoever so we can
multiply those things together what we
need to do is turn this a radius right
here into an integer so that we can't
multiply these things together
and we can do that by saying int and
then passing in the radius in the
brackets so this is called typecasting
and what we're doing is turning a string
type into an integer type right so this
then is going to become an integer 10
and then we can times it by this number
and we can square it as well so that's
the general rule whenever we enter
information here it's going to be stored
as a string if we need it to be turned
into a number we can use this int
function to do that
so now if I save this and
in Python area underscore count what's
happened tell again now we have the area
of your circle is 3 1 4 2 ok let's just
try another value so same again this
time I'll say 5 and we get a different
area of the circle so let me go
there's your very first Tyson program to
calculate the area of a circle which is
going to be particularly important for
ya crumbly never but anyway that's how
we do it so in the next tutorial we're
going to move on and we're going to look
at basic string formatting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
