fourth angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about the
magic that is two-way data-binding Wow
okay dude so this is where we left off
in the last tutorial we went ahead a
downloaded angularjs and popped it in
our folders right here and we link to
that in the head so that we can now use
angularjs in this project so before I
start I want to say that for a lot of
angularjs we're going to need to run our
code on some kind of server now that
could be a live server or a local one
I'm going to use a local one and one
cool about Adam this text editor right
here is that we can just install a
package that enables this functionality
for us so to do that go to file and go
to settings you can see I've already
installed it but to do it just go to
install right here and search for adam
live server this will pop up just click
install a little blue button like this
and once it's installed go to packages
you'll see your installed packages right
here and just click on this one and it's
going to give you some information and
it tells you if you use any of these
keystrokes right here control shoot
three four five eight or nine that is
going to open up a live server and it's
going to have a live link between this
earth browser and your code so when we
save in the code it's going to
automatically update in the browser okay
so I've already done that I've installed
it and we went ahead and click control
shift 3 and I got this browser this
server right up here this local server
ok so now when I type something in here
let's just type ap tag and say hey all
press save and that's going to appear
right here ok so a cool let's get rid of
that for now and click Save so then
two-way data-binding
is one of the first things I explored in
angularjs it was like magic in a webpage
when I first saw it and it's really good
just for starting out and seeing the
kind of power that's available to you
straight out of the box so the first
thing we need to do is add in an
attribute to our Hixton element okay so
we'll pop here and the attribute is just
ng up now this is actually a directive
and we're going to talk about directives
a little bit later on all you need to
know for now is that this tells angular
look our everything inside of these
HTML elements right here and these hex
ml tags to be an angular application so
I want you to control everything within
it okay so we can have this ng app on a
different tag if we wanted to we could
put it on the body and then everything
just within the body would be controlled
by angular this would be our application
or if we had a div tag or something like
that within the body somewhere then we
could put it on that and then just the
content within that div tag would be
controlled by angular and that would be
the angular application portion of your
website okay so for simplicity let's
just go ahead and keep this on the HTML
tag and just say a lot we'll pass it
over control to your angular you control
everything within these HTML tags so
this is our application right now and
the best thing I want to do is add a
text input so I'm going to say input
type equals text I'm going to use
another directive right now it's called
NG model okay and you're probably going
to notice a pattern here we're using ng
in front of these directives and pretty
much every directive that we use with
angular that is a an angular directive
in itself starts with ng okay so ng
model is what we're going to use to
store our data and when I talked about
MVC in a previous tutorial we said that
the model was the data so that's all
we're going to do it's going to store
data for us okay in some kind of
variable and we're going to give this
model a name we'll call it fave meat and
then I'm also going to put placeholder
on to this import I'm going to say enter
your fave meat alright cool so now the
same it's going to look something like
this on the browser and there what would
happen is if I type something now into
this import if I take pork now that
string that word right there is going to
be stored on this variable this model
okay fave meat so it's going to store it
it's binding my input to this model
pretty cool right but it's not that
interesting on its own so what I want to
do is output this to the screen right
here and I'll do that below by st. P and
I'll say your fav
meat is and then I'm going to output it
using what's known as an expression
which is just two curly brace sets and
then we pop the model name that we want
to output in between them so the model
name is veiny so remember whatever we
write in here because we have this
ngmodel directive associated with this
input field then whatever we write in
here is going to be stored in this model
so right now the model is storing this
string pork ok but what we want to do is
now output that to the browser using
this expression we're going to talk
about expressions later on but this is
how we output data using expressions ok
so if I save that now then it should
oops not proc but you can see updating
as I type in here it's updating alive
right here okay
and as I delete it deleting that live as
well so I can type anything I want in
here okay that's really cool now you can
imagine this will take a little bit
longer using something like vanilla
JavaScript or jQuery and we've not had
to do any JavaScript whatsoever here at
all this is just the functionality
straight out of the box with angular and
it's called two-way data-binding
so it's called two-way data-binding
because if we update the model using the
view right here this is the view right
because we're viewing this in a browser
so if we update it here then it's going
to update the model in the code now if
we update the model then it's going to
update the view okay so it's backwards
and forwards two-way data-binding and
that is really cool that's one of the
best things about angular j/s in my
opinion okay and it's really really
flexible we're going to get into where
more complex examples as we go on but I
wanted to show you this just to begin
with alright so that is your first kind
of proper tutorial using angularjs if
you have any questions feel free to
comment down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
