PSD to responsive website tutorial and
in this video we're gonna take a look at
the picture element Wow alright then
gang so we pretty much done all the
Styles now and the websites looking
pretty neat this is the desktop view
then as we go smaller we get the tablet
view and then eventually we get the
mobile view like that now that's all
pretty cool but I mean we're doing
something that is really pointless right
here and it's downloading this massive
image for a mobile screen which is what
about this wide that makes no sense
whatsoever so what we need to do is find
a way to stop that because really when
we're downloading that huge image on a
mobile device then we're just wasting
loads of data we don't need to download
an image that large essentially so what
we want to do is find a way so that if
you're on a desktop yeah we download
this big image if we're on a tablet
something like this size or in between
then it's gonna download a smaller image
about this big then if you're on mobile
we're gonna download this tiny little
image right here like this okay so
that's what we're gonna do in this
tutorial so just to jump to the code
first of all you'll notice that when I
made the HTML I put in this little
comment within the main banner and that
was to change it to the picture element
so that's what we're gonna do but before
we start making any more HTML I'm going
to jump into the Photoshop file right
here and I'm going to make three
versions are rather two additional
versions of this banner so this is the
one currently we're using for all
different versions whether it's desktop
tablet or mobile and basically we're
just squashing it down right but what I
want to do is keep this one for desktops
but then I've created two more files one
of them is 960 pixels in width so that's
going to be for the banner that I'm
going to create for tablets and things
like that and then the other one is for
Gen 8 pixels in width which is going to
be for the banner for mobile phones and
their smaller devices so what will it do
is grab this banner like this and just
drag it to first of all the tablet one
let's position it in the top left like
that then press ctrl T then hold shift
just to keep everything in proportion
and make it about the width of the
document then we'll just zoom it right
to the top then I'm going to grab this
to just form a perimeter
around there and then what I'll do is
just go to image and crop it doesn't
need to be exact this you know we've
cropped off a ton a little bit at the
bottom but that's fine so if i zoom in
and go to actual pixels you can see now
that this banner is a little bit smaller
and it's going to be served up on tablet
devices only okay so we're not
downloading a huge image when we don't
need one just this one next we want to
transfer this back into the mobile one
so let's again get that position in the
top left and transform that hold down
shift before we do it to keep everything
in proportion and something like that
it's going to do guys
yeah we'll cut off a little bit of the
left otherwise it's gonna look really
short so what we'll do again is zoom in
and crop this bad boy we'll start the
bottom down here up to the top like that
and we'll go to image and crop by the
way you can just go to the crop tool
they've done or why I'm doing this you
can go somewhere down there where is it
crop tool and you can just do it in one
like fell swoop that way if you want to
I like to do things the lower way around
for some reason but anyway that looks
pretty good now so that's gonna be the
mobile version if I go to actual pixels
and I'm holding down there to bring up
these options by the way and then this
is the small one this is the medium one
and then this is the gigantic one if I
go to actual pixels as you can see it's
huge so they're the three different
images we're going to use so all you
need to do now is go to file save for
web and devices and we'll choose a jpg
because it's kind of like a photo I
suppose got a medium quality you'll
notice this is now 5k when the default
one the big one one was about 12 to 15
or something like that and we'll save
that as banner - and and that means
banner medium right so for medium size
screens so that one's done then we'll go
to this one and we'll save this one else
also and we'll save this as by the way
this is 2.9 K so we've reduced the file
size again we'll save this as banner - s
for small there we go alright so now
we've got the three different images
available to us we can go in here and we
can add in the picture element so this
is a relatively new element and it's
just written like that picture
okay and we use it to serve up different
versions of different images depending
on how wide the screen is okay now it's
not gonna go into too much depth about
this we've already done a video I like
this on YouTube and I'll leave a link to
that in the description down below so if
you want to learn in detail about how
the picture tag works then I'll leave a
link to that video you can go and check
it out
but what we need to do essentially is
provide a few different source sets okay
and we do that using the source tag
first of all and then the SRC set the
source set right and this is going to be
the first image for the lowest width
screen so this is gonna be in the images
folder forward slash banner - s dot jpg
that's the smallest one right so then we
give it a media query if you like or a
media attribute to say when we'd like
this image to apply and I'd like you to
apply where the max width 480 pixels so
anything that is 480 pixels and lower
then this image right here is gonna be
loaded in okay which makes sense because
that's all we need for those kind of
whips a small image so the next one
sauce again and oops if I spell wrong
yeah scoffs brilliant Shawn
okay so sauce sauce set equals images
forward slash and butter you guessed it
medium JPEG and this is gonna be for
media which has the muck screen not much
screen don't know what how I'm going to
flow much width of 768 pixels so this is
gonna pick up all the kind of tablet
devices okay so anything between 4 1876
8 it's going to load in this bundle
right here which is the medium one and
then if neither of those two apply then
we've gotten an image time to fall back
on and this is going to be the default
one for desktops okay so we've done of
these filters here apply then this is
the image target falls back on and it
just downloads this one instead so again
we need a source set oops offset equals
and then it's in the images folder
forward slash banner JPEG
the JPEG there we go and this is the
large one we don't need to add any kind
of filter to it then we'll do it in a
halt and we'll just call this banner
doesn't really matter by the way one
little thing we've got different sources
like this a different source sets the
alt that we give the image tag at the
bottom the fallback option is also
applied to these images here we don't
need to add any kind of alt attributes
into these things okay so if we click
Save now and if you see in the browser
it's not going to work mainly because
this is not supported in a lot of modern
browsers so in order to pick up support
for this picture tag what we need to do
is add in a JavaScript polyfill okay and
polyfill basically just fills in the
gaps in browsers when they don't support
something natively a polyfill will
inject that support into the browser so
that we can use certain things okay so
tightly this is not supported in a lot
of browsers but if we add a polyfill
into this website then it will support
it it will be supported so that's what
we're going to do and a polyfill by the
way guys is basically just a JavaScript
kind of library that has a lot of code
in it that allows us to use new features
in browsers which do not support them so
the polyfill we're going to use is
called picture fill and again I've done
a tutorial on polyfills and pix fills
and this whole picture tag so it's the
same link that I'm going to leave down
below if you want to learn more but
right now I'm just going to head over to
the picture fill website alright then
guys so here I'm at the picture field
websites this URL here which I'll leave
down below so you can just go ahead and
click that then I want you to click
QuickStart and it's going to say what
the recommended usage is right here so
basically we need to pop this in our
head file okay so first of all it's a
little script with a html5 Shiv which
just says hey look if the document
doesn't already have the element picture
and bend it into it then just give it
that element it's gonna create that
element for us so that we can use it in
that document okay that's what the html5
Shiv does and then below that it's got
another script with a source of pixie
filled KS and this little attribute
right there is saying async which means
an asynchronous which means it's going
to download while the rest of the pages
download it as well you know the rest of
the page isn't gonna wait for this thing
to download
it's gonna do it asynchronously in the
same time so we're going to pop this in
our head like we'll just copy it and
grab this thing right here pop it in our
head there we go
and let's just move this along a little
bit oops
just these three lines like that yeah
but here we go that looks a bit better
now the one thing I want to do is just
get rid of this and we're going to use a
CDN instead because I've not downloaded
this it's not linking so anything yet so
I'm gonna get rid of that and we can
download or link to rather the the CDN
instead and that can be found if we go
to download and then just go to picture
fill yes all the minified version
whichever one you want to use then I'll
just click that you can see up here it
says CDN so we can grab that URL and
link to it then we'll go back into the
code and we'll say script source equals
and do that and I will say async like so
and that will be fine I think okay so
now we've got that linked top we can use
the picture element right here so now
when we do log this in a browser
hopefully it should work I'm gonna save
that and head over to this marble thing
right here we'll make this a bit larger
refresh alright and now if we go to the
main banner persky's me you can see the
picture element is there instead and if
we hover over this last one this is the
one that's being loaded in it just this
okay because currently none of these
media queries are filters rather these
things here max with 480 are max with 4
7 6 8 apply but when we get to 7 6 8 you
can see the size at the top around about
here by the way guys so currently 900
when we get to 7 6 8 there we go it
switched out the banner for the medium
one so now if we hover over the banner M
you can see that is the one there's been
applied ok so if we go to 480 again a
switch
not the banner you could see that little
thing where it switches if you watch
carefully
there you see okay so you switched it
out again and now it's just downloading
this one right here so this is the point
guys I mean we've downloaded all three
there which is a waste of time but your
typical user going on your website is
not probably good doing this with the
website if they are then I suggest they
get a new hobby because this is just
ridiculous but the idea is that if
you're loading the webpage up on a
mobile phone you're not going to be
changing the screen size and downloading
multiple things you're just going to
download this small one right here so
that we're not wasting data on the down
we're not down we'll do something huge
when we don't need it so now this is
pretty much fully responsive this planet
alright so that is it for this tutorial
and in fact that is it for this tutorial
series guys I mean we've taken a PSD
from scratch built up some HTML and CSS
and we made that mobile menu and made
our pictures responsive so we've done
all that from scratch I hope this has
been beneficial to you what may I'm
gonna do in the next tutorial playlist
is take a look at bootstrap and Dulla
I'll teach you how to create a website
using that so until then guys if you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
to leave them down below thanks for
watching don't forget to share subscribe
and like and I'll see you in the next
