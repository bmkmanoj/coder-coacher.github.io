your tenth SAS tutorial and in this
video I'm going to go through some color
functions Wow
we're going dog so SAS provides us with
a ton of functions that we can use to
make changing things in our CSS or
styles much easier now I'm gonna go to
this website right here and we don't
leave this link down below it's a good
idea to read through this because
there's absolutely tons of functions we
can use and there's far too many to go
through all of them you can see this
absolutely loads and if you click on one
of these functions it's going to tell
you a little bit about it and how we can
use it so this is really cool what I'm
going to do is just show you a couple of
color functions that we can use to
change the hover effects on some
elements on our webpage so the first one
that I want to use is called or lighten
and it's right here and you can see it
says it takes a color variable and an
amount variable so let's just copy that
and what I want to do is head back to
this page and right now in the
navigation I'll hover effect for these
links is kind of like a gray background
now this doesn't look great I don't want
this great cool it doesn't really go
with the blue so instead what I want to
do is somehow create a lighter version
of this dark blue so the hover effect
will be that as a background so if we
find in our styles the main nav we find
the a which is each one of these and
then we have this pseudo class and hover
and we've given it that background of
great so let's change this right here
and instead well paste in that function
so the function is called lighten and it
takes these two variables so we need to
pass three through now the color that we
want to lighten is this deep blue okay
so that's going to be the base color so
we'll paste that in there and then we
just pass in an integer right here so
let's just say I don't know five for now
then we'll save this and refresh and you
can see now it lightens that now every
put something like one in here you're
gonna notice that effect much less
doesn't like too much it's very very
soul and the however we go if we put ten
is gonna head towards a very light color
like so okay
so I'm just gonna stick with about six
somewhere in between save that and there
check this and that was quite nice much
better than that great effect so that's
taking care of all that color for you
you don't need to go out and get another
hex value or store another value in your
variables whatever calling you pass
through here it's going to lighten it by
this amount alright so let's do another
example
what other function can we use all right
let's use this complement color so if
you've ever used Adobe cooler or
something like that or another kind of
color theme program then you'll know
what a complement color is it's just a
color which sits nicely with another
color all right so let's go down to
let's see we've got some anchor tags
right there that's these things
currently the hover effect makes them a
color of red and again that doesn't
really complement the blue so instead
what I'm gonna do is take out that red
and I'm going to paste in the compliment
function and that takes a color so the
color that we want to compliment is this
deep blue so we'll copy that and paste
it all right there and what that is
going to do is go out and find the
complement color for this color right
here so if we save it now you're gonna
see this is gonna change the hover
effect it's kind of like a really deep
crimson red a little bit Brown as well
so it kind of matches these things which
is quite cool all right
so that's two functions that we can use
and like I say there's absolutely loads
of functions that we can use opacity
functions other color functions string
functions absolutely though so this is a
really good resource for learning about
those and I'll leave this link down
below and you can go and check those out
so any questions feel free to ask below
otherwise I'll see you in the very next
