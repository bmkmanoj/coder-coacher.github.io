JavaScript for beginners less than 35
and in this video we're going to start
accessing and changing attributes ah
all right then gang so before we start I
just want to correct a mistake that I
made in the last lesson I said in the
last lesson that these two in HTML looks
HTML and text content I said that they
were both methods there are in fact
properties and we can tell that they're
a property because when we call them we
use this equal sign this assignment
operator to update the value that's how
we update properties if it were a method
that we'd most likely see those
parentheses right there that's how we
distinguish between the two so apologies
for that guys there are properties not
methods alright so in this video I want
to show you how we can go in grab
elements and then change their
attributes like ID class H reference etc
okay and to do that we have to follow
two steps first of all we go in and grab
whichever element we want and then we
use one or two methods either set
attribute or get attribute to either
change or read the attribute value all
right so the first thing I'm going to do
is just give this a tag some more
attributes so we can play around with
them and I'll give it a ID of text and
then I'll give it a class of ninja cool
and that's a bit in the HTML nav so we
can go in and grab that I'll name a
variable called link and I'll say that's
equal to the document dot get element by
ID and then we'll pass in the ID we've
just given it which is test that's going
to store that in the variable length so
if I call it we'll get that link back
cool right now we'll use get attribute
first of all so we'll just say link dot
get attribute and this is a method
because it's got those parentheses and
then the attribute that we want to get
we pass through here as a parameter and
I want to get the hate ref attribute I
want to find out the value of that so
I'll just press ENTER and that is
subject just like here cool and we can
do this for any attribute so I'll do it
again I'll say link
at attribute and then I'll pass in this
time class see what that brings back
ninja which is the value right there
cool so that is get attribute my friends
it just reads the attribute value and
sends it back to you now the other one
is set attribute a set attribute update
the attribute that you want to obtain
okay so I could pass in the class again
here that's the attribute name yet and I
have to pass in another parameter now
and that's the value to which I want to
set that class so I'll set it to PI
because I want the new value of class to
be PI R cancer and that's going to
update it right here in the HTML all
right cool so we can also set attributes
that don't already exist so currently
there's href ID and plus but we can add
another attribute using set attribute
also so I'll do that I'll say link dot
set attribute and then the attribute I
want to set is alt and I know we
wouldn't normally see that on an a tag
but what the hell this is just an
example and then I'll give it a value of
hello click enter and there we go it's
update the HTML right there with the alt
attribute and the value of hello cool
now then these are all methods yeah
these two a methods but we can use
properties to update these values as
well now there's loads of different
properties I'm not going to be able to
show you them all but I'll leave you a
link down below so you can go and check
those out
I'll just show you a couple here so I
can say something like link dot plus
name and if I don't set it equal to
anything this is a property it's just
going to bring back what that currently
is set to which is PI cool
but if I say link dot class name and set
it equal to ninja again that is going to
update that there to ninja once again
all right now the behavior of these
properties is not always the same as the
method get' attribute and set attribute
all right so for example if I said all
link dot hate ref which is this one here
yet and call that it's going to return
to me the fully qualified URL whereas
when I called it over here using get
attribute hate ref it returned to me
exactly the value which was in here all
right
so the behavior is not always the same
and that's because these are properties
these are kind of information stored
about that link so it recognizes that
this is the full link okay and it is the
same if I was to say link style call
that I get a object with all these
different properties in it alright we
don't get whatever the styles are for
this elements if the word inline styles
here they would display I suppose right
at the beginning here but it brings back
an object which wouldn't be the same as
the value of the styles on the tag
itself now we're going to look at this
in the next lesson so I don't want to
talk about it too much I just wanted to
show you that we can use these inbuilt
properties as well like I say I'll leave
a link to our website where you can go
and check more of those out in your own
time but if you have any questions about
this feel free to comment down below
I'll answer any questions of course and
if you enjoy these videos please like
share and subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next one we're going to talk
about this style property a little bit
more I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
