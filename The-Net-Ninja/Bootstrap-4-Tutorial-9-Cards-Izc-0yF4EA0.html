ninth bootstrap full tutorial and in
this video I want to talk about a new
bootstrap 4 component called cards so if
you're familiar with bootstrap 3 you'll
probably remember something called a
panel which was a small box container
for content on your page and they look
something like resisting right here
here's some examples of panels on the
bootstrap 3 documentation so they're
just little boxes with titles content
and we can customize the colors etc so
they were quite flexible brought in
bootstrap 4 panels have been replaced by
a more flexible content container called
cards so before start coding anything I
just want to show you some examples of
these tabs on the bootstrap for
documentation so I've gone to components
and then card and if I scroll down here
this is kind of like the basic card if
you like where we have an image a title
some text a button you've got this
border etc but we can customize it to do
what one so we can have these kind of
things going on like a list and we can
have cards without images or we can have
cards with navigations in them like so
like this or we can have images at the
top or images at the bottom so there's a
lot of different customization options
that we can apply to these cards and
we're going to go through an example in
this tutorial so let's head over to the
code and the first thing we want to show
you is this image folder have added this
in and this is for images in it mongrel
node react and web pack you can get
these from my repo in the lesson 9
branch so I'll leave the link down below
to that repo so what I'm going to do is
create on our design right here some
cards for cards 1 2 3 4 govern across in
a grid system we've already seen grips
and each card is going to have one of
these images in it it's going to have
some text title etc ok so I'm going to
show you how to make these cars so I
said we were going to do them in a grid
now what's the first thing we need to do
is we use a grid we need to do a
container to put that grid in so let me
come down here and create a div with a
class 2 container
like so alright so what's the next thing
we need to do for making a grid we need
to make a rope so I'll come here and in
fact first I'm just going to do a little
comment that says carts like that so we
know where we're up to and then again
with a classic equal to or rope so this
is our row of content and remember
within each row we can have as many
elements as you want each taking up a
specified number of columns okay so what
I'm going to do is four elements and
therefore medium size screens I want
each of these elements to take up six
columns in width so medium size screens
and upwards six columns in wit therefore
large size screens in other words I want
each element to take up just three times
in width when there's more space on the
screen so how do we do that well let's
create just one give to begin with so
we'll say different class equals and
then it will say call and geese or
medium size screens in other words six
columns your whip then call LG for large
size screens and up with three columns
in width all right
so now there's our kind of surrounding
column plus if you like inside here we
want to place a card now the first thing
we need to do is create that element for
the card I'm going to do it give again
with a class equal to card like so and
then we can place all of our card
content inside here and if we wanted we
could just place some content directly
inside here so I'll just show you this
save it
let's have a look at a browser that
looks pretty clearly so I'm not going to
do that I want it to pick up the
different card Styles etc I want some
padding around this so instead what
we're going to do is take that off and
we're going to create a div with a class
two card - block so all of our card
content now can go inside this block and
what this does is give it some extra
padding around the card itself okay so
now if I create a key tag and let's grab
some lorem ipsum from this ninja it's in
place or right here so just a little bit
that'll do and if we go back now paste
in save it you're going to notice now we
have some padding around that which
looks a lot nicer tool so there's some
text now what if we want to add a
heading well we can do that I'm going to
add the h3 and I'm going to give this a
class equal to card title and inside
here I'm going to say no js' training
all right save that check this out okay
looking nice now I want to add in an
image now we can add an image at the top
or the bottom now check this out if I
add an image in here what's going to
happen well let's find out I'll do an
image tag and say source equals and then
I'm going to use one of these things
right here than no one so it's /img /a
no dot PNG close that off check this out
in a browser and first of all it goes
off the card okay we can sort that out
in a minute
secondly it's got this padding around it
now I don't want that I want the image
to be flush up against the card itself
so ideally we need to take the image
outside of the card block okay
we don't want it inside the car block
piece of card block provides us with the
padding now we can put it at the top
here or at the bottom down here
underneath the content I want to put it
at the top so I'm going to paste it in
there and because you've seen the top
I'm going to give this a class equal to
card - IMG top that's where it's going
right so if I save this now checking out
in the browser okay cool one more thing
this is kind of stretched up and down
now I don't want that I want it to look
more natural so to make the image 100%
weight of the card and then auto height
what we need to say right here in this
class list is IMG - fluid that's going
to do that for it so ever save it and
check it out now in a browser that is
looking better
awesome so there's our first card so now
all I want to do is copy this dude right
here and paste it in three more times so
we've got four cards in total and then
I'm going to replace the image itself
with different things so the bottom one
here we'll called webpack then this
we'll call react these are all
correspondence of these images right
here this one right here we will call
when it's left Mongo so that check this
out in a browser and that is looking a
lot better now one more things I want to
do right here is use a utility class we
saw that in a lesson right here we go to
kind of mute this text it's a little too
dark for my liking so we can do that by
using one class and I'm going to use it
on this surrounding container right here
and their class is called text title
init muted and watch what happens right
so this is how it looks right now if I
save it check this now it's a lot
lighter like kind of in-your-face if you
like so let me go guys that is how we
create cards and if we make the screen
smaller you can see the big role on two
lines eventually like so and that's
because of this thing right here where
we say call Andy we want them to take up
six columns in width if we go even
smaller to the smallest kind of devices
they're going to stack on top of each
other so it's all nice and responsive as
well so there we go that is card in a
nutshell and there are more things we
can do with cars but it's all quite
self-explanatory if you check out this
documentation right here again I'm going
to leave the link down below so you can
take a look at that in your own time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
