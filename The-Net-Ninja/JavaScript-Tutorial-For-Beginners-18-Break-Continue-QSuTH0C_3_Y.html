watching JavaScript for beginners a
lesson 18 where we're going to talk
about the break and continue key words
Wow all right then guys so we're back
here in the code and I've stripped out
that for loop we did last time and
replaced it with this even simpler one
right here so just to talk you through
this we're setting a initial index
variable here to be 0 then we're gonna
check this variable each time around the
loop if it's less than 10 we're gonna
execute the code and then each time
around the loop we're going to increment
this I variable by 1 and then each time
we're gonna consult up log that variable
so it should look something like this in
the console stack from 0 which is what I
starts at and then all the way to 9 when
it reaches 10 it's no longer true here
because 10 is not less than 10 so it
breaks out of the for loop now then I
just want to show you a couple of key
words that we can use within mood for
exceptional circumstances okay the first
one is the break keyword now the break
keyword essentially breaks you out of
the loop for good okay so I could say if
for example okay I is ever equal to 7
then let's execute this code remember we
did in for statements in previous
lessons if you've not checked that out
go and have a look and we could say
break so what we're doing right here is
going through the loop all the way up to
7 when it reaches 7 it still logs it to
the console but then it reaches this if
statement right here and if I equals 7
which it does then it's gonna use this
keyword break to break out of the loop
down here and then what we'll do is
console.log I have broken a little loop
alright so then it will no longer
execute this code 4 8 9 and it wouldn't
pretend anyway but it would break out of
the loop at 7 all right so let's save
this and refresh over here and then you
can see all the way from 0 to 7 then at
7 it says a broken out of the loop
alright so we can use the break keyword
to break up the loop at any point that
we want we can check its set condition
while we're looping through certain
items and if we reach a point where we
don't want to continue
Lupo we can just break manually using
this keyword alright now another thing
we could do is use the continue word and
I'll do another if statement right here
I'm going to say if I is equal to five
or if I is equal to say three then what
we'll do is use the continue keyword and
continue is similar to break in that it
will no longer execute any of the code
below this continue word in the loop it
will just go right down here but whereas
break breaks you out the loop completely
and doesn't go back up here that
continue just says hey just skip out the
code for this iteration of I this loop
of I so while I use five skip out this
the rest of this code don't go to this
don't go to this just go down here then
back up to the top and stack it with six
and it's the same for three if I equals
three skip up all of this don't print it
out to the console just go back up to
the top okay so it's like a week to form
a break it just says for this loop don't
execute the code for this time around
okay so hopefully if we refresh we
shouldn't see number three and number
five printed out here so let's refresh
and then no I'm not saved it
that's why refresh again and this time
we don't get three and we don't get five
all right so that is the continuum break
keywords in a nutshell guys you have any
questions just feel free to comment down
below well answer all of those obviously
and if you enjoy these videos please

guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
