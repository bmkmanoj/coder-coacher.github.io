JavaScript for beginners lesson 16 and
in this video we're gonna take a look at
loops in particular the while loop ah
alright then guys so I'm still in this
test J's file over here and we're going
to take a look at this while loop now a
while loop is just another control flow
system much like the if statement so we
can execute certain code sections
dependent on a condition all right so
let's first of all make a variable and
we'll call this age and once at this age
equal to five now a while loop uses the
keyword of wild and then we use our
parentheses to form the condition
bracket much like the would in an if
statement and then we have our curly
braces for the code block so we put our
condition right near here and
essentially what this does is say while
this condition is true always execute
this code so it will do it once if this
condition is true it will execute the
code come to the end and then it will go
back to the top and if this condition is
still true it will execute again get to
the end back to the top and the while
this condition is true it will always
keep looping around like this so at some
point we need to make sure that the
condition is false so that it doesn't
always go around in a loop and is an
infinity loop or an infinite loop okay
that will crash your computer so I'll
show you that in a second but for now
let's make a condition or say while age
is less than ten then we want to say and
let's document let's do a console in
fact console.log if your age is less
than ten all right and then what we'll
do well that's this kondal
we don't want to condole anything we
want to console that log and then at the
end we'll do a document dot write saying
you are now over set all right so what
we're doing here is saying that well age
is less than ten which is it's five so
this is true we're going to console that
log
your age is less than 10 and currently
this would be an infinite loop because
there's no change to age okay so we
don't want that because that would cause
the computer to crash we want to change
this age variable at some point so that
it becomes over ten and then this
becomes false so we can break out the
loop and then go down here to this line
so at the end of each console dot log
I'm going to say age plus plus I
remember that is the increment operator
so that's going to add one to the age
each time this while loop runs so it's
going to start off with age being five
which is less than 10 so that's going to
be true it's going to console.log this
message then it's going to add 1 to age
which is 6 then it's going to come to
the bottom go back up here while age is
still less than 10 which is it 6 it's
going to carry on going and it's going
to add one sort of comes 7 and 8 then 9
then when it gets to 10 10 is not less
than 10 so it's not going to execute
this and we're going to break out the
loop and we're going to come down here
and then write this to the document you
are now over 10 so before we do anything
let's right click over here in a
document and inspect element going to
bring our console up and we can see the
console log messages there so let's save
this and bring this over here and
refresh and then you can see that five
times that's what this little number
here says it says your age is less than
10 and then after that it says you are
no over 10 all right so that is a while
loop my friends the basics of it at
least if you have any questions about
this feel free to comment down below
I'll answer all of those otherwise if

or subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next one where we're going to look
at four loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
