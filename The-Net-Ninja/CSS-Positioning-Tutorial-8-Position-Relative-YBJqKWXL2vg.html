CSS positioning lesson 8 and in this
video we're going to talk about relative
position Wow okay then guys so pretty
much everything we've done in this
series so far has relied on CSS methods
other than the position property to
layout elements on our web page things
like floats on normal document flow and
that's absolutely fine if we wanted to
we could create a whole website this way
however it's not always the easiest way
that would be like painting a wall with
an art brush when we have a roll on
standby which would be much easier to do
it with so that's what the position
property in CSS can do for is it can
make things a lot easier when
positioning elements on our web page and
it takes one of five values as shown on
your screen right now
static relative absolute fixed and in
Harry so we're going to dive right in
and explore the relative position
property in this lesson okay then guys
so I can say everything on this web page
has been laid out using floats or text
columns or normal document flow we've
not used the position property once
yeah so what we're going to do is use it
on this content div to show you what it
can do so all I need to do is give it a
position property and sell it to a
relative okay and now we've set that
position property we can offset this
element from the left from the right
from the top and from the bottom so to
do it from the left all that saves left
50 pixels and that's going to move it
away from the left by 50 pixels all
right likewise I could change this to
right and it's going to move it away
from the right by 50 pixels these can
also be minus values so I could put
minus 50 and minus 50 from the right is
the same as saying 50 from the left
because it just goes in the opposite
direction right so we also have the top
and bottom we'd say 50 pixels from the
top or 50 pixels from the bottom and as
well we have the minuses that we can use
okay so what we're doing now is just
offsetting this element by these amounts
because it has this position right here
now we're not removing this from normal
document
Flo that's very important this is still
occupying this position right here and
that's what the position:relative does
okay so we've seen here
position:relative
that means it's staying in the same
position right here as seen by normal
document flow but we're just offsetting
it visually here okay and that can be
demonstrated by this if I see bottom
might in fact I'll change to this to top
just so it's a little clearer and I'll
change it to 300 pixels right
save that oops top and now it overlaps
this stuff right here but we still have
this big gap here that's because this
has not been taken out of normal
document flow it's still here in the
eyes of the document but we've just
offset it by this amount visually okay
so the end user ie me or you will see it
moved from that original position so
because of this because it still leaves
that gigantic space and it looks a bit
weird I tend to use the position
relative just to tweak something a
little bit for example instead of this
we could come up to this service right
here which is one of these I'm going to
grab this let's say service and child
and I'm going to say want to get the
first one
in fact all services will give a
position of relative yeah so each one of
these now has a position of relative so
I can offset each one then I'm grabbing
the first one right here
and I'm giving it give that a top value
of 5 pixels so it moves down a little
bit then I'm going to get the second one
I'm going to paste it twice because
we're going to the second and the third
and the second one I say top 15 pixels
and the third one I'll say top 25 pixels
right so now this is like a little stare
effect and okay it might not look so
cool but you can see these are the kinds
of effects I would use the
position:relative for just to offset
elements by a little bit each time okay
now there is one other use
for the position:relative and that's
when it's used in conjunction with
position:absolute and we're going to see
that in the very next letter so until
then guys don't forget to subscribe
share and like
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
