eighth JavaScript in the Dom tutorial
and in this video we're going to talk
about Dom traversal from sibling to
sibling ok then so in the last tutorial
I showed you how we can traverse the Dom
from a child element to a parent element
and also from a parent element so it's
children elements now in this tutorial I
want to focus on how we can traverse the
Dom between sibling elements that is
elements that are on the same level such
as these 3 right here so to do that
first of all I'm going to need to reach
in and grab a reference to one element
and it's gonna be this thing right here
the book list again so since I'm a ninja
I've already prepared this and we have a
reference to that book list now in this
constant write hit so I'm going to log a
few different things to the console I'm
going to log the next sibling and the
previous sibling and a couple of
variations of these so we'll say
console.log and the first thing I'm
going to do is the next sibling so I'm
going to say book list
next sibling is and then outside of this
string I'm going to output the Booklist
and the property name that we need to
use is next sibling all right so if we
save this now and view it in a browser
then we should see in the console that
we get this text node right here so this
is the next sibling of that element and
again this is because we have a line
break it's going down to the next line
and that line break is this thing right
here this text node which is here so if
we want to get the next element instead
of the next node we can use something
similar let's just copy this dude and
paste it down below and this is going to
be instead of just next sibling next
element of sibling like so so I'll say
the next element sibling is and if we
sewed this and view it in the console we
can see that now we get the form which
is the next element okay cool so that's
how we get the next one and you probably
guessed it already to get the previous
one I'm just gonna copy and paste these
down here I'm gonna say instead of next
it's gonna be previous and then down
here instead of next it's gonna be
previous as well
if we can spell it there we go and
instead of next here I'm gonna say
previous and also down below as well
and then let's review this in the
browser
save it check out the console and now we
can see that the book lists previous
sibling is this this is the text note
again because we've gone up a line and
then the previous element is the header
which we can see is correct as well
because we're starting here and the
previous one is the header cool so
that's how we navigate between different
sibling elements now I want to get quite
tricky here and just show you some of
the different things we can do that are
a bit more complex different more
complex queries and changing the HTML
things like that so we're gonna do one
simple example and what I'm going to do
is say book list first of all then I'm
going to say previous
element's sibling which if you remember
is going to be the header so currently
without on the header then of what I'm
going to do is use the query selector
and we can do this we can chain them
together like this so we can grab a
certain reference and then chain a query
selector on top of that and what that is
going to do is search this scope right
here search inside the header right so
this query selector is going to search
inside the header now for AP tag and we
can view that right here so we're
grabbing that P tag and what we're going
to do is add on some HTML so we can say
dot in a HTML is plus equal to and then
I'm going to add on a br tag then I'm
going to say oops
then I'm gonna say - cool
if I can type to call for everyone else
okay so now if I save this I'm checking
out in the browser we can see books for
ninjas too cool for everyone else so
we've added in this stuff right here and
all we need you to do originally was
grab a reference to the book list and
then use the previous element sibling
property first of all to get a header
then we're using the query selector so
it's querying everything inside the
header we're finding the P then we're
changing the inner HTML of that so
that's how flexible all these different
methods and properties that we have
access to in JavaScript really are so we
can do all of the same kind of things
that we can do in jQuery really easily
really easily in vanilla JavaScript as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
