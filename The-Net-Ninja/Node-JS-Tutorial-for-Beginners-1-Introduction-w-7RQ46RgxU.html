first lesson of the best know jazz
tutorial series on the planet okay then
so you may have heard of no js'
everyone's using it and it's really
popular at the minute so what do you do
you head to the no js' website and you
think I'm going to learn this but then
you're faced with this paragraph right
here no js' is a JavaScript runtime
built on Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine
nodejs uses an event-driven non-blocking
model that makes it yeah oh yeah yadda
yadda okay this makes no sense
whatsoever this isn't exactly the most
user friendly or beginner friendly
paragraph to place on the front page of
your website so to break it down no js'
actually is a platform which allows us
to run JavaScript on a computer or a
server and that my friends is immensely
cool because if we want to create a full
web application ourselves we no longer
have to learn additional programming
languages to run on the server like PHP
or Ruby we can just do it all in
JavaScript via nodejs so that means that
no GS gives us the ability to read
delete update files easily communicate
with the database plus all the other
things you would expect of a server-side
language and we're going to take a look
at those in this tutorial so why would
you want to use node.js
well it's insanely popular because first
of all it uses JavaScript so there's no
need to learn another programming
language to do your server-side code up
it's a very fast and that's because it
runs on the v8 engine and uses
non-blocking code and we're going to
take a look at that in later tutorials
it's got a huge ecosystem of open source
packages which we can install in our
projects via the node package manager
and it's also great for real-time
services like chat rooms and that's
because we can utilize something called
WebSockets so we're going to take a look
at all this and more in this tutorial
and here's a breakdown of what we will
be learning so I've got ahead and split
this tutorial series into three sections
the first section is all going to be
about the inner workings of nodejs we're
going to look at the v8 engine modules
the event emitter the fire system and
we're going to look on
the hot see how it all connects together
and works because I think when you're
learning nodejs
it benefits you greatly to know the
inner workings of no jets a little bit
so you know what's going on then the
second section is all going to be about
creating a web server routing I'm going
to take a look at Express which is a
very popular node package and templating
and then the third section we're going
to create a node.js application from
scratch and it's going to be a to-do up
or rather go so this is what we're going
to be aiming towards at the end of this
tutorial series we're going to go ahead
and create this to-do application so
this is a quick sneak preview and we can
basically add things to this list I'll
say take an app that's always a good
idea then we can add them and we can
also delete them if we click on them so
we're going to be creating this
application towards the end of this
tutorial series we're going to learn a
lot more about no GS first of all
secondly item is the text editor I'm
going to be using for this tutorial
playlist it's on the left over here and
it's really cool and it's free so if you
want it just head over to adding dot IO
and download it by the way a lot of
people have asked me which theme I use
for item and for the UI theme I use
something called monarch I tweaked and
for the syntax theme I use item Molokai
and it does look quite nice okay so
finally I want to show you my github
page and I've created a repository for
this playlist which is going to contain
some assets for our final to-do list
application so all it has in it really
is an image some styles and some
JavaScript for the front-end so if you
want to go ahead and download that you
can do or maybe just leave it and then
download it towards the end of this
tutorial series
either way it's there if you want it and
finally just a little bit about what you
need to know before starting this
playlist ideally and the first one is
JavaScript that's essential because we
are going to be using javascript on
nodejs that's what it's all about the
second one is HTML and that's more for
later on in the course when we're going
to be templating and creating a bit of a
front end for our node.js application
and then finally just a tiny bit about
the command line
and you don't need to know watch and to
be honest you can get away with not
knowing anything I'm going to show you
all of the commands you're going to be
using and they're going to be minimal so
there we go guys that is your brief
introduction to no js' and I hope you
enjoy this playlist and I'm going to see
you in the very next tutorial where
we're going to go ahead and download it
to our computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
