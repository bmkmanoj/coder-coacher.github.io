show you two more special characters
which he used to start and end patterns
and to explain this concept of starting
and ending patterns I'll go through a
simple example imagine I have a form on
my web page and they ask the user to
type in a word into one of the fields on
that form which is five letters or five
characters long now it must be exactly
five no less and no more so I'll need a
regular expression to tell me when a
user has typed out five exact characters
okay so I'll use that regular expression
to validate that form field if you like
so you're probably thinking well we know
how to do that we can do something like
this
imagine we place a character set with a
range in it from A to Z and the Royal
lowercase but it doesn't really matter
this could be uppercase as well if we
wanted to use the insensitive flag this
doesn't matter but we want it to be five
in length so we use our curly braces and
we place a five inside it that means
that this thing right here
must be five spaces or five characters
in length okay so you're thinking well
this will do because then it's going to
tell you when you have a word of five
letters it's going to say yet we have a
match and it will do if I type hello
it matches if I type in ninja it matches
and a four letter word doesn't match but
we do get a match when we type out a
five letter word however the problem is
here if I continue to write letters then
what happens is we just get numerous
matches or if we don't use the global
flag right here we still get one match
so if we use the type C in all of this
into the form field my regular
expression is still going to be saying
yep that's fine we get a match or right
here hunky-dory
well no it's not because I don't want
all of this rubbish right here
I just want this I don't want them to
type anymore if they type anymore then
it's not a match in my eyes okay because
when I go to grab the value from that
farm field I'll be grabbing the whole
thing and this word could be anywhere
inside that thing and right here we're
not even looking at that word we're
getting this much
here and we're not even looking at the
word ninja inside it so what I want is
for this to not be a much and it doesn't
highlight this but only when you type in
five letters so we can do that what we
need to do is tell of a regular
expression that look and this thing
right here must be at the start of the
form field and it must also be at the
end okay so there can't be any more
fluff to the left or right of it so the
way we do that is by using two different
characters
we'll use a carrot at the start and this
carrot when it's outside of a character
set and now we've seen the inside of
character seven it has a different
meaning there it's the negate symbol but
when we're placing it here at the start
of the regular expression we're saying
okay well the thing that follows it must
be at the start of the form field if you
like okay or the start of this test
string and therefore if anything is
placed before it now then it's only
going to match the stuff at the start
also if we place a dollar sign at the
end then what will happen is we're
saying okay well this thing right here
this five letter word must also be at
the end of the form field so we're kind
of jamming it in between these two
things right here and now if we type out
this long string it's not matching the
first five letters right here because
these are not at the end of the test
string or they're not at the end of the
form field on my webpage it's only now
going to match if these things right
here this word is at the end of the form
field or the test string so if I delete
all these and we type out five letters
now we get a match okay but if I add
more we don't get a match and if I add
more at the start we don't get a much
all right so if we take away this one
right here then what we could do is a
lot of letters before it and we get the
match at the end because this one is
saying well it must be at the end right
but we don't have the caret anymore if
we put the caret on then it must be at
the start as well okay so now we don't
get a much it only happens when it's a
five letter word exactly so you'll see
this current and dollar combination in a
lot of regex is when you're working with
forms to make sure that the only thing
that they take in that form field is
what is within those two characters so I
hope that makes sense as to why we need
them and we will be using them more as
we go on specifically when we create our
own form in a couple of tutorials time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
