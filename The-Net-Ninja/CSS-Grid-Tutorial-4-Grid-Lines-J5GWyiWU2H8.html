fourth CSS grid tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about column and
row lines okay now so far when we've
been making a grid we've defined our
columns in this case there's three
columns and we have nine elements inside
this grid so these nine div elements
right here and the default behavior of
this grid is to assign these elements in
order to the positions on the grid so
the first element the first div is
assigned to the first row and the first
column then the second one then the
third and because there's only three
columns we go on to the next row so then
the fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth
ninth etc so this is the default
behavior it's automatically assigning
elements to positions on the grid in
order now I want to introduce you to
something called grid lines which help
us to define positions on a grid which
is then going to be able to help us
place elements in whatever section of
the grid that we want not necessarily in
order for example I could take this
first block right here and I could place
it in this position instead by using
these grid lines
alright so imagine we make this grid
using CSS and it has 8 columns 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 and 7 rows going down now when it
comes to grid lines they're going both
directions the column direction and also
the row direction so in both cases the
first line starts on the very left or
the very top so for columns the very
left starts with a 1 that's the column
number and goes all the way to the very
end after the final column which is 9
now I said there were eight columns but
there's nine column lines and that's a
general rule of thumb if you have X
amount of columns you have X plus 1 and
that of lines and that's because we have
the very end ones which add an extra
line if you like and the same goes for
the rows is that's with one at the very
top and goes all the way down to 8 at
the very bottom so if you have X amount
of rows you have X plus 1 amount of row
lines so the idea is that we use these
column and row lines to determine where
to place our elements in the grid so I
could have a development with inside the
grid and I want to place it here for
example
of starting at this point going all the
way over here down here down here like a
box stick it up these nine different
squares right now if I were to place it
there then the default behavior of CSS
grid won't work because it'll place it
up here if it's the first element here
if it's the second etc so I need to
override that and use these column and
grid lines to do it so if we're starting
the element here the top left what we'd
say is we want the element to start at
this column line right here number three
and it goes all the way to six this
column line right here so we're telling
that to CSS grid was seen this is where
we want our element to be placed in
terms of columns then we do the same
thing for rows we say well we want the
element to be positioned at the start of
this line right here number two for the
rows and go all the way down to row
number five this column this row line
right here all right then we end up with
something like this our element is
placed there so let's take a look at how
we can do this in the code all right
then so in my index file now I still
have this div with an ID of content
which is going to serve as our grid
wrapper then instead of nine elements
inside I have six now and each one has a
class one two three four five and six
this is so we can star them separately
from one another okay so the first thing
we need to do is define our grid and say
how many columns and how many rows that
we want because at the minute even
though we're displaying is grid this is
displaying as one element stacked on top
of each other we don't have any columns
defined yet so let's define the columns
first of all and to do that I'm going to
use the property grid
- template - columns now I want to have
six columns and I want every single top
column to be the same width so I'm going
to use the repeat function to do it I
want something to repeat 6 times and I
want to repeat 1fr so each column is
going to be one fraction so if I save
this now we can see each of these
elements is lined up inside the column
right that's the default behavior now at
the minute we only have one enroll but
what I want to do is create four rows
right so then I can distribute my
content over these four rows and these
six columns so to do that I'm going to
come underneath
this and say grid - templates
- rows this time I want to repeat four
times because we're gonna have four rows
and I want to use the min/max function
right here because of what each roads
have a minimum height will then give a
maximum height of also if this content
within it so I'm gonna say 150 pixels
comma bottom right so now have our rows
and our columns defined and we can see
that row take on the height of 150
pixels right there cool so now we've
done that we can go about placing our
different elements one through six in
these different areas on the grid
because right now even though we can
only see one row and six columns we
actually have four rows and six columns
so we can place these elements anywhere
within each of these cells if you like
alright so then let's do number one
first of all going to come underneath
these styles and say plus one then
inside I'm gonna use a property called
grid - column - starts now this property
is going to say where do we want to
start this element this div a what
column line do we want to start it up do
we want to start it at column line one
right here or do we want to start at
column line three or pay somewhere well
I just want to start it at column line
one so that is going to start this
element at the first line on the very
edge of the grid over here now I'm going
to use another property grid - column -
end to say where do I want this element
to end at what grid line so it can span
if it wants three columns all the way up
here or two columns or four columns it's
up to you where do we want this element
to end well I'm going to say grid line 3
which is right about here remember one
is on the very left to 3 so I'm going to
use grid line 3 to end this element so
if I save this now we'll take a look
here we can see it starts at line 1 and
it ends at line 3 that's pretty cool
right now I've used two different
properties right here
but I can combine these into one
property if I wish so I'll just come in
this dude out right now and then
underneath instead of writing those two
properties separately I'm just gonna say
grid - column then I can type in two
numbers what is where I want to start
then I do a forward slash then I do with
three and we need that forward slash in
the middle this forward slash means okay
we're done with the starting position
now I want to move on to the end
position so start position forward slash
and position right so this is the same
as writing these two columns out
separately so if we save this now and
viewer over here we can see exactly the
same behavior
it starts at column 1 and it ends at
column line 3 alright so let's go on to
the second element will do class 2 down
here and I'm going to do pretty much the
same thing I'm going to say grid -
column instead of using the two separate
properties we're just going to use grid
- column and I want this to start at
line 3 where the other one ended so
we're gonna start right about here and I
want to end this all the way over at
line 7 which is gonna be the very end
remember we stated we wanted six columns
which means there's six plus one column
lines so it's gonna end right at the
very end over here on the right so if I
save this now we can see that in a
browser we have one over there and two
over here
awesome so now we're placing elements
where we want on this grid really easily
all right so let's move on to the third
one which is this element going to calm
it down here and say class three and
inside I'm gonna do something it's
slightly different first of all I'm
gonna say grid - column is gonna be one
two four so I'm saying right here I want
to start at the very start over here and
go all the way up to the fourth line
which is right about here one two three
four right now if I save this oops not
this save this and view it in a browser
we can see that it takes up these spaces
right here and it goes to line four over
there now what if I want to place this
somewhere else in terms of rows so not
just columns but also rows imagine I
want this to take up not just one
in heights but maybe two rows in height
so down here as well well I can do that
I can use the same kind of technique I
can say grid - row instead of grid
column and say where I want this to
start now I want this to start line to
remember one is at the top then - he's
down here so what exists start here
still but this time I want to take it to
line four
so three is here 4 is here so it's gonna
end up down here so I say grid Row is
gonna be two to four right so it starts
at Row two and ends at row line four so
save that and view in a browser now we
can see it takes up in that space right
here so this is really awesome we're
essentially telling CSS grid exactly
where we want our elements to start and
finish on this grid and it's going to
offer us a lot of flexibility so let's
just finish this up I'm gonna go down
here and say 4 and this time what I'm
gonna say is grid - column and we're
gonna start it off at 4 which is where
the number 3 ended and we're going to
tick all the way to the end which is 7
and for a grid row I'm going to say also
I want to - 4 so the same height so
let's save that and view it and now we
can see this one over here now we just
need a 5 and 6 so we'll do number 5
first of all I'm gonna say grid - column
is gonna go this time not from one so we
don't want to start it over here this
time I want to start it from somewhere
over here right and we could do that we
don't have to do it in order it doesn't
have to start at the left we can start
it over here if we want so I'll say I
want this time to start at column line 3
and end at 7 and save that and we can
view that right now it starts here and
ends over here now at the minute this
number 6 is getting pushed on to the
next line down the next row because it
was here originally so this 5 the fact
that it goes to the end means it's
pushed this down to the row below but
what I want to do is actually have this
block right here and we can do that
easily say we want to start this element
at this row line and end it at this row
line all right so let's
this last one number six and inside I'm
going to say grid - Row is gonna be four
right so one two three midway between
this for we want it to start right here
and go down so if I save this now you're
gonna see it start over here which is
awesome it's moved back up even though
it's pushed down on to the next row then
we want to end it over here so we need
to do a grid - column as well so grid -
column is going to be one two three so
save that now we have it started at one
to ending it three alright so there we
go there is how we use these grid lines
and these two properties grid - column
and grid - row to place these elements
right here wherever we want on this grid
that is freaking awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
