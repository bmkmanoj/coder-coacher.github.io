24th nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about route
parameters in Express
okay so we've set up our Express up
right here and we've responded to some
get requests but at the minute we're
just responding to these kind of static
requests you know forward slash contact
/home forward slash about but what if I
wanted some kind of dynamic request for
example say we had a social network site
and one particular route would be
forward slash profile forward slash the
ID of that profile now I wouldn't want
to go and create a method for each ID
and then respond to each ID separately I
want to recognize when someone is
requesting a profile page and then grab
the ID from the URL so I can do
something with it and we can do that by
using route variables or route
parameters so let's go ahead and create
another get method which is going to
respond to a particular request let's
say apt-get and then it's going to be
forward slash profile so we want to view
a profile and then we want to view for
example the ID of the profile so we can
say : and then ID so it might be profile
forward slash one two three okay and
then that ID may correspond to a
particular person in a database so it
could make some kind of database query
and then return that data from the
database and inject it into our HTML and
return that to the user now this is all
a little bit beyond the scope of this
tutorial I'm just showing you these are
out parameters for now but when we
create our own application later I want
to do list then we're going to be doing
something similar to this we're going to
be querying a database by using a ramp
parameter so for now let's just leave it
at that
we'll fire a function which again is
going to take the request object and the
response object
and then we can actually access this
idea that the user input the user
requested on this request object
so what I'm going to do for now is I'm
going to say okay so response dot send
and we're going to send some text back
to the user and I'm going to say you
requested
to see a profile with the ID of then
we're going to concatenate something to
this and it's going to be this ID here
so how do we access it
well we access it on this request object
so let's say request dot and then the
property is params that's going to store
this parameter in it and we just need to
save the parameter name which is dot ID
so if I save this now and put a call on
there like so
okay the app crashed and that's because
I forgot my little comma right here as
well so let's save that again and
finally it's starting node up j/s so now
we can go ahead and open this in a
browser and if we say forward slash
profile forward slash one two three
that's the ID then it says you requested
to see a profile with the ID of one two
three and let's change this now for
three seven whatever and it brings that
back to a so we've we successfully
accessed this variable or this parameter
that we've passed through on our request
by using request dot params pretty cool
that so this could be any name e1 I
could say profile and then the name and
let's I'll put the name instead so if we
save that and come back to the browser
and this time let's say Crystal and it
says you requested to see a profile with
the ID of crystal or rather we should
put with the name of Crystal save that
and refresh and now we get it and the
same for any other person I could say
yoshi or
Ryu and we're going to get back this
parameter that we requested so this is a
really cool way to set up routes when
the route may be dynamic and change but
it's still got this same kind of
structure that all profiles so it's
saying look for when profile is in the
URL then forward slash something then
bring me back that something on the
params and I'm going to do something
with it
maybe query a database and then returns
some data dependent on it so there we go
guys that is route parameters in action
and again we're going to be using these
later on as well this is more a kind of
introduction to them any questions feel
free to leave those down below otherwise
I'm going to see you in a very next
