31st nodejs tutorial and in this video
we are finally going to start creating
our to-do application in nodejs whoo
okay there so first of all I want to
point you in the direction of my github
page and in particular this repository
right here I'll leave the link to it
down below and right here I've uploaded
some basic files for us to get started
with in this application and it's just
one folder a public folder with some
styles in it a JavaScript file and also
a little image of an engine so if you
want to go ahead and download that to
your desktop then open it up in your
text editor we can get started alright
so I've got a head and opened up the
public folder in my text editor
item right here and I'm just going to
walk you through this really quick look
there's an assets folder inside that
then we have this little logo right here
we also have the stars dot CSS file
which is just some really basic styles
which is going to make our to-do
application look a bit better
nothing fancy in here I'm not going to
go through in this tutorial because this
is a nodejs tutorial not a CSS one but
feel free to browse through those and
ask any questions if you need to then
finally we have this to-do list
jas file which is going to handle our
Ajax requests to add a post or delete
items from our to-do application and
we're going to go through this file in
great detail later on for now it's just
enough to know is there and that's what
it's for
okay cool so we have those basic files
and the next thing we want to do is
create our package.json file and install
our dependencies so we know how to do
that it's just NPM in it and then this
is going to throw up a series of
questions which we need to answer about
the application so first of all the name
and file as it is as it is no jazz
playlist then the version that's fine
description a little to-do app entry
point is going to be a pas test commands
that note git repository note key words
don't really have any author me license
fine as it is
is this okay yes it is okay cool so now
we have this package JSON file and we
can install our dependency
and they're going to be tracked in this
file so what packages are we going to
need for this project well first of all
we're going to need Express this is
going to be an Express application so
let's go ahead and install that by
saying NPM and first of all we need to
get down here NPM install Express and
then I'm going to pass through the save
flag so that it saves it as a dependency
in this file right here okay so next we
want to install ejs for our templating
so we'll say npm install ejs and we're
also going to pass through the same flag
so that up here like Express it's going
to be listed as a dependency okay cool
and finally I want to install body
parser because we're going to be making
post requests and we need it to pass the
data in those requests so I'll say NPM
install body
- parser and again I'm going to pass the
same flag so that it is listed as a
dependency right here ok so we are also
going to be using another package called
Mongoose and we're going to be using
that to interact with a know SQL
database in future tutorials but because
we don't need it just yet I'm not going
to install it just yet we'll go through
that later on
so there we go we have our package JSON
file ready we've got our basic files
right there in the next tutorial what I
want to do is start fleshing out this
project and creating our app.js file so
any questions so far
feel free to leave those down below
otherwise guys I'm going to see you in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
