up three tutorial and in this video
we're gonna talk about carousels Wow
alright there's so carousels in
bootstrap are by far one of the most
popular features that people use it for
and it is really cool carousel is one of
those things where you have a banner at
the top and it kind of slides to the
next image so we're gonna make one of
those here and it's dead simple to make
we just need to know a few classes now
I've already gone ahead and commented
out that Jumbotron that we did in an
earlier lesson and I've got three images
here commented out that we're gonna use
in the carousels so I'm gonna make it
right at the top just underneath the
navigation here and the first thing that
we need to do is create a div just
around the whole thing preferably not in
capitals and then give this a class of
carousel and then we also want to give
it an ID because we're going to use the
ID a bit later on and the idea is just
going to be anything you want it's gonna
be unique to this I'm just going to call
it my slider for now so you call it
whatever you want and then with inactive
we need to create another div with a
class of carousel - in it okay and this
is all the inner content within the
carousel so the slides themselves now
each kind of slide within the carousel
is called an item and it's probably best
to contain it within a div with a class
of item you can just use images straight
away but if you want things like
captions and whatnot overlaying it it's
best to put them in a div so what I tend
to do is this I do a div with a class
two item like that and then I put
whatever I want within that slide in
this div so that can be an image or some
text or an image and text for now what
we're gonna do is just place in this
first image right here so I'm going to
copy that I'm going to paste it and then
what I'll do is come down here and I'll
do a new item
div class equals item in fact what I'll
do is I'll just copy and paste this
again because we're gonna have three
slides and I'll paste that down below
alright so in the second item I'm gonna
have this second image right here if the
wizard so we got a ninja and wizard next
I have one the coder at the bottom all
right so then we've got three slides
here right each slide is an item so each
slide has this class of item and then in
it we've got a enemy teach okay now if
we save this now and view in a browser
nothing is going to show and that's
because none of the items here are
active the idea is that bootstrap cycles
through each slide and the active one
will show okay only the active one now
none of these are currently active so
let's go ahead and set the first one to
be active all right there's a ninja dude
and there it is there's a carousel
however this isn't kind of rotating
through the images now we have to do one
more thing for that to work and thing is
to add a data
- ranked attribute and we're going to
set that equal to the carousel when we
save that and refresh this after about
five seconds should stance a cycle
through the images so every few seconds
or so it's gonna show a new image so
there's gund alpha wizard and then
finally hopefully it's gonna show our
programmer there all right cool
so the transitions and what I'd call
modern it's just kind of flicking from
one to the other so we can add another
class to this carousel called slide
which are gonna make the transitions a
little bit more smooth and they're going
to slide from one image to the other and
that looks a bit better all right now
I'm gonna stop this carousel for a
moment because what I want to show you
now you must save that and just refresh
so it doesn't go sliding through what I
want to show you now is how to add a
caption alright so like I said these are
our items each one of these is a slide
right
and the reason that did this is because
not only can we have images in the slide
but we can also have it captured or any
other element leaving one right now to
add a caption we just add a container
with a class equal to carousel - a
caption just like that and then within
this caption I'm just gonna put a h2 and
I'll say something like yo ninjas let's
kick some coding us what a rock-hard
ninja alright so there is our caption
over on the screen right now and we can
kind of style this up as we see fit not
wrong CSS style what's cool is it's got
this little drop shadow so it does stand
out a little bit from the the image so
that's cool now if we add one of these
to each slide just to take a look what
happens all right and then put this back
to carousel and refresh over here now
hopefully it's going to slide through
all of these different items and show
the caption on each one that there we go
so Gandalf
I'll finally our trendy programmer there
all right all right so that's how we
make a simple slider or carousel with
bootstrap now there's one or two more
things I want to show you the first one
is how to add those little Chevron's to
the left and right of the banner that
when you click them it goes to either
the previous or next slide so we can add
those under here you want to come
outside the carousel inner so we'll just
come after that and then we want to just
do a simple anchor tag and within that
we need to give it a class of first of
all rank because this is the direction
it's going in so it's going to appear on
the right of the slide then we'd give it
another class called carousel - control
oops
control okay and we also want to give
this a hate ref attribute and we want to
set this equal to this thing right here
this ID that we added on the slide
before that's why that's important okay
so we're going to put the hash sign
first and then put the ID now we want to
do a data - slide
attribute and set it equal to next this
is going on the right hand side over
here it's gonna be an arrow over there
so that when you click on this is going
to go to the next slide in the stack
okay so that's telling bootstrap right
there that when you click this anchor
tag it's going to go to the next slide
all right so now in between that what I
want to do is actually display the
chevron itself now we're going to use
bootstraps icons to do this and I'm
going to talk about icons in a later
video so don't worry too much about this
right now all I want to do is add a span
class off the with icon and then to say
which kind of icon we want to use deliv
icon
- chevron - right okay and now we're
going to see that chevron appear right
there okay so what we want to do is
exactly the same for the left but
instead of right here we need to put
left and the same under here left and
then finally we want to change this next
to preval print which means previous
obviously and now we get this one over
here and what's cool is when you hover
over these Chevron's you see this little
gradient appears on the left or right
that's pretty neat effect and you can
actually click anywhere in that gradient
to go left or right such as that okay
pretty cool now we can also have a
different kind of navigation on this
slider and is quite common you sometimes
see them at the top here on the bottom
like little circles one circle for each
slide and when you click on one of those
circles it takes you to the
corresponding slide alright so we can
add that up here what we want to do is
an LTAC and then we give this a class
and the class is going to be carousel
indicators indicators like that and then
we need within here we want to add an li
tag for each slide now we have three
slides okay so when I add three Li tags
in each Li tag is going to correspond to
a slide and it's going to have one of
those little circle icons at the bottom
now within each li
we also want to specify a couple of
attributes the first one being data -
target and that is going to be equal to
again this thing right here so we'll
copy that and we need to put a hash or
pound symbol first of all like that so
it knows that it's this slider and then
the the second attribute is going to be
Delta - slide - - and this is where
we're going to say which slide we're
going to slide - when you click on this
alarm now I always do it so that they
kind of match up so this will be the
first one right in fact let's just make
three Li tags because we've got three
images one two three so this one will
correspond to this this one will
correspond to this and this to the
bottom one right now
javascript is going to be controlling
this functionality that when you click
on one of these it slides to whichever
slide it represents and JavaScript is a
zero-based language which means this is
not slide one its slide zero this is
slide one and this is slide 2 so we
don't start at one we start to zero so
when we click on this Li here we're
saying slide to zero okay then - one
event or two just like that so let's
save that and now you can see those
three little icons at the bottom and
when we click on one it kind of
navigates to that slide all right pretty
cool now normally when a slide is active
this icon would be a bit different for
the active slide it would be filled in
or something and we can do that with
bootstrap as well all we need to do is
add a class of active to kind of
initialize that now the first slide here
is the one that's active when the page
loads so I'd guess that this one should
be active as well so let's give this a
class of active and save that and let's
refresh over here and now you can see
that when it starts up this one is
active if we click another that becomes
active etc okay pretty mean so there's
just one more thing I want to show you
now and that's how we can kind of
control some of the functionality of
this slider in JavaScript jQuery dead
simple
so let's come down here to the bottom
where
I have got my function right here I'm
going to just delete this tooltip that
we did in the previous lesson and what
I'm gonna do is use jQuery to say I want
to get the carousel if we can spell it
that is the carousel okay that's what
we're looking for it's gonna return that
element and then we're gonna use one of
bootstraps methods called carousel again
and then within this what we're gonna do
is specify a few options this is an
object in JavaScript we're just using
object notation you don't really need to
know too much about it it's pretty
simple to layout we're just gonna
specify a few options in here so we can
say first of all the interval and this
is the length of time that a slide stays
on the screen before it slides to the
next one so we can say interval I don't
know 1000 and this is in milliseconds
all right so comment go to the next one
and then we'll say pause we'll set this
to false which means that normally when
you hover over the slide it's not going
to move
that's the poet effect okay if we set
this to false it's going to override
that and even if you hover over the
slider it's still going to move to the
next slide after 1000 milliseconds all
right so the party's gonna be false the
wrap is gonna be false
and the wrap my friends is when we get
to the end slide here it's just going to
carry on automatically back to the first
slide and that's the wrap effect if we
set this to false then it's going to say
actually when you get to the last slide
do nothing chill out and don't go back
to the first slide all right
so we're gonna say that's a false and
then finally we can have a keyboard oops
keyboard option and this can be true or
false you know and this can be basically
if it's true then we can use the
keyboard to control the functionality of
this like the arrows okay so we'll leave
it there we don't need to come around
the last one to save that and let's
refresh now the slides move a lot
quicker stupidly quick in fact but when
it gets to the last one
it doesn't move anymore okay and also I
can use the keyboards to control this so
that's it for this tutorial if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
drop those down below otherwise guys
I'll see you in the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
