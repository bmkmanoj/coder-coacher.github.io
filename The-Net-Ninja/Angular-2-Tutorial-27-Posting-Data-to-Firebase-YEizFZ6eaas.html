27th angular2 tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can post
data to firebase okay so in the last
tutorial we created this method which
connected to firebase using the 5/8 API
and it listened for a child added event
to retrieve data from the database and
that loaded in the ninjas into our
application like that now in this
tutorial what I want to do is give the
user the opportunity to add new ninjas
by tapping and entering and the bell
color and then adding it to this
application to this list now to do that
we're going to need to form a post
request to firebase so we're going to
use the firebase API to do that as well
but first of all we need to create a
form where they can add a new ninja now
you might notice as well that this looks
a little bit ugly here at the minute so
what I want to do first of all is just
dead quickly paste in a couple of rules
into the directory CSS file so I'm just
going to paste these in right here and
if you want to pause and add those in
yourself you can do it's literally just
two rules which are targeting these
things here to take away the dots and
the padding etc so let's just take a
look at this updated and that looks a
little bit better okay cool
so let's now add that form so users can
add new ninjas to this directory so to
do that we need to go in a directory
view this HTML file and we're going to
add this form just at the bottom
underneath this URL now I'm going to
also take out this button because we
don't need that anymore and I'm going to
create the for page so for not in
capitals then I'm going to give this an
ID and I'm going to set this equal to
add ninja like so okay cool then inside
this file we want a couple of input
fields we want an input field for the
name of the ninja so I'll say type
equals text like so and we also want an
input field for
the belt color so what I'm going to do
is attach a model to each one of these
so we can get that data and transfer it
into the component class and post it so
we know how to do that it's a square
bracket then a normal parenthesis and
then it's ng-model
and then we set that equal to some kind
of model some name now I'm going to
store this in a property called name and
I'm going to do the same kind of thing
for this one down here and this is going
to be called belt okay cool so we've got
our to import for yours now next I want
to add a button which they click to add
this new ninja so I'll say pops it and
inside this button will add the text add
ninja and then I'm going to give this a
click event some event binding right
here which we've also seen so I'm going
to set this equal to a function which is
going to be defined on our directory
component in a minute and this function
is going to be called FB post data and
it's going to take two things it's going
to take the name and the belt so I'm
going to pass those both through name
and belt cool so if I save this now and
head over to our component we can add
this method right here FB post data so
let's go down here and call this FB post
data and this is going to take those two
parameters the ninja and the belt and
then what we're going to do is connect
to our firebase database again so we'll
say firebase just as we did with the get
request right here firebase dot database
and then the ref again which is just a
forward slash for the root directory and
then this time what we're going to do is
push to this reference right here okay
and what we're going to push is an
object and the name property is going to
be equal to the ninja but I'll change
this to name
so the name is name and the belt is belt
this thing that we pass through as well
okay so now we've pushed that to the
database simple as that that's all we
need to do so if now I view this in a
browser we're going to see down here I'm
just going to refresh and make this a
little bit wider okay so now we can see
those two import fields first one the
name the second one the belt color so
say I want to add a new one I'm going to
call this dude Peter a cool ninja name
and let's give him a green belt if I
click Add ninja now then we see Peter
green belt so what's happening well
we're clicking this is firing this
function because we've attached a click
event to it we're passing through these
two models the name and the belt to that
function so when we fire this function
we can receive them we're connecting to
our firebase database right there are
the routes reference then we're pushing
to this database using the push method
and we're pushing the object right here
which is taking these parameters and
adding them to these two properties now
once we do that it's automatically being
added to this list why it's because of
this thing right here this child added
event listener that we've got going on
so when we push a new ninja to that
database this event listener triggers it
sees that a new child has been added to
our database right here and it fires
this callback function this snapshot
thing right here we get back and it
pushes that new ninja that we just added
to this thing right here okay
so then once it's added there this view
is updated so it looked through the
ninjas and the new one gets output make
sense so that's why we're seeing the ad
straight away and we can do that again
let's add a new one Jenny and pinkey
add ninja and now we get that one cool
so that is how we use the firebase API
to get and also post
to the firebase database that we've got
set up okay cool so like I said there's
tons more to learn about firebase this
is just a couple of methods we can use
to add and read from the database if you
want to take a look through those
documentation pages I'll leave the link
to those down below I am also going to
be doing a full series on firebase in
the future and showing you a lot more
anyway that is about enough for this
angular 2 tutorial series I hope it's
been of some benefit to you I am going
to extend this in the future I'm going
to be adding on some new tutorials to do
with ng module literally as I got half
way through recording mysteries there
are some breaking changes in angular 2
they're released rc5 this is all based
on our c4 and and everything I've taught
you here works with our c5 but there are
new changes particularly to do with ng
module which I am going to be adding on
to this series pretty soon so stay tuned
for those I'm also going to be doing
series on angular forms and angular
animations in the future as well so stay
tuned for those also any questions leave
those down below otherwise I'm going to
see you in the next series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
