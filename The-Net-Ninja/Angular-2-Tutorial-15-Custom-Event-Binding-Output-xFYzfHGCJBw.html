15th angular2 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about the output
decorator and custom event binding okay
so in the last tutorial we passed data
from the route component down the tree
to the home component right here and we
did that using a push term property
binding and the input decorator now what
we want to do is reverse that process
where you want to pass data from the
home component up the tree to its parent
component the root one and we're going
to do that using a custom event binding
this time and also the output decorator
so this is what's going to happen we're
going to place a button on the home
component view a user is going to click
that button and then that is going to
fire off a custom event which we are
going to make up ourselves that event is
going to fire off this listener in the
root component we're going to listen out
for that custom event so that when it's
submitted we could handle it right there
so we're going to pass data via this
custom event from the home to the root
component upwards through the tree
ok cool so where do we need to start to
do this well we're going to start in the
app component view right here this is
the root component view so what we're
going to do is attach our custom events
to this directive right here at home
because we're listening out for a custom
event which is going to be fired by the
home component so the way we normally do
event binding is by doing parentheses
like this and saying like click equals
some kind of function which is defined
on the root component itself the class
now we're not going to do a normal event
binding we're going to do a custom event
binding binding so we want to make up a
custom event which is going to fire this
thing so we'll call this custom event on
Yelp we're going to set that equal to a
yell function right there and then what
we're going to do is pass through the
event information and we do that by
seeing dollar event like so okay cool so
we're press save now and we'll go to the
root component class and what we're
going to do is make that yell function
and it's going to take in that event
information now right here we can call
it whatever we want in the view itself
what we want to do is call it dollar
sign event okay so then we can exit
to all this event information inside
this function we're going to take a look
at that later for now what I'm going to
do is just alert I yell it cool
ok so we've set up everything on this
component we've got this yelled function
when it bere which is going to fire when
this thing happens when this custom
event is emitted within the home
component right so we need to now go to
the home component class right here and
remember in the last tutorial when we
use this input decorator that was
because we wanted to say to angular look
this component is going to grab some
data from somewhere else expect some
data to be input to it now what we're
going to do is the opposite we're going
to output some data we're going to
output some data via a custom event to
the parent component so this time what
we need to do is say at output like so
and to use it we're going to have to
stick it up here in the import statement
so we'll say output and then what we're
going to do is set this equal or rather
give it a name first of all which is on
Yelp and then set this equal to a new
event emitter like so and we're going to
have to import that as well to use it
event emitter and by the way this can
all be in one line because they're all
being imported from the angular core if
they were being imported from somewhere
else we'd separate them out onto a new
line ok cool so the reason we've set
this variable equal to a new event
emitter is because then we can emit
events we can say on yell emit and that
is going to emit our custom on yell
event and then this route component is
going to listen to that custom event
being fired and then it can set it equal
to this function which is then going to
fight it in turn cool so now what we
need to do is save this and head over to
our home component view and create a
button and I'll say hit me and on this
button we're going to attach a normal
click event and when this button is
clicked what we're going to do is fire
yell event okay so let's pass through
the event data through there as well and
I'm going to explain all of this
in a minute but for now I'm just going
to grab this function because when a
user clicks this button it's going to
look for this function on the home
component right here so let's create
this event now this function rather and
pass through the event there same again
we don't need to call it dollar sign
event here all the way in the view
okay so let's save the view and back in
here what we're going to do is say this
to refer to the class itself and then
get the on Yelp and omit that event okay
and we can pass the event through there
as well which is this thing here at the
e so what we're doing here well first of
all in here we've got this button rather
in this one the home view we have this
button which has a click event attached
to it when the user clicks that button
this function right here fires fire yell
event and it passes through the event
information via this event variable so
it's going to look for this function on
the home component class right here
which it finds then it fires that
function it says this done yell which is
this thing right here dot emit and
because ano is set equal to a new event
emitter it has this emits event so we're
emitting this on yell event and remember
this is all happening in the home
component now in the root component view
when the home component failures are
emits this onion event the root
component is listening for e on this app
home directory so when it happens it
fires the yell function on the home
component and passes through that event
data that it receives so in this thing
right here where we have the young event
defined it fires that function with the
event date passer again and does this
little alert right now so let's go here
and press hit me and you'll notice I am
yelling so that's all worked pretty cool
so what is this event information
well let's log some of this to the
console I'll say console dot log and
then eat and I'm going to save that and
come over here get a refresh and I'm
also going to bring up the the console
so that we can see it ok cool
so now we're going to press this hit me
and it's going to do that then it's also
going to fire this thing
down here it's going to log this event
to the console and we can see it's a
mouse event and all these different
properties where it happened on the
screen etc and if you open up this
object you're going to see all these
different properties here that you can
access on this event
ok such as the source element of where
it was kicked there clicked etc so now
we have access to all that information
about the event so essentially what we
have done is passed data from this home
component up to the root component and
handled it there and we've done that via
a custom event binding and the output
decorator I'll see you in the next
