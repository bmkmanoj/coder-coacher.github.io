third big stop for tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about the bootstrap
reboot
alright so the bootstrap reboot gives us
some kind of baseline set of stars to
work from using only element selectors
and it's built on top of normalized
which is going to really help with
element consistency across all different
browsers so it provides us new stars on
things like lists headings paragraphs
all the different elements without using
classes so it's a really kind of basic
clean layer of styles to work from gives
us a good starting point if you like and
you can read more about the reboot on
the docs right here just click on
content and then reboot and it shows you
all the different approaches it uses and
the different styles it uses for
headings lists pre formatted text tables
etc so really kind of strips out a lot
of the browser inconsistencies and
unifies them into one really nice clean
baseline style so what I want to do now
is show you a quick example by creating
a few different elements so I'm going to
head to Adam and this is where we left
off in the last tutorial so this is our
starter kind of file and I just want to
pop some content in here now so the
first thing I'm going to do is a h1 and
we'll call this hello world and then
what do h2 underneath that source I hate
to and this is 2 h2 and then what we'll
do is we'll do a paragraph tag and I've
just a copied already some lorem ipsum
so I'm going to paste that right in
there for our paragraphs going to come
back to the start then give a cont there
we go alright and then underneath that
let's do a ul and then some Li tags
within it so we'll say potatoes onions
and chicken
sounds like an amazing tea alright so
there's a ul and I finally let's just do
a form as well so we'll click form and
then what they were label inside the
form and this should say text field
because that's what we're going to do
next then we'll do a input type in cost
fax and we'll give it a placeholder as
well like holder is equal to let's just
say placeholder like so close that off
and then after build up on these dudes
so let's get rid of one of them finally
we'll do input type equals submit so
this is going to be our button at the
bottom with a value equal to clicks me
all right then so now we've got some
basic HTML elements on the page so let's
save this now and let's check it out in
this browser so let's go over here and
here and now you can see what this looks
like with the base styles included so
just to show you what look like before
let me take off this thing right here
let me comment out this like so this is
the bootstrap CSS so we're going to take
a look at what it looks like before we
apply that you can see it's a different
font family this is Times New Roman and
things look a little different so if I
take this back out now you're going to
see it just kind of cleaned it up a
little bit makes it look a little nicer
removes a lot of the margins etc gives
it a nicer cleaner font family gives
these things a little more padding and
also I just want to show you this in
Firefox just to compare and you can see
they look pretty similar they have a
very similar style so we've got no
browser really inconsistencies between
these two now so that's what the reboot
does for us it gives us a really nice
baseline to work on so in the next video
what we're going to do is move on now to
bootstrap containers and also explore
the breakpoints so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
