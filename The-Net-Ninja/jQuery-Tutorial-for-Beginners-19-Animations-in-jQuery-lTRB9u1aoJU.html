jQuery for beginners lesson 19 and today
I want to talk about jQuery animation
Wow horrid ngang so unless you've been
living in a box for about the last 10
years or something then you'll have
noticed that a lot of web applications
have a lot of effects and animations
gone up right whether it's an image
slider or gallery by something fades in
and out there's tons of them now jQuery
gives us a lot of neat tools to slick up
our websites and build our very own
animations which is really cool now
there's a few things I want to show you
over the next few videos so they're
going to make your life a hell of a lot
easier when it comes to animating things
but to begin with I want to start with
the built-in low-level animate method
alright now this is very much like the
CSS method that we've seen in a previous
tutorial and it can pass through either
one or numerous CSS properties that we
wish to animate but it differs in that
we can pass through additional
parameters to the animate method in
order to customize our animations a
little bit more alright
so we're going to do a little example
right now you can see I've already set
up my document ready function so when
the documents ready is going to fire
this thing right here which is grabbing
the h2 right here and binding a click
event to it so that when this is clicked
this function is going to fire up and
then within this function we're going to
animate some properties but the first
thing we're gonna do is just show you
that CSS method again just to go through
the similarities of these two methods
all right then so let's grab the disc
keyword which refers to the h2 when this
is clicked and wrap it in the jQuery
wrap it like that
so that we get access to those jQuery
methods right so now we can use dot CSS
and Dom animate so CSS first we pass
through that object remember and then
we're going to specify some properties
to change first one being the width I'm
going to set that to around 500 pixels
and then secondly I'm gonna pass through
the height one and I'm going to say that
to be about one of your pixels alright
oops
so let's semicolon that up and save
refresh now when I click pop this
changes right according to what we've
passed in here
now guys this is the technical part we
change the CSS Tex right there she
commanding the heat hockey poof I'm like
magic this will now animate let's
refresh and click tada
pretty cool yeah and I think you'll
agree when you've got interactivity on
your website a lot of the time this
animate function is a bit better than
that pop off the CSS function right not
always the case and don't overdo it but
a lot of the times animations look
pretty cool so that is the animating
method guys pretty much the same as the
CSS method just that we have to change
this to enemy now we can't animate every
property we can only animate properties
that have a numerical value for example
width 500 height 500 we could change the
top left bottom right properties to
whatever we want because they're numeric
but we couldn't change the font family
or the color right because they're not
numeric so anything with a numeric value
we can animate now I did say there were
additional parameters right and there
are the first additional parameter we
can pass through comes after this
objects let's do a comma and pass
through the next parameter now this is
the speed of the animation how long it
takes for it to complete by default is
400 and this is millisecond so that's
not point four seconds right but we can
change it I'll change this now to 40 and
this is gonna be super quick so keep
your eyes peeled guys ready there we go
it's almost like the pop of the CSS
method really quick or we could change
this to 4,000 and this is gonna be like
a snail really really really slow that's
gonna look pretty crappy if you put that
on your website but hey guys it's your
choice if you want 4,000 you do 4,000
I'm going to change this to 1,000 for
the rest of this tutorial
that's a nice speed I think yeah alright
so that is the second parameter we can
pass to the animate method the third
parameter is the easing parameter and
this can be one of two values either
swing or linear now swing is the default
value and basically this means that at
the start of the animation it's a little
slower in
middle it picks up some momentum and
starts to swing a little bit quicker and
then towards the end the animation slows
down again much like a swing on a park
yeah
that is the default value of this
parameter if we don't pass anything
through now we can change it if we want
to linear and I'll show you what that
looks like
I'll click here and the change is very
sort of guys but you do notice if you
look carefully the linear one is a
linear motion from start to end it
doesn't speed up it doesn't slow down I
prefer the swing parameter because it
looks a little bit more natural yeah to
me but it's your choice all right so
what is the fourth property we pass
through well that is a callback function
and I've talked about callback functions
in previous tutorials a callback
function is a function of fires when
something is complete alright so when
this anime is this animation is complete
after 1000 milliseconds we can specify
here a function to fire after it is
finished yeah so I could do something
like this I could say alert animation
animation animation complete all right
so let's save that and save if I click
there we can animate and then pop there
we go we get the alert now I think guys
you'll agree that this looks a little
bit messy right and I don't like right
things messy so what I would recommend
if you have a callback function is to
take that function let's pop it out over
there get rid of that comment and
specify the function up here somewhere
like this we need to give it a name as
well when we're declaring it so let's
just put function complete that's the
name of the function then here we can
say complete and that's going to call
that function right here it just looks a
little neater right so let's save it and
test it click over here and boom we
still get that alert at the end now this
is a pretty crappy example guys don't be
putting alerts at the end of your
animations or your websites and that's
really amateur I just want to
demonstrate what we can do here
a better example would be if you had say
an online shop and you've got loads of
products on this page right if someone
clicks by on one of those products then
a little miniature version of that
product like a little image zooms up to
the cart at the top right knee little
basket icon and then once the animation
is finished you can display a message on
the website saying item and it's a
basket that would be a more logical
thing to do rather than alone at the end
of a h2 expanding I mean don't do this
on your website guys this is a really
pretty exact but what I will do in
future tutorials is a couple of examples
like an image fader or something like
that so do not despair I am gonna show
you how to do a couple of cool things
with this animate function all right
so until then if you have any questions
for your free to drop a comment down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
subscribe share and like
and I'm gonna see you in the next
tutorial where we look and a few other
animation things we can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
