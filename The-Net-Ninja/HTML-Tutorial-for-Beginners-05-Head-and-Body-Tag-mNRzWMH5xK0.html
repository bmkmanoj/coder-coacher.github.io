ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 5
the head in the body so in the last
lesson what did we do we started our
first HTML web page and it was pretty
simple to be fair but we've got the head
in there and we got the body in there so
in this lesson I just want to kind of
hone in on those two tags make sure you
completely understand them before we
start to put out this website even more
so just to recap quickly mm-hmm in the
last lesson we said that the head side
contains all the extra information about
our web page so this can be things like
metadata CSS references jasmit
references so while this is data that
you want to tell the browser lock this
is some extra information about the web
page but you don't want to show it to
the user all that in the head the body
tag contains all the visual content
everything that you want to show to the
user you put in the body tag headings
images paragraphs whatever else you've
got so I'm gonna jump back over to
brackets now and I'll see you there and
Here I am back in brackets and we're
pretty much where we left off last time
we've got our HTML tag head tag and body
tag and we're going to start with the
head now last time we popped in this
meta character set utf-8 tag and I
briefly said that this was basically
telling the browser hey we're using the
utf-8 character encoding for this
website and not in AB set at the time
that's what you're going to be using in
probably even more unless you're going
to be making a website for a Russian
person you know something with Russian
characters in or Japanese characters or
something like that
you're going to use utf-8 so that's
going to be one of those things that you
just put in head every time the next
thing we did was the title tag and I've
decided we're gonna sell fish online so
I'm gonna change this to mr. greens fish
Emporium alright in fact we'll call it
mr. greens medication for him why not
okay so the meta tags now I said last
lesson or maybe one before that that
there's various different types of meta
tags we can use a few of them to tell
the browser and crawlers crawlers are
things that come from search engines to
see what our website's about we can use
them
to tell those different things about the
website make associations with it one
such thing is the keywords meta tag now
the keywords meta tag ain't used as much
these days as it was in the olden times
what it used to do was provide kind of
keywords for Google or other search
engines to use so that if you search for
these keywords it your website might
show up in results for them now it's not
used as much these days people used to
abuse them used to stuff loads of
different keywords in there so they
drank kindly for different terms Google
and other search engines cotton Don and
it's not as important anymore but it's
still nice to make that Association and
it can't hurt certainly so we'll do it
in this example and this is just a meta
tag we give it the attribute name
remember these are all attributes these
little things that we're giving it and
the name is going to be keywords and we
put the keywords himself in the content
attribute and we'll say fish smell it
whisper something smelly fish trout
salmon why not mr. shark okay so there's
our meta keywords tag will do another
meta tag and this is going to be a
description one it's called the
description meta tag and like the
keywords on this is you pie search
engines if you search for a term in
Google you'll see sometimes a lot of the
links come up and then little
descriptions underneath them little text
nip it's this a lot of the time is where
they come from so you want to give a
good brief description of your website
something that's going to attract users
to click the link so we'll say we sell
the smelliest
fish online guaranteed who the hell is
not gonna want to come to this website
so we've got our meta tags now and we've
got our title tag so what's next
we'll do our CSS link now I'm not going
to go into too much detail about this
all you need to know for now is that we
put our CSS links or references in the
head that's where we tell the browser
where our CSS file is located
and when the browser sees this CSS
reference is going to say right I'll go
to the location this user or this
developer has specified
I'll get this CSS file and I'll use this
to style the web page so just remember
that much for now you don't have to
remember too much about it so this is a
link tag and we do link rel which stands
for relationships on to the relationship
of this link tag to the document is a
stylesheet and type another attribute
well it's going to be text slash CSS and
that's just the type of the document and
then we do our H reference and hate's
ref by the way it stands for Hyper
reference
I think quote me if I'm wrong and that's
just referring to the location of the
CSS file so where is the CSS file stored
now I'm going to make a folder called
CSS and then I'll do a file called name
dot CSS and we're now going to make this
main CSS file now in a future course
what I'll do is take this finished
website that we do on this course and
create a CSS file this is just to
illustrate to you how we pop a CSS link
or reference in the head and that's all
there is to it so the browser's seen
this it's saying ok so we've got a link
tag here the relationship to this HTML
document is a style sheet so I know it's
a style sheet it's have typed text and
CSS and this is its location so I can go
out and find that now and I will apply
all those Styles in that main dot CSS to
this document ok so that's pretty much
about your your head tag we can also
pour script with references in there
JavaScript but we're going to do that in
a later course similar to this I mean
it's a different type of tag is a script
tag but it's a similar kind of method of
referring to a location so your head tag
contains all the extra information you
want to say to a browser look this is
what the web page is about here's some
extra bits and bobs doesn't show
anything to the to the user now and the
body
the body tag is everything you want to
show to the user all right and you can
put any tag that you want to in here to
be honest we don't really need to put
any other tags in here I mean I've
already demonstrated that we can put a
heading tag in we can put a P tag in and
we're going to kind of flesh this out as
we go along so that's all there is to
know to be honest anything you want to
show the user images text whatever you
put in the body tag this is going to be
the visual aspect of our website all
right so that's pretty much it just a
quick overview again of the head and the
body in the next lesson we're gonna
start to flesh out the body even more
and actually build on creating our
website I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
