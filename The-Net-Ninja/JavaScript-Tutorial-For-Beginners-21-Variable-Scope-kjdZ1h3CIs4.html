JavaScript for beginners in Lesson 21
and in this video we're going to take a
look at the variable scope Wow
all right so in JavaScript and other
programming languages in general there's
this concept called variable scope and
essentially variable scope determines
where in the code a variable is visible
and which part of the code can use it
now there's two types of scope and they
are local and global so a global
variable has global scope and that would
be declared outside of any kind of
function at the top level of your
javascript file much like this one here
this variable have defined called foo
giving it a value of 20 that is a global
variable and that means that I can use
it anywhere in the code I can call that
variable wherever I want and I'll get
that value now a local variable is a
variable which is defined inside of a
function much like this one here I've
got a function called my function and
I've declared a variable called bear in
it and assigned it the value of 10 that
is a local variable and this means my
friends that it can only be used within
this function it cannot be called later
on outside of the function if I call bar
I'll get an error because it's defined
in here that is a local variable or
rather than guys so I've got the code up
from the last lesson here and if you
remember we just made a simple function
called get average we passed that
function to variables then we worked out
the average of these variables we logged
them to the console and then we returned
that variable down here where we called
the function and we assigned this
variable here the result okay then we
logged that result here to the console
so this right here is declared outside
of the function is it not so that makes
it a global variable with global scope
that means it can be used anywhere in
the code divide functions down here I
could use it within nose or outside of
functions down here I could use it there
as well I can call this wherever I want
now this one up here this variable we've
called average that was declared within
this function which means it's
a local variable now I can only use
local variables within this function and
I have done have used it here I've
called average to log it to the console
and I've returned it here I've given a
value back down here so that is a local
variable now let us try and log let's
say console dot log this variable
average outside of the function see what
happens have saved that and I'll refresh
over here and we get this error uncut
reference error average is not defined
okay so that means there that this
variable is telling me that it's not
been defined and it has been defined up
here but that is within a function
outside of the function it's not been
defined remember a variable that's
declared within a function is local
therefore has local scope meaning it can
only be referenced within this function
okay so let's get rid of that and I'm
going to demonstrate that we can use
this anywhere I'm going to make a
function here I'm going to call it log
result and then we'll if it's function
what I'm going to do is just copy or cut
this I'm going to paste it down here
the average is my result and then what
I'm going to do is call log results like
this okay so what i'm doing here is
first of all i'm calling this function
i'm passing these two variables into the
function it's going to work out the
average for me and it's going to return
that value here so my result is now
going to equal the average of that then
what I'm doing is calling this log
result function which is here and inside
that function I'm going to log this
message to the console which says the
average is and then it's going to use
this variable here even though we're
using it inside a function that should
be fine because this is declared outside
of a function its global has global
scope and can be used anywhere so let's
save that and refresh perfect okay so
this right here this message is this
and just to prove that I'm just going to
put the average I'm going to put another
concatenation I'm going to put inside
the function just so we know it's from
with inside the function that this is
happening there we go so that is it guys
they are local and global variables now
you may be thinking where do we use
these and I would typically say if
you're using a function like this then
you would declare your variables inside
the function itself because you're only
going to use them inside the function
now if you desperately need to use this
outside of the function you could
declare this outside up here
I don't now set it equal to zero or
something and then what we're doing is
declaring this if it's got global scope
we can still use it within the function
so we don't have to declare it again
we'd have to you know define it by using
the VAR keyword we can just call it and
update it by specifying we want the
average variable and then set it equal
to this and this is now a global
variable because we're assigning it here
to zero so that's it guys we have any
questions about anything you've seen
here feel free to comment down below
I'll answer all of those otherwise I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
