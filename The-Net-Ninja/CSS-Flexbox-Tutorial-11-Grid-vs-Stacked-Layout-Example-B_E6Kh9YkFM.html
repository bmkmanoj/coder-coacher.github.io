CSS flexbox tutorial and in this video
we're going to go through our third
example and we're going to try and
create a grid unstacked layout using CSS
flexbox ah okay then guys so I've gone
ahead and opened up this example 3
folder and in it I selected this grid
versus static HTML file which is over
here we've also linked up to that
stylesheet in the head which is there
we're going to go through that in a
second and I've also put a script tag up
a link into the jQuery city and because
we're going to use a little bit of
jQuery later on when we add in some
functionality so all this top part is
pretty much the same as the previous
example we've still got that nav with
the social Navi in it as well and we
start all that up in the Styles dot CSS
but we've also now added this section
down here with an ID of blocks and
within that we've got a series of
article types and in each article tag
we've got a h2 and the paragraph tag
with some lorem ipsum so currently this
looks like this in the browser this is
still styled up as it was before in the
previous example but this looks like a
pile of junk
so that's what we're going to
concentrate in this tutorial so in the
stars dot CSS you're going to find this
comment grid vs. flex base styles that's
where we're just going to apply some
basic CSS styling to it then we're going
to apply our flex styles to make this
into some kind of grid layout okay so
the first thing I want to do is go after
the block section and I want to space it
out a little bit give me some breathing
room so to do that I'll just give it a
margin of 20 pixels all the way around
cool then after that I want to style up
the article tags and the first thing
I'll do is give them a background of
white which is FFF like that then I'll
give them a margin - bottom of 20 pixels
just to spread them out a little bit
like that and then I'm going to give
them a padding of 10 pixels and also
bliss set the box sizing property to
border box like that and all that doors
is basically incorporate this padding
into the overall width okay so if we
have something like this with 100% it's
not 100
cent plus 10 pixels on each side it's
just 100 percent in total and this 10
percent 10 pixels is incorporated into
this width if we didn't have this
property check out the width over here
then add add additional 10 pixels each
side so that's why we add that okay
let's get rid of that which one's your
percent we go moved up now we just want
to go after these h2 tags and style
those a little bit so say article 82 and
then all I want to do is make these
align to the center so text-align:center
then it will say font size is about 20
pixels a little bit smaller then I'm
just going to give them a margin of 10
pixels top and bottom zero left and
right so that is all looking a little
bit better now all right so that's also
how it's going to look on smaller
screens if we just shrink this you can
see it's going to look like that and
that's pretty cool but what we want to
do is make this into a grid layout now
for screens that are over 768 pixels so
we need to start adding in our Flex
properties down here now the first thing
we need to do is make the section right
here a Flex container remember the way
we do that is by giving it a display
type of flex and that way all of these
become Flex items so let's get that
blocks element again and say display
flex like so okay then what I want to do
because this looks rather rubbish at the
minute is go after those articles and
we'll set the Flex
property of these to be 0 bro 1 to
shrink and 32% in width now the reason
this is not 32 percent of the minute is
because we're not set the Flex wrap
they're currently shrinking because this
is set to 1 so let's go up here and say
flex - wrap so that they wrap when they
hit that point of 32% in width right so
now there's three items in each of these
kind of rows and they're all 32 percent
in width if we are dealt together it
gives us
96% which gives us four percent left to
kind of spread these out a little bit
and we're going to spread them out using
the justify content property and set it
to space between which is just going to
apply that space that leftover space in
between those elements all right so now
that is looking pretty nice guys we've
got that kind of griddle a grid layout
we would go after but what I want to do
is hand over control to the user so that
if they want to they can say well
actually I want this to be a stacked
layout by stacked layout I mean the
layout that we get on this version
alright so I want to give them that
option to apply that layout style to
this width right here this width browser
so to do that we need to do a couple of
things first of all let's head back over
into the HTML and we need to add in a
couple of using controls at the top
little links that they click to change
the layout so let's first of all create
a div tag so div and we're going to give
this some style or just a margin of 20
pixels like so and then within that
we're going to do a span attack and this
is going to say a layout and then below
that let's do a couple of eight attacks
so we'll say a pair of equals just a
pound sign and then the class for this
one is going to be stack and let's put
the text stack so they're going to click
that if you want to stack the elements
instead of grid them and then right here
we're going to do another anchor tag and
set that to a pound sign for the H ref
class equals grid so they're going to
click this one if you want to make the
layout into a grid like so so that's all
we need for that then we need to attach
the functionality and to do that we're
going to use jQuery so remember I've got
the jQuery see the end right up there so
we can use jQuery in this page I'm going
to come down to the bottom to do that
I'm going to add in script tag around
about here just before the closing body
and what I'll say is when you click the
the stack and Kotak so a dot stack then
what I want to do
on click is fire this function if I can
smell function correctly okay perfect so
when they click that and detect we're
going to fire this function and what
we're going to do is grab all the
articles source a article dot add class
and we're going to give them a class of
stack all right
I'm going to control that in the CSS
momentarily but then we're going to grab
that copy it and paste it again
this time when they click on the grid
and Kotak then we're going to fire this
function which grabs all the articles
and then removes the class so remove
plus step okay all right so let's head
back over to the styles and what we need
to do is just add in an additional style
for when they have the class of stack so
let's go down here and say article dot
start and this time set the Flex
to be zero one 100% like that I'm going
to save it just going to refresh here
and then when I click stock is going to
stack them when a click grid is going to
make them into a grid pretty cool right
so we've just handed over control of the
layout really easily to users using just
a couple of flex properties that is so
simple but let's now just make this a
little bit slicker and add in some kind
of animation why not so we'll come down
to this article and sage transition and
we're going to target the Flex basis
which is this thing right here that's
changing it's also flex - basis and it's
going to happen over not 0.2 seconds and
it's going to be linear like sir save
that or refresh and check this out let's
go from grid to stuck and it just makes
it a little bit slicker kind of animates
it into place if you like alright so
there we go guys that is our dynamic
layout we've got grid and stepped and
when we go down to mobile sighs it just
stacks as default okay perfect so we
have any questions feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise I'll see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
