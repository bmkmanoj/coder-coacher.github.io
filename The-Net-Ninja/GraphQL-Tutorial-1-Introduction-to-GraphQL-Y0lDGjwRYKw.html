dojo all right then so quite a few
people have been asking me to do a graph
QL series and my friends I am finally
answering the call so in this series
we're going to be going for an absolute
novice to complete black belts in graph
QL both on the server side using node.js
and also will be getting a front and
perspective on the client side using
react too so ideally before you start to
train yourselves in the art of graph QL
and recommend that you have at least a
basic grasp of node.js and possibly even
a familiarity with react to now that is
not essential my friends because I will
walk step-by-step through everything we
do in this playlist both on the server
side and on the client side too but if
you do find yourself scratching your
head then I would recommend you check
out either my node or react series the
links to both of those are gonna be down
builder so what exactly is graph QL
anyway well basically it's a very
powerful query language used to
communicate data between a client the
browser and a server and it allows us to
structure data-driven applications in a
much more flexible and efficient way
than a restful approach would so imagine
that we created some kind of restful api
for a website which displays books and
authors now to retrieve information
about a particular book and display that
information on a web page we would
probably make an AJAX request to an
endpoint which looks something like this
forward slash books then forward slash
the ID and whatever the book we want to
retrieve is now this would bring back
some information presumably about that
book such as the title genre reviews and
the author ID so we could display that
information on the page but then if we
wanted to display author information
about this book as well then typically
what we do is grab this author ID and
then make another request to a different
end points such as forward slash author
x' /id
to get information about that author
such as the name the age biography and a
list of book IDs and they correspond to
the different books that this author has
written okay so already we've made two
requests from this page to show book
information and author information so
this is already getting a little bit
inefficient then imagine we also want to
display information about each or the
book that this author has written now
we've already got a list of book IDs
right here so what we could do I guess
is make subsequent requests to this end
point right here for each different book
now at this point we could be making
three four five or more requests to this
end point just to get information about
each different book so this is when the
chinks in the armor of restful design
starts to show now I want you to
contrast this to a graphic you our query
for the same information which looks
something like this so here we have a
graph QL query this is what they look
like and what we're doing is asking for
a book with a particular ID one two
three then we want the title genre
reviews of that book as well as the
author and from the author we want the
name the bio and the list of books and
from each book we just want the name of
that book so all of this right here is
just one request in graph QL and we're
getting back all of that information and
all of that related nested information
from this one single HTTP request rather
than sending four five six or several
requests to get that information using
restful design now this my friends is
freaking awesome and is one of the many
reasons that I love graph QL so much
that's not all what's more if you don't
want all of this information and you
just want some of that information from
each different thing then you can be
selective as to what you want returned
to you for example we could say we just
want the title of the book the name of
the author and the name of the books
that that author has written and we
don't need to block the return of this
request with all these different
information such as the genre the
reviews the bio that we don't really
want so this is another great thing
about
Kewell and will see all of this in
action as we go along through this
series alright then guys so in this
series what we'll be doing is creating
from scratch a graph QL server using
node J s and we'll be querying that
graph QL server from the front end so to
do that we'll be creating a react app to
run in the browser which is then going
to query that graph QL server and
retrieve information from it so if we
click on a book over here we're gonna
see information about the book the
author and the different books by the
author as well so this is using
graticule behind the scenes to query
that information from the graph QL
server and retrieve it back here
we can also add data by filling out this
form down below so the book name the
genre and the author if we click Add
it's gonna pop it on the screen we could
click on this and we can see information
about that book and all the different
books by that author as well so this is
pretty cool we're adding information and
we're also retrieving information from
the graph QL server
so in essence here what we're doing is
creating a mini full stack application
centered around this whole idea of graph
QL with react on the front end and node
on the back end now before we get
started creating that I just want to
make sure that you have node.js
installed on your computer either of
these versions will do right here and
you can find it at no js' dodd the link
is gonna be down below secondly i'm
using a text editor called atom a lot of
people always ask me which one musing it
is this because it's freaking awesome
and free so download that if you wish I
implore you to do so I'm also going to
be using a tool called CMD R or
Commander I still don't know how to
pronounce this but it is just a console
emulator for Windows you don't have to
use this you can use command line or
whatever console you wish this is the
one I'm using and you can find it at a
commander or CMD a dotnet the link is
also going to be down below now finally
I am as always going to be giving you
access to all of the course files in
this playlist you can find them at this
repo right here graph QL playlists on
github I'll leave the link down below
and if you want to get the
hold for lesson 10 for example you need
to select it from this branch drop-down
go to lesson 10 and you're gonna see a
lesson 10 code appear right here so
there we go my friends that is your will
win introduction to graph you well I
really really hope you enjoy this series
I've really enjoyed creating it and if
you do like the videos please my friends
do not forget to share subscribe and
like and I'm gonna see you in the very
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
