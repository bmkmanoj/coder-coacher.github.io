watching JavaScript for beginners a
lesson 42 and in this video I want to
talk about JavaScript timers all right
then guys so before we jump into any
code whatsoever I just wanted to show
you this quick example of how timers are
used in JavaScript now you see this
banner at the top here and it keeps
changing image every three seconds or so
that is a JavaScript timer in action and
essentially what we're doing is in the
code we're saying hey every three
seconds or so I want to fire a function
which is going to change this image okay
now in this tutorial I'm not going to
create something like this I just want
to strip it down to the bare bones and
show you how to use timers but maybe in
the future I'll do a tutorial series
showing you how to create something like
this so now we know what they use for
let's jump back into the code and start
coding one ourselves alright then so as
you can see I've got this dead simple
HTML page open right here I've got the
Styles linked up in the head then I've
got this div with an ID of message right
here and a couple of paragraphs inside
and then at the bottom I've got this
test J's linked up as well I'll go over
what this is later on but for now I just
want to jump into the style dot CSS and
show you what I've done with this div
with an ID of message I've just given it
some basic styles which is going to make
it red with a border and central and
you'll also notice I've made the opacity
equal to zero which is why you currently
can't see it but when we apply a class
of Show to that ID then is going to give
it an elasticity of 1 which is going to
mean it's going to be visible and that
transition from 0 to 1 is going to be
smooth because I've set up the
transitions right there so it's going to
look like it's fading in when we apply a
class of show to this message ID cool so
I'm going to jump over to test yet and
we're going to start writing this
JavaScript so that after say 3 seconds
when the page loads we can fade in that
message all right then so the first
thing I need to do is store that message
ID in a variable so I'll say var my
message equals document dot get element
by ID and the ID we need is
right awesome next thing I want to do is
creative function which is going to fade
in that message so I'll say function
we'll call this show message and then
within that function
I just want to fade in this message now
the message ID is stored within this
variable so we can just say my message
dot plus name equals show and that's all
we're doing we're giving that message a
class name of show so let's save that
however this won't fire until this is
called and we don't want this to be
called until three seconds after the
page loads so this is where we use a
JavaScript timer now there's a couple of
inbuilt methods in JavaScript they are
set to timeout and set interval now
there you have two different kind of
functionalities the one I'm going to
focus on first of all is set timeout so
all we need to do is write set timeout
and then call that function with the
brackets now within these brackets we
need to pass through two parameters the
first parameter is the function that we
want to call and that is going to be
show message just like that and the
second parameter is after how long do we
want this function to fire and I'm going
to save 3,000 and this is milliseconds
by the way so that is essentially three
seconds so what's going on here guys is
that we're saying look I want to set a
timeout so that after three seconds I
want this function right here is your
message to fire and then this isn't
going to happen which is going to give
the class a show to this element and
then hopefully it's going to fade it all
right so let's refresh over here and
count to three and there we go it fades
in perfect so that there my friends is
set timeout now I said there were two
methods what's the other one the other
one is set interval and that's the type
of method we'd use if we were to create
a image slider like we saw in the
example because it's repeatedly calling
a function every three seconds or so
this here it just calls the function
once set interval calls it many times
all right so let's get rid of this here
want to jump back into the index file
and uncomment this stuff right there we
can get rid of this now I'll just delete
it so this right here is just an empty
div tag with a color with an ID of color
changer and what I want to do with this
is make it so that it's a square block
and it changes color every three seconds
or so right so we'll save that jump into
the style and uncomment some stars that
I made earlier and right here you can
see again just give it some basic styles
so that it's a little square in the
middle it's got a color or background
color of white to begin with and then
I've set up these transitions so that
when we change the color it's like a
smooth transition all right so let's
save that and jump back into the test
file and let's start creating this
functionality now this time the first
thing I need to do is grab that element
in the index file this one right here
call it changer so let's say variable
color changer equals document dot get
element by ID and the ID is color -
changer perfect
so that's stored in a variable now I
want to make another variable called
colors I'm going to set this equal to an
array and within this array I'm going to
set all the colors that I want this
element to cycle through now we've seen
arrays we can pass through strings in
them and that's all I'm going to do I'm
going to pass for you a pass through a
few strings red blue and green and pink
why not okay so that is our array and
then thirdly I want to create a final
variable called counter and I'm going to
set that equal to zero and this here my
friends is going to count which position
we are in in the array so when the block
is red it's going to be in position zero
when the counter scoops to one then
we're going to call this blue and it's
going to change to blue when the count
goes to 2 we're going to call green and
it goes to green because this is
position 0 1 2 3 right okay so that's
what the cow
for next thing we need to do is create
that function which is going to change
the color of this block right so the
function will be called change color and
then within here what we need to do is
access the style properties of this
color changer
so we'll say color changer dot style and
the property one is the background
property because we're going to change
the background color I'm going to set
that equal to colors which is this array
and we're going to call through the
position of the counter whatever
position the counter is at at that time
we're going to call that variable of
that value yeah so a position 0 this is
going to be red a position 1 it's going
to be a blue and whatever position it's
in it's going to call that value all
right
so every time we call this change color
function I want to add one to the
counter so the next time around
it goes from zero to one to two to three
make sense right now last thing we need
to do is use our set interval function
so we just write set interval that's how
it's written in JavaScript and then
within these brackets we pass through
two parameters again first of all is the
function we want to call which is change
color and then second of all is how
often we want to call it again I'm going
to say 3,000 milliseconds sub 3 seconds
so guys what's going on is we're saying
look every 3,000 milliseconds or every 3
seconds call this function change color
all right so let's save that right now
and refresh over here starts off is
white because that's what the CSS does
to it then it changes to red then three
seconds later blue and then hopefully
green yep and then pink perfect but now
it's stuck at pink because the counter
is going up and up and up every time so
it might be four then five and six and
we don't have those positions in the
array the array just runs from zero to
one two three okay so when the counter
gets to three then we need to reset it
back to zero for this to cycle through
make sense right so let's
go up here and create an if statement
within this if statement I want to say
if the counter is greater than or equal
to the colors dot length that's the
length of this array then we want to
reset this counter back to zero source a
counter equals to zero let's save that
now when we click refresh this should
cycle all the way through again so red
then blue hopefully yep green and then
after pink it should hopefully go back
to red yep and do the whole thing again
perfect now there's one more thing I
want to show you and that is how to stop
a timer now just like we have set
timeout and set interval we also have
clear timeout and clear interval and we
use those methods to stop a timer so
what I want to do is make it so that
when you click this the whole thing
stops the timer stops and it doesn't
continue to cycle through the colors so
let's set up that event we'll say color
change it because that's the element
right here that we've stopped there yet
dots on a click and we're going to set
this equal to a function and then within
this function I want to say stop this
interval now to do that I need to store
this interval in a variable so we'll
create a variable right here and we'll
say my time it equals set interval
change color 3000 and what this is doing
oops is just storing this interval in
this variable so that we can use this
variable later on when we want to stop
this interval this is like a controller
for this variable for this interval so
we write the function clear interval and
then within this brackets here we just
say which interval we want to stop and
it's stored in my timer so we'll pass
that through and that is going to clear
this interval sort of that it stops
cycling through the colors so let's also
add a tete
change will say color change whoop is
color changer not change color change
you know teach to your mouth we'll set
that equal to timer stopped so the text
in here shows up when we've clicked it
to say that the timer has stopped
all right let's save that and refresh
and let it cycle through just a couple
of colors and when it gets to blue I'll
click on that and it says time is
stopped and hopefully now it's not going
to carry on yeah perfect
alright guys so that is how we stop a
timer and that is time as well so if you
have any questions about this whatsoever
