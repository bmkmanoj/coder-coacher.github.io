responsive design less than five and in
this video we're going to talk about
media queries Wow okay so I mentioned
media queries in the previous lesson so
I go over them in more depth now
essentially what media queries do is
allow us to create CSS rules based on
various parameters for example the
viewport size or the screen size or the
device type that you're viewing the
website on so the idea is is that we can
arrange our layout to suit a wide
variety of different devices or screen
sizes for example we could create a
media query which targets just mobile
screen sizes and we create a whole set
of CSS rules that are going to target
those screen sizes okay so the way it's
going to look different on mobile
devices the syntax is really easy okay
and what we would generally do is put
media queries in our main style dot CSS
file or whichever CSS file you're using
or you may want to have different CSS
files just for certain media queries or
media types I don't like to do that a
lot to keep everything in one file
together so what we would generally do
in the CSS is first of all declare that
we're using a media query and we do that
by using the @ symbol first of all and
then say media no spaces between those
and then we pass through a keyword which
is a media type to say what kind of
device we're going to be viewing on and
on what type of device these CSS rules
are going to be active on then we use
the keyword and to attach an expression
to it and the expression could be
anything
well not everything but can be a variety
of things it could be things like the
orientation of the device or the width
of the device things like that okay so
got some examples here by the way then
we have our curly braces and all our
styles go in there which you're going to
target this thing right here so for
example we've got two here the first one
I'm declaring the media query right here
then the media type I'm saying this TV
so I want these CSS rules to be viewed
on TVs only TV devices and there's the
keyword I'm attaching this expression to
it I'm saying that it must have a
minimum width of 1200 pixels so I'm
saying that I want to target TVs that
have a minimum width of 12
hundred pixels and for all those devices
that fit into this media query then
apply the styles between here now
there's nothing now at the minute but
generally in the CSS she what would you
what you do is write a load of CSS rules
that are just going to target TVs with
this width okay or with this minimum
width another example I've said media
again to declare our media query then
this time the media type is screened so
any device which has a screen that could
be iPads or desktops or phones whatever
and if you with a screen and we're
attaching this expression to it they
have a maximum width of 800 pixels so
I'm going to write some rules within
these two curly braces which say okay
apply these rules to all screens which
have a maximum width of 800 pixels so if
the screen is bigger than 800 pixels
don't apply these rules if it's 800
pixels or less then you can apply this
rule so I'm targeting smaller devices
kind of like the the iPad range things
like that all right so I just want to
show you these media queries in action
just a quick example and I've got open
here a website template that we made in
another playlist that I've done here on
YouTube and that playlist is PSD to
WordPress where we take a PSD file then
we create this HTML and CSS template and
we turn that into a wordpress theme so
what I'm going to be doing is using this
CSS and HTML template that we created to
demonstrate some different things when
it comes to responsive design and we're
going to make this website responsive
and now I said we were going to make a
website from scratch but I thought just
to teach you the core principles of
responsive design I'm going to use this
one because we've already got some HTML
and CSS ready made up and then right
after this tutorial playlist I'll
probably make another one where I'm
going to make a completely new
responsive website from scratch okay so
for the sake of this course if you want
to follow along you can head over to my
github page where I've uploaded all the
HTML and CSS and images for this
template so you can go to here this
address at the top I'll leave the link
down below in the description so you can
go there and then just click download
zip and it's going to download all the
files for you to view this in your
browser and it's going to look something
like this when you open it
in a text editor this text editor is
brackets you can get it from brackets
i/o so if you want put it up in here
you're going to have access to the index
file the star dot CSS file and all the
images ready-made so we can start making
this responsive okay incidentally if you
want to start this from scratch I'll
leave a link to the PSD to WordPress
tutorial series down there and you can
go through how I make this HTML and CSS
template from scratch otherwise just
follow along from here okay so I just
want to demonstrate these media queries
in action so I'm going to right click
and go to inspect and I'm in google
chrome here by the way and then what I'm
going to do is go to sources that's
going to bring up the style.css file
right here so I can see all that and
what I would typically do is do all of
my desktop Styles at the top like this
okay and then I would cook down here and
when I've done all the desktop styles
we'll make a little comment in the CSS
and I'll say something like the extra
media queries okay and all my media
queries are going to go below here so
the first one I'm going to do I'm going
to say add media that's just to declare
that we're using a media query then I'm
going to say all screen devices that's
the device type and I use the keyword
and and I'll attach an expression to it
and the max width and I'm going to put
700 pixels okay and then what I can do
is start making some CSS rules within
here and those CSS rules are only going
to be targeted towards screens which
have a maximum width of 700 pixels so if
the viewport is bigger than 700 pixels
it's going to ignore these stars that I
place in here if it's 700 pixels or less
and it's been viewed on a screen then
it's going to action them okay so what
are we currently at the minute we're
currently at about 900 pixels here and
if you point you can see this little
ruler at the top so let's just create a
rule let's grab the footer which is this
thing down here and it's quickly gray
but when it gets to 700 pixels
I want the footer background to be red
okay so currently we're at 900 and the
foot of background is if we find the
rule this color right here which is a
deep gray but when it gets to 700 pixels
the viewport right here then I want it
to change to red so let's just zoom this
over to the left a little bit so we
reach 700 pixels and watch the footer do
there we go now it's red so now that it
sees that the viewport is 700 pixels or
less and it is on the screen it's
applying these styles okay anything
within this kind of code block here now
typically we're not going to start
changing to colors of our footers just
for kind of mobile devices or tablets or
things like that we would do more
positional things to make it fit better
and to give more space and make it
easier to scroll around and use on a
mobile okay so we'll do something a
little bit different we'll take that off
you'll notice it jumps back to Grier to
gray now and we'll take it out a little
bit and what I'm going to do is change
it so that these here because as you get
a little bit smaller like this this
start to look a little squashed sorry
and what I want to do is take them and
have two and then another two under them
okay so let's inspect the element and
find out what they are
it's these Li tags right here you can
see they've got these rules apply to
them in the style dot CSS right here so
I'm going to copy that and you can see
currently they've got a width of 23
pixels not 23 pixels 23% so we've got
each one having a 23% width now when it
gets to 700 pixels in width the viewport
I want to change that so I'm going to
paste that rule right there and then I'm
going to set the width equal to 46 I
said which is twice as big okay and now
you can see we have two to a row like
that so all with 700 pixels is four to a
row less than 700 pixels or 700 pixels
or less it's two to a room okay and we
can take this one step further we can
make another media query let's copy that
come down here and this time we'll say
less than 500 or less than 400 and
that's going to target most mobile
devices because most Mobile's have a
width of around 400 pixels or there
abouts and this time what I want to do
is make
the width of each one of these 92% okay
so it's going to be one to each row so
let's have a look let's go to 400 pixels
and then boom there we go so each one of
those now has a width of 92% is taken up
most of the width of the page except for
these little gaps right here so yeah
that is how media queries work and one
more little thing whenever we hit a
media query so right now it's just
applying all these Styles upwards of
here because we're at 800 and something
pixels but when it gets to 700 pixels
and applies that media query we call
this point here at 700 pixels we call
that a breakpoint because that's the
point where the design breaks a little
bit and new designs on new styles are
applied okay and by the way this rule
46% is being applied here because it's
below the rule up here okay remember CSS
stands for cascading style sheets and
that means it runs from top to bottom so
rules that are at the bottom
override rules that are at the top okay
so that's how media queries and
breakpoints work my friends we have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
a comment down below otherwise guys I'll
see you in the next video we're going to
start making this website more
responsive and we're going to dive into
this code and change it up a little bit
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
