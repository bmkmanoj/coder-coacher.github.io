jQuery for beginners a lesson 24 and in
this video we're gonna do a click to
expand animation example Wow
okay then class so I want to show you
one more animation example that we can
do using jQuery Xin bill animation
methods now we're gonna use the slide
toggle method in this tutorial and we're
going to focus on these three l8x right
here now
if we look in the code you can see each
of these three Li tags in the
point-of-sale ID have an image which is
this thing at the top h3 and then a P
tag which is this text down here now
what I want to do is hide these P tags
initially okay so they're not there and
then when you click on one of these Li
tags it expands that P tag and shows it
it slides down to show it yeah now what
we need to do first of all is hide those
by default so what we're going to do is
jump into this style dot CSS file and
we're going to grab our points of sale
ID and then it's the Li tags we want
within that and then the P tags within
those and we're gonna say display not
and I'll save that and I'll refresh over
here now you can see the don't show by
default all right so let's jump back to
the index file zoom that over and we're
gonna make our function down here first
thing to want to do is create a variable
and this is going to be called items and
within this variable I'm going to store
all the different Li tags okay so I'm
going to set that equal to jQuery and
then it's the points of sale li tax okay
so that's gonna grab all of those Li
tags and store them in that jQuery array
okay then now I want to set up a click
event to each one of these Li tags so
what I need to do is say items dots odd
click and then specify function which
will fire when one of these Li tags is
clicked all right now that this right
here this on click is binding the click
event remember to each one of these Li
tags not just one of them but each one
because um
this variable items right here is an
array of all of those jQuery objects for
the Li tags okay so it's binding that
click event to each one now what we want
to happen when each one of those is
clicked is to either show this P tag or
hide this pizza depending on whether
it's showing on not already so what we
need to do is say this and wrap it in
the jQuery wrapper because whatever we
click on at the time is going to refer
to this and we want to wrap it in that
jQuery wrapper so that we have access to
those jQuery methods and then what we
want to say is find and we want to find
the P type within the y li okay because
this when we click it currently refers
to whichever Li tag that we click now we
want to find at this P tag and do some
animation on that so we say dot find
then P ok so we're grabbing that P tag
then we want to say slide toggle and
specify the amount of time it's going to
take 500 milliseconds I'll say and then
that should do it guys so I've saved
that now if i refresh over here and
click on one of these you can see it
slides down that Pete Aguilar click
again it slides back up and that's that
slide toggle method in action all right
so I can do it with each one of these
pretty cool yet alright guys so that is
the slide toggle in action a practical
example of when we'd use this if you
have any questions about it whatsoever
