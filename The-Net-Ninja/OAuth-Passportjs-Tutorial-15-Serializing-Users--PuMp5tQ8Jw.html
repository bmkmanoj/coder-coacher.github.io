15th ooofff tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about how we can
serialize and deserialize users sounds
complex but believe me it is not alright
so we're at this stage right here where
we have our user now from our database
whether that's a new user or an existing
user and we want to tell the browser
look this person is logged in so if the
browser makes another request for
example to see their profile page then
that's fine they can be authenticated
easily and the way we're going to do
that is by taking an identifying piece
of information from their profile from
their record in our database and we're
gonna stuff that into a cookie that
cookie is going to be sent to the
browser so that then when the browser
sends another request for their profile
page for example they're gonna send that
cookie we receive it and we can say hey
I know this cookie that's this user
they're authenticated so we're gonna
start the first bit of that process down
here where we need to take a little bit
of their information from their record
and stuff that into the cooking we don't
need to take all of their record for
example the username their age of the
hard one their hobbies if that was in
their record or beneath is one piece of
identifying information that we can use
from their record does that make sense
now then you might be thinking well
we've got this Google ID right here
let's use that but I don't really want
to use that because not everyone that
signs up to our application is gonna
have a Google ID only people that log in
or sign up with Google are gonna have
that property all the people might have
a Facebook ID or a github ID right so we
can't really use that instead what we're
gonna do is use the ID that MongoDB
created for us remember when we created
a new user MongoDB automatically created
an ID for that user which was different
from this profile ID right so they're
all gonna have that ID every single
person in our database whether they
signed up with Facebook Google or github
so we're going to use that ID from that
record
now then to do this we're going to use a
couple of functions the first one we're
going to use a serialized user this is
the function that is going to take a
piece of information from our record and
then pass it on to stuff in a cooking
right and the other one is deserialize
user which when the cookie comes back to
us on the server when a browser makes a
request for the profile page for example
we're going to receive that ID and we're
going to deserialize it so that we can
grab a user from that ID make sense so
there the two functions we're going to
use so if you like serialize is going to
be kind of here and deserialize is going
to be over here right when the cookie
comes back to us so we're going to
create those two functions first of all
so up here I'm going to create the
serialized user function first of all
and this is stored on passport so I'll
say passports dots serialize and I have
to spell this correctly serialize user
ok so inside here there's a function
that we pass to it and it takes through
a user and the second parameter is the
don't parameter now this we use to say
when we're done right we've grabbed some
information and now we're done so down
here remember we also had done as well
and we're going to come back to this in
a second
so this callback function right here
inside and we need to add on that little
arrow inside what we want to do is take
the user and we want to grab a piece of
identifying information from that user
okay and the way we can do that is by
saying user ID
remember the ID property is created by
MongoDB so don't get this confused with
the Google ID on the profile ID from
Google this is gonna be when we pass
this serialize user function a user this
is going to be that ID associated with
that user on our database created by
MongoDB right so we get that by saying
user dot ID we can just use dot ID not
underscore ID which it looked like in
the database just ID so right now we can
call the done method and we're going to
pass in that ID right there okay now the
first parameter we need to pass through
is null this is the error right so if
there's an error we can pass it through
table I'm pretty certain that if we're
passing along a user right here then
there's not going to be an error because
we have an ID on that user right so all
we're doing now is saying okay we're
calling done right and we're passing
that done method the user ID the ID
associated with that user on our
database so when this is called right
here it's going to pass it off somewhere
else that ID and we're going to stuff
that ID into a cookie does that make
sense right so what we need to do down
here if we have a current user is we
need to say done and basically done
means okay go on to the next stage and
the next stage is going to be
serializing that user alright once we
have the user over here and we're
passing through a user so we already
have the user retrieved from the
database here so we can pass that in
like so and also we pass through an
error if there is one at the first stage
as the first parameter right here now
again I don't think there is going to be
an error I'm pretty certain the wall
base so I'm going to pass through null
as the error now we also need to call
this dual function down here when we
create a new user so I'll call it once
we've saved it to the database I'll say
done
to North for the error and also this
time the new user we've just created so
let me just walk you through this when
we retrieve the profile information from
Google we then come in to this callback
function and we're looking for a user
with that profile ID that Google ID
inside our database if it exists we're
grabbing that user then we're calling
done and we're passing that user through
to the done method right the same down
here if there's not that user we're
creating a new user in the database and
we're calling the done method with that
new user so either way we're calling
done with a use of record our own user
record and a person so when this done
method is called
inside this passport callback what it
does is move on now to this serialized
user method right so we're passing it a
user in the dung function down here
right and then this serialize user
method takes that user and it performs
something some kind of action on it now
we're saying okay well we're done in
here because all we're going to send
onto the next stage is the user ID
that's the bit of information that we
want to jam into a cookie right so
that's all there is to serializing user
we're taking a piece of information and
we're calling dual method and passing
that user info into the dual method the
rights of the next stage after that is
going to be to cram that into a cook it
and send it to the browser so the
browser knows who it is and when it
sends that cookie back we know who it is
right well authenticating them using
that piece of information now when they
come back to us we need to take that ID
and get a user from that ID and that's
what the deserialize user method is all
about so I'm just going to copy this
because I'm super lazy and paste it down
here and this time is called dee dee
realized so quite a de before it and
this time it doesn't take your user it
takes an ID because remember we're only
sending out the ID in the cookie and
when it comes back that cookie we're
just retrieving that ID from the cooking
so we retrieve an ID and now it's our
job in here to get a user from that to
see whose ID is this the cookies come
back with an ID but who does that
I D belong to you what's the user so in
here we're going to say user dots find
by ID right and we can use this method
to find a user based on their user ID as
the ID that MongoDB gives it so we can
passing the ID right there that we
retrieve right here okay then because
this is a asynchronous task it returns a
promise and we can use the dot then
function on it inside we have a callback
function which is going to retrieve that
user so we're looking for this user in
the database it's going to retrieve that
and pass it through to this callback
function right here and inside this
callback function we want to call the
done method so we'll copy it from there
because now we have the user from the
user ID right make sense and we're
passing the user then to the next stage
so dead quickly once again
inside the callback function right here
in passport we're grabbing the current
user or making a new user then calling
done and passing that user through to
serialize user whose job it is to take
that user and grab some information from
it so we can stuff it in a cookie that's
what this is doing so it's grabbing that
user and it's saying done okay I'm gonna
pass you to the next stage and we'll
come to that next stage in a minute then
down here we're saying okay deserialize
user when the cookie comes back to us
from the browser take that ID that's
stored in it and I want to find the user
based on that ID then when I found it
I'm gonna call done and I'm gonna pass
that user on to the next stage as well
alright so we'll cover the next stages
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
