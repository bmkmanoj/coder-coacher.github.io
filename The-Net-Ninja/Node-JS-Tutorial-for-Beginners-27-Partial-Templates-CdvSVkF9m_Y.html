27th nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about partial views
okay then dudes so in the last tutorial
we added to our template using this code
right here so we cycle through our
hobbies and output them to the screen
like so so in this tutorial I want to
talk about partial views so with a
minute we've only got one view this
profile ejs file imagine we had several
one for the profile one for the home
page one for the contact etc now
currently we're just serving up the
contact and home page using these index
files right here whenever using ejs
templates and we do not use the send
file method so imagine I want to make
these into views now then we'd have
three views right and on each of you
we're probably going to have elements
which are similar you know their comment
to each view such as the navigation
presumably we're going to have the same
navigation in each of those three views
so what we could do is we could
hard-code the navigation into each one
of the views or we could make a partial
template for the navigation then we
could include that navigation partial
template in each one of these views so
what's the benefit of that well first of
all we don't have to code it three times
secondly if we make a change to the
navigation we don't have to go into each
one of those individual template files
and we could have ten we could have 20
and we don't have to change each one we
just go into the one partial view which
contains our navigation code change it
there and it's going to update on each
one of the views that we include that
partial view on so let's do that let's
create first of all a partial view for
our navigation so the way I like to do
this is create a partial folder in my
views folder so I'm going to right-click
go to new folder and call this partials
then in here I'm going to create a new
file called nav dots ejs so this is
going to be the partial view for my
navigation so let's just do a now oops
enough element first of all I'm going to
keep this really simple ul and then
inside the UL I'm going to just do a
couple of Li tags
with links you don't need to link
anywhere at the minute we'll call this
one hole then we'll copy this dude and
paste it down below we call this one
contact alright cool so let's save that
and now what we want to do is include
this partial view first of all into our
profile view so how do we do that well
what we need to do is use an include
statement and that include statement
needs to sit in between these ejs tags
we don't need the equal sign here but
that's for outputting the data we just
need these two brackets so let's copy it
up and I'm going to do it just before
the h1 here and a minute 8 include it is
how we include a partial view and then a
path to that partial view now from here
the relative that URL to that is going
to be in the partials folder and then
forward slash now dot UGS and then we
just need to close out our ejs tags as
well
so if we save this now what I'm going to
do is just come down here and type RS
this is going to restart the server for
me just to catch those changes in case
you didn't and I'm going to refresh over
here and now we should see that
navigation at the top home and contact
and yet this does a little great but the
idea here is not to teach your CSS and
style it I'm just showing you no js'
partial views so now we can insert this
partial view on any template we have at
the minute it's just in the profile view
but let's go ahead and create templates
for the index and the contact so new
file in here we'll call this index ejs
and let's just grab all of this junk in
here in the HTML file and dump it in
here for instead of nothing here we're
going to include this thing this partial
template so I'm going to copy that and
I'm going to paste it in the same place
on the index template cool so now we've
got a home view let's do the same for
the contact I've got two views new file
contact dots ejs and again I'm going to
grab everything in the contact HTML file
first of all don't put in here and let's
again grab this include statements in
clewd the navigation right there as well
cool so now we have that partial view
included in each one of these three
views now currently in the app KS when
we request the home page or the contact
we're sending the HTML files yep
we don't want to do that anymore we want
to render these views so first of all we
need to change these things to render
like so that's how we render views just
like the profile one right here and then
secondly we need to pass through the
view name so let's get rid of this jump
right here a pass through the view name
which is index and remember we just need
to write the view name because it knows
automatically to log in to the views
folder okay and the next one is just
going to be profile not profile sorry
contact okay cool
so let's save that and let's come over
here refresh this everything's still
okay with the profile view but if we go
to the home page now then we get the
navigation at the top as well they
starred a little differently just
because of the styles in the head right
here but we still get that HTML injected
using this include statement and also if
we go to the contact page then we get it
as well cool so now if we just make a
change to this one file it's going to
update on all of these three templates
so I'm going to add in the links right
here forward slash for hole four slash
contact for the contact page save that
and I'm just going to restart server to
catch those changes and I'll refresh so
now when I click the home page should
take me home now when I click the
contact page should take me to the
contact page
pretty cool right and again and no this
looks pretty pumps but this is not a
design course this is a no js' course
and I'm just showing that the the
techniques here that we can use to
include partial views into our templates
so any questions feel free to leave
those down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the very next
