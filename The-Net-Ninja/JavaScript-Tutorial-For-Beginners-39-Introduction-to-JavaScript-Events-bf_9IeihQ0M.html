JavaScript for beginners lesson 39 and
in this video I want to introduce you to
JavaScript events around there so far
we've been directly typing JavaScript
into this console right here yeah and
we've been firing that code ourselves by
hitting Enter
when we've written something for example
I'd write some kind of function here
let's just do an alert and for now and
then when I click enter it's going to
fire that code and we get the desired
result right there okay but in reality
when someone views our webpage we want
that code to fire when certain things
happen or when some condition is met and
these things are called events and
there's literally tons of events going
on all of the time when somebody goes
onto your website right for example if I
hover over this logo that's an event if
I click this little icon that's an event
if I click anywhere on the page that's
an event if I scroll down the page and
if then if I hover over that button
that's an event these things are going
on all of the time when somebody views
your page now it's our job as JavaScript
developers to write code that reacts to
whichever of these events that should
trigger some behavior all right for
example I use JavaScript to write this
drop down menu right there so I said in
my code that when this little icon is
clicked right there I want something to
happen so I said in my JavaScript code
when they click this drop down this menu
when they click it again bring up the
menu that is two events happening and
two actions firing as a result of those
events happening I wrote that in the
JavaScript right essentially I wrote a
piece of code or a function that will do
something when a particular event
happens now how do we write these events
well you can write them directly into
your HTML for example I could say
something like in here add an attribute
let's just edit this HTML I could add an
attribute here and say on click that's
the event name equals alert
you clicked me all right and we could do
something like that let's just get out
of here and try it out now we get the
alert you clicked me so we can add
events to elements that way however I
don't like doing that
I think it's messy it clutters up your
HTML I think HTML and JavaScript should
ideally be kept separate where possible
and imagine if you had some kind of
bigger function that you wanted to
happen when this was clicked you're not
going to want to write loads of
JavaScript in your HTML and again if you
have the same event happening on
multiple pages much like this I have
this on every page I want to write it on
every HTML page I just write it once in
my JavaScript code and then load that
code into every page all right so it's
much easier to write these events or to
react to these events in a javascript
file alright so how would we do that
well each element that we get in the Dom
has these event properties and there's
loads of event properties I'm not going
to have time to go through all of them
just going to go through a few here
right but essentially how we do it is
grab an event out sorry not grab an
event grab an element out of this HTML
code right that we want the events
happen to so for example let's just get
rid of this let's edit the HTML we'll
get rid of the event in there and let's
say we want to add some events to this
h2 right here okay the first thing we
need to do is get that h2 element and
store it in a variable all right we know
how to do that we'll create a variable
var and we'll call it title because
document but get element by ID oops
wrong one don't get element by ID and
then the ID is page title and now we
store that in a variable called title
right now this title now has access to
all these event properties and let's say
there's tons we can have click events
and mouse over events load events
literally far too many to do a core
something right what I am going to do is
leave a link down below to a web page
where you can
all those events but for now I'll just
go over a few and I'll say the on click
event in fact if you write on and you're
in Google Chrome developer tools like me
you'll see a list of loads of different
events that we can have here all right
they're all on something generally so
what we'll do is an on click event and
that's saying when someone clicks this
title element I want something to happen
right so how do we write what happens
well we assign this a function right
so we say it's equal to a function like
that and this here is what's known as an
anonymous function because it's not got
a name normally we'd give a function a
name wouldn't where you've seen that
when we've discussed functions in the
passport in this case we don't need a
name because we're just assigning this
function to this on a click event and
you might notice that we've got this
semicolon at the end that's because this
is a statement right here when we
normally declare a function we don't
have this semicolon but because this is
a big statement with the assignment
operator we have to put this at the end
all right then so let's write this
function so I'll say that when this is
clicked on I want to alert you click me
and you can have whatever code you want
in here right
you could have code that swirls this
around zooms it off the page makes it
fade out you can do whatever you want to
do with this element in here and just
keeping it simple all right so now we've
added that event dead simple click enter
and that function has been attached to
this event so when I click on this now
we're going to get this alert I press ok
I can click again get that alert ok cool
we've attached that on click and then to
this element right here and we can
attach all the events too let's do a
title dot onmouseover that's another
event and this is an event which
recognizes when you place your mouse
over the element all right so I'll say
this
was a function and an alert will pop up
again and I'll say you hovered your
mouse over the winky face dirty talk
there all right so let's say this and
let's try it
there we go you hover your mouse over me
okay you hovered your mouse over me okay
click on still there you clicked me
awesome all right then so they are
JavaScript events there is another way
to do this and that involves event
listeners right and it's a method called
add event listener oops
thought was typing that add event
listener just like that and this takes a
few different parameters but for the
sake of this course and playlist I'm not
going to go into this because they still
have a few browser inconsistencies
particularly when we're dealing with
Internet Explorer 8 and below alright so
maybe in the future when I do advanced
JavaScript courses I'll include that in
there but for now I think you'll be fine
with these events right here experiment
with loads of different events try them
out like say you can have a look at them
all in the Google Chrome console by just
writing on after your title and you can
scroll through them and try a few out
all right the guys so they are events if
you have any questions about that
whatsoever feel free to comment down
below answer any of those questions
otherwise guys I'll see you in the next
