and in this video I want to go through
some basic string formatting okay so in
the last tutorial we playing around with
printing out some data to the console
over here and when we did that what we
need is print out the string that we
broke out of the string and we printed
out this variable here so we could see
it in the console and that's why we can
do that but in this tutorial I want to
show you a couple of alternative ways to
do this to print out data to the console
using some kind of string formatting
where we don't have to break out of the
string because in this example we did we
broke out the string right here I do the
color and then placed the variable so
I'm going to show you some different
options now to output variables and data
to the console where we don't have to
break out the string and we can format
that data as well so first thing you're
going to notice that I've created this
lessons folder and this project folder
and I've already placed this area calc
project we did in the last tutorial to
this in at the project folder just to
kind of keep things now to me in this
lessons folder I've created the string
underscore format got py file so that's
what we're going to do all this code for
this lesson in one thing to pay
attention to if we're running this file
over here in the console then ideally
what we want to do is navigate into this
lessons directory over here so I'm just
going to do that first of all I'll say
CD and then lessons so now we can run it
from this folder okay now so I'm just
going to create a couple of variables
first of all and these are going to be
random number sourcing the one equals
and then it could be 3.14 - and I was
going to do PI but I really don't know
it - some of this different decimal
places so I'm just gonna put random
numbers there and then no - I'm going to
set equal to ten points something we'll
just say like two nine zero three nine
and then four eight something like that
okay that'll do so we've got those two
numbers there and now we want to play
around with printing those out through
the console so first of all we'll do the
previous way so this is what we've been
doing in previous tutorials where we can
place a comma after the string and then
output it separately so we do something
like this would say print and then
inside we could open a string first of
all to say nope
one is and then I'll close that string
do a comment and then output the
variable this is how we can output
normally right then I'll have a comment
and I'll add a little bit of string to
it to say and num2 is and then another
comment we're going to output them too
and saying that so now what we're doing
is outputting this drink this variable
then this string and this variable again
and it's all going to be on the same
line so Python it doesn't add a line
break in here and go to the next line it
adds a space whenever he sees this
comment and then a variable is going to
add a space right so that's what it's
doing between each little thing here and
when we print this if we want the
program I'm going to say tighten and
then it's stringed underscore formats py
when we run this file we're going to see
if I just make this a little bit bigger
first of all this is all in the same
time no one is no one this number and
then two is this number cool so
outputting that and that's fine but what
if instead we just want to keep this all
within at one string so we don't want to
have to keep breaking out the string
then adding a variable than breaking up
again it's all a bit disjointed
what if we want to do this a slightly
different way what we can do that so I'm
going to call out this for now and then
I'm going to show you two different ways
we can do this so this is using the
format method right so it's a method
that we can use on a string called
format and I'll show you that now so say
we want to print these things out again
we'll say print and then we'll say
normal one is and then I'll come back to
this in a minute right just going to do
like a double dash for now to say we
want to output something there and I'll
say and normal to is and then another
double - you want to output something
there as well now this trim can take a
method or have a method called dot
format so I'm just using a method on
this string right directly on it called
format so when we use this we can output
different variables into the string so
say we want an output variable there and
a variable there what we can do that and
we do that by using curly brace no tail
so open and close there and then we do
the same thing over here okay so this is
a little bit confusing at first but what
we're going to do is pass variables in
here we're going to pass in num1 and
num2 which are these things here num1
and num2 okay now in these ones we want
output in a 1 and number 2 so the way
this works is by giving these an index
this has an index of 0 this has an index
of 1 so if I want to output this I need
to put a 0 inside this curly brace and
if I want to output this I can put one
inside this calibration and could do it
vice versa for wanting to I have to do
it you know put 1 over here and 0 over
here well that's not correct because
this is actually done to so I'm going to
put a 0 and 1 and then this is going to
output those variables okay so let's
save it and run it again and we see
exactly the same this time so number one
is no 1 and then 2 is numb 2 over here
all right now the cool thing about this
format method is that we can pass in
some formative options to these things
right here so say for example I want to
say well I only want to see 3 digits
here I don't want to see all this big
number I want to click down to size and
I want to see just three digits well the
way we add some formatting on to these
variables is by adding a colon after the
number right here okay or the index and
then we say how we want to format it now
if I want to use the precision
formatting option then it stopped
3 all right and that means basically I
want the precision of this number to be
3 I want only three digits to show so
I'm going to do exactly the same for
each one so call on first of all to say
we're passing through some formatting
options then adopt 3 to say we want the
precision of this number to be three
just three digits to show so when I save
this now and run this again and now we
can see that we get three digits in each
case we get 3.14 that's three and ten
point three and that's three as well
okay you'll notice only got one decimal
point and this has got two decimal
points it's still three digits one a
zero and a 3 3 a 1 and a 4 so that's
what this precision up
does so sayings death we just wanted
three decimal places rather than a
precision of three three numbers well
what we can do is add on an F at the end
of this to say three floating-point
numbers right or basically this means
three decimal points or three members
after the decimal point well if we run
this again now we're going to I didn't
save it let's save it first of all
that's always a good idea I'm going to
clear this as well just to do as a bit
of room okay so now if we run this again
we're going to see each one to three
decimal points so that's another cool
reason to use this format method rather
than this method right here where we
don't have any kind of formatting and
also we're not breaking out of this
drinking we're inputting these variables
in the actual string which is just a
little better as well all right
we're keeping everything together but I
want to show you one more way which is
actually my favorite way of formatting
strings and and it improves on this just
a little bit so I'm going to say down
here another comment using F - strings
so this is what I call an F strings
right
I don't we do is put a little F before
the string to say that we're formatting
that string so again I'm going to do the
same thing and in fact I'm just going to
comment this dude out and down here I'm
going to say print we're going to print
out the same thing I'm going to do a
string first of all we'll say no one is
then a little double - to say we're
going to come back here and it's adding
a variable shortly and normal to is and
then another double - so we're going to
output these two variables here now the
way F strings work it just I put in an F
influence of the string before we open
the string before that little quotation
mark right so now we're saying apply
then this you can be a for Matthew
string and we want to output some kind
of dynamic data in it and format it so
how do we do that well this time i we do
is do curly braces again but this time
we output the variable name here so I
can say no one and that is going to know
to look for this null one variable and
output it in this string and we can only
do this because we place these s in
forms of this drink okay so same we can
note that this is
I'm going to output none too and now
we're out putting these numbers so I
save this role at this again we still
get the same thing without putting these
numbers but to me this is much more
logical to do it this way okay it makes
much more sense to output variables like
this and it simply refers to the
variable name itself rather doing the
index of the variables in this function
which is a little less and readable in
my opinion right so we can also format
it the same way so I could say after
this one : so say we want to through
some formatting options now and what I
want to do is do a dot for to say okay
well I want the Precision's before but
I'm going to place an F after that to
say four decimal places right so I'll do
the same over here so colon dots 4 and
then F so all the formatting options are
the same between this and this but it's
just that this is a little easier on the
eye there's not as many keystrokes is we
don't have to do this whole format
function over here it just looks a bit
nicer as well
so really save that now run this file
one more time and if you see now we're
getting them to four decimal places
right so there we've got my friends this
is how we do some basic string
formatting and we ended up using this
quite frequently as we go through this
