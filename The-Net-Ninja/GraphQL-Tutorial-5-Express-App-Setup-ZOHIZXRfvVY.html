already have node.js installed on your
computer if not going install that first
of all then come back now in the
background I've got at in my text editor
open and I've created this empty folder
called graph QL playlist now there's
nothing in this whatsoever at the minute
but what I have done inside commander
you can use whichever terminal you wish
I've navigated to that folder right here
so the first thing we want to do is
create a folder called server because
we'll keep all of our server-side code
inside that folder so to make a folder
or a directory from the command line I'm
gonna say mkdir and then the name of
that folder so this what we called
server alternatively you can just right
click and create a new folder anyway
that makes this server folder so now
we'll see the into the server folder and
the first thing we want to do is
initialize a node project now to do that
we type NPM in it which is going to ask
us a series of different questions about
this project you can just enter through
most of them and you don't need to
change anything you can if you wish but
there we go now that is going to create
inside this server folder a package.json
file and this is going to keep track of
the different dependencies that we have
for this project so the first thing that
we want to do is create an Express
application and to do that we're going
to need to install the Express up so
let's open up this again and install
that I'm just going to clear out so we
have some room and we'll type in NPM
install Express now depending on the
version of NPM that you have you may
need to type in a flag - - save if you
have a newer version you don't have to
but all the versions you do have to if
you insure then it just type in double -
save and that's going to save this to
our dependencies in package Jason so
once that's installed it's gonna track
it right here we can see Express and
it's also going to create this package
lock JSON file as well don't worry about
that completely normal this is just
another way to track our dependencies so
we also have this node modules folder
where our Express module that we just
installed is living at the minute but
what we want to do now is create a new
file to kick off our Express application
so inside server I'm going to right
click and go to new file and call this
file a pas and then inside here the
first thing we want to do is require
that package we just installed so I'm
going to store this in a constant and
call it Express and set it equal to
require and then Express and again if
you're sitting there scratching your
head thinking you don't know what's
going on at all
then I don't think you're quite ready
for this course and advise you instead
to go and check out my nodejs for a
beginner series the link is down below
anyway for the rest of us
we've required Express now so we can set
up with that up I'm going to store this
in a constant called up and set it equal
to Express which is a function so we'll
invoke that function to create our app
all right cool so the next thing we need
to do is tell our app to listen to a
specific port on our computer so the way
we do that is by saying app don't listen
and then we're going to listen to port
4,000 but it's up to you what you want
this to be then we're going to pass
through a callback function so that when
this occurs when our app begins to
listen to that port this callback
function is going to fire and it's going
to tell us in the console that it's
listening for requests so this callback
function is an es6 function so that's
just parentheses arrow and then curly
braces and inside what we're going to do
is console dot log and then inside now
listening for requests on port 4,000 all
right cool so now we've installed
Express we set up our Express app and
we've told it to listen to a particular
port right here so if I run this up now
then we should see this message logged
to the console so I'm going to go down
to the console over here inside node and
then the name of the file to run it
which is app and we should see that
message now listening for requests on
port 4000 cool so I'm going to press
ctrl C to exit out of that process now
we have our Express app up
running and listening for requests now
just quickly I've installed a package on
my computer called node one now what
node one allows you to do is type
instead of node up type in node Mon up
and now we don't have to keep restarting
the server every time we want to make
changes to the application this command
right here is going to do exactly the
same thing as node app but it's going to
listen for changes or watch for changes
to our files and then when it detects a
change it's going to automatically
restart the server for us so that we
don't have to so it just speeds up our
development so to install that all you
want to do is cancel out this process
and say npm install node 1 and then - g
to install it globally on your computer
and when you've done that you can now
type out no daman and then up on
whatever the name of your file is ok so
there we go
we've created that express up now the
next step is to go ahead and start to
set up our graph QL and we'll do that in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
