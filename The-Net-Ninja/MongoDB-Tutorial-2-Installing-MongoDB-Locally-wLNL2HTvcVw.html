mongodb for beginners tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you how to
download and install MongoDB on your
computer
alright then so the first thing you want
to do is head over to MongoDB comm and
then click this download button in the
top right hand corner this is going to
take you through to the download page
which is automatically going to detect
which operating system you're running
and it's going to suggest a version of
MongoDB to download so check that's
right then click on this download button
once it's downloaded just run through
the installation wizard and keep
everything the same that is going to
successfully install MongoDB on your
computer whoo okay so we've done that
but we need to do one more thing to
start working with MongoDB so currently
you've got it installed on your computer
awesome however MongoDB is not psychic
it does not know where to store the data
on your computer so you need to give it
that folder if you like to store all the
data in so what we want to do is go to
the root level of our C Drive I didn't
mean to open that and then to open this
command prompt this is CMD I by the way
so you want to go to the root level of
your C Drive and then if I say dir to
show you my different directories you're
going to see this data folder or right
here that's not there automatically I
created this folder ok so you're going
to need to do the same thing create this
data folder at the root level of your C
Drive then if I go into the data folder
you're going to notice this other folder
as well if I say dir again you're going
to see this DB folder right there I also
create in that one so you need to do the
same you need to create /data /nostart
Stata ok so you can have to do that
through the command prompt or you can go
into your file explorer go to the C
Drive create the data folder there and
then within it create this DB folder as
well that's all you need to do now Mongo
knows to go into this folder
automatically to store data ok or
retrieve data cool so now we can
actually run MongoDB so how do we run
MongoDB now its installed yeah we've
created somewhere for it to store data
but how do we run Mongo
dB well let's head to the documentation
and see what it says I'm going to go to
this link right here I'm going to leave
this down below because the
documentation is actually pretty good
for MongoDB this is going to show you
how to install and run it on Windows
we've already installed it and this is
how you run it right here by running
this command there's also links for
installing and running on OS X and on
Linux as well so check out those if
you've got a different operating system
dead simple either way we're just going
to copy this so I'm going to copy it oh
by the way one thing getting to watch
out for you see this 3.4 bit in the
middle this is the version number of
MongoDB so if you've installed a
different version like 3.5 or whatever
you need to replace this 3.4 bit with
3.5 ok otherwise it's not going to work
so we've copied that now let's head over
to the command prompt once again I'm
going to paste it in and I'm just going
to hit enter that's it
this is going to run MongoDB for us and
that is a lot of crap right there but
don't worry this is just running MongoDB
in the background and you can see right
there at the bottom it says waiting for
connections on port two seven zero one
seven so call that running now we can
start working with Mongoose in the code
and speak to MongoDB and in every future
lesson I'm going to assume that you've
got this running in the background
otherwise it won't work okay MongoDB how
it always has to be running in the
background for the code to communicate
with MongoDB makes sense it's exit out
of this all you need to do is hit ctrl C
and that stops the process okay cool so
now we have MongoDB running I'm just
going to enter that again so it runs
again we've got MongoDB running on our
computer and it knows where to store the
data one more thing I want to show you
in this tutorial is how to clone the
github repository that I've created for
this playlist you don't have to do this
by the way you can just watch and work
along with the files as is or you can
clone the github repository and have
access to all those different branches
if you want to so to do that I've
created this other tab in commander by
the way to create a new tab just right
click at the bottom and then go to new
console and yet here we go so you can
see I'm already in this directory right
here this is where I want to clone
the MongoDB playlist repository on my
computer so you navigate first of all
where you want to clone it just using CD
and then whatever directory it is you're
going to okay then we need to use git to
clone the repository now at this point
you're going to need get installed on
your computer if you don't have that
what you want to do is head to this
address right here I'll leave the link
down below and just click this button
that's going to install it on your
computer for you all right so do that
first of all then we can clone the
repository so I'll leave the link to the
repository down below as well go to that
just go to clone our download and then
grab that thing right there that's going
to copy this kind of address to the
clipboard then you want to go back to
the command prompt and you want to say
git clone and then paste that dude in
hit enter that's going to go out grab
all those files clone them on your
desktop
alright so it's done now and if I go to
Adam this is the text editor if I go to
new project folder or add project folder
I'm going to look for the repository the
directory that it's installed on my
computer should be called MongoDB there
we go MongoDB playlist I'm going to open
that and you can see in here we have the
end files of the whole thing
alright cool right so we want lesson one
now to do that all we need to do is come
to our command line there and we'll say
git checkout around the first of all we
want to direct into the new directory so
we say CD MongoDB - playlist that's
going to dump us in the actual project
directory right here you can see git
status if you like and that's going to
say which branch you run okay so what
I'll master at the minute then to go to
lesson one I'm going to say git checkout
lesson - one that's going to switch to
lesson 1 and if we go back to the code
now you're going to notice all that
stuff is gone and we've just got a clean
directory to work with ok so now I want
to do one more thing and that is install
Mongoose so that we can just start
writing code in the next tutorial now
what I'm going to do is create a package
JSON file first of all and that puck
JSON file is going to keep track of all
of our dependencies for this project so
let's head to the command line again I'm
going to say NPM in it and then that is
going to ask me a lot of questions if
you want to just skip all those
questions just do this double - yes and
that is going to create that package
JSON file for you with all the default
values if you like okay cool so now you
can see is create that package JSON file
and it looks something like this but
let's check it out in the editor as well
we can see it right there now and there
we go I'm just going to zoom in to all
this codes you're going to be able to
see clearly on your screens so what we
need to do now is install Mongoose
remember Mongoose is that package that
we're going to use to interact with
MongoDB which makes it much more easier
for us so what we need to do is go to
the command line again and then I'm
going to say NPM install Mongoose and
I'm going to do double - save that's
going to save it to our dependencies and
by that I mean it's going to save it to
this file right here as a dependency so
that whoever else uses this card in the
future knows that we need to install
Mongoose to run these projects that
we're going to be created okay okay cool
so once that's installed we can go to
our package JSON file and we can see now
it says dependencies at Mongoose okay so
now that's installed we can start
working with it in the very next
tutorial so don't forget to share
subscribe alight guys and we're going to
see you in that next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
