three tutorial and in this video we're
going to have a look at four loops okay
so the might have a point in your code
when you want to cycle through or loop
through some kind of collection of data
for example you might have a list of
users you want to cycle through those
and you want to do something with each
user in that list such as attach a
property to it or maybe just print it to
the console so we can use loops to
perform this kind of behavior and
there's different types of loops in this
tutorial I'm going to show you a type
called for loops so I've already created
this loop py file in the lessons folder
and the first thing I'm going to do is
create some kind of collection of data
in this case a list so let's give this
list a variable name I'm going to call
this ninja's and we're just going to
store some names in here okay so the
first one it's going to be a right then
crystal then Yoshi and then finally as a
table camp okay cool so now we have our
list right here and there's four
elements in it so if I want to cycle
through on loop through this list and
gain access to each individual element
and then do something with it I'm going
to use a loop to do this so we're going
to do specific like for loop to do this
and the way we do that is by saying fall
and then I'm going to write something
here and then explain it I'm going to
say ninja in ninjas so this is how we
write a for loop and one of the saying
here is 4 and then I'm giving each one
of these a singular name here and
calling each one a ninja because they're
in the ninjas collection right so I can
make this thing go up here I can call
this X if I want but I'm calling it
ninja because it makes sense to me is a
singular of the collection so I'm saying
okay so for each ninja right here in
ninjas so this is the name of the
collection right here but I'm going to
do something ok so if we've had a
collection called I don't know Potts and
would say each popped in pots or
something like that right does that make
sense so this naming convention is just
something I use this has to be pops
because this is the collection recycling
but again this could be anything it
could be teeth whatever you want it to
be either way I'm going to say ninja in
ninjas so then we want to do something
with each ninja I'm going to do a Kohl
on now and now we have to do a code
block and again this has to be indented
so in this code block we can have access
to the individual ninja each time around
so we're going to cycle through this
list and each time around in this code
block were performing some kind of code
for each individual item and each time
around this ninja variable right here is
going to refer to the element that was
cycling through at that moment in time
so I could say something like this
prints and then the ninja so if I save
this now I'm going to run this file so
I'll say Python and then it's called
loops py what it's going to do is cycle
through this list right here and print
each one of the ninjas okay make sense
so as our code gets a bit more
sophisticated we're going to eventually
cut this out and make more code here in
this code block and do more with the
actual ninjas or whatever we're cycling
through but for now that's just a simple
example so I'm going to go on out and do
another quick example I'll comment this
dude out for now and I want to show you
how we can cycle through maybe just a
portion of a specific list so again I'm
going to say for and I'm going to say
ninja in ninjas and we're going to do
exactly the same thing I'm just going to
say print ninjas but this time what if I
only want to cycle through or loop
through a portion of this list well
remember when we looked at slicing lists
we've had that kind of square bracket
notation I can do the same thing down
here we could slice this list ragged so
only cycling through a portion of it so
I could say for example I want to go
from position 1 from index 1 and then up
to index 3 not including index 3 so
that's going to go from here because
remember is 0 based so this is index 1
up to but not including 3 so it's going
to print out crystal and Yoshi 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
let's give this a whirl I'm just going
to run this program again and this time
oops
because I'm printing it ninjas and not
ninja
okay so let's run that again this time
we just get crystal and Yoshi cool so
that's how we just cycle through on loop
through a section of a list using this
slicing here so let me comment that out
again and I'm going to run through one
different example where we're just going
to basically add in some additional
logic so we're not just printing out a
name so for this case what I'm going to
say is for ninja in Ninja so exactly the
same so far
then we'll do a called block then what
I'm going to do inside is I'm going to
check if the ninja at any point in time
when we're cycling through this data is
equal to a specific name so I'm going to
say is ninja is equal to remember that's
the comparison operator
double equals if it's equal to and then
I'm going to say a Yoshi which is in
there the third element if that is the
case then we're going to do something
else and we have another nested code
block in this if statement remember we
learned about if statements in the last
tutorial so this time around what going
to do is print and then I'm going to use
a pharmacy strings of s and now we can
output variables in here so I'm going to
output the ninja first of all which will
ultimately be Yoshi because this only
runs it means equals Yoshi and then what
I'm going to say is - he is a black belt
so we're just letting people know that
you know Yoshi using this list he's a
black belt okay so there's the if
statement very simple and then what I'm
going to do is a little else down here
where if it's not Yoshi if that specific
ninja is not Yoshi we're just going to
print the ninja instead without letting
someone know that this is the black belt
so let's save this again run it and we
should see Ryu crystal Yoshi and then
because this if statement kicked in
because ninja at that moment in time
during that cycle that iteration ninja
equaled Yoshi
then we print this string instead of
just the ninja okay so one more quick
thing I want to show you is a break
keyword so if at any point in time when
you're cycling through your list or
looking through your list you want to
break out of that loop
then you can be using the break keyword
for example if we come across Yoshi at
any point in time I want to print that
out and then break out of the loop so
that we don't carry on and Ken is never
printed out and we can use the break
keyword to do that and simple that's how
you break out the loop and then anything
else in the list or collection is not
going to cycle through this for loop
okay so let's save that and just give it
a whirl so click on loops and now we get
regular crystal if you actually black
belt but not Ken because we broke out
right here when we came across Yoshi all
right so there we go that is for loops
in a nutshell in the next tutorial we're
going to take a look at a different type
of loops called wild loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
