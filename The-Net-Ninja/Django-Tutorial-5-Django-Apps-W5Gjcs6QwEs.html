tutorial and in this video we'll take a
look at django apps alright then so in
the last tutorial what we did was create
this views dot py file inside the root
up directory this django notic directory
and remember Django created this root
app for us when it started the project
and we're going to talk about apps in a
second don't worry about that but inside
this views dot py file what we did was
control what happened when someone came
to a specific URL and then we sent back
a template which was in this templates
directory which was inside the root of
the entire project this Django notic
folder at the top okay now the way we've
done things here by creating this views
file inside here this root app and this
templates folder inside the root of the
project this is generally not the Django
way of doing things we tend to instead
create separate apps or separate
sections of our websites now this is
okay to teach you because I wanted to
show you the basics of how URLs and
views work together without overwhelming
you with apps and things like that but
now we know the basics what I'd like to
do is move on and do things the more
jungle way so create different apps for
different parts of our application so to
better explain what apps are in Django I
created this nifty little diagram which
I'm pretty proud of and it shows the
kind of structure or desired structure
of our jungle project so when we created
a jungle project it created the root
folder right here okay which was Django
gothic and then inside that it also
created another Django nautic folder
which is our first app our main app of
the project right and inside here what
we did we manipulated the URLs we
created URLs in here and we also created
a views file right and we control what
we sent back to the user inside this app
right here now generally when we're
creating a jungle project what we do is
split up our application into separate
mini apps if you like okay so each up
inside the project is going to control a
certain aspect or section of the whole
web application for example we've got a
blog going on here right we want to
create a blog
now it makes sense to me that we have an
articles app which is going to control
the different articles the blog posts if
you like okay and inside this articles
app folder we're going to have a URLs
dot py file much like we did over here
we're also going to have a views file
and we're going to have a templates
folder and these views URLs and
templates are only going to be of this
particular app right same if we want
some kind of user accounts
we're gonna have an accounts app and
that's going to have a URLs file a views
file and a templates folder with
different templates inside it for things
like a login screen a signup screen of
different things to do with accounts
right so we're modularizing our whole
project here into separate little apps
instead of just doing everything inside
this route main jangan optic app like we
did in the last tutorial we don't want
to create and a views file in here and
control what we sent to a user here
right we can still put base URLs in here
and we'll see that as we go through the
tutorial but for the most part what
we're going to do is split up our
project into separate little apps for
different sections of our website make
sense
okay then so now you've got your head
around what ups actually are let's go
ahead and create an app for the article
section of our website so to do this
what you want to do is navigate inside
your terminal to the root project
directory which is the top-level django
gnostic folder here right we want to
create a new app which is going to sit
inside this folder and the way we do
that is by saying - because we're
running a Python file and we're going to
use the manage py file again told you
we'd be using this quite a lot then
we're going to use a command called
start up and then we give this up a name
I'm going to call it articles and
generally we PluralEyes our app names
you don't have to it's just a bit of a
standard so this startup command coming
from manage dot py is going to go ahead
and create a directory inside here
called articles it's going to create
that app fold forwards ok and you can
see it pop up right now and inside here
we have another folder called migrations
and a lot of files
now if the migrations folder will come
to you later I don't want to overwhelm
you with that just yet this in Nick py
is the same as inside here it's just
saying hey this is a module then we have
an admin dot py again we'll come to that
later app stock py later models doc your
wife later don't worry about most of
this for now but we can see at the
bottom that we have a views dot py file
inside this folder already so that's
saying to me look python a rather jangle
wants you to create views inside
individual apps and that's what we're
gonna do and hopefully it's already
imported the render function which we're
going to need to render templates right
the one thing it doesn't have in here is
a urls file so let's create that because
we want to keep our urls files separate
for each individual app so we're
controlling them in different sections
and we don't get overwhelmed by just
putting them all inside this thing right
here okay make sense to kind of
modularize things as you're going along
so let's create a new file and call this
urls dot py and inside here i'm just
going to paste what we have inside this
file for now cross that off paste it in
here because we still need these things
in fact i'll get rid of admin we don't
need that because we're not setting up
an admin URL but we still do need
this URL right here and we do need to
import the views from the current
directory which is this file right here
okay so now we have this urls file we
don't want to set up an about URL inside
the articles out because that's not what
the articles up is for instead what
we'll do is just set up an articles home
page right and we won't call it home
page we'll call it something like
article list or something like that
because the home page of the articles if
you go to something like forward slash
articles on a website you'd expect just
to see a list of articles right so this
is the URL but creating it's gonna be
just forward slash right and we're going
to show this functional rather via this
function wedding user goes to this so
let's save this and go over to our views
file and we need to create a function
called was it article list yes it was
article list so we'll say death article
underscore list
it takes in the request object and in
here what do we want to do well all we
want to really do is render a template
to the user which is going to show a
list of articles right so we know how to
do that we can say return and we're
going to return a render of an article
or of a template rather and the first
parameter is always the request object
and then the second parameter is going
to be the template that we want to
render now we've not created this
template yet where do we want to create
it well I'm not going to create it
inside this route templates folder over
here I'm going to leave this for kind of
global templates that we can use in
every single up right what I'm going to
do instead is create inside this
article's app a new folder called
templates and we're going to keep all of
the templates for this app inside this
folder now typically what we do is
create a new folder inside here and it's
gonna be the same name as the app itself
so articles you can see we have articles
then templates then articles and this is
kind of namespacing the templates for
this app because if we didn't have this
and we had an app called I don't know
home or index inside here and we also
had an app called
more index inside here or another app
then Jango would get confused about
which one to render when you want to
render the homepage or the index right
so what kind of name spacing the
templates for the articles up right here
and inside here we want to create a new
template and I'm going to call this
article underscore list dot HTML alright
and this is going to be a really simple
HTML page will say articles or the title
and then inside here we'll just do a h1
and it will say article list or
something like that okay
so let's save that now we have this
template stored in this folder right
here what we want to do is render that
template when this function is fired
article list makes sense so let's pass
through that template now I said that we
namespace things this is where it comes
in handy so it's not just the article
underscore list dot HTML thing we want
to render we want to render articles
forward slash article list
so this articles refers to this folder
right here then article list and that
makes sense right so we're rendering
this HTML template when this is fired
right here now the next thing we need to
do and we should have done this earlier
is that whenever we create a new app
over here we have to actually register
that up inside the project right
otherwise it's not going to work so the
way we do that is by going to the
settings dot py file and if you go down
here you can see installed apps now
Django comes with some apps already
installed even though we can't see them
over here and one of them is for the
admin section authentication sessions
etc right these are all things that are
helping you out all a visit a couple of
them later on but we've just created an
articles app so we need to register that
inside this settings file so Django
knows about it and all we need to do is
call articles like so all right so now
this is registered inside the entire
project
Django knows about it so this app will
work so let's just review what we've
done it
we've created this article's app and
inside we have the URLs file and this is
saying okay when someone goes to the
root URL because you're not specified
something here fire this function
article list which is then rendering
this template right here which we just
created inside hit now if we run this
now do you think it's going to work and
they ask you that question because
inside the URLs we have this URL setup
for the articles but we also have the
same URL setup or the home page so which
one is going to take precedence right
well if we run the server or find out so
I'll say Python managed dot py run
server so this is going to spin up a
local server for us so that we can visit
this in a browser and if I go to
localhost colon 8080 so how do we
actually get the articles did we go to
forward slash articles
well no that's not going to work we get
a 404 error so what's going on here how
do we actually view this thing right
here okay
how do we get to it well what we have to
do is register the article URLs
inside the main URLs folder or file
rather inside this root app okay so it's
dead simple to do we need to create a
URL here which is going to include the
URLs from this file does that make sense
so this is dead simple to do all we need
to do is import I'm gonna put a comma
there a function called include right
and this is going to be used to include
URLs from other URL files so I'm going
to place these underneath admin and
we'll create a URL and inside first of
all there's going to be a raw string
that's the first parameter and this is
going to be caret which means starts
with then it's going to be articles then
forward slash we're not going to put a
dollar sign on the end because we want
other things to come after this later on
such as odd slash articles
oh it's slash then the name of an
article or an idea of an article right
and what we're going to do is whenever
someone goes to forward slash articles
we're going to include which is this
thing we just imported the arty earthy
URLs or the articles app so we type in
here as a string articles which is the
app name dot URLs so Django knows now to
look for these URLs inside the articles
up and include them so whenever someone
goes to forward slash articles then it's
going to look at these things right here
and then place whatever in here after
that forward slash articles so for
example if I created another one here
which was I don't know about right does
it make sense but then when we went to
forward slash articles forward slash
about then it would fire this thing
right here does that make sense
so forward slash articles now will come
before every single URL we place in here
so we've registered those URLs if you
like or we've included them in the main
URL file all right so if we save this
now fingers crossed this should work if
I go to forward slash articles then we
should get the articles template and we
don't because our server is not running
some invalid syntax and that is probably
let's just have a look over here because
I've forgotten a comma yep it is so save
that and hopefully now my friends this
will work
four slash articles voila we get the
article listener so I know this might be
a lot to take in when you first start
out but that's simply what we've done is
created a new app we've registered some
URLs inside this app and some views and
templates then what we've done is we've
registered that app inside the settings
folder or file first of all down here to
make sure that everything works in
Django and Django knows about the app
once we did that we included the app
URLs which are these things inside the
main URLs right here so that when
someone goes to four slash articles then
we include the article URLs okay so
whatever comes after forward slash
articles is registered here then we just
hook it up the same way as normal we
hook it up to some kind of view function
and that's going to send back a template
which is stored inside the app itself
and again Django knows to look inside
the templates folder because in one of
the first lessons we said in a settings
file down here that the templates
directory is going to be templates so it
knows to look inside each app to look
for that template folder okay so there
we go that is jungle apps in a nutshell
and we're going to learn more as we go
along so don't feel like you have to
know everything about apps just now
we're going to be making more apps as we
go along and working with these
different URLs and fuse to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
