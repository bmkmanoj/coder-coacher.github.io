your 15th of UGS tutorial and in this
video I want to give you a quick
introduction to components ok then so
this lesson is going to serve as a very
quick primer two components we're going
to dive much deeper into them in later
tutorials
so what is a component well a component
is just a reusable piece of code or
template that we can use in different
review instances right so right now we
have to view instances right here if you
up one and view up two and we have two
placeholders for them game the HTML file
so one if we want to output some kind of
template or functionality in each one of
these to review instances well we could
write it separately in each one of these
or we could create a component which we
can then inject into each one of these
view instances right so we're just
creating it once and using it in
multiple places we're reusing the
component so how do we create that
component are going to say in the view
dot composites and then this method
right there it's going to take two
parameters the first one is gonna be a
string which is the name of this
component I'm going to call this
greeting and then the second parameter
is going to be exclusion inside this
function we can pass through some
different properties
now the first property I want to show
you is going to be called template and
this is going to be add attempt late
which is rendered when we use is
component okay so it's going to be a
string I'm going to pass through some
HTML so this is going to be AP tag I'm
just going to say okay there I and a
reusable component okay close that key
tag off and now if we use this component
in each of these view instances this is
going to be output to the Dom so how do
we use this component well all we need
to do is output this name of the
component in tag format in this index
file so if I were to output this
component I can just say open without
greeting closing now this is not
Hipstamatic right you know that so what
vue.js does is look at this and say hey
that looks awfully like a component that
has been created called greeting so what
I'm going to do is take this template
and where I find this greeting tag I'm
going to replace it with that template
right there okay so if I just copy this
now and paste it down below as well then
we can reuse this component this
template in two different instances two
different sections on our website so if
I save that on view in a browser we can
see these two things right here
you view up one and view up to just
check this out if I inspect these
components we're not seeing that
greeting tag we're just seeing the
template so the template takes over the
greeting tag completely and this
disappears right that's the way it works
okay so we can also pass through data
into this view component much like
reward in here where we say data and
that gives an object without different
properties such as name we can do the
same kind of thing in these components
but there's one little difference
instead this time data is not an object
directly data must be exported right and
this function then returns the object so
we return an object and now we can have
our different main properties or title
properties in here so why is this well
when we're creating a view instance
likely if there's just one instance
right and that returns a single data
object and that's fine because there's
just one instance of this view however
when we're creating a component there's
going to be multiple instances using the
same kind of definition and if we just
use a plane object instead of this
function right here then basically what
we're doing is saying all those
instances are going to share that object
by reference right so they're all going
to have the same object if you like the
same data object and if we change the
data in one of those components on the
page it's going to update in every
single component right that we use every
instance of that component by providing
data as a function right here every time
we create a new instance of it we're
just calling this function to return a
fresh copy of this data right so if we
change this data in one of the instances
of the component then it's not going to
update it in another one and I can
demonstrate that now so what I'm going
to do is first of all I'll put this name
right here so when I say next
and if I save this we're going to view
it in a browser and we concede out there
so I'm going to create a function now a
method which is going to change this
name in the component so we can pass
through the message the same way reward
interview instance right this is still
an object and inside here I want to
create a method called change name and
this is going to change the name of this
thing right here right so it's going to
be a function and inside this function
which is still access this data right
here the same way reward in a view
instance by saying the list not whatever
the property is called so this name I'm
going to be equal to Mario
okay so now we need a way to call this
function so I'm going to place a button
right here I'm going to do a full stop
and then do a button and then this
button is going to have a click event
attached to it so first of all inside
the bottom will say change name right
then this button is going to say V on
that's how we listen to events and it's
going to be a click event I'm going to
set that equal to this function right
here change name so we can take change
name let us save this now to view it in
a browser we're gonna see this button
right here now if I change it here it
changes this to Mario but this does not
change the Mario right so that's the
reason we're using this function to
return to the data because if it was
just a simple object this data would be
shared between both instances here and
if we changed one and it would change to
the other and I can demonstrate this by
doing a little trick if I define my data
up here say for example I say class
object a large data rather is equal to
this object
and I say name is Yoshi right then if I
return instead of this object right here
if I just return data this is now
external right and this is going to be
shared between each instance of this
component so now if I do this then if I
click on one it will update on each one
you can see is what data on both of them
so we're kind of tricking view jealousy
is what they didn't want us to do and
that's why we returned a fresh object
each time so if it just won't do a
little bit here that's why we returned a
fresh object each time for those
component instances okay so a little
confusing at first but that's how we use
data in component and that's how we can
create components to create reusable
code and templates we can use in
different sections on a website like I
say we're going to delve into this much
deeper as we create single page
components later on and it will all kind
of click into place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
