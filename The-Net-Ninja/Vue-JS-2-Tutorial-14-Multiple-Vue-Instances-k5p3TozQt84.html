UJS tutorial and in this video I want to
show you how to create multiple view
instances
okay so thus far we've just created want
view instance to control our entire
application that one section on the web
page now in this video I want to show
you how to create multiple view
instances to control different sections
of your website for example we might be
using viewed OS and multiple instances
as widgets on a website okay so each
view jas instance is controlling a
specific widget on a website so how does
this work well first of all what I'm
going to do is store this view instance
in a variable alright so I'm going to
call this one so now this is an instance
which is stored in a variable called one
right and this right here I'm going to
change to view up one and we're going to
use this to control an area on a web
page with this element so I'm going to
actually copy this and paste it down
here to create a second view incidents
and I'm going to call this one two and
this time this is going to control view
up to okay so now if we go to the HTML
you'll notice I've created two areas
view up one and the view up to so these
are the two different sections that
they're going to control so let's just
add some data on each one of these
instances first of all I'm going to add
a title and this is going to be a view
up one and then down here also a title
as well and this is going to be view up
to so let's output those different
titles now in this index file so if we
come over here we can add for example a
82 and say title and the same goes for
down here title so let's save that view
this in a browser and you'll notice we
have these two titles right here okay so
because this is being controlled by the
view instance want this thing right here
then it takes this title and because
this one is being controlled by this
second view instance right here
take this title so there we go we've got
two successful new instances on our web
page that's how I can use two different
ones now I also want to do a computing
method for each one which is gonna be
called greet so I'll have that right
here and this is gonna be a function
which is gonna return to as a string
which we can output then to the browser
and this is going to say hello brand app
1 and then down here we'll do another
greet function so I'll copy this and
paste it in here and this instead is
going to say your boobs this is up to
speaking to you okay so now we've got
two different greet functions in our
computed objects right there one for app
one and one for up to so let's now
output these as well to the browser and
remember we can do that just by saying
something like this soap and here P and
this is going to be greet
I remember computed properties we don't
need to add on the parentheses like that
that's just a method computed properties
is just the name and we'll do the same
for view up one so there as well and if
we save this we should see both of those
greetings yep and yep cool so that is
how we use to view instances absolutely
the same as if we use just one view
instance they're independent of each
other however we can interact with one
another so we want to do something in
this instance which interacts with this
instance well this is why I've given
thee to the variable names one and two
so that it can reference them outside of
the view instance themselves so say for
example if we go here we had a button in
view up to and that's going to have a
click event so click on click slightly
calls a method which will call it a
minute and we'll say change up one title
right so this button is going to change
the title
this title right here okay so we're
communicating between the two instances
so let's call a method and we'll call
this change title and we need to create
that method now in view up to because
this right here this button is within a
view up to so it's going to look for
this method on the instance which
controls the area which is this one
number two so let's create that method
and it's called change title and this is
going to be a function and inside what
we want to do is change the title of
this thing right here this data now we
can do that really easily just by
referencing the name of this view
instance so I'm going to copy this and
let's paste it down here so want to drop
title and that's going to access the
title property right there in the data
and we can set it equal to something
else so I'm just going to say title
changed okay so let's just save that and
I've forgotten my parentheses all right
here okay let's save that and if we view
this now in a browser if we change if we
click this then this should change and
it does so we have access now one view
instance from another so I'm going to
show you one more thing and that is that
we can change the title of this one or
this one from outside any of you
instance whatsoever so we can just write
something down here like this to title
and then set that equal to change from
outside you can leave outside any of you
instance and this is going to override
this title right here because we're
referring to that view instance and
changing that title I would have to cut
a button or anything for this to happen
this is going to run automatically
because it's just running for JavaScript
so let's save this and check it out in
the browser and now you can see it's
changed from outside so there we go
that's multiple view instances for you
in a nutshell
you
one thing they do want to say about
multiple view instances is that if
you're constantly interacting with
separate instances like this you might
want to reconsider how you're
structuring your application you might
want to bundle I begin together in one
view instance where it's much more
natural to communicate between data than
having separate instances which are
communicating with each other all over
the show in this example it's fine
because it's very simple but if you've
got multiple instances all over the show
communicating with each other
you might want to think about just
bundling it all together in one or two
instances to control a larger section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
