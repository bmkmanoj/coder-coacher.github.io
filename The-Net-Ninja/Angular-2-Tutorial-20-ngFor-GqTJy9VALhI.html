angular 2 tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at the ng 4
directive all right there so in this
tutorial we're going to look at another
structural directive called ng 4 and
what ng 4 allows us to do is loop
through some data and kind of output
multiple series of HTML tags for each
one of those data items and it's all
going to become clear as we go through
this tutorial so say for example in this
series we're going to have a list of
ninjas we're not just going to have one
ninja we're going to have a series of
them there might be five six seven eight
whatever and what we want to do for each
ninja is output some HTML for example a
list item tag and in each list item
we're going to output the data of that
particular ninja so we want to cycle
through the ninjas and output some code
for each one right now instead of
hard-coding that for each ninja and
after all we're not going to know how
many inches we will have in the data
that could be four for the could be ten
so we don't know haven't it's cold
instead of doing that we're going to use
ng four and that's going to output
however many we need for us okay so
let's get rid of this stuff first of all
and what I'm going to do is get rid of
this as well and we're going to start
building up this directory so we'll say
page two first of all and we'll say
ninja listing at the top then underneath
this I'm going to do a ul turn and this
is going to have an ID of ninja -
listing this is just for the CSS to look
good and then underneath that what we're
going to do is an li tag like so and
this is where we're going to use the ng
fall okay so the way we do this is by
using a little extra crystal ball and
then same mg4 and setting it equal to
something and what we set it equal to is
let ninja and I'm going to explain this
in a second of ninjas so let is just a
keyword we put that at the start to say
look let in this kind of local scope
right here let ninja be the
variable for the particular ninja that
we're looping through and this is going
to be a collection of ninjas so we need
to define this ninjas collection on the
directory component so let's do that I'm
going to get rid of these two things
right here and I'm going to create a new
variable column ninjas and this is going
to be equal to an array because ng for
loops through an array of objects of
your like are an array of data okay so
this right here refers to the array
ninjas so if we start to pad this a rail
each ninja is going to be an object and
it's going to have a main property and
we'll call this first one your sheep and
give it also a belt
we won't go down we'll just a belt and
this is going to be black for Yoshi okay
so that's that first ninja then we're
going to do another I'm just going to
copy and paste this because I'm super
lazy paste it in and we'll call this one
array and the belt is going to be red
and then finally it will do one more and
we'll call this crystal and this time
the belt color is going to be I don't
know purple okay so now we've got our
collection of ninjas so in the code over
here it's going to loop through this
ninjas array and it's going to output an
li tag for each ninja okay
and in each time around that loop in
each Li tag the particular ninja that
it's currently outputting is going to be
referred to as this local variable ninja
okay so if I now use string
interpolation to output ninja dot name
okay because it's got a main property
right here then each time around it's
going to print out the name of that
particular ninja so first of all it's
going to do an li tag and it's going to
grab the first ninja in the array which
is yasha and it's going to output yo
 then it's going to go back through
the loop and next time around ninja it's
going to be the second item in the array
which is array and it's going to output
right and then third time around ninja
is going to refer to crystal okay so if
we save this now and check
in a browser refresh over here then now
we're going to see these three names
output right here Yoshi Ryu and crystal
pretty cool right but we don't just want
to output just the name of the ninja
each time we want to output a little bit
more code now I've already copied and
pasted some of the code I want to output
here so I'm just going to paste it in
another walk you through it so let me
just zoom this over okay so each time
around we have a div within the Li tag
and that's going to class of single
ninja again this is just for CSS
purposes so it looks good little
comments saying bell color because we're
going to output the belt color right now
and this is in a span tag and you'll
notice right now I'm using ng style now
this is an attribute directive a similar
to ng class I'm using property binding
right here then send it equal to an
object and I'm saying the background of
this particular span tag is going to be
the color of ninja belt and remember
we're passed through ninja on each
iteration of this li output so it's
going to refer to this thing right here
black red or purple so it's going to set
the background color of this spun tag to
whatever color we've supplied in this
object right here for the belt okay new
new belt then within the span tag will
outputting the ninja belt text so that's
going to be either red black or purple
and then just some text after it same
belt
cool so then without putting the ninja
name and we're doing h3 with the ninja
name we saw this a minute ago and that's
going to be either Yoshi crystal or Ryu
and then finally if we're doing this
click event which we're actually just
going to delete for now we don't need
that so what I want to do now is save
this and view it in a browser so if we
head over here and refresh cool now we
are going to see each of these belts the
background color determined by what
we've put in the object for the belt and
then its output in the name of that as
well black red and purple and then the
name of each of these ninjas as well
next to them pretty cool right
so that is what ng4 does it loops
through an array which we've defined
ourselves right here and we don't have
to define this ourselves we can use
something like firebase and they request
that information from firebase I'm going
to show you how we do that later on so
once we've got that array then we can
say we want to use ng for to loop
through that array and we're saying on
each iteration of this loop each time we
output this Li tag we want to refer to
whatever item in the array we're
currently cycling through as ninja so
each time around the item is referred to
as ninja then we can do things like
saying output ninja belt or ninja name
okay and we can combine them either
using string interpolation or directives
like this and use them as objects within
objects okay so there we go that is ng
for any questions leave those down below
otherwise I'm going to see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
