bootstrap 4 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about containers and
break points all rather so first of all
what is a container well
containers are pretty much what they say
they are they're the most basic layout
component in bootstrap for that actually
required when we use the grid system but
we'll get into that later
but essentially they wrap and contain
our content and they give us some basic
padding and margin to go around our
content as well plus they also help us
Center our content in the middle of the
page if we want it now the two types of
containers fluid or fixed and the main
difference or rather the only difference
between them is that a fixed container
has always a maximum weight and is
centered on the page and that maximum
width changes depending on the break
point or the viewport as we get to
smaller screens the max which gets
smaller as we go to the larger screens
the max which gets larger and a fluid
container is always 100 percent of the
viewport width or its surrounding
container even that has a max width
property on it so we're going to see
both of these in action so let's jump
into the code and give them a whirl
all right so I'm back in the index file
and I've stripped out the code from the
body we did in the last tutorial so
unless with just this data file that
bootstrap gave us on their website so
what I want to do is create two
containers first of all a fixed one then
in fluid one so we'll need an element to
give a class of container to and I'm
just going to use a div for now we'll
give this a class of container now this
is going to create a fixed container for
us the kind of default container if you
like all right and within that DF let's
just do a h1 called fixed container what
I'm also going to do is give this a
style property so it's going to
background color of sky below now I
don't advise you to add inline styles to
your HTML this is bad practice I'm just
using something quick and dirty so you
can distinguish between this fixed
container and the fluid container in the
browser all right so let us now copy
this and do a fluid container take it
down here and this time the class is not
container these container
-
fluid that's it so that's the only
difference between these two so this is
going to create a fixed container this a
fluid container so let's just change
here the text and also the background
what can we use yellow all right so
let's say this and check it out in a
browser and now we can see this fixed
container is the blue one it has a
maximum width you can see it stops here
and here and it's scented on the page
now if we make this a little larger you
can see it's still centered and it still
has that maximum width and if we hover
over the element in this inspector then
you can see that that weight is one
thousand one hundred and forty pixels
wide and you can see this one right here
this fluid container doesn't have a
maximum weight it's one hundred percent
okay and as we get smaller you'll notice
that the fixed container goes to
different max weight so as we reach the
first breakpoint here you see it goes
smaller and now it has a different max
width now it's 960 pixels whereas this
fluid container is still 100% width of
the viewport so as we go smaller it gets
leaf its container goes smaller as well
etc all the way down to really small
screen sizes where it becomes 100% okay
so it's working through these
breakpoints and it's getting a different
maximum width at every break point
whereas the phlume container is always
staying at 100% width right so what are
these break points well we can check
them out on the bootstrap Doc's right
here or you want to do is go to layout
then go to all of you and we're going to
see these responsive breakpoints or
right here so bootstrap adopts a
mobile-first approach so we start off
with an extra small device right
listening right here which is less than
576 pixels so anything that we create in
bootstrap is by default shown on these
device widths in certain way then when
we reach a width of this 576 pixels
bootstrap changes the display of our
content so that it gets maybe
so for example this thing right here
when it reaches 576 pixels let's get
through it 565 there we go just roughly
there you can see it comes away from the
edges and it gets a different max width
okay the next one up is 768 pixels so
that's kind of like tablets things like
that so again if we get to 768 and you
can see by the way the device width
roughly here you might need to zoom in
but you can see is currently about 616
and as we go up to 7 6 8 which is around
about now you can see it jumped again
now we get a different max width okay
the next one is 992 so let's have a look
again bring this up to 992 and it's
going to snap around about now now we go
snap again and go to a different max
width and then the final one is 1200
pixels so for anything over this it
snaps again so let's take a look at that
round about you now there we go
snaps again gets a different max whip so
they're containers and these breakpoints
don't only apply to containers they
apply to different things and different
components that bootstrap provides us
with such as the grid system the
different break points the grid system
displays differently for example at
certain break points we might have four
elements going across your Malraux at a
smaller breakpoint we might have two
elements going across in a row okay so
it changes the display of those elements
as we go through the break pots and
we're going to see that all that in
action later on so which contain that
you use either it be fluid or fixed
depends on your design I guess but I'm
going to be used a mixture of both I
think throughout this series so now we
know what containers are how about we
put something in them in the various
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
