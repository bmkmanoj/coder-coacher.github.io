jQuery for beginners lesson 16 and in
this video I want to talk about invents
helpers Wow
okay the yank so a noiseless and I said
there were loads of events that can
happen on a web page right such as click
events resize events scroll events etc
the list goes on and on and on and on
and on and I gave you a link in the
description to that video to a list of
all of these events now if you were to
click that link you wouldn't notice that
these events look a lot like methods
themselves and guess what they are
jQuery is really good at making life
simple for us and if you've not noticed
that by now when you're watching this
course then God knows what you've been
doing maybe you've been watching this in
a blindfold and some ear muffs or
something anyway jQuery makes life
simple for us so what it's done is
taking these events and it created these
kind of event helpers if you like out of
them forest so that it's easier to write
ok so in the last lesson you saw me do
something like this I grabbed it in the
element from the dom and stored it in a
variable I'll just call that element for
now and I said dot on click and then I
supplied a function as the second
parameter to say what's going to happen
when this click event happens and this
is where all the magic occurs now this
guy's is pretty much the same as saying
dots clip right that is the helper if
you like so it's a little bit simpler to
write now this is just pointing to the
on click method so it does pretty much
exactly the same thing so if I write in
here alert you clicked me right and then
we need to specify something to click so
I'll grab something from the HTML
document we'll get this lead banner
right here copy that I will say pound
sign lead banner so what I'm saying here
guys is that when you click that lead
banner pop-up this alert you click lis
right so let's save that and see what
happens click you click me all right
cool
and you can do this with pretty much
every event out there so I could even
say double-click DPL click you
double-click me save that and if I click
once now doesn't work because we've not
got that click event but if I double
click now it works you double clicked me
awesome alright so these guys remember
is the same as same odd and then double
click like that alright so same again
once doesn't work twice doors so they're
exactly the same pretty much now some
people prefer to use this dot on method
because performance wise I suppose it
could be slightly better and for a
couple of other little reasons as well
but when you starting out and certainly
for most things dot double-click would
be fine and you can still unbind them so
you could do something like this double
oops DPL click and then under this you
could unbind it you could still say read
data and then use the off method like
that to turn off the double click you
can still unbind them that way right
it's the same thing so if I do this if I
double click once works now the double
click again doesn't work that's because
we've unbound it here once we've clicked
it once so this still works when you use
these helper events right there okay so
that is what event helpers are all about
again I'll leave that same link in the
description down below so you can go and
check out all of those event helpers in
your own time if you have any questions
feel free to drop a comment down below
as well otherwise guys don't forget to
