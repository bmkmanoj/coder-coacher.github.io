fifth webpack tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a look at CSS loaders
all right so we can use CSS loaders to
load in only the styles we need any
particular point into different parts of
our application for example if we're
working with some kind of JavaScript
frame which which dynamically injects
content into our website and typically
we've split that javascript up into
different components if you like and
each component can load in only the CSS
that it needs for that component pretty
cool right so this way CSS becomes much
more modular and easier to manage so
there's two loaders we're actually going
to use in this video the first one is
the CSS loader and the second one is the
sterile order so we need to install both
of those via the NPM once we've
installed them this CSS loader is going
to lolly in the CSS into our JavaScript
file but that's not enough what we then
need to do is use the style loader to
add that CSS into the Dom or the
document object model so we need to use
the two in tandem together for this to
work so the first thing I want to do is
head over to my index dot HTML file and
I want to pop some content in here that
we're going to style and it's gonna be
something that they're dead simple so
let's come over here and create a new
dip I'm gonna give this a class of
internal component and maybe if you're
using some kind of framework like react
this would be dynamically injected by a
Java component I'm not going to go into
all that I'm just going to create this
in the HTML file so let's do a little h1
here as well and say CSS Lotus awesome
because they are okay so now we've got
that and we can stir this up using some
CSS so let's create some CSS let's go
into our source folder and create a new
folder called CSS and then we didn't
that let's create a new file and we'll
call this intro component CSS okay I'm
going to style up this dude right here
so how are we going to do that just a
simple selector will say intro component
which is that HTML selector I added on
right here so we tagged it in that will
say padding is gonna be 20 pixels
background is gonna be maroon the color
is going to be white which is FFF and
then finally we'll say font family
it is Ariel okay cool so currently
nothing is linking to this CSS it's not
being linked to in this file so
nothing's actually going to work here it
just displays the default browser styles
so now what we're going to do is use
those CSS and style loaders to inject
this where we need it these styles so
let's go ahead and install it so to do
that just type in right down here NPM
install and then we're going to need the
style
- loader and also the CSS iPhone load it
both of those and then we're gonna save
them both to our dev dependencies so hit
enter and let those dudes install okay
sweet so when that's a start let's just
double check in our package not JSON
file to make sure yeah they're the our
CSS loader and style order so what's the
next thing we need to do we need to
configure our web config or right here
to say we want to use those CSS and star
loaders now I said in the last tutorial
that this load is property right here is
an array and this array contains
different object and each object refers
to a different loaded that we're going
to use so this is the first one right
here which was the babel loader now
we're going to add in another one into
this array select it would comment and
do another object and this is going to
be from a star loader and the CSS loader
okay so first of all we want to test for
CSS files so similar to this we want to
test for anything with a CSS extension
so we'll paste that dude in there and
change this to CSS so it's only going to
load or perform it's loaded on CSS files
okay
so comment now the loader we want to use
this time is we actually need to use two
we need to use the style order and the
CSS loader
okay so we'll say the style loader and
the way we pipe these two together to
say we want to use them both
same time is by using the exclamation
mark right there and then we say CSS log
okay so remember the CSS loader is going
to load all the CSS into the JavaScript
file and then the styling load at which
we're tacking on to as well is going to
add those styles into the Dom alright so
that's all we need to do for this we
don't need to say any presets or
anything like that because they're just
going to do one thing they're gonna put
the CSS that we write into the Dom right
so let's save this now and let us go
into our JavaScript file right here I'm
going to get rid of this alert I don't
want to use that anymore
and imagine this javascript file is the
component which is going to be
controlling this component on our home
page right so let us quickly say here
require and we're going to require this
CSS file right here so we need to put
the path into that and that path is dot
forward slash CSS forward slash intro
component dot CSS okay so now we're
requiring that for this component right
here for this javascript file so if we
now run web pack that is going to take
those Styles and it's going to bundle
them out into this bundle yes and add
those styles to the Dom so it's going to
style this thing right here except we've
got an error and then we just take a
quick look we can see that the error is
right here so let's check our styles
okay and let's add this semicolon on the
end there then we can run web pack but
once again okay cool and this time it
does run so let's check it out in a
browser and now we can see those Styles
are added in or right there so you might
think that this is pointless
and you'd be fair enough to do so
however just imagine you have many
different JavaScript modules that
JavaScript components right and each
JavaScript component is injecting a
different element or different component
into your index dot HTML file right so
every time we use one of these different
components we can just require the CSS
that we need
for that particular component instead of
loading in all of the CSS to the
index.html file which we might not need
we might only need a third of it all
just little sections of it so this way
we're only ever loading in the CSS that
we need which is really cool and it
means that we can modular as our CSS
right here in two different components
for different sections of our
application so there we go that is how
we use CSS loaders and in the next video
I'm going to show you how we can use
sass loaders to transpose sass into
vanilla CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
