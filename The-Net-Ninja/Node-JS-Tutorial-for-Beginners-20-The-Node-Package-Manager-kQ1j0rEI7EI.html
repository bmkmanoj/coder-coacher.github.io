nodejs tutorial and in this video I'm
going to introduce you to the node
package manager or for short the NPM
okay then dogs so in the last tutorial I
showed you how we can perform some basic
routing like this and we discovered that
this way of doing it could quite
possibly become tiresome when we have
many pages on our application now
fortunately there is a package called
Express which is going to really help us
slim this down and create web
applications on node but to do that to
use it first of all we're going to have
to talk a little bit about the node
package manager now the node package
manager or NPM four-shot comes installed
with no GS when you install that and
basically it's just a bunch of
command-line tools which can help us
install third-party packages or modules
if you like to help out with our node
projects so Express is one of these
packages and there are many many more is
a huge ecosystem of third-party packages
that's why no js' is so great so a node
package is essentially just a bunch of
code that sun else has already written
right it helps us perform a certain type
of task within nodejs
applications for example the Express
package helps us with routing and
templating and such so the idea is is
that we can load these packages into our
node application and then use their
functionality in our code and the way we
do that is by using the node package
manager so using the package manager we
can install packages update packages or
even publish our own packages for other
people to use as well okay then gang so
I'm on the node package manager website
which keeps track of all these packages
available to us and that's at NPM
J Escom I'll leave the link down below
and basically here we can just search
for what packages are available to us
and it's going to give us information
about those packages and tell us how to
install them so let's just go ahead and
search for Express and it's going to
give us some drop-down options some
suggestions right here but I'm just
going to click search and then any
package relating to Express is going to
show up for us
and we can click on one of these
packages to tell us more about it so I
just want to take a look at express
itself so I click that and then it's
going to tell us how to install Express
and many more things so you can see
installation tells us how to do how to
do that the features of express some
Docs the github page etc so there's
loads of information about this package
here so this is a great resource if
you're looking for something to add into
your application so let's go ahead and
install on it we'll use this command
right here NPM install express in nodejs
and that's going to go ahead and install
Express in our application so remember
this command line so so remember this
command so let's go over to our
application come to the terminal and all
we have to say is NPM install Express
and if we run that then this is going to
take just a minute or so it's get a
glass is going to grab all of those
files and it's going to download them
into our nodejs application and you can
see already it's created this node
modules folder so it's fully install now
and if I open this up you're going to
see huge amounts of folders now don't
worry don't let this put you off you can
see Express is right here and this is
the module we installed however it's
also installed all these other modules
or packages if you like and they are
dependencies so Express depends on these
other things these other modules so note
has recognized that and it's installed
these other modules or packages if you
like as well so we don't need to work
with those other packages directly we've
just installed Express it's just that
it's installed these other modules so
that Express can work properly ok so
anyway now if we wanted to we could use
Express in our application I'm not going
to do that in this tutorial I'm just
introducing you to the package manager
we're going to do that in a couple of
tutorials time so I'm going to uninstall
that for now so how do we do that well
all we have to do is say NPM
on install no Express and then again
this is just going to take a minute it's
going to cycle through all of these
folders and files and it's going to be
uninstall them for you so when this
finishes we should see in this folder
just the bin fault now so it's taken
those folders out okay cool so this is
the node package manager and how we use
it to install packages that we can use
in our application so in the next
tutorial I'm going to introduce you to a
file called package JSON and this file
is going to help us keep track of all
the packages we install how they can be
updated and it's also going to help you
when you pass your code on to other
developers it's going to tell them what
they need to install for this
application to work okay so we'll take a
look at that in the next tutorial any
questions so far leave those down below
otherwise guys don't forget to share
subscribe and like and I'm going to see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
