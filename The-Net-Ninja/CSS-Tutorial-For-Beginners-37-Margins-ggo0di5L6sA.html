yo guys what the hell is going on this
is cs50 beginners lesson 37 and today
we're gonna talk all about margins
that's Camille okay so first of all
let's just have a recap of what the box
model is we said that we've got our
element here in the middle which is
given a specific width and height then
around that we have some padding which
is the internal spacing within the
element itself then we can have a border
if you wish and then finally the space
that separates it from other elements is
the margin around the perimeter of the
element itself so we're going to look at
the margin in more detail in this video
and we're going to jump back in the code
to do that alright guys so here I am
back in the code and it's exactly the
same as last time we've got these two
divatox here both of the class of box
and this content in between and then
we've stabbed them here with a class
selector a box we've given each one a
margin of 30 pixels our padding of 30
pixels and a one pixel solid border
which is black so let's just view this
again in a browser and see what's going
on alright so there it is and this here
is the content and we've got some
padding here around the content border
and then the margin between the two
elements let's just inspect the element
in google dev tools and we can see there
the orange which is what we're going to
be looking at today is the margin okay
and we specify a badge in 30 pixels and
that says hey browser I've just
specified one value that means a plan is
following you to the top right bottom
and left side of the element so it's
giving the merging all around the
element okay now what if we wanted to
control the top differently I'll be
right differently on the bottom
differently on the left differently well
we can do that we can specify and value
for each one okay and let's have a look
how we do that so right here we've given
one value and that applies the margin to
all sides of the element okay if we
wanted to give each side a different
value we can do that by specifying full
values so I'll just write these first of
all okay and then I'll go through it so
what we're seeing here is we start at
the top the first value is the top and
we work clockwise around
the element so we're saying the top here
is 30 feet source we want the mountains
at 30 pixels on the right which is next
around in the clock we want it to be 20
pixels give it a right margin of 20
pixels and then at the bottom we want a
15 pixel margin and then on the left of
5 pixel margin okay that makes sense so
that's how it control an each individual
side margin so let's see in a browser
what's happened okay we can't really see
there because not much as changed with
we right-click this now and inspect in
the element there we go you can see now
the the top one is 30 pixels okay
the right one bit smaller 20 pixels
bottom one a little bit smaller again 15
pixels and the left one is very small
that's the 5 pixel margin and it even
says that here you see in the bottom
right hand corner of Google Chrome tools
we've got the margin values here it says
it around the perimeter okay
so that's how we control each one
individually now there's other way
there's other shorthand ways we can do
this say we want the top and bottom to
be 30 pixels and we want the right and
left to be 15 pixels well we can do that
we can do it by specifying two values
and that there my friends is saying okay
give the top and bottom a value of 30
pixels and a left or right a value of 15
pixels so let's just make sure this has
worked and viewing the browser's at once
again and inspect the element and cool
there we go guys you can see now the
left of rack the same and the top and
bottom of the same and again it shows
the exact values here in dev tools all
right so that's pretty cool now there's
one more shorthand we can do and I don't
use this one often but you can use if
you like if we had a third value what
we're saying now is we want the top to
be 30 pixels we want the right to be 15
pixels we want the bottom to be 20
pixels and because there's not a fourth
parameter or a fourth value specified
it's getting to the left and it doesn't
know what that is so it says hey well
I've got one thing for earth for the
right which is 15 pixels so I'm just
gonna match that so the left will
automatically match this 15 pixels so
essentially this is top left and right
and bottom okay so that's the last
shorthand method we can use so let's
just view this once more in a browser
let's make sure it's worked inspect the
element and yeah there it is you can see
here 30 pixels 15 pixels 20 pixels and
15 pixels again so the left and right
match each other right okay then so in
the last lesson I talked about the
margin collapse okay so let's just go
back to the code for a second and I'm
going to just say 30 pixels all around
so top bottom left they're out they're
all gonna have 30 pixels Manatee then
we'll view this again in a browser and
inspect the element so the I said in the
last lesson that we've got this property
so in this element here which has a
mounted bottom of 30 pixels and then
this one here which has a mountain top
of 30 pixels now the margin between them
is only 30 pixels Bobby you would think
it would be 60 pixels right because
we've got a margin top of 30 and a
margin bottom of 30 so they should add
up and give you 60 pixels right well no
that's not the way that CSS works in
browsers and this is called for the
vertical margin collapse okay so
essentially when you have two elements
stacked on top of each other and they
both have a margin associated with it
one imagine on the bottom and one a
margin on the top then those two margins
collapse when they meet each other so if
those margins are identical which they
are in this case they're both 30 pixels
then they collapse and they become 30
pixels in total the margin between the
two and if we have one margin larger
than the other then they collapse and it
will take the larger of the two margins
so let's just change this to 15 15
pixels 15 pixels so what we're saying
there is we want a 30 pixel top margin
15 right 15 button and 15 down however
the space between these is still 30
pixels you see that one there is 15
pixels at the bottom but this is still
30 pixels at the top so when the margins
collapse is still accepting that larger
value of 30 pixels okay
now you might think this is
counterintuitive well you're just gonna
have to accept that that's the way that
CSS works in browsers and there are
reasons for it
for example if you didn't start P tags
and you display them normally in a
browser if the mountains didn't collapse
then between every P tag there's gonna
be a humongous gap and that's gonna look
a bit silly so it's there to help you
out and you can't get around it you know
it's not easy to earn so it's not hard
to to kind of combat this so we've
looked at the shorthand methods and
we've looked at the margin collapse what
we're going to look at now is just a
couple of nifty techniques that I knew
sometimes okay now say we want this box
to be oops I've got rid the border then
see what this box to be a width of I
don't know 300 pixels right let's just
view that in a browser let's see what
happens
okay cool so the box is 300 pixels but
you might think well actually I want
this box to be central so I want to
specify left and right margins which is
gonna bring this box to the sense here
but I don't actually know what those
margins should be okay and I don't know
the width of this container for some
reason or other or when the browser
shrinks then that container is gonna
shrink as well so we want those boxes
regardless of how big this container is
to sit in the middle now how do I do
that well that is where the margin auto
property comes in so let's take a look
at that we saw before that we can have
to valleynewslive this and then this
would be the top and bottom margin and
this the left and right okay now we want
the left or right to be made up so that
it senses the boxes so we'll use auto
because we don't know what that margin
should be and what are we saying okay is
give the left and right margins a
property which is automatic work out an
automatic property for me which is going
to sit this box in the middle so let's
save that view it in the browser make
sure it does and cool there we go
so we'll right-click this inspect the
element and now you can see it's given
those left and right margins an
automatic value which is equal and sits
the content in the middle okay so that's
one really cool technique I
not all the time and there's one more
thing I wanna show you and that's
percentages so say we have a width of
50% yeah now again we want it to sit in
the middle and we know that if the width
is 50% then there's 50% room left so we
can have a 25% margin okay
for this to work we need to get rid of
the padding because remember the padding
is all part of the box model in fact no
I won't get rid of that watch your face
anyway there we go so we say we want
this width of 50% to sit in the middle
then on each side there's gonna be a
margin of 25% so we can work with
percentages and margins as well that's
absolutely fine so let's view this in
the browser once again cool and they you
can see it's still sitting in the middle
is 50% the width but if we shrink the
browser now this doesn't work okay
I've not made this a percentage value so
it won't work in this case boy generally
speaking this is a good way of kind of
controlling the width of elements
positioning them in the middle and
they'll scale down for responsive
websites too that's a little bit of an
so I'm not going to go into it in this
chapter now or this video rather I may
do a series on responsive design in the
future you can check that other so
that's about it for margin if you have
any questions feel free to drop a
comment below I'll answer all of those
otherwise if you enjoy these videos
please like them subscribe or share them
and I'll see you guys in the next one
where we're going to look at padding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
