night vgs tutorial and in this video i
want to show you how to set up writing
in your view application okay there so
at the minute our blog application right
here only really has one page and what
we're doing is just nesting different
components on this one page to kind of
control what we see in it right but
really most applications have more than
one page if you go to for example /add -
blog then you'll go to the add blog page
where you can add a new blog or if you
go to forward slash your blogs then you
see the blog page etc okay so to do this
what we're going to have to do is set up
writing in vgf so we can kind of
dynamically show different components
depending on which URL the user goes to
now routing doesn't come shipped with
the core of UGS library we're going to
have to install a third party package so
to do that lets go to our terminal and
install it and we can do that by same
npm install view - a router and we're
going to save this to our dependencies
okay so once that's downloaded we can
now use it in our application so to do
that we need to go to main and we need
to say view that use but this time it
used the view router so first of all
we'll need to import it
so we'll say import view router role and
then view - router now we can do this
thing down here to say we want to use it
in our application so say you don't use
and then this time of you route it okay
so now we can make use of the view
router and start setting up some routes
so how do we set up these routes well
what we need to do is create a new
instance of the view router that we've
just used here okay so let's do that
first of all or say Const router is
equal to a new view router so that's
that thing right here okay so we're
making a new instance of this view
router and what we need to do is pass in
here an object which is going to take
our route so we need to register our
routes in well we could register them
here but what I like to do is keep them
separate outside in that
little file to keep everything organized
so I'm just going to leave that here for
now save it also going to save this app
view and what I'm going to do is create
now a new file in the source folder
called routes so we'll call this route
jas okay now then we can register or
kind of make up all of our routes in
this file so the way we do this is by
exporting an object or rather an array
of objects okay because we have an array
of routes each element in that array is
going to represent a different route so
we can export this because we're going
to import it later in a different file
so export default and this is going to
be an array okay so in this array each
object like this would be a route and
then each object would have different
properties in that route so let's just
do two for now keep it simple so the
first property in the route object is
going to be the path and this is what
comes after your kind of a root domain
name so if your website is
www.miamikettlebell.com thing and what
do I want to show I want to show a
certain component so we can say as the
second property component and if someone
just goes to forward slash I want to
show the show blog's component so a list
of the blogs and that little snippet
underneath each one so I need to import
that component in here so we can use it
so I'm going to say import and it's
going to be show blogs from and it's in
the component folder so it's dots
forward slash to say current directory
then the components folder forward slash
show logs W okay so now we've imported
that and we can say the component we
want here is this thing shell blocks
okay so if we go to forward slash we're
going to show this component let's set
up another one or same path and this
time we'll say /ad
okay and this is going to be the pass to
add a new blog this time the component
that we want it can be this add blog
component so let's copy this dude and
paste it underneath and this time it's
add blog and same over here add blog
okay so now we can just copy this and
paste it down below so now if someone
visits a /add we get this component
showed all right so now we've kind of
defined our two routes that we want to
use in this application and at the
minute this is not going to do anything
because we're not kind of registering
these routes anywhere we're just
exporting an object or rather an array
of object so what we want to do is go to
the main J's file and we want to import
this and register them in this new view
router instance then once we've
registered then we can start to use them
so the first thing we need to do is
import this file yeah so we can do that
right here we can say import and what we
want is routes and I've made this known
what you can call it whatever you want
from and it's going to be from this file
right here okay so it's just routes yes
so I can just say dot forward slash for
current directory or routes like so okay
so now we've imported that and what we
can do is register the routes in this
new view router instance ok so it takes
a property called routes and this is
going to be equal to listing we've just
imported so we'll paste that down there
so this right here was imported from
here so imported this thing and now
we're using that as we're out so it'd
just be the same as registering them
here in an array like that and then
doing your different routes in there but
what we've done is externalize them into
a different file keep everything
organized and we've imported them and
place them now like that okay so the
same thing so now we've registered the
routes right there now we need to say in
this view instance the router which we
want to use okay so we've created this
instance of the Revue router but we're
not doing anything
this vu out it so what we need to do is
say we want to use this view router in
this view instance so to do that dead
simple I would say is router and that's
going to be equal to this thing right
here router again so I'm going to paste
that in save it and now we can use these
routes in this view instance but where
is it going to go because at the minute
if we go /add that's not going to do
much right because we've not said where
we want these components to load in when
we go to these rounds now we need to do
that in our route component right here
so instead of hard-coding
this component what we want to do
instead is use this tag it's called a
router - view ok so now we're saying
this is where we want the components to
get loaded in when we visit those routes
so if I save this if I go to /add it's
going to load in the add blog component
here if I go to just forward slash it's
going to load in the show blogs
component here make sense so let's see
now if I'm at /add it goes to this if I
just go to forward slash on it's old
it's going to go to this click go right
so now we've created these routes but
check this out you'll notice that this
hash right here in the middle of the
route and that is basically so that vgs
can use this hash mode to store these
different routes and use them now
ideally we don't want this in I like
clean URLs so if we just go to /ad then
that's the route instead so what I'm
going to do in the next tutorial is show
you how to use this kind of approach
instead of the hash approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
