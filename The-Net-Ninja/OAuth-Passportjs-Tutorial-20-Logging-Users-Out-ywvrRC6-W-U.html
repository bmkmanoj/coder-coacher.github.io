20th a while tutorial and in this video
I'll show you how we can lock users out
of the application all right then sir
we're in a position now where we're
really nailing down this authentication
process and we can now successfully
login using Google and see our profile
page and we've also secured this profile
page so that people not logged in don't
see it and instead they're redirected to
the login page which is cool right so
now we've not talked about logging out
yet and at the minute if we click on
this logout button now we're just seeing
this stupid message right here saying
we're logging out when in actual fact
we're not we're not doing anything all
we're only sending this text so I want
to show you how we can logout in this
video but before we dive into the code I
want to show you what is actually going
to be happening behind the scenes when
we do this so if I just open up the
developer tools by clicking f12 and then
go to the network tab I'm going to need
to refresh this page to see the requests
I'm going to click on this request right
here for the profile page and if we
scroll down to the request headers we're
gonna see this cookie right here and
this cookie has express session and it's
equal to this long thing right here this
coded cookie right and that there is
containing our encrypted user ID so when
we're making a request for this profile
page that cookie is being sent to our
application on the server we're seeing
that cookie at we're saying okay when we
decrypt it we can see this user ID and
we're gonna grab a profile or user based
on the ID and send it back to the view
so you can see your profile you are
authenticated however if we log out what
we want to do is rip out our user ID
from this cookie we want to destroy it
because for as long as that user ID
exists in that cookie
we are authenticated right so we want to
rip that out so that if we then try to
access the profile page we're gonna say
okay your ID is not in this cookie
anymore therefore you're not
authenticated we're gonna redirect you
to the login page that's what we want to
do now I've made this sound more complex
than it needs to be believe me it is
really really simple to do and in fact
we can do it in one line of code so
let's go to our logout handle it right
here so at the minute we're just sending
this really daft message saying we're
logging out but instead we want to
actually log out so to do that we use
the request object and now thanks to
passport we can use the logout function
and voila there we go we have logged out
of the application that is all there is
to it I just wanted to explain what was
happening behind the scenes when we call
this function so after we've logged out
what do we want to do we don't just want
to sit around and show them a blank
screen or anything like that we want to
redirect them maybe to the home page so
it will say response
don't worry direct to you hmm
oh no it's not home it's just forward
slash what am i doing okay so we want to
redirect them to forward slash which is
the home page okay cool so let's test
this out if we refresh over here and
then click logout then we're going to go
to the home page and now if we click on
this request over here and go down to
the request headers we can still see
this express session cookie it's still
got some information stored in it about
the session however it's much much
shorter so no longer it means our user
ID encrypted into this cookie so its
ripped it out
we're not authenticated anymore and when
logged out so if we try to access now
forward slash profile then we're going
to get redirected to the login page
because when we try to make that request
our application is saying no your ID is
no longer in this cookie encrypted
therefore we're going to redirect you
because you're not logged in there we go
that's how easy it is to log out of a
system so I want to show you one more
thing and that is to do with this header
up here first of all I want to add in a
profile link and then secondly I also
want to control the display of these two
buttons because think about it if we're
logged in then we don't want to see the
login button we don't want to log in
twice right we just want to log in and
then we only need to see the logout
button but vice versa if we're logged
out we don't need to see the logout
button we just want to see the login
button right so we're going to control
that view now and the way we're going to
do this is as follows
we're gonna send the user object to the
view every time we get a few for example
the whole view the profile view the
login view etc and if in that view the
user actually exists then were only
gonna show the logout button because if
the user exists it means they're logged
in if the user doesn't exist in that
view then we're only going to show the
login button right so we can do this in
ejs templates we can use a bit of code
to check that certain things exist and
then show content depending on that
condition so let us go to our code now
I'm going to cross off the routes and we
want to open up these views so let's
start off with the home view now before
I do anything I said I just wanted to
add in the profile view so I'm going to
copy and paste this from my repo and
just paste it down here so now we have
that button as well on our home page
let's just have a quick look the profile
button so when we click on that we go to
the profile obviously I'm not logged in
so it's redirecting me so the next thing
we want to do is do a quick check right
here ok you want to check if the user is
actually logged in on them and then show
one of the buttons depending on whether
they are or they're not now to do that
we need to actually send the user back
to this view right here so let's go to
our route in fact it's in the app j/s
that's where we have our home ramp down
here and remember we can send an object
right so we can send an object where the
user property is going to be the request
don't use them so we're sending that
back now to the view so we can use it
and we can check whether that user
object actually has something in it so
what I'm going to do is just copy and
paste again a little bit of code from a
repository I'm gonna delete these two
first and then paste this in and explain
it so we'll opening up some ejs codes
right here using the angle bracket and
then the percentage sign and we don't
need the equal sign right here because
we're not directly outputting it any
data we're just doing a check then we're
saying if this user exists so remember
we're sending this user object right now
if this request dot user doesn't exist
and it's going to be not so when we
check for
right here this can be null yes so it's
gonna fail but if the user does exist
then what we're gonna do is show the
logout button because if the user exists
they're locked in and we only want to
show the logout button right else if
this is not true if it's null for
example we want to show the login button
right so that's what we're doing right
here then we're closing off the whole
check at the bottom so notice we have to
open up the code and close it off for
each line before we output the HTML okay
so that's a really simple way of
conditionally showing things so let's
just check this out on at the home page
I'm going to refresh over here and now
because I'm not logged in we only see
the login button
so if I click log in and log in then we
go to the home page now we only see the
logout button because I'm logged in now
okay so we want to extend this not just
on the home page but to every other view
as well so I'm going to go to the login
page and paste that in here save it and
I'm going to go to the profile page and
I'm gonna paste this in right here as
well
so let's save that and check it out on
the browser so I'm on the home page
and I can see that I'm logged in if we
go to the profile page I can still see
I'm logged in because I can see my
profile if I log out then now I can just
see the login page right and if I go to
profile doesn't let me and that's
because we've not actually sent that
user right to the login page so we need
to go back to our authentication routes
and where we go to the login page we
need to remember send the user along so
we say user is request user makes sense
because currently we're not sending that
but we're still in the login view trying
to check if that user exists but we're
not sending anything down so let's save
this now and let's go back and try this
again remember if I go to profile then
it redirects me now to login and we only
see that login button if I do login
then we only see the logout button again
so this is how we can conditionally
control what we show in our application
dependent on our login status</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
