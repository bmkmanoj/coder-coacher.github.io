watching jQuery for beginners in lesson
two
what is jQuery Wow okay so jQuery is a
massive free open-source JavaScript
library
it is not a programming language in its
own right now if you look carefully guys
you'll see this is all in capital
letters and that's because a lot of
people get confused here when they first
start using jQuery they think it's a
separate programming language and they
don't bother learning JavaScript you
think oh jQuery is easier I'll use that
instead jQuery is not a programming
language it's a JavaScript library its
main aim is to make working with
JavaScript much easier and you're gonna
benefit hugely from knowing the core
essentials of JavaScript first okay so
it is not a programming language it's a
library
so what can't jQuery do for as well it
makes working with the Dom that's the
document object model much much easier
whereas before we'd have to jump through
hoops in vanilla JavaScript to try and
grab a particular element deep in your
document now with jQuery we can just use
a CSS selector to grab that element and
do what we want with it in JavaScript so
much easier when it comes to working
with the Dom it also makes working with
animations much easier as it does with
events handling and also Ajax which
we've not really discussed in any of my
playlists yet it makes that really
simple - now don't worry about Ajax so
much yeah I'm gonna do a whole playlist
on that in the future plus it does loads
more stuff such as make things across
browser compliant which is a cool cool
feature basically that means less time
debugging your death issues in vanilla
JavaScript for example when we use
events in JavaScript in normal
JavaScript sometimes there's some
differences between browsers in how they
kind of process that code or interpret
that code now jQuery takes those
differences away so there's a one
solution fits all approach which means
guys more time working on your website
and fixing books so you can have a much
better website at the end of it all
right it also has a cool feature
jQuery this is called
and chaining is essentially applying
different methods or effects or whatever
you want to call them to an element in
one line much like this here now we're
going to get into chaining later on so
you might not know what this is at the
minute so don't worry about that
essentially what it means at the core is
that the code is less of the bulks it's
much easier to read and things get rick
written much much quicker all right so
really cool
finally there are plugins galore for
jQuery right if jQuery isn't enough on
its own for you then you can go out
there and you can get an image slider
plug-in to make an image slide or you
can go out and get a form enhancement
plug-in so make your forms work
differently pretty much whatever you
want to get a plug-in for you can go out
there and get it now I'm not saying
that's always the best way to do things
it's sometimes quite lazy and you might
need some specific functionality in
which case you want to make your own
code but for quick solutions plugins are
great and there's tons of them out there
so in short just to summarize and we'll
say this much jQuery to JavaScript is
like a sat-nav to account it's not going
to make you a great driver but it will
make getting from point A to B much
easier and quicker so I hope you're
looking forward to learning all about
jQuery don't forget to subscribe to make
sure you catch all the updates and I'll
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
