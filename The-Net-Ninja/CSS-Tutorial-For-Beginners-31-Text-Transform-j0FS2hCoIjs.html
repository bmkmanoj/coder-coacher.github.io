in this video we're gonna talk about
transforming text that's coming up ah
right now before we go into the code
what exactly do we mean by the word
transform well by that we mean change
the location of a word so in this
example here we've got a point along and
then if we change it to this version of
hello where we capitalize the first
letter with a capital letter we'd say
that transformation is capitalization so
it's all to do the letter case in here
from lower to upper case so now we know
that let's jump into the code and play
around ah
all right there so there is not much to
cover in this video but I do want to
show you a few things when it comes to
text transform and we're going to
transform the text on a few different
elements on this page let's get started
with this p-type here and it's inside
the header so we'll do our header select
the first of all that idea and then grab
the P tag within that and that's just
gonna grab this one here and we want to
apply a text transformation to this
element now the property name for what
transform a text is simply text -
transform that's all you need to
remember and now brackets is giving me
this selection here capitalized we'll
see in a minute I'm going to do that for
you full width I'm not going to go
through because probably you'll never
need to use it in Harriett we already
know what that does it just inherits the
style from the parent element lowercase
forces everything to be lowercase not
make sure that no text transform can be
applied to this element and uppercase
makes everything okay so we're just
going to see what a few of these do
first of all we'll capitalize and that's
gonna be for this pizza key remember so
I'm going to save this now and let's
have a look what it does in the browser
okay cool so that's this sentence here
every letter every word rather now has
got a capital letter at the beginning so
that's what capitalized does he takes
every word and it gives it a capital
letter you can see in the cold that's
not the case you know we've not got
capital letters and seven the first one
here where it says welcome but in the
browser it capitalizes every first
letter of every word all right
so that's really good for titles now
well
we do well let's go after these P tax
here we'll just say body direct
descendant P and that's just going to
grab these Hyrum because these are the
only direct descendent Peas
oh and this one here so what we'll do is
we'll give these now a text
transformation of a case if we can spell
it roughly there we go okay sure always
know you've got it right in brackets
because it'll be orange otherwise it's
not gonna be any color whatsoever well
it'd be black so let's save that and
view it again in a browser and that's
not work which is absolutely brilliant
just what I expected how would all right
a transformation that's why guys don't
pay any attention to me go find someone
else to teach your CSS seriously let's
review this again then in a browser
okay cool there we go now
so all these are now capitals so that's
what uppercase to us and I'm pretty sure
you'll know what lowercase does it's
gonna make everything lowercase so you
see here these are all capitalized and
this one is here
well hopefully they're gonna disappear
now
yeah there we go all these hello they're
ninjas they don't have a capital H
anymore and this welcome at the top no
longer has a capital W so capitalized in
Harriette lowercase non uppercase that's
about it guys we'd apply this non rule
here if say for example this P tag is
inheriting a text transform so we've got
the body selector here and we're saying
okay text transform popper cakes yeah so
by default every element in the body tag
is going to be transformed to be
uppercase including these P tags
including these H ones and hey tutus
everything right however say we don't
want these peas here or this P to
inherit that style well we can put text
transform done and that's going to
override this uppercase so that's about
it I said this we're going to be pretty
short just from the five minutes if you
have any questions about this whatsoever

all of those as soon as I can otherwise
