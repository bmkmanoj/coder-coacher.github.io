yo guys what the hell's going on you're
watching CSS for beginners less than 35
and today we're gonna talk all about the
paragraph spacing so that's coming up
Wow okay so in the last lesson we talked
about line height right and we said that
the distance between the two lines of
text within one paragraph tag can be
controlled with the line height property
remember we give the line height I'll
hide this gonna allow for the font size
and an additional space between the
lines okay but how do we control this
space between the paragraph tags that is
not the line height we use a property
called margin to do that and that's all
part of the box model and we're going to
talk about the box model in more detail
in the next lesson but I just wanted to
give you a quick introduction to the
margin property and how it can be used
with P tags to control the space between
those tags okay so we're gonna jump back
into the code now and do just that
Wow okay guys so I'm back here in the
code and I've already given the P tag to
these two properties here giving it a
font size of 14 pixels and I've given it
a line height of 2 m/s and remember m/s
our relative measurements so what this
is saying is take 14 pixels and times it
by 2 so that's gonna be a 28 pixel light
height and if you remember that's going
to be the 14 pixels that we need for the
actual size of the fonts and then an
additional 14 pixels of space so it's
gonna be 7 pixels at the top and 7
pixels at the bottom that's gonna give
the overall line height value of 28
pixels okay so that makes sense so now
what we're gonna do is give this a
margin bottom property or let's say 32
pixels okay now you can control the
margin top margin bottom margin left
margin right and we're not going to do
that now like I say I'm going to cover
the box model in the next video and
we'll go into that then for other P tags
I'm just going to use a margin bottom
because that's all we really need to use
to separate the P tags okay so what
we're seeing here is look at the end of
the P tag
I want a margin of 32 pixels before the
next P text arts makes sense right so
let's save that now and view it in a
browser see what it's done
are either so we've got this 14 pixel
font size a line height of essentially
28 pixels that's two M's and then we've
got this 32 pixel gap at the bottom of
each paragraph tag and that is the
margin bottom all right if I just
right-click this and inspect element and
a hover of this P tag can you see those
orange parts there that is the margin of
the P tag right so the bottom part is
larger that's the 32 pixel part the one
that we applied and you can see also
they have a small thin orange margin at
the top now that is a default browser
style okay the browser's automatically
implement a margin top of one M
generally speaking so that is the
default browser styles at play we
evolved originated from the bottom and
we've applied a 32 pixel margin and so
there's a bigger gap at the bottom
between the P tags okay
so that about covers it this was a
really quick lesson like I said we're
going to go into more detail about the
margin and padding and other ways to
control the box model properties in the
next video so until then guys if you
