your 18th janggo tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at how we
can make an Accounts app to control our
signing flow all right and so now we
have listed all of our different
articles we can click on an article so
that we can see them in detail I think
now is the time that we can open up this
blog so that other users not just me the
administrator can also add blocks now if
I wanted to add all the users then I
suppose what I could do is go into the
jungle administration and click on add
new user and I could add a new user and
then they could then do some stuff
however this is not really a good user
experience I mean if I go to Facebook
and want an account I don't email the
administrator say look can you sign me
up for an account on the Facebook admin
side and then some of the details now
that's not what happens
ideally what we want to do is allow a
user to sign up from the front-end so
create some kind of form and then allow
that user to fill in the form to sign up
for an account and then when they have
an account they can also add blogs or
articles from the front-end - we don't
want our everyday users logging into the
admin section because this is for admin
users only so against what we need to do
then is create a new app within our
project which is going to allow this
kind of functionality we can create
templates within that app - logger use
in or sign up your user now fortunately
Django comes with a lot of user
authentication stuff already baked into
it so if we go to settings inside Django
notic and scroll down inside installed
apps we can see this one right here
Django doc contributor off so a lot of
this functionality is already installed
into Django and that's why we can add
new users over here in the admin section
we just want to kind of take that
functionality and add it into the
front-end so that we can add new users
from the front-end but a lot of it like
I said is already done for us so this is
gonna be simpler than you might think
so the first thing I like to do then is
create a new app to handle our user
authentication or our user accounts so
to do that we need to open up the
console and I'm gonna just cancel out
the process over here and play this so
we have a little bit of room and then to
create a new accounts app we need to say
Python manage dot py then start oops
start up and call this accounts click
enter and that's going to create a new
accounts app for us and we can see that
up here now over on the left cool so
inside here we have these different
files already and the first thing we
need to do is register this accounts up
inside the settings so I've just closed
that down when I should have just kept
it open and inside here we want to add
in accounts so then Django knows look we
have this new accounts app in our
project as well so let's save that and
the next thing we need to do then is
start to create the URLs for this
accounts up that what URL do we want the
user to go to for example if they want
to sign up or log in so let's create
first of all that URLs file inside the
accounts up so new file URLs dot py and
inside here the first thing we need to
do is say from Django doc conf WR Elle's
imports URL we do this at the top of
every URLs file if we're going to
articles you can see exactly the same
thing in fact why not just copy this and
paste it up here so we import the views
which we have over here we've not done
anything inside there yet and we also
import URL right here because we need
this to create URLs inside this file the
next thing I want to do is give this an
app name remember this is the way we
kind of namespace our URLs and I'm going
to call this accounts and then
underneath we can start creating our URL
patterns so URL patterns not equal to
and then inside this we want to say we
want a new URL shifter along and inside
this URL we need to say first of all the
path of the URL so this is going to be
the signup URL first of all I remember
it's a raw string and the first thing we
want to do is a look
correct say that it begins with this so
like that then we want the URL to be
signup forward slash and then a dollar
sign to say this is the end okay so
that's the first parameter right there
the second one is going to be the view
that we send the user to if they go to
this URL
now we've not created the views yet but
let's just pop this in views which we
imported up here dot signup on the
scroll view and we'll create this for
you in a second
lastly we'll give this a name which is
going to be equal to sign up so if on
the front end and the templates we want
to send a user to this template or this
URL instead of hard-coding the URL what
we can do is use this URL name later on
okay so that's how you are l's for this
app sorted so far remember the next
thing we need to do for these to work is
use them or include them in our route
URLs over here so much like we did with
articles we can do the same thing for
our accounts URLs so the way we're gonna
do that is by saying mrl then inside raw
string then it's going to be carrot
accounts /i remember we don't put the
the little dollar sign here because this
is not the end of the URL something
comes after it these things over here
come after it okay
so that's the first parameter the second
parameter is going to be include and
which you are else do we want to include
well it's going to be the account URLs
so we say account dot URLs
alright so now these URLs are registered
inside this URL file so that when we go
to forward slash accounts whatever we
put after it for example signup will be
handled inside this file okay so the
next thing we need to do is make this
view so that when someone goes to
forward slash accounts forward slash a
sign up then we use this view to dictate
what happens so let's open up the views
file and create that view now so the
first thing we want to do is
define a function and this function is
called sign up review and it takes the
request object right here and inside
this function right now what we want to
do is just render some kind of template
a signup template so we'll say return
and then render remember render is
already imported here for us which is
cool and inside here we have the request
object first of all then it's the
template that we want to render we've
not made this yet but it will be in the
accounts folder forward slash sign up
dot HTML so we're sending back this
template right here so let's save that
and create that template inside here
we'll say new folder templates and then
inside that we need a new folder again
which is going to be accounts and that's
this part right here so we've seen the
accounts folder inside templates then we
need a new file called signup dot HTML
alright so this is the template then for
this signup page so again this is going
to extend the base layout so to do that
we need to say curly braces percentage
sign to open up our template tags then
we say extends and in single quotes the
base underscore layout dot HTML
okay so we're extending that template
and again we need to define our block of
content which you want to put in that
template so again template tags and then
block and the block name is content
remember you can find that by going to
your base layout template right here
this is the block name content so let's
cross this off and go back to sign up
let's end the block and then finally we
need to just put something inside this
block so it gets injected into that
template for now I'm just gonna do a
simple h1 so we'll call this sign up
whoo okay then so what's happening here
well first of all we've created our
accounts up then inside that we've
created some URLs for the sign up page
right here so we've used this URL or
this URL file inside
this URL file right here so we say okay
when someone goes to forward slash
accounts then I want you to use these
account URLs right here so to get to
this one over here we have to go to
forward slash accounts forward slash is
sign up when that happens I want you to
look in the views file and use this
function right here sign up view so
inside views we have this function right
here what this does is render a template
which is in the accounts folder and it's
called sign up dot HTML which is all
right here so I've got there in the end
let's now try this in a browser the
first thing we need to do is run the
server so we'll say Python manage py or
run server and then skew over to the
browser and we'll just go back to the
articles page over here and if we now go
to accounts forward slash signup then we
should get the signup page yep we get
the signup page right there at the
minute just a h1 but this will be the
place where we do our form for users to
sign up and that is going to be coming
in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
