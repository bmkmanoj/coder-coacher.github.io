this react app on the front end so the
first thing we want to do is grab our
console and I'm just going to right
click and start a new console over here
in YouTube because I like to keep our
graph keep our server running in the
background so we can always query it in
the future
so we'll right-click go to new console
and press starts then we need to CD into
this directory in the graph QL playlist
so I'll just right click and copy the
full path so I can just paste it over
here because I'm super lazy so CD change
directory paste that in then we're in
the correct directory now this is where
we want to create our work react app but
before we do that we need to install
that package create react app so we'll
say NPM install and then it creates - it
react up and then you want to pass the
global flag so - G that's going to
install it globally onto your computer
so we can use it from any directory
whatsoever alright cool so once that's
installed we can use it to create this
application so we just say create react
- up then we give this app or project
folder a name now I'm going to call this
client ok
and the reason I'm calling this client
is because it's going to contain all of
our client side project code so we have
a folder over here called server we're
also going to have a folder in this
directory called client right so we're
splitting up the server code from the
client code and essentially they're
gonna be kind of two separate projects
and the client is going to be querying
the server alright so let us now run
this command it's just going to take a
couple of minutes to create this kind of
boilerplate react application for you
you can already see this client folder
right here but like I say we'll just
take a couple of minutes to fully create
that application so I'll see you in a
minute when it's done alright then so
that has successfully created this
application for us and if we expand the
client folder we're gonna see it is
populated now with a load of different
files and folders we'll explore those in
a minute but first of all if we open
back up the terminal we can see that we
have now access to a few different
commands inside the client directory so
we have NPM start which is going to
start the
development server npm run build which
is going to bundle the app into static
files for production etc so we're
primarily just gonna be concerned about
this npm start once you start a
development server and serve up our
front-end application before we do that
we need to CD into client
so CD client now we're inside the client
folder we can say npm start and this is
going to start up a development server
to serve up our application alright so
hopefully in a second it's going to open
up in a browser and it looks something
like this
cool so this is our front-end
application right and it's been served
up from a development server which is
listening to port 3000 now contrast that
to our graph Cubase server which is
listening to port 4000 so we have two
servers on the go here right it's not
all one application we don't have graph
give our server also serving up our
react up on the front side nope that's
not the case we have a graphic of our
server as a separate entity listening to
Paul 4000 listening for requests and we
also have a development server listening
to port 3000 which is serving up our
react application right so these are two
separate things and yeah in the future
if we wanted to build this up for
production this project this front-end
project we could have it served from the
same Express server but for the sake of
this tutorial I don't want to do that I
want to keep it simple and keep these
two things separate okay so remember the
ultimate goal here is to query from this
front-end application our graph QL
server alright and then we triva
information from that and display in
some kind of application on the front
end so that's what we're aiming to do
now to do that in our console we're
gonna need the graph to our server
at all times running on port 4000 over
here and in our other tab we're gonna
need to be running our work development
server to serve up this react
application so we need those two tabs on
the go right okay so let's just have a
little peek at this code that it's
created for us inside the client folder
so
first of all we have the node modules
which are all the different dependencies
that we need to run this application on
the front end right so although the
stuff in there don't need to worry too
much about that we also have a public
folder for serving kind of public files
including the index dot HTML file and
this is the file which is initially
served right but our react application
is injected right here into the root div
that's how react works right it injects
content dynamically so we have that then
we have the source folder here which is
where all of our react code is going to
go and the file which is first kicked
off is this index J s you'll notice we
have a bit of import stuff at the top
and then we have this react Dom render
and what we're doing is where we are
rendering the root application which
we're importing right here right so that
roots kind of component right there is
this thing up J s so this is the stuff
that's being rendered into the index
file which we saw in the browser that
react logo and the little Welcome spiel
below all that kind of stuff is inside
here now there's a couple of things I
just want to get rid of that I don't
want to worry about for the sake of this
tutorial so let's just get rid of this
stuff this stuff down here
I'm also going to get rid of a couple of
things in the routes component so let's
go to app KS and get rid of this CSS
file now app dot CSS is just the CSS for
this component we're going to be using
index CSS for this series so let's get
rid of that and we also don't need the
logo up there so let's get rid of that
and a lot of this stuff we're gonna
delete as well everything inside the div
let's save that for now we can get rid
of app dot CSS over here so let's delete
that and also let's delete apt SJS
because we don't need that for this
series and let's get rid of this
serviceworker and logo SVG as well okay
so let's just keep it simple that's the
reason I'm doing this I don't want to
overwhelm you with different files
because this is not going to be an
extensive react course I'm just showing
you how to use Apollo with react so we
can make graph queue
queries from the front end all right if
you need a refresher on react I've got a
series on this channel you can check out
the link is down below or feel free to
check out any other tutorial on it
YouTube as well alright so now we have
this root component now which is being
rendered to the Dom now it's got a class
name of app but I'm gonna get rid of
that and just give this an ID and coin
main all right this is for kind of
stylistic purposes later on so we have
this div now and we could just play some
content inside there we'll put a h1
I'll say something like ninjas reading
list
oops list all right good good I cannot
do this list right h1 so let's save that
now and if we check this out in the
front end it's gonna look something like
this now all right so I said a minute
ago that we're just going to use index
dot CSS to control all of our CSS so
let's just play around with this a tiny
bit I'm going to get rid of this stuff
here and instead I'll just say the
background is going to be EEE which is
kind of like a light gray and then also
the font family is going to be something
called in quotations new neato semi bold
all right so you may not have this font
installed on your computer if not just
use Arial or something like that this is
a fun I like that I've got installed on
my computer so it will work all right so
again let's just check this out in a
browser and you can see the font has
changed and also the background color so
now we have our basic react app up and
running in the next tutorial we'll take
it a little bit further and create a
component to list out our different
books</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
