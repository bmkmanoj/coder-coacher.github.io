sixth webpack tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at the SAS
loader so in the last video what we
created this simple CSS file then we use
the Styles loader and the CSS loader to
import that CSS into our JavaScript and
the Dom where we needed it now web pack
can also help Paul's turn SAS code into
CSS as well and we can do that using
these SAS loader so what we're going to
do in this tutorial is just transform
this into a SAS file then will transport
us into CSS and then require it as
normal here so first of all let's change
the extension of this so I'm going to go
to rename and I'm going to call this
intro component s CSS so that's a CSS
sorry that's a SAS extension now so I'm
going to use a couple of sass rules here
now if you don't know what SAS is check
out my set for beginners playlist but
I'm just going to keep this really
simple I'm going to declare a variable
up here at the top and I'm going to call
this a main color and I'm going to set
this equal to seven seven seven seven B
B okay so that's a variable now which we
can reference down here so instead of
say background maroon this time I'm
gonna say background it's gonna be main
color like so cool also we can nest
styles in SAS so let's do a quick one of
those we'll say h1 text transform
uppercase ok let's save that and what
that is going to do is target if we open
the index dot HTML this thing right here
because it's a nested style is inside
this ok so now what we need to do is
install the SAS loader now the SAS
loader depends on another package called
node SAS to work so we're actually going
to have to install both of these those
two packages so I'm going to open up the
terminal right now and install those
I just want to navigate into the web
pack pull a list first of all
then i'm gonna run npm install and then
first of all node sass and then the sass
loaded we're gonna say both of these two
are def dependencies so hit enter
let those install okay so once both of
those have installed just check your web
pack config rather not that the PACU
stop Jason and come down here to see
even notice ass is there yet and the
sass loader cool so now we can use them
so the first thing we need to do is
configure this loader in the web config
file now we don't need to create a new
loader for it because now instead of
testing for CSS we're going to test for
sass files so let's just tack on an S at
the start of there this time it's going
to look for this extension which is a
sass file and what we want to do is then
also pipe the sass loader on into this
thing right here so let's just do
exclamation mark sass loader so again
what that's going to do is convert the
sass into CSS then the CSS loader is
going to put that CSS into our
JavaScript the style loader then puts
that CSS into the Dom okay so we're
tacking all of those three together so
let's save that now and if we come down
here and run web pack and hit enter
you'll notice that we get an error and
that is because in script one we have
not changed this to s CSS because no
longer are we requiring the CSS file
we're requiring the sass file so if we
save that now and rerun web pack this
time it should work okay cool so let's
just check this out in a browser and now
you'll see we've got the text transform
of the h1 and we've got that new purplee
background color as well sweet so that
is the sass loader and that's how we can
work with sass using webpack so that is
the last video in this series there is
more to web cut than this this is just
kind of like a beginner series and in
fact what we're going to be doing right
after this series is a react one and in
that I'm gonna be using the web pack dev
server and I'm also going to be
converting JSX code to a vanilla
JavaScript using webpack as well so make
sure you stay
for that one and check out that if you
want to learn more so until then any
questions leave those down below
although I don't forget to share
subscribe and like and I'll see you guys
in the very next playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
