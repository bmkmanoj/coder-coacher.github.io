13th CSS animation tutorial and in this
video we're going to go through another
example this time we're going to make
some rotating panels using CSS
animations ah
alright then dudes so as you can see
what I've got open here is the panel's
dot HTML file and that's in the rotate
examples folder and they've also I'm
going to open this style that CSS as
well so open those two up and let me
just scoot this in so you can see what's
going on and they're basically we've got
all these panels right here and it looks
like a bit of junk code mini but we are
going to make it look pretty cool and
apply some neat hover effects and then
basically this is just a ul with the
class of panels right here and in the UL
we've got these series of li tex right
now each li tag essentially kind of
contains one panel and each panel has
got a front and a back so the front is a
div with a class of front and the back
is a div with a class of back and
there's different text on each one so
we've got that for each kind of color
yeah you'll notice I've made the color
of the back each time a little bit
lighter than the front just so the hover
effect when we apply is a little bit
kind of nicer all right so then the idea
is that we want to hide this but panel
to begin with kind of scoot it up behind
the front one yeah and then when we
hover it over the front one we want to
appear to twirl around and this shows
the back of the card essentially that's
the kind of effect we're going for so
how the hell are we going to do this
well let's go over to these styles that
CSS and see what's going on over here so
this is all pretty standard stuff to
begin with now you can see we're styling
the wrapper the panels the Li tags each
Li tag has got a width of 25% which is
why there's four in a row
and Rob being floated left and also
these div tags inside their lives which
are these two things here front and back
they are styled so they've got 100%
width padding 50% top and bottom just so
they look like a square and yeah all
kind of basic stuff so what we're going
to do is start styling these up now and
prepare them for the animations begin
with so I said the first thing what we
want to do is hide this bug card we want
it to appear built behind this four
so that when we hover over it then it
shows the back right so the way I'm
going to do that is by using the rotate
and property the rotate Y property so
that it rotates 90 degrees that we can't
see it because when we rotate something
across the Y around the y axis rather
and then when we get it to 90 degrees
it's going to look so thin we can't even
see on the screen okay because this is a
flat 2d object and if we rotate a flat
2d object 90 degrees then we can't see
it technically all right so let's go
after this panel then so I'll need to
say panels div dot but because that's
the back panel and then I'm just going
to apply a transform to it rotate Y and
I'm going to say 90 degrees and now
you're going to see all of those back
panels and vanish yeah unlike service
because we've rotated them around the y
axis which is going down and when you
rotate the 2d object around the y axis
90 degrees when it was kind of faced on
to begin with you can no longer see you
so if we just change this to like 88
you're going to see something very thin
okay so as you increments towards 90 it
gets thinner until 90 it's pretty much
non-existent that's all you can't see it
but it is still there okay
so now what we want to do is kind of
move up behind this front panel and the
way we're going to do that is by
positioning this front panel absolutely
because when we're position something
absolutely we're taking it out of normal
document flow so then anything that was
underneath it kind of zooms up to take
the place that this front one did have
in it normal document flow so this back
one is going to zoom up behind this
front one yeah so let's go after the
front one panels div dot front and then
what we want to do is say position
absolutely take it out a normal document
flow so the other ones scoots are behind
it so now what we've got is the front
panel showing and we've got the back
panel behind it but that's rotated on
the y-axis 90 degrees so we can't see it
anyway so what we want to do when we
hover over one of these things right
essentially what we want to do is
animate this rotate y value here
to zero degrees so the back one kind of
rotates back in but at the same time we
want to rotate this front one along the
y-axis from zero to 90 degrees so that
one's rotating out and the back one's
rotating it at the same time as the
front one is rotating out and that gives
the kind of effect that the CAD is
flipping over so I'm going to show you
that now first of all let's make our
keyframes and we'll call this animation
and twelve all right and then at zero
percent what we are going to say is that
we want to do a transform and it's going
to start off at trim rotate Y zero
degrees like that so it's going to start
off at zero degrees and then when it
gets to 100% we're going to do the same
thing again transform rotate Y to ninety
degrees okay so if you can think about
this when we hover over one of these
cards we're going to apply this
animation to the front of them so we're
going to transform them from zero
degrees rotation across the y axis which
currently is to 90 degree rotation
around the y axis so that will make it
pretty much invisible it will get
shorter and shorter and shorter until
it's invisible
okay so let's apply that right now we'll
say panels Li hover because we want the
hover effect div dot front because we're
just going to apply this to the front
panel to begin with and then we're going
to say animation it's called swirl we're
going to take about nine point two
seconds to do this and we'll say ease in
make it seem a little more natural and
then we want to stay forward so that it
ends up in the same place it doesn't
kind of revert back once the animations
finished okay so now you want to do
something similar for the back panel
let's copy that and paste the same one
down below and this time we want to
change this to back like so and also
instead of going from zero to 90 degrees
we want to go the opposite way around
because it's already 90 degrees we want
to go from Mountain
to zero so that the back one is kind of
flipping in so all we need to say is
reverse right here but this is not quite
right yet we need to do just a couple
more things to make it look better
because at the minute it doesn't look
very natural this twirl effect okay and
the first thing we need to do is put a
delay on this one because we want the
forward one to kind of rotate out first
of all and then we want the backbone to
rotate in to make it a little more
natural so we'll say there's a knot
point two second delay on this back one
right so that after this one rotates out
then this one rotates in so now when we
hover over in fact I'm also going to
make this ease out because that's the
opposite of easing and when we rotate
over one of these dudes now it looks a
little more natural it looks like the
card is turning over okay so there we go
guys that's how to make some flip cards
using CSS animations any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise guys I'm going to
see you in a very next tutorial
