jQuery for beginners lesson 10 and in
this video I want to look at how we can
wrap and unwrap elements using jQuery
Wow okay guys so when I say an element
is wrapped
I just mean there is a parent element
surrounding it for example these Li tags
are right here are surrounded by this UL
tag so we'd say these Li tags are
wrapped with this UL tag yeah
simple so we can control this wrapping
and unwrapping div elements in the HTML
using jQuery dynamically and by that I
mean we could say okay take all of those
I don't know P tact and wrap them in a
div tag all right now you might be
thinking why on earth would you want to
do that well there's a few different
scenarios in which you do it
one scenario I can think of off the top
of my head would be if you have a
contact form for example at the bottom
of that form you have a button and you
don't want that button to be pressed
until all of the fields of that form are
filled in so you could say okay wrap
this button in a div tag which is going
to be styled to disable that button then
when they're all filled out those form
fields you could say okay use the unwrap
method now on that button to unwrap that
div so that people can click it okay
that's just one example so what we're
going to do in this tutorial is take a
look at these three methods root right
here
they're the methods are used to wrap and
unwrap elements and then what we'll do
is take a look at an example combining a
few of these with some functions or
events using javascript so we'll take a
look at this one first of all wrap and
what this does guys is just take all of
the matched elements that we use jQuery
to find and then it wraps them
individually in a given tag so for
example we could say go out and get
other sections if that will do that
let's say oops don't assign section and
that's going to bring us back an array
full of those section tags those jQuery
objects of those section tags and then
we can say wrap and then within these
brackets right here we just say which
tag we want to wrap them with okay
we pass it in a string format so I'm
just gonna say did but an empty div tag
now we don't need to put the closing div
down because JavaScript and HTML are
clever enough to realize that if you
want to wrap something in a tag then it
needs a closing tag so that takes care
of itself for you you just need to put
the opening tag so right here my friends
what this is doing is saying okay get
all those section tags then wrap them
individually each one with a div tag
alright so we'll save this now we'll
come over here expand this refresh and
I'm going to open the development tool
so we can take a look at that HTML and
if we open the main content we find the
wrapper first of all then we've got
these three empty div tags which we've
just put in okay
because we said to take each section
right there and wrap them in a div tag
and it's taken each section and doing
exactly that alright so we've wrapped
them now what if we want to unwrap them
okay well we can do that we'll copy that
paste this down below and this time I'm
going to put on wrap and this time we
don't need to specify anything in the
parenthesis because what it's going to
do is just look at its immediate parent
element the thing that's wrapping it and
it's just going to take it away doesn't
matter what it is whether it's a div a
ul anything whatsoever it's just gonna
unwrap it okay
so let's save this again and refresh
over here and then if I inspect the
element again hopefully we're not going
to see those div tags wrapping the
sections anymore and we don't cool
alright so that's a wrap and unwrap the
final one I want to show you is wrap all
okay so what this does in fact down
write out first of all we'll come down
here and we'll say wrap all just like
that and we want to wrap them all in a
div tag so it's going to get all of
those sections together and then it's
going to put one empty div tag around
all of them not each one individually
but all of them as one whole okay
so let's save this and view it over here
if I inspect the element again open this
up and we should see the wrapper then an
empty div tag just one empty div tag
then
rapping all of these sections in one
okay so that is the difference between
rap which wraps each section
individually or each element that you
grab individually and then wrap all
which takes them all treats them as a
whole and wraps them all in one tack all
right okay then so we've seen all those
three methods individually now let's do
a quick example so I'm gonna just
quickly delete all this right here and
the first thing I want to do is edit the
HTML I'm gonna put a little button at
the top right here just bear with me
want to do this let's we'll call this
div class equals button we'll give it
some style properties we're gonna say
the text-align:center then I'll say
padding is gonna be about 10 pixels
background orange that'll do it doesn't
need to be great just a little button
that spans the width of the page and
then I'll say inside unwrap all right so
if I save this now and view this over
here what I want to do is when we click
this button and I'll expand it when we
click this button I want to unwrap all
of these sections when I take that
wrapper away from it so that it should
go fullscreen because remember in the
car wood over here we've got this class
of a wrapper surrounding all of these
sections now I want to unwrap that so
that it's no longer contained within the
central column and expands the full
width of the screen and then when you
click it again it rear apps them okay
now you probably wouldn't do this how
many websites I just wanted to show you
a practical example of how we'd use this
with functions and events so the first
thing I want to do is create a few
variables the first one is going to be
the wrapper which is string and it's
gonna be David Clarke equals in a single
quote so we don't escape out the string
wrapper just like that I remember we
don't need to put the close intact
because jQuery jazz
Group tasting I'll be I'll figure that
out themselves we just keep it like that
next variable is the button I need to
grab that from the Dom which is up here
it's got a class of button so I just
need to say put it just like that it's
gonna grab that for me and the last
thing you want to do is create a
variable called wrapped I've set that
equal to true all right then so they're
the three variables I'll explain what
the wrapped one is for later on now the
next thing I want to do is create an
event so that when this is clicked all
the action takes place now I'm going to
use a vanilla JavaScript to do this
because we've not covered events in
jQuery yet so I'll just say button and
then remember we have to unwrap that
element because currently it's got that
jQuery wrapper all around it so we can
use jQuery methods and that's because we
grabbed it using jQuery so to unwrap it
remember all we have to do is specify
which one in the array of jQuery objects
it's returned we want and because
there's only one of them is going to be
in the zero of position so that's what
I'm doing right there
remember we covered this in an earlier
lesson it was all about wrapping and
unwrapping elements for me using jQuery
so now I've already I can use the
vanilla JavaScript methods on it and the
method I want to use or rather the
events I want to use is the onclick
event and by the way I cover events in
JavaScript in my JavaScript for
beginners course so if you want to check
that out you can I'll leave the link
down below and we're gonna set this
equal to a function and then within this
function is where all the action is
gonna take place
now then I'm gonna do a quick check to
see whether this wrapper is currently
there or not because if it's there then
we need to unwrap it if it's not there
we need to rat it right so I'll say if
wrapped and that's this variable here
currently is set to true and I've set it
to true because to begin with the
wrapper is there so it's true is
currently wrapped okay so I wrapped then
we want to unwrap it else we're going to
wrap it up okay so the first thing we
need to do is grab oops the sections
like that that's going to turn all those
sections for us and then we just need to
say on rap and that's gonna unwrap them
and it's going to take that div wrapper
away because that is the the nearest
parent remember when you say unwrap it
just finds the nearest parent and takes
it away okay so that's what we've done
there and under here we need to get the
sections again because this is where
we're wrapping them section and then dot
wrap oops
dots wrap and now we don't want to use
just wrap because that's going to put a
div around each different section we
want to wrap all and then that's just
going to put the wrapper around each
knot around each one around them all as
a whole
okay so it's going to put this back at
the top so red pole and then within that
we want to put the wrapper which is this
variable right here
remember div class equals a wrapper like
that and then we need to change this
variable right here so if it's true then
we're going to unwrap it and if it's all
wrapped we need to change this default
because now it's all wrapped yeah it
makes sense so let's do that
wrapped equals false and then next time
it comes around it's gonna say is it
true no it's false okay then I've got
here then unwrap it okay so that's what
we'll do well sorry not unwrap it then
wrap it so we'll set that wrapped
because the truth here and so each time
is changing and it's gone wrapping and
wrapping depending on what it is before
okay last thing I want to do is just
change the text on this button each time
you click it because if I click it I
want it to change to wrap and then if I
click again change back to unwrap okay
so what I want to do is come down here
and I'll do button got text and I've not
done this little zero here because it's
a jQuery method this text okay so we can
just call it on this itself and we've
covered this in an earlier tutorial and
the text here is gonna be wrap so once
we've unwrapped it now this is going to
become wrap
and then the opposite is gonna be true
for down below I'll just copy this and
paste it down here and we'll call this
one wrap right through that and I think
we're pretty much done guys
so let's save that and refresh over here
now if you expand this and click this
it's gonna unwrap make it fullscreen
like that's gonna take that wrapper away
and then if I click it again it's gonna
bring it back and wrap it keep on
clicking it hours of endless fun amazing
alright so you made a one that on your
website but you can imagine this could
be something like make fullscreen for a
video or something I don't know and it
makes you fullscreen the possibilities
guys are endless with what you can do
with this so that about covers this
tutorial if you have any questions
