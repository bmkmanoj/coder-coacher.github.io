second flexbox tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about flex
containers oh and don't so in the
introduction tutorial I gave you a quick
and a mean quick overview of how flexbox
works and it went something like this we
first have to create a container an
element with a display type of flex so
that every direct descendent element
within it then becomes a flex item so
once we've done that we can then control
the behavior of those flex items using
several flexbox CSS properties I applied
to the items themselves or the container
and that behavior includes things like
how they grow within the container I'll
have a shrink
relative to each other or whether they
stack on top of each other or side by
side and that kind of thing so there's a
lot of things we can do with them in
this tutorial we're just going to take a
look at creating a container and some
flex items within them just to have a
look at its most basic behavior okay
then gang so I'm in this index dot HTML
file in the root of the project folder
and remember you can find these files on
my github page I'll leave the link down
below if you want to follow along and
I've also got open this style CSS a file
which is in the root directory as well
so this index file dead simple just
gonna head right here with a title and
that style dot CSS file linked up then
in the body we've just got a class of
wrapper on a div which is going to keep
everything within a central column on
the page so what I'm going to do is
create an element which will be called
our Flex container so I'll make a div
tag then I'm going to give this a class
of Flex
- container so there's our container now
within it we want to include some Flex
items so let's do another div this time
I'm going to give it a class of box and
I'm also going to give it another class
of one so I'll copy that and I'm going
to paste it a couple of times a down
below like that and I'm going to give
this one a class of two and the
reasonable giving them separate classes
as well as box is so that I can style
them differently so now we've got our
container there and our Flex items to be
within
directly blue air within it so let's go
to the star dot CSS and the way we make
this a Flex container is just by using
the display type of flex so we'll say
flex - container that's the element we
won and we'll give this a display of
flex and voila that now guys is a Flex
container but I don't want to show you
this just yet I want the effect to be a
little bit more significant after we've
stared boxes so the starwars boxes first
of all so every single one of the boxes
is going to have a height on 100 pixels
it's also going to have a min width
value of 100 pixels - now I'm going to
start each one differently and I'm just
going to give them different background
pull it so the first one is going to
have a background of red the second one
which is - is going to have a background
of blue and then the third one which is
three is going to have a background of
green all right so now we've got this
flag kind of thing going on over here
and you noticed each one of these
elements right here is going full width
and that's the default behavior right of
block level elements they take off the
full width of the available space
horizontally and these all block level
elements so that's why it's doing it
currently ok check out what happens when
I uncomment this and set the container
to flex boom now all of these are flex
items and this is the default behavior
of flex items they stack left to right
in a row like that okay and now that
these are Flex items we can do all kinds
of cool things with them to change how
they grow how they shrink we can add
space between them we can make them
stack on top of each other lots of
different things all right now I want
you to imagine as well how we do this
with out flex we'd use floats right so
I'm going to go through that example and
just demonstrate how much harder it is
to do this with float than it is with
flex so first of all I'm going to give
this Flex container a background color
of white just so we can see where that
content
at all times over there so this is the
container and each of these flex items
are within that container so we normally
do this by floating those elements to
the left so let's get rid at the minute
of this display type of flex let's give
it the flow way or so float left and yet
we get the same effect except we now
have that element collapse of the parent
element that white background is nowhere
to be seen and that's because this
element has collapsed it's got a height
of zero and so we can't see that
background and the reason it's collapsed
is because we floated every element
within it so what we need to do is some
kind of clear fix and I would normally
do that by grabbing this element and
doing a siedel class after then
inserting a blank string like that not
contact content and then after that sale
its displayed type to block and then
finally clearing all the elements above
it why did I say clearly okay play both
now we get that height back but this
seems a little bit happy right and to be
honest I just prefer to use the Flex
method instead much easier we don't have
to worry about clearing all of those
floats and we get that behavior as
default pretty cool right so that is how
we define Flex containers and how we
create Flex elements within them in the
next tutorial we're going to dive in and
start looking at how we can grow these
elements using Flex grow all right
so until then if you have any questions
