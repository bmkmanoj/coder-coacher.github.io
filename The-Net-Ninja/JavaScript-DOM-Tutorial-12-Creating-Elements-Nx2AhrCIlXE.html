twelfth javascript in the Dom tutorial
and in this video I'm gonna show you how
we can create elements and then place
them into the Dom all right then so in
the last tutorial I showed you how we
could hook up the submit event listener
to this file so that when we click
Submit it prevents the default action
and the page does not reload and it logs
the value of this input field to the
console so really what we want to do is
grab this value and then use it so we
can add a new element here and add the
book to the list so we're going to
insert a new Li tag if you like now to
do that we're going to need to create a
HTML element on the fly in JavaScript
and then insert it into the Dom so I'm
going to show you how to do that in this
tutorial so if we go back to the code we
can see so far we already grabbed a
reference to the book we attached the
event listener to it so that on submit
it prevents the default action and we
grab the value of that input field and
we're going to use this in a second so
the first thing we need to do is start
to create some new elements so that we
can input them to the Dom so let's take
a look at what elements we need to
create exactly if we inspect one of
these we can see that each one is an li
tag inside that we have a span with a
class of name for the title and a span
it with a class and delete for the
delete button so we need to create three
elements right here the Li and then to
spawn tags so let's create some of those
elements over here I'll get rid of the
console that one first of all we don't
need that anymore and then underneath
I'm going to do a little comment saying
create elements and then the first thing
I want to do is create the Li tag so
I'll say Const li is gonna be equal to
documents and the way we create an
element is by using the create element
method so create element and then this
is going to be an li so we're passing
whatever element we want to create into
a string inside this function so this
has created that element but at the
minute it's not done anything with it
it's just floating around in space if
you like so later on what we're going to
do is input this Li tag into the dot but
for now let's just create the other
elements as well
we need to spam tax one for the book
name and one for the delete button
so again I'll create a constant I'm
going to call this one book name I'm
going to set that equal to document dot
to create elements
and then this is going to be a spun
okay so we've got one span tag now we
also need another span tag for the
delete button source a Const delete BTN
is equal to documents
dot create element
and we're going to create another spam
all right cool so now we've created all
three elements that we need so the next
step is to combine these elements into
the structure we want and then insert
them into the dot now first thing we
need to notice is that the span tags are
nested within the Li tags so we need to
first of all append these to this
element and then we're going to append
the Li element to the UL so we can do
that down here I'm going to say comment
append to DOM and then underneath I'm
going to say Li oops
a lie which is this element we created
right here the Li tag then dot append
child so this is how we add something
into the Dom we use a pen child
so we're saying here we want to grab
this Li and then append a child to it
and the child we want to append is going
to be the book name which is this span
tag right here okay so now we've nested
the spell tag for the book name inside
the Li I want to do the same thing with
this delete button so I'll say allied to
append child and then this is going to
be the delete button and all that does
matter here if this one was to come
before this one then what would happen
is the delete button would appear first
in the DOM and then the book name now
that's not the case over here the name
comes first
then the delete button because what this
thing does right here append child is
add this element right here to the end
of this tag right so it puts it at the
end not the start okay so now we've
added those two elements to the Li the
next thing we want to do is append the
Li to the Dom so we have access to the
list over here which is the UL we grab
that in an earlier tutorial so I can
just used this list variable and down
here I'll say list dot append child and
then we're going to append the LI to the
list
okay so we've created the three elements
we've appended the spun tags to the li
element we created then we've appended
the Li to the list all right so let's go
appear at the bottom of the list when we
add it now this is fine but it won't
work exactly as we want it to just yet
and I'll demonstrate that let's just add
any one joke in here click add and we
get the Li tag but nothing actually
appears in it and that's because we've
created these elements if we inspect it
we've created these elements and we've
appended them to the Dom however we've
not added any text content inside of
them so that's what we need to do now
and we already know how to do that so
let's do another comment here saying add
content and then we need to add text
content to the book name and also to the
delete button so the book name has this
text content and the delete button just
says delete so first of all we'll say
delete BTN dot text content is going to
equal to delete that's fine now the text
content of the book name is going to be
this value that we grabbed from the
input field that the user enters so
we'll say book name dot text content is
going to be equal to value which is this
thing up here that we grabbed so now
we've entered the text content of those
dudes and then we're appending it to the
Dom so let's give this another whirl
I'll just enter any old junk over here
click Add and now we get it right there
but still the delete button is not
showing so let's have a look what's
going on if we right click we can see
the delete button is there is part of
the string so this is happening because
we've not got the class right here of
delete and we don't have the class of
name right here on the span tag so these
are not being styled correctly yet so
that's going to lead us on to the next
tutorial where I'm going to show you how
we can add classes and whatnot to these
different elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
