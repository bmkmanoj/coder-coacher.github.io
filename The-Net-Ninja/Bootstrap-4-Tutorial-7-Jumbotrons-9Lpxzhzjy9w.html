your seventh bootstrap 4 tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
your margins so originally back when I
recorded my bootstrap 3 series I thought
that the bootstrap team came up with the
name of Jumbotrons when you're high what
ever since found out thanks to someone
commenting that the name actually comes
from those big billboard things in the
US which was an education for me because
I had no idea they would call that so
that is a bit about the bootstrap
Jumbotrons etymology in bootstrap terms
basically a Jumbotron is a way to
highlight some kind of marketing message
in a banner like fashion to use it so I
think the best way to understand what a
Jumbotron does is to create one so let's
go into the code and get rid of all this
stuff from with inside the container
that we did in the last lesson so now we
just have this container I'm also going
to get rid of this star tag in the head
as well we don't need that anymore and
I'm going to create a Jumbotron within
this container I remember a container is
the central column that keeps everything
contained within it in the middle of a
web page right so let us create this
Jumbotron I'm going to use a div tag and
give it a class off you guessed it your
bottom and there we go guys we have
created a Jumbotron awesome now if we
take a look in the browser it doesn't
look like much yet just this gray square
blodge in the middle so this essentially
would be our banner and we could put
text or images in it right so that is a
Jumbotron but what if I want a full
width jumbo tube going from left to
right looks like we can see on the
bootstrap website this is kind of like a
jungle term which goes left to right
what if I want to do that well all we
need to do is get rid of the container
which is keeping it within the central
column so if we take off this container
like so and I'll just scoop this over
here save it and now we're going to see
that Jumbotron go all the way from the
left to the right let it go right so
this is all well and good but I want to
show you one little quirk I'm going to
zoom right in on this page and in fact
what I'm going to do as well it's just
alter the background color of this
week's task and we can see it sort a
style and then the background
it's going to be three three three which
is like a really dark charcoal gray and
if we look in the corner now I'll zoom
in a little bit more you can see this
curve right here on the top and bottom
and on the left and right as well I
don't want that I want it to be flush
against the corner up there up there and
down here as well so how do we do that
well we can do it simply by go ahead and
adding another class called
Jumbotron - fluid and if I save that now
this time we're going to see those
curves disappear now it's just a
straight kind of flat Jumbotron tool so
let me just zoom out again but to
default and there is our Jumbotron but
now what I want to do is put some
content inside of it so let's do that so
the first thing we want to do is change
this background to aaaa make it a little
lighter again save that and check it out
okay that's fine and then inside the
Jumbotron I want to add some content so
let's add h1 first of all and we'll say
welcome to the dojo like so and then
underneath that we'll do a key tag and
in this P tag I want to say a guiding
light for the less enlightened we spell
all right and lighten like so okay save
that and check it out in the browser and
okay we've got some text in it but I
don't want it all the way over here to
the left what would be nice is if we
centralize this text in the middle much
like on here on groups tab we've got all
this space on the left and right and the
text is centralized in the middle so how
can we do that what centralized things
in a central column or container yep
it's a container so let us add in the
container around this text so I'll say
div class equals container and then I'm
going to copy that closing bit and add
it right at the end scoot these along a
little bit as well so that and now if we
check this out the browser this is
looking a lot better so we know how
a Jumbotron which goes from left to
right it's flush at the edges no curves
and we have our text which is
centralized in at the center so this is
okay but it's still not looking great
it's a little bit boring at the minute
and the text is a little brilliant in
the center either so in the next lesson
what we're going to do is take a look at
some bootstrap utility classes to liven
up this Jumbotron with additional color
and textiles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
