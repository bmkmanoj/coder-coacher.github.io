tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about the init function alright
then so in the last tutorial we went
ahead and created our very first class
planet and then we created a new object
based on this class which then had all
of these different properties
the name radius gravity system and this
method called orbit as well but we also
said that if we created new instances of
this class for example planet X down
here we'll be creating a new instance
then that object as well is also going
to have exactly the same property values
these things right here as this one so
there won't really be any point in
creating multiple instances because
they're in essence all the same so we
said well what if we want to pass in our
own parameters what gives for example
when we create a new planet we want to
cut in here the name of the planet the
radius of gravity in the system well we
can do that and we do that using this
connect function so this init function
right here is required when we create a
new class of if we can include it then
it would just be fought back to a
standard one that is implemented by
peiser's so we have to include this
first initialization function this sets
up the attribute for us and we said that
it takes this self parameter right here
and this function automatically runs
when we create a new instance so even
though we're not passing this self
parameter within this function right
here that we're setting up a new
instance of this planet it's passed kind
of automatically into this init function
so if we deleted this then it's not
going to work I'm just going to
demonstrate this after saving and I'll
run at this file so now we see this
error and it says it takes zero
positional arguments but one was given
right so one was given but it's not
taking it right here so what actually
give it an argument but in this function
we're not saying we want to take it so
that has to exist so this self parameter
right here refers to the instance of the
object we've created and that's why we
can attach all of these different
attributes to self so that when we
create our instance they're accessible
on this variable alright so now what
we're going to do is pass in to this
function right here this initialization
function
we want to passing some custom values
for these different properties right
here so they're not all the same every
time we create a new object so first of
all let's accept those into this
initialization function so I want to say
name also the radius we need a gravity
and also the system
okay so we're accepting all of those
different things now now when we create
a new instance of this class a new
object we can pass through those
different variables those different
parameters so the name of Haas in this
example is going to be tough so we're
passing that through first because
that's the first one it expects right
there the second one is going to be the
radius so we'll pass through that number
which is 2 and a lot of zeros then if
the gravity which is 5.5 and then
finally the system which is a string
again and that's the hot system okay so
now we're passing this data through to
this constructor function right here but
we're creating a new instance of that
class a new object so what we can do now
is instead of hard-coding these values
right here we can refer to the things
that are passed through we can access
these things so I can set this equal to
name which is this variable we passed
through off then down here I can say
radius then under here I can say gravity
and then down below I can say off or
rather system right here okay cool so
now if I save this and run it again then
hopefully this is going to be exactly
the same as before where it outputs the
different things and we do get an error
and that's because of this dude right
here we're going to actually passing
anything through okay so that's just
saying we're requiring to pass through
and four arguments these things here
will not do it right here so I'll tell
you what let's make a new planet and
pass through some different arguments so
I'm going to call this one and Abdul and
set that equal to climates we're
creating a new instance right now and
inside we need
oops the outside inside with even name
first of all which is in the boom then
we're going to do the radius which we'll
do this time as three and I love the
zeroes and then after that we need the
gravity
eight for this and finally the system
which is the Naboo system all right so
now if we print out these things as well
then hopefully this time it's going to
print out this stuff and not all this
Hopf stuff right so let us print out
first of all and it's a fun messy string
name and then it's going to be Naboo
name underneath that will print out
another formatted string and inside here
also radius is Naboo radius I will do
the gravity as well so prints then a
formatted string then gravity is Naboo
gravity and then finally I'm going to
print out the orbit function a source a
print in a blue dot of it like so
alright then so let's run this file
again I'm going to clear it first of all
run the file and now we get all this hot
stuff first of all and then we get this
stuff down here so we're printing out
the boo three and zeros
eight and the boot is orbiting in the
Naboo system cool so now what we're
doing is creating multiple instances of
this class by making multiple planet
objects passing in unique data for each
planet and then we can access that data
right here and it's passed into visits
function so that it can be assigned on
these properties and again when we refer
to these properties in the orbit method
we're referring to each planets unique
values which are passed in which is
really cool because now we could add as
many different planets with as many
different attributes as we wanted to and
then we could work with these planets we
could use the data and call methods on
them and they're all going to be unique
so that's how we work with this init
function right here to create new
instances of a class in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is take
a look at sort of different attributes
that we can assign to this and also the
different ways we can assign methods
