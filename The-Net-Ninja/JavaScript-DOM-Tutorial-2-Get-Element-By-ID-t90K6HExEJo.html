JavaScript and the dawn tutorial and in
this video I'm going to go through the
get element by ID method okay then so if
you're working with the Dom then
typically the first thing we need to do
is reach into the web page and grab some
kind of element which we want to update
change the HTML of or whatever you want
to do the first step is always generally
reaching into the doll and grubbing and
element essentially what we're doing is
querying the Dom right now there's lots
of different ways we can do this I'm
going to show you about four or five
different ways we can do it over the
first few lessons and for the majority
of those lessons I'm going to be working
in the console over here on the right so
if you're in Google Chrome which I hope
you are then you can click f12 to open
up the developer tools then just click
on this console tab and inside here we
can run JavaScript which is what I'm
going to be doing we're also going to be
using this elements tab which gives us
an outline of the whole HTML document
right here and we can see all the
different nested elements within each
one so
the first thing I want to show you is
the document object now to do that all
we need to do is type in documents and
click enter and this is going to show us
the document object provided by the
browser so if we open this up we can see
an entire outline of the whole document
which is really cool so this is what
javascript is using when it queries the
DOM and all of our different methods
that we use to query the Dom are going
to be sitting on this document object
okay so I'm going to show you in this
tutorial how to reach in and grab an
element using an ID so hopefully you
know all about IDs IDs are an attribute
that we give to hate email elements to
identify if you like and we can use
those IDs in JavaScript to reach in and
grab those elements so for example this
div right here at the top has an ID of
page banner this one has an idea book
list and this one had bulk
now typically not typically in fact in
all cases you only want to have one
unique ID on each webpage so for example
I wouldn't have this idea of page banner
and then another bar down here which
also has the ID of page banner these IDs
must be unique and associated to only
one HTML element otherwise some of these
different methods that we use might
throw up results you'll not expected
okay so let's go in and grab this
element first of all this ID of page
planet how do we do that well first of
all we say document and then we're going
to use a method on this document object
called get elements by ID so to use a
method dot first of all then get element
by ID and
the camel casing here each word starts
with a capital except the first one
alright so this method takes in a
parameter in these parentheses and
that's going to be the ID that we want
now we want the ID page - ballot so if I
click enter now what it's going to do is
return to us this element and now we've
reached in and we've grabbed that note
so later I want to show you how we can
change this note how we can change the
text content or the HTML we're going to
do this first of all okay so this is
just one way of reaching in and grabbing
an element from the document and we
could also store these in variables if
we want to use them at a later time for
example I could take var banner is equal
to document dot get element by ID and
then inside here we can pass in the page
- banner and say quotes click enter it's
going to return undefined to begin with
but if we called the banner variable
later on we can see that this element is
now stored within it okay so that is how
we go in and grab an element by the ID
let's just do one more ID as an example
I'm going to highlight this and copy it
ctrl C and we're going to grab this book
lift ID as well so I'll save var to
store another variable and we'll call
this book list camelcase
equals document but get elements and by
the way when you see it ghosted like
this this is Chrome developer tools just
helping you out and what you can do is
tab to get to the end of that method and
it's going to fill it out for you so in
the parentheses again we're going to
paste in this ID that we want and if we
click enter and then type out book list
we can see that that book list div has
been stored inside in this variable so
again if we wanted to now we could say
book list and then some kind of method
to change the content or the HTML or the
style of this element right here we're
going to see all of that later on so
then there's how we can reach into the
DOM and grab an element by ID in the
next tutorial what I want to do is show
you how we can go in and grab multiple
elements like classes or any kind of tag
name so I'll see you in that tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
