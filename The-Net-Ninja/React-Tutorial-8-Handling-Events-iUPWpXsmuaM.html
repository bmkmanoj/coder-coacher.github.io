eighth react tutorial and in this video
I'm gonna show you how we can handle
events in react
okay so typically speaking unless you
have a really boring web application
we're gonna want some kind of
interactivity for it whether that be the
user clicking on a button or typing
something into a field or hovering over
an element that's all some kind of
interactivity and we want to be able to
handle that interactivity those events
if you like through react and we can do
that pretty simply now there's loads of
different kinds of events we can react
to with react and if you want a full
list of them just head over to the docs
at this link I'll leave it down below
and it gives you a list of all the
different types of events that we can
use now in this tutorial I'm just gonna
do a couple of simple ones before click
events so it is really simple to setup a
simple event which is what we're gonna
do first of all then once we've done
that we'll look at something a little
more complex so first of all let's just
attach the click event to this PETA so
the way we do it is by saying on clip or
whatever the event name is on the tag
itself and then we set it equal to
something now the thing we set it equal
to is going to be some kind of function
which fires when this happens when a
user clicks on this P tag and the
function is going to be stored on this
component right so we set it equal to
curly braces again and then we say this
to reference the component then the
function name which is going to be
stored on it now we're going to call
this function and clicked and we've not
made that yet so let's make it so let's
put a comma after this render method and
come down here I'm going to do another
comment saying push them functions and
we'll create a function called clipped
ok which is this thing we set here so
set that equal to a function and then
inside here we're just get a lot to the
console a simple message you clicked me
so what's happening me we've attached a
click event to this P tag which is equal
to this clicked which references this
function right here so when someone
clicks the P tag this is going to fire
and it's going to log this to the
console
pretty simple
right so let's save this dude and check
it out in a browser okay so when we
click this P tag you click me and if we
click it again we get it twice
very very simple that's how easy it is
to set up an event and a handler in
react so let's do something a little
more complex say for example when we
click on one of these things right here
on the list we want to delete it from
the list that's how we have seen we've
done it well we can do something like
that as well but it is a little bit more
complex so we no longer want the event
happening in this component we want it
happening in this component right here
because this is where the individual
items are make sense so let's delete
this dude first of all we don't need
that anymore
or this event so let's get rid of that
and instead let's create a click event
down here now first of all I want to add
a little cross within this Li tag so
that when it user clicks that cross then
we'll delete this item so I'm gonna say
span class name it's gonna be equal to
item iPhone delete and then inside this
we want just an X like that now let's
attach a click event to it so I'll say
odd now up on click equals some kind of
function now because the click event is
on here we want the function to be in
this component as well because we're
gonna say this dot whatever the function
name is so it's going to look at this
component and then the function on this
component so let's call this handle
delete and then we need to make that
down here so again a little comment
custom functions and then we'll call
this handle delete going to set it equal
to a function which is gonna fight now
let's just think about this for a minute
when someone clicks on this cross this
is gonna fire this hand or delete thing
and we want this function to delete this
item right here whatever item we click
on from
this data okay now the data is being
stored in the state of this component
right here that a do component the
parent component it's not being stored
on this component so what we need to do
is pass this event back up to this
component to another function in this
component so that that function can
delete the item from the state makes
sense because we can't directly delete
it from this nested component so we need
to find a way of passing this item back
up to that component so we can delete
that item so that's what we're going to
do so the way we're going to do that is
by passing a function which we're going
to create on this component as a prop
down into this component so that we can
access that function okay so let's here
create a function first of all and we'll
call this function on diligence and this
is going to take the item so whatever
item it is we want to delete it's gonna
take that and it's going to go ahead and
delete it now I'm just gonna paste a
little snippet of code in here then
explain it so within this function I'm
declaring a variable called updated to
dues and then it was setting that equal
to this dot state doctor dues which is
this array okay so I'm setting it equal
to that dot filter which is just a
JavaScript function which means we're
going to go through each of the elements
in this array and we're going to filter
some of them out now it takes a callback
function with the value so the string of
whatever element it is and the index of
that element in the array so if we
return false then it's going to keep the
element in the array if we return true
it's going to knock it out with the
element so say for example we take in
eat some cheese so it's saying okay well
filter through that array and is the
first value what shop is that equal to
the item eat some cheese no it's not
okay so that stays in the array because
we're returning false here now is the
second one
eat some cheese is that equal to the
item yes is so we're returning true here
therefore we filter that out of the
array okay so that's what we're doing
were filtering the item which is passed
through to us out of the array right
there so once we perform that action
once we filtered it from the array and
that new array is stored in this updated
- duze because this array isn't altered
by the filter method
it's just storing the new array in
updated two views once we've done that
then we're saying this set state which
is how we change the state of the
component and they were saying the two
dues is then going to be replaced by
this updated - duze right here okay so
then we're updating this thing with the
new irate with the item filtered out of
that array makes sense so we want to
pass whatever item it is down here up to
this function right here so that we can
filter it out of the array and change
the state so we're going to pass this
function down into this component as a
prop so that we can do that so we're now
it's passed props down we come to the
component which is nested right here and
we pass it down on that component so
we're going to call them earn the prop
on delete set it equal to this it's a
reference this component dots on delete
so we're passing down this function
right here into this component makes
sense so now we can access this function
in here so when this is clicked this
cross we're gonna say this door handle
delete which is this function then I
want to say this dot props dots on the
building it's which is the function
we've just passed down into this
component this thing right here and then
we're going to pass an item into that
which represents this item here and the
item we're gonna pass in is simply this
thing right here this dot props the item
so let's pass that in and save it so now
when we click this next item this cross
it's going to fire this function which
is going to say this dot prop stop
undelete the function which is passed
down to us and passing
the item into that delete method so
we're passing that item into this method
right here which is filtering through
the array creating a new array and
taking this item out of that array then
it's updating the state by saying this
set state and it's setting the two dues
of the state which is this thing right
here with the new array that we've just
created the new filtered array
make sense cool so let's save this and
try it out okay so that's good so far no
errors always a good time and if we
click on one of these now it gets
removed from the list awesome
so there we go guys that's how we create
an event and that's how we handle events
and that's also how we pass events down
into nested components and pass the
handlers back up into parent components
