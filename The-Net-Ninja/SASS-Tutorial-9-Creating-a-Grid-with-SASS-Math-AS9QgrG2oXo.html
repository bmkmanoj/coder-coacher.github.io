ninth sass tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can make a
grid system using a bit of math in sass
Wow okay then go so our website is
coming along swimmingly and there's one
section we've yet to style and this is
this project section right here by the
way these are little placeholder images
that I use from this website place hold
it and they're basically what you do is
tap this URL in your image source type
and then whatever size place hold it you
want you just pop it in there so I could
do something like 400 times 400 then
that's going to output that size
placeholder image for me in the document
okay so this is really cool for
prototyping designs or layouts of you
like I'm just going to stick with 150 by
150 for now and I've got 12 of those
stucked in Li tags and they're all in
this projects section right now so let's
copy that and say I want to make these
into some kind of grid but traditionally
in CSS I'd do something like this
projects Li and then within that and say
float them all to the left and I'll make
them a width of 23% and then do a margin
a right of 2% and then what we'll do is
make the image within those 100% width
so a width of 100% of the Li tag okay so
now if we press save we get something
like this which is fine absolutely fine
but you'll notice we get that extra
margin there on the right which isn't
great I don't like that kind of thought
thing I want it to be even there's no
margin here on the left from this but it
is extra margin here on the right so
you'd have to start using earth child to
get rid of that bit of margin then
tweaking the width of your Li tags to
make them all equal etc so what I'm
going to do is instead show you how we
can do this using a sass and create a
really flexible grid system which is
going to get rid of this problem so
let's get rid of all this here and we'll
save that I'm going to keep this in for
now then we're going to go into our
mixing
make a new mixing which is going to be
four out of grid so to do that we'll say
mix it and we'll call this grid and then
I mentioned it in a couple of tutorials
ago that we could pass through variables
into our mix ins and then use those
variables within it so that's what we're
going to do in this tutorial so I'm
going to pass through two variables the
first one is going to be called coals
and that's going to be the number of
columns that we want in our grid so how
many of these are going to line up next
to each other the next one is going to
be the margin that we want to be between
each of the elements so that's mgn so
we're going to use these in a second so
first of all again I want to float all
of the Li tags to the left and then
after that I want to give them a margin
to the right of the market and then I
want to give them a margin at the bottom
of margin and then we're going to work
out the wick okay so each one of these
now each one of these elements is going
to have a margin to the right of this
margin that we pass through so say 10
pixels or something like that each one
of these has ten pixels right but we
don't want the last one to have 10
pixels we want the last one to sit flush
against the right hand side so we want
to take the margin away from that so
before I do this with let's sort that
out so we know we can use the ampersand
to use a pseudo class or say and and
then we're going to use n channel and in
this nth chart we want to pass through
the the last child on each row right so
say we have five in a row
yeah then we want every fifth element
have a margin right of zero and how do
we get that well we can just pass this
variable through here because this is
going to tell us how many columns we're
going to have so if this is five and
it's going to be every fifth child so we
can output this here we could say Cole's
and except we can't do Cole's n we have
to embed this in some kind of a variable
template like soap because if it was
just Cole's and then n it's going to
look for this variable Coles and we
don't have that so we have to wrap the
actual variable in this thing right here
and then put it okay so this is going to
get the last child on each row and we're
going to say margin right
is going to be zero on those children
okay okay let's work out the wick will
give it above here like so now then we
want the width to be equal distributed
between each element and we also want to
take into account of margin so I've
created a formula for this I'm just
going to paste it in to begin with and
then I'll go through so what I've said
is take 100% width
first of all okay then I want you to -
this thing calls minus 1 times the
margin right so save is 5 columns then
I've said Coles minus 1 which is 4 times
the margin because eat four of these
have a margin to the right not 5 that's
why we've minus 1 ok and that space is
going to be used for the margin so this
equates say for example to 20% what we
do anything ok well take 100% then take
away that 20% because that's all
allocated to margin
all right based on the margin that we've
supplied then with that left over with
whatever's left in this case let's just
pretend this 80% I want to divide that
80% by the number of columns that we
have so if this is 5 then I don't know
what blood is off the top of my head
it's going to be just 80% divided by 5
and it's going to kind of spread that
whipped out equally to each element so
let's save that that's our mixing done
what we need to do now is call this mix
in in here right so we'll say @include
and it's called grid and remember we
have to pass through two things we have
to pass through the number of columns in
each row and also the margin that we
want so let's say for example we want 4
columns and we also want a 30 pixel
margin okay so let's try that press save
and see what happens on the right it's
unable to compile oops that's because we
passed through of this air pixel value
there and we'll need a percentage let's
pass through 2% save that ok now it
works ok so now you see this flush to
the right side flush to the left side
and it's created that grid
and now it's really easy to change this
say we want six columns and we want four
percent we'll save that and then we get
that right there so now this works
really easily whenever you want to
change your grid you can do I'm just
going to do one more I'm going to say
two columns a yeah two columns and I'll
say and eight percent margin and I press
save and now we get them like so so this
is really cool and by the way the reason
we had to pass a percentage through here
and not a pixel value is because we're
doing all of these mathematics right
here so we're times in you know the
percentage value or reminding the
percentage value from a percentage value
all right so that is how we create a
grid system using sass and a mixin any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see it
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
