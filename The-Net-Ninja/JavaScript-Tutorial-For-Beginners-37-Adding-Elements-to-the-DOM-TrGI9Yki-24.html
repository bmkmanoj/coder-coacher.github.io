JavaScript for beginners lesson 37 and
in this video we're gonna start adding
elements to the Dom ah alright there so
in the last few lessons I've been
teaching you how to go into the HTML
grab elements and then change the
content of them elements or change the
attributes of those elements right now
what I want to show you how to do is
create brand new elements and then put
those into the HTML where you want to
put them and to do that we have to
follow two steps step one is to create
that element in JavaScript and when
we've created that element that's just
kind of sitting around in the middle of
nowhere it's not in the document yet
right so step two is to take that
element we've created in JavaScript and
push it in to the HTML where we want to
do it so that's what I'm going to do I'm
going to walk you through that process
right now so first things first where
are we going to put a new element
well I've chosen this navigation right
here I've decided that currently it's
got three links I want a fourth
I want a link to a blog right so to do
that I'm going to have to insert a new
li element right here at the bottom and
then after all within that sorry and new
a tag okay so let's create those
elements now to create a new element
we're going to store them in variable so
I'll say a bar new li equals document
and then the method that we use to
create a new element is simply create
element dead simple right then within
the brackets we have to specify the type
of element we want to create now we want
to create an li tag so I'll just type
allied and then press ENTER that there
my friends has created a new Li tag so
if I call that now uli there it is it's
empty nothing in it but there it is
so now we need to create a new a tag
because that's what's inside here right
so to do that we'll create a new
variable and we'll say new a equals
document dot create element exactly the
same way we did the one a book and then
this time we want an a tag and that
there has created a new a tag so let's
just call
to make sure and there we go cool
alright then so we've created our new
elements the next thing we need to do is
go into the HTML and pop them in where
we want them to now I want it to be at
the bottom of this Ally stack right here
so to do that I'm going to have to grab
this UL tag and then insert it within
that UL tag and to do that I'm going to
use a combination of get element by ID
to grab this now right here and then
within that I'm going to use get
elements by tag name to grab this UL
which is going to return an array of one
element just this URL right here and
then once I've got that I can insert
this li and this a tag within it make
sense right cool so let's do that let's
say bar menu equals document dot get
element by ID and then the ID we want is
this one right here main nav and then
within that I'm going to say get
elements by tag name and then we want
you out because that's going to grab
this UL right here within the main nav
and then because that's going to return
an array with only one spot in it we can
just shorten this by adding the array
notation at the end here and specifying
we want the 0th position within that
array and that day my friends is going
to return to us the menu um like that
okay cool so now we've got that we can
start adding the new elements to it
which is step two so the way we do that
is called the menu variable book just
created dot and then we say append child
that is the method name okay what we're
saying is append a new child to this
menu item that we've got here append a
new element right and the element we
want to repend to that menu is this li
new ally so let's do that cool is added
this fourth Li tag right on the end
there okay so currently there's nothing
in this Li tag so what we need to do is
append this egg tag that we created to
the Li tag right because the a tags are
within the Li tag so let's do that we'll
grab new Li which is d li tag group
which is creating and putting
and we'll say we want to append a child
to that append child and the child we
want to append to that is this new a the
a tag right there like that and that
there should insert the a tag right
between the Li tags cool all right so
the only thing missing now is the text
between these egg tags and I'm just
going to simply use in an HTML to do
that I'm going to say new a dot inner
HTML equals blog just like that
all right there we should say blog now
it's not shown up here because the CSS
is controlling the height of this menu
but if I inspect that elements go to the
UL and the main now it's got height 200
pixels you I say Auto then it should
show right there we've inserted that
blog link at the bottom and we could go
in and we could use set attribute to
give this H ref attribute so it's
actually got a link to somewhere I'm not
going to do that in this tutorial I just
want you to know how to insert elements
alright so what if we wanted to insert
an li tag at the top we don't want to
insert it you know right down here at
the bottom we want to insert it at the
top or somewhere else well we can use
another method and that's called insert
before alright so how do we do that well
same again we want to insert it within
this menu so we call the method on this
menu will say menu dot insert before and
then this takes two parameters okay the
first parameter is going to be the new
item that we want to insert again we
don't need quotations sorry and the new
item is going to be new Li all right and
then after that we have to specify
another parameter and this is the
parameter that we want to insert a new
element before alright and that my
friends is going to be before this one
right here so I'm going to say insert
that before menu get elements by tag
name and that's going to grab all these
and
my tax rate is going to return an array
of those Li tags all there and I want it
before the zero position okay so I want
it before the first one so let's try
that let's call it and this time you can
see we're going to get an Li right at
the top which says block okay it's taken
it back out here because this element
this new Li was the one that was here so
it's taken it removed it and put it
right at the top over there instead
alright guys so that is how we insert
new elements into our HTML if you have
any questions feel free to drop a
comment down below I'll answer any
questions you ask otherwise if you enjoy
these videos please like share and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we can look at how we
can remove items from the HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
