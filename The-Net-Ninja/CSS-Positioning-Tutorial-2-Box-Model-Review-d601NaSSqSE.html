CSS positioning lesson 2 and in this
video I just want to have a quick review
of the box model Harlan gang so the box
model in diagram font looks something
like this okay we have our element in
the middle right there then we have some
height and width properties applied to
it then we've got the padding property
which is the internal spacing of the
element then after that we have a border
and then beyond the border we have the
margin which is the external spacing of
the element now all of these properties
together are what are known as the box
model and we can apply these properties
to different elements in our CSS but we
can only apply them to block level
elements and by that I mean they have a
display type of block not inline okay so
let's take a quick look at some examples
all right in class as you can see I've
got this index.html file right open in
brackets it's just a dead simple file
with all the basic tags like that and
we've got this link tag right here which
is linking to this style dot CSS which
is this one right here this is a blank
CSS sheet so what I'm going to do first
of all is go to view and go to
horizontal split I'm going to move this
style onto the bottom so now we've got
the HTML at the top and the CSS at the
bottom all right then what I want to do
is press this little lightning icon and
it's going to bring up the live preview
right here so as we make changes over
here it's going to automatically update
on the right over here so let's just
minimize this a little bit to see them
both and then scoot this in right over
here all right so the first thing I want
to do is create a few different tags I'm
going to say P for a paragraph tag and
just say test then I'm going to copy and
paste this like that and then I'm going
to do a couple of attacks you don't need
to have a H ref value at the minute
we'll call that test as well and we'll
copy and paste that too
so if now we look over here you can see
that the P tags right there one after
the other stacked on top of each other
whereas these two a tags next to each
other right that's because these are
inline elements and these are block
level elements so these have a display
type of block automatically and these
have a display type of inline okay now
like I said we can only apply all of
those different box model properties to
block level elements these things right
here and if we do it to these ones that
it's not going to work because they're
inline elements all right and block
level elements by default take up 100%
width of the page right so currently if
the page is this big and they take up
all that weight if the page was this big
they take up all that width there right
and I can demonstrate that by inspecting
the element I'm just going to go to
right-click and inspect then I'm going
to zoom to full screen if I hover over
this P you can see up at the top it goes
full whip right that little orange and
blue box that shows you that the P
element is full wick and it's taking up
the whole space at the page and this one
is too but if we go to the a tags now
you can see just those small blue
squares to show you how wide they are
and that is not the full width they're
just taking up the room of the element
itself okay that's what inline elements
do now that if I get that back there and
press this link again this link was
disconnected because we inspected the
element by the way what I'm going to do
now is just add some box model
properties to these P tags right so I'll
say P and I'll say width 50 percent
instead of 100% we'll give it a margin
of 20 pixels a padding of 30 pixels and
and we'll give it a border as well of
two pixels solid and black all right so
now if we refresh over here we can see
all of those box model properties
applied to these P tags all right now if
I try and do the same thing to the a
tags and all I'm going to do is say
comma a so then we're applying it to
both of these tags and save you can
see that it's not worth the same okay
first of all it's not got that whipped
attribute associated with it all right
secondly the margin isn't there it's not
present except this margin the top and
bottom margin isn't there but the left
or right one is so that's not quite
properly at the padding fair enough this
has worked but because this is not a
block level element it's kind of
overlapping into this top one okay and
the border has that worked let me see
yeah the borders work so we can apply
the border to it now if I change the
display type of the a text to block
display block and save it now this works
exactly the same way okay so that is how
we control the width height padding
margin and border properties of elements
and that's how we change them from in
line to block if we want to we can also
change them to inline block which kind
of combines the best of both worlds so
we can have that inline ability of
stacking left and right but we can also
apply these other box model properties
to it if I reduce this to 20% you'll see
them stuck in now left to right and
that's the inline kind of property
coming through so if I delete that now
and just display them as block now they
don't do that
all right so there we go guys that is a
quick review of the box model if you
have any questions whatsoever feel free
