bootstrap 3 lesson 1 ah okay guys
welcome to the best bootstrap tutorial
on the internet this is quite literally
going to teach you to be a bootstrap
ninja from knowing nothing about it
whatsoever
so let's start with the basics all right
so what is bootstrap bootstrap is a
framework right and frameworks are
designed to help do a lot of the heavy
lifting associated with certain tasks
now the task the bootstrap is associated
with or concerned with rather is
creating responsive feature-rich
websites so when we use bootstrap it
helps us to create these really quickly
and easily and it also comes with a
bunch of cool features and tools that we
can use in our websites too so when we
use a framework we have to write our
code in a particular way and we have to
write it in a way that the framework
wants us to write it we can't just write
it any other way and expect the
frameworks to do a load of stuff for us
doesn't work like that we have to write
it in a way that the framework wants us
to write it then we can take advantage
of the features it provides us with okay
so this is also the case when using
bootstrap now some of those features I
talked about are the fluid and grid
sorry fluid and fixed grid system right
so it's going to make layout content on
your website a lot easier carousels
drop-down menus modal's or pop-ups
whatever you want to call those things
plus tons of other stuff too now
bootstrap also has a mobile-first
approach which basically means that any
website you create bootstrap is going to
look freaking awesome on a mobile but
that is only if you code it the right
way like I say that bootstrap watch its
coding okay so when we use it it's going
to assume that we want to create a
mobile-friendly website and it's going
to take a lot of that responsive work
out of our hands and it's going to do
all that dirty work behind the scenes so
that it's going to look pretty neat on a
mobile
now before you embark on this amazing
bootstrap journey you're probably going
to want to know a few things the first
one is HTML and CSS and they basically
you need to know how to encode to put
websites and style it using CSS because
if we don't know that then we're in a
bit of a pickle there guys because
bootstrap is all about creating websites
so you might want to check out my
beginner HTML and beginner CSS courses
I'll leave a link to both of those in
the description down below
second thing you might want to know is a
bit of JavaScript not much just a bit
and probably you can get by without
knowing anything whatsoever but it is
going to come in useful when we're going
to be using some of the bootstrap
JavaScript features right third of all
or by the way I've got a course on
JavaScript which you can check out by
clicking a link in the description also
so yeah thirdly you might want to know a
little bit about responsive development
and basically bootstrap is all about
quick responsive cool websites so you're
going to want to know the basics things
like media queries or viewports because
that's not what this tutorial series is
all about ok so if you don't know that
I've also done a responsive development
tutorial series I'll leave the link to
that down below as well boom
so once you've checked all that out
let's get cracking on getting you to be
a bootstrap ninja I'll see you guys in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
