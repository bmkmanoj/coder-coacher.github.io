very first angularjs tutorial Wow
thinking so I just want to welcome you
to your very first stepping stone in
becoming an absolute guru in angularjs
in this video I'm just going to talk a
little bit about what angularjs actually
is and why we use it and the kind of
things that you're going to need to know
beforehand and also what we're going to
be learning in this playlist so
angularjs is an MVC style JavaScript
framework for creating single page
data-driven applications the MVC just
stands for Model View controller and
that's the design pattern that separates
our data logic from our output HTML just
makes things easier as we update our
application and code it later on don't
worry too much and we don't know what it
is at the minute I am going to do a
tutorial on what MVC is and how we can
use it in angularjs
so because angularjs is a framework that
means that we have to write our code in
a way angularjs wants us to not just any
old way so the in return we can receive
all these super ninja powers that we can
inject into our projects so some of
these powers or features are two-way
data-binding which is like magic when
you first see I'm going to show you that
in a couple of tutorials time a really
good templating system some document
object model interaction filters which
allow us to change how data is output to
reuse them very easily directives which
let us extend the functionality of HTML
also add in new behavior to it plus tons
of other things as well that I'm going
to show you and again don't worry too
much if you don't know what the hell I'm
talking about right now and I'm going to
go through each of these in detail as we
go along so as I said angularjs is
primarily used to make single page
data-driven applications and essentially
this just means that we bring in
additional content into the web page
without ever having to refresh the page
or actually load a new page and the way
we do this is by using views and routing
and views is the V in MVC okay so here's
a really quick simple example I've just
got a HTML outline right here then in
the body tag we've got this main tag
with an NG view directive
worry about that a minute this is just
telling angularjs this is going to be
where the views are loaded in so the way
this works is if a user types forward
slash contact then we set up our routes
in angularjs to dynamically inject the
contact HTML view into this tag ok or if
we type forward slash about then
angularjs would go out and grab the
about view right there and inject that
into the main view so we're not actually
physically loading a new page angularjs
is just reaching out grabbing the
content of views that we need bringing
them back and punching them right into
this view area right here okay so it's
really flexible and it's also really
quick so I'm going to talk about all
that later on I just wanted to show you
an example of how this works all right
so here's a glance of what we're going
to be learning through this playlist
first of all like I said we're to go
through what MVC is or mvw in the case
of angularjs which stands for Model View
or whatever you want and then we're
going to take a look at two-way
data-binding which like sega's really
magic when you first see it so we'll go
through that then we'll dive into
filters directives and expressions and
we'll take a look at what controllers
are and how we can use them to control
our data then we'll look at setting up
some routes and views in our application
then we'll take a look at animations now
angularjs is really cool when it comes
to animations it has a whole separate
library dedicated to it and it makes our
websites look really slick so we'll go
into that then we'll have a look at form
validation and how we can use angular to
help us with that it's really cool one
of my favorite parts of angularjs in
fact and then finally we're going to
create an app from scratch which is
going to be a to-do list so here's what
you going to need to know beforehand
first of all JavaScript that is
absolutely essential because angularjs
is a JavaScript library and we are going
to write in a fair amount of it during
this playlist if we don't know any of
that I've got a tutorial series called
JavaScript for beginners I'll leave the
link down below in the description
secondly HTML absolutely essential we're
going to be creating HTML views in our
application so again if you don't know
that check out my HTML course I'll leave
the link down below as well thirdly CSS
now that's optional we don't need to
know
ESS I'm going to include a style sheet
for its download in this playlist so you
don't need to know it but it would be
beneficial you know to start things up
yourself because angularjs adds classes
inference that we can hook into and
style ourselves so optional but advised
and then finally Jason which again is
optional but advice this is just a way
that we can represent data which is easy
to work with in JavaScript dead easy to
learn I am going to cover it a little
bit in this playlist so we don't know
that don't worry too much about it but a
quick google search of json and how to
use it will probably result in you
mastering it in less than an hour so i
just want to show you a couple more
things before we get started and the
first one is this text editor this is
the one i used in the quick review
example before it's called Atem and you
can find it at Ateneo i'll leave a link
down below to that but it is pretty
simple to remember and it defines itself
as a hackable text editor for the 21st
century which basically just means we
can hack the hell out fit to create
additional functionality or just load in
packages that other people have made to
extend its functionality also it is
really cool I've been using this now for
the last couple of weeks I find it
really nice to work with and it looks
pretty awesome as well okay so you can
go ahead and download that for different
platforms what it does is just detect
the platform right here and then you can
go ahead and click the button to
download it so go ahead and do that and
the next thing I want to show you is
this repository I've created on github
called angularjs playlist and what I've
done basically is just create a simple
index template file for us to work from
like a baseline file and also some CSS
in a file called standard CSS so that
the applications and tutorials that we
make don't look as crap in a browser and
it overrides those default browser
styles all right so it's there for you
if you want you don't have to download
these I just thought I'd make it
optional so you can go ahead and
download it here by clicking this if you
want it so if you've downloaded a Tim
and you've also downloaded those files
from my github repository go ahead to
file and then add project folder what
you want to do is navigate to where you
downloaded that folder from github and
just click into that select folder open
it up and you're going to see something
like this and index dot HTML file which
is just
dead-simple baseline file which we can
work from and it's hooked up to this
content forward slash CSS style CSS
which is in here and this is just going
to make the the tutorials look a little
bit better in a browser as we go on
alright so there you go guys that is
your Express introduction to angularjs
in the next tutorial we're going to go
ahead and talk about MVC so don't forget
to subscribe share and like
and I'll see you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
