twelfth CSS animation tutorial and in
this video we're going to go through
another example where we're going to add
an animation to a shopping cart on a
website Wow I rather doke so I've got
ahead and opened up this web examples
folder again and now I'm working in this
basket dot HTML file it's the same style
CSS which we'll go through in a second
and on your right you're going to see
this absolutely snazzy sports clothing
website possibly the best one I've ever
seen
and we've got all these cool sports tops
listed from top to bottom left to right
and you'll notice in this page right
here I've linked up jQuery and that's
because we're going to attach a little
click event to these buttons right so
down here you can see we've got this UL
with the class of products and each one
of these allied tags within it has an
image h2 and a button so we're going to
attach that click event in the button
and I've already done that down here you
can see we're saying when we click on
one of these buttons then I want you to
grab this that's the button and then get
the closest ally which is this thing
above it then find the image within that
which is there and we're going to clone
that image so it's going to create a new
image element for us whenever we click
on one of these items these buttons
right so it's going to clone the image
above it so once we've cloned it we're
going to add a class of zoom to it and
I'm going to use that class to animate
it later on and then once we've added
that class we want to append that
element to the body text so it's just
going to appear at the bottom here so
when we click on one of these it's going
to duplicate this image and then it's
going to drop it at the bottom of and
the body tag
right and then once we've done that
we're going to use a set timeout to
remove this extra image that we've just
added on after 1000 milliseconds or one
second right so it's just there briefly
so I can show you that if I click Add to
basket you're going to see that image
appear for one second then go add to
basket and it goes alright so what we're
going to do is animate that thing right
down it appears so that it zooms across
here at the top it looks like it's going
into your basket so let's do that screw
over to the styles these are the base
styles right here basket base tiles that
are just kind of styling this layout
right here nothing special going on
whatsoever and then down here is where
we're going to add our animations
so remember when we added the new
element when we click on one of these
and we add that new element to the body
we gave it a class of zoom so that's
what we want to target right here and
that's what we want to enemy so first of
all let's say zoom right and I'm going
to give this a position of absolute
first of all just so we can position it
at the top of the page and we're going
to say top 40 pixels so it's not exactly
right at the top and then from the right
we'll say about 50 percent so it's going
to appear roundabout here in the middle
of the page 40 pixels from the top 50
percent from the right and then what I'm
going to do is give it a width of about
40 pixels nothing too big so it's just
like a little thumbnail of the image and
I'm going to start it off with an
opacity of 0 in fact I'm going to leave
that out for now we'll add that in
shortly when we do the animation so now
if I add one of these you'll notice it
go up here at the top yeah
and that's because of these styles right
here so what we want to do now is when
we click on one of these we want to
animate this zoom element this image
right at the top going to the basket so
let's go ahead and do that we need to
create our key frames so I'll say key
frames and then we'll call this zoom and
then what we're going to say is at not
percent we're going to have an opacity
of 0 right then what we're going to do
is say at 195 that 50% halfway through
we're going to have an opacity of 1 so
it's going to gradually fade in until
halfway and it's going to be fully
visible as it scoots along right and
then at the end 100% first of all we
want it to fade back out again right and
we'll just preview this so far so what
it's going to do oops we want it to zero
what it's going to do is fade in then
fade out right it's 0 to begin with
fading to 1 then fade out and we can now
get rid of that thing so it's 0 to begin
with by default anyway
refresh this and now just watch it's
going to fade in and fade out no it's
not because we've not applied the
animation to this
okay so let's apply the animation right
here we'll say animation zoom about one
second ease and forwards okay we know
all this stuff if you're sure what this
is you might want to go back and refresh
yourself on the previous tutorials then
we'll refresh this and now you can see
it fade in and fade out so we've got the
fade in effect we want now we just want
to zoom it over to the right so it's
starting it right here at this position
so we don't need to add anything at the
start all we need to do is add in
properties at the end so we'll just say
right and we want it to go about 40
pixels from the right so it ends up
around here which is five pixels from
the right of the screen here so we've
got this animation going on this is oome
animation which takes one second we're
giving it the ease damming function so
it looks a little more natural and we're
saying forward so that it remains at the
end it doesn't kind of pop back to the
beginning when it's finished so let's
save this right now see what it does if
I click on one of these now you're going
to see it fade in fade out and zoom
across at the top so whenever we click
on one of these it grabs that image
clones it does this little animation at
the top to make it look like we're
dropping it in the bathroom which is
pretty neat I think just a nice little
subtle effect if you've got an online
shop and you can do all sorts of crazy
stuff with this you don't have to do it
at the top like this you could work out
a way to have it zoom from your image or
you know from the top and drop in to the
image then maybe have your basket wiggle
a little bit or something like that you
can get really creative with these kind
of things but this is a nice little
simple example which doesn't take too
much work if I'm honest and yeah does
the job pretty nicely so if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
