yo troopers what the hell is going on
this is CSS for beginners lesson 12 and
in this lesson we're going to talk all
about specificity ah so before we start
I want to get one thing straight I hate
the word specificity do you have no idea
how long I've tried to pronounce that
word correctly four but along the line
somewhere I am gonna mess up so when I
do please go lightly on me okay
so you'll remember from previous lessons
we talked about conflicts and the
Cascade and we said that if we have two
identical selectors in our CSS file what
happens is the Cascade runs from top to
bottom comes down here Phi is the first
selector P calls them all black goes
further down into the CSS finds another
selector which is just P which is
identical and it calls them all red so
this rule overrides this rule and all
the P tags will be read now what happens
when we throw an ID into the mix well we
have this ID here main content and then
we say we want all the peas within that
main content to be colored black that's
our selector okay and below it in the
CSS we might say we want all the P tags
to be cool in red now from what we've
learnt so far we would expect would we
not the CSS to come in start at the top
call it Amol black come further down and
find this rule then call it more red so
this overrides this well sorry to break
it to you but that is not the case here
and the reason is that this rule is more
specific it's finding this ID here and
the peak within it and because this is
more specific than this one this will
rule this winning its coloring them all
black now this P will still have an
effect on any other peak outside of the
main content it will still call all
other peas red but not override this
rule all the peas in the main content
will remain black so how does CSS decide
which rule is more specific than other
as well to do that it goes off this
little point system and essentially if
you have an ID in your selector then you
give that selector 100
in value if you have a class in your
selector you give that class and it's
that ID excuse me that selector an extra
10 points in value if you have an
element in your selected you give that
selector one point in value okay so the
selector if you're going after the same
thing the selector with the most points
which is weightier wins
so just skipping back for this example
again you can see that this ID gives the
selector 100 points then in addition
this P gives it one point so that's 101
points in so on this selector here is
just the P so it's just that one puny
little point now this is one point this
is 101 points
so in this case because they're going
after the same tag this one wins the
conflict okay it's like one of those
little card games where you buy like
strength eight strengths nine strengths
Oman wins exactly the same with
conflicts in CSS if your CSS rule your
selector is more weight T in terms of
points then it wins the conflict alright
so what we're going to do now is jump
into the HTML file we've been working on
and we're just going to go through a few
different rules and see what happens
when they conflict with each other all
right gang so here I am back in HTML and
I've stripped out all of the CSS we've
been working on so far and I just want
to start playing with these rules and
see what happens when we've got
different specificities in them so we're
going to start out by using this main
content idea that I've added in and
we're going to take these P tags within
the main content ID so to do that
remember I put that hash sign and then
the domain - content and then I put a P
to signify that I want to get on the P
tags within that main content so I'm
going to color all these red and then
underneath this rule I'm going to add
another one and this is just going to go
after all the peas and they're going to
color those black so what we're going to
expect here CSS comes in find this rule
first of all says hey there's an ID in
here now how many points is that worth
100 a whopping 100 and then it finds
this P tag here and it says how many
points is that that's one so in total
we've got 101 points okay now it finds
this rule here and it says what
hey you're just a puny little element
selector on your own I'm only going to
give you one point so we have this one
here colouring peas black and this one
coloring peas ready the main content now
this one's going to win because it's 101
points and this is only one point so
you're going to find that every P tag in
the main content is going to be red this
one here outside of the main content is
still gonna be black because it's not
covered by this rule it's not within the
main content all right then let's give
this a whirl show this in Explorer and
then we're going to open up in Chrome
Canary and there we go these two here
are read within the div the main content
this one here is black so what can we do
next well imagine that we wanted to
override this red text for just the
second one here now what a lot of
designers will do is come in here and
say we'll give this a class of I don't
know we'll just use the word test for
now it's not important so I'm going to
use this class here to grab a hold of
this P tag and I'm going to color that a
different color so I'll say test
remember that all starts with a period
or full stop depending on where you're
from
then the class name test and that's
going to target this tag here or
whichever tag is given a class of test
now I'm going to color this green and
hopefully that should work right
you know I'm overriding this one here
saying old test pluses give that core of
green so let's see what happens
what okay so it's no green now what's
going on hmm
well this is what's happening the CSS is
starting at the top it's finding this
rule which we remember is 101 points so
all these are currently read all these
peas here it's going down here this is
one point so it's going to say now I
don't want to override these ones here
not going to call those black they're
still red then it's finding this test
here this test class and it's saying
okay we've got our test classes color
green but I'm not going to do that
you know why because a class only has
ten points ten points that's all it has
an ID has a massive 100 times so this
wins why am I going to color this green
when you've given it a value more than
101 points so this isn't going to work
and this is where a lot of designers
fall flat on their faces they're pulling
the hair up pulling the teeth out
thinking why math is this not working
you know I'll give it a class I'm
explicitly singing color these green so
work down you know it's not going to
work like that it's not flexible CSS
like that it has these rules and you
have to obey them okay so to get around
this what you could do is you could
embed anything that you want Green in a
strong tag okay and remember because
this P tag is the parent element this
strong tag will automatically inherit
these P tag styles so automatically this
strong tag is going to be colored red
however if we put a rule thing strong
here we're going after the strong
elements and color those green then what
we're saying is we want to get the
strong tags and override that inherited
style that the P tag has given us and
Club it green now you might be saying
well hang on this is just one point how
is it that this can override this one
which is 101 points well I'll tell you
this is why this rule here is targeting
the P tag is it not so it's going to
color the P tag red it's not targeting
the strong tag the strong tag is only
read because it's inheriting the P
textiles by default now that doesn't
hold any weight okay if I was to put
here main content strong that would
directly go after this strong tag and
then this wouldn't work but I'm not
doing that I'm saying main content P so
it's tagged in the P tag and coloring
knows read the strong tag is only read
because it's inheriting that but I can
override that by writing a rule
explicitly for the strong tag okay this
is only implicitly targeting the strong
tag this is X
basically targeting it okay so that's
why overrides it so let's view this in a
browser and make sure it's work putting
Chrome Canary there it is see ninjas
green hallelujah it's worked so again
this is worth 100 points an ID a class
is worth 10 points and an element is
worth 1 point
whichever selector has the most points
wins
if selectors are identical like this
these two P tags the bottom most wins
because of the Cascade alright so that
should hopefully give you a good
understanding of how these conflicts
work when it comes to specificity all
right so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to dive down below
and comment I'm going to answer all of
those obviously please like these videos
if you enjoy them also share them and
subscribe there's going to be another
one coming up very shortly where we're
going to talk about the important rule
that's the final tool in conflict I'll
see you guys in that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
