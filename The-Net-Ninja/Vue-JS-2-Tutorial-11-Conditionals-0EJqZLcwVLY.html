11th of the UJS tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
conditionals okay so what do I mean by
conditionals well I mean conditionally
show some content depending on whether
we want it to basically write so we can
use a conditional called V if it's a
directive or we can also use a directive
called V show and there's a sort of
difference between the two and I'm going
to show you the difference later on but
first of all I want to create two
buttons which are going to kind of
handle the functionality of this
conditional so the first one right here
is going to toggle some kind of error
data right so we'll say toggle error and
the second one is going to toggle a
success data message so we'll say toggle
success all right okay cool so what I
want to do is give each one of these a
click events or favor V I've been on and
it's a click and we've set that equal to
something where by ID error is going to
become the reverse of what that error
Courtney is right now I know this isn't
defined yet but we'll do that in a
second but I'm going to do exactly the
same for the button down here except
this one is going to be in success so
we're going to have two variables stood
on our view instance right here in the
data object we're going to do that in a
bit once called success and the other is
called error so the idea is that these
buttons are going to toggle whether
those variables stood here a living true
or false right so when we click this
it's going to toggle it between 300 and
false when we click this is going to
toggle the success variable between true
and false
make sense so let's quickly create those
two property here so let's say error is
false and Hewett and also substantive
okay cool so now we've got our two
properties and these two buttons right
here are going to toggle them so let's
just make sure that these buttons are
displayed yep okay and they're not doing
anything currently because this isn't
really linked to explain it it's just
changing them from true or false and
it's not doing anything
so now I want to create a conditional
you
envy if right so the way we do that is
by saying T then we hike an F and set it
equal to something which is our doing
now if this boolean is true then this
paragraph tag here will show right if
this is false then this paragraph tag
won't show so let's set this equal to
error yeah so V if equals error so if
this error data is false then this won't
show I remember it's currently set to
false right here so this will not show
currently but when we toggle it then it
will show okay let's just add some text
in here and we'll just say there hasn't
been an error to sort is here and then
I'll save that if we come now to the
browser if we toggle the error you can
see when we toggle it we're making that
error property true and therefore since
V if will now equal true it shows if we
toggle it again we're making that error
property false and therefore V if equals
false and it won't shop so I just want
to inspect this element for a second and
if you can see right here the P tag is
in the Dom if we click trouble error the
P tag has been removed completely from
the Dom and we just see this little
comment where it was no so it's taken
out and it's putting it in the Dom
complete so let's just do the same with
success for a now let's just copy that
and paste it down below and at this time
this is going to be success all right so
we'll save that now and check this out
so we can total success and it still
says there's been an error and that's
because they're not change this and
instead we'll say new success arsenal
okay so now if we save this check it out
Tuggle yep we get a success message
toggle yeah we get an error message but
we can't show both of these at the same
time which is a bit weird because you
don't generally have an error and
success at the same time so what we can
do is say instead of e
if we can say V else/if
right so now it's going to check this
first of all if it's true it will show
this okay and if it's true this won't
show even if this is true because the
same else okay so only if this is false
we'll move on to this and then check if
this is true
make sense and then if this is true it
will show this if it's false it wants to
show this so if we save these check it
out in a browser so first of all we'll
toggle
success and that works then we'll toggle
error that works then we'll try and
toggle success and now it's no longer
showing okay regardless of whether this
is true or false
toggle success of success rather is
still not showing and that's because we
have this else if so it's only checking
this else if statement if this is false
right make sense it's a bit like
JavaScript programming you agree your L
statement and your else if so that's a
simple little example to show you how
these work I want to show you one more
thing and that is V show so they're
comment nose out and underneath here
what we're going to do instead is two
more paragraphs so P and then V - sure
this is a different directive but does a
very similar thing I'm going to set that
equal to error again and inside here
we'll just copy this text there has been
an error and also I'm going to do one
more for the success so this is going to
be show equals success and success okay
cool so now this is going to do a
similar thing it's going to show this
element if error right here is true and
it's going to hide it if error is false
so for this one if success is true it's
going to show this otherwise it's going
to hide it so let's view it will say
toggle error and we get exactly the same
behavior toggle success the same
behavior so what's the difference
between V show and the if well if you
remember
when we inspected this element if we
toggle the error then it took it out
completely
however V show when we toggle it and it
becomes false just gets a style of
display:none it doesn't take the element
out of the Dom okay it just gives it
this style of display:none
and that's the subtle difference so
there we know there's some conditionals
using a V if and V show and these are
going to come in handy later when we're
serving different content to the user
depending on different statuses or
different properties within our data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
