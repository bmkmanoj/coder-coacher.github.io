tenth CSS animations tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can change duplicate animations together
Wow let's so this is our animation so
far or looking pretty cool except what I
want to do now is add on another
animation to this Mario dude right here
so that's some part down this road he
just jumps just once that's all I want
just for the jump once and so to do that
we're going to have to chain two
animations together but the first step
as we know is to create our animation
using keyframes so we're going to do
that first of all for the jump animation
so we'll just say add keyframes and call
this jump and then we're going to define
our animation in here but this time
instead of using from and - I'm going to
show you another way to do it because if
you think about it there's no longer
going to be two states to this animation
there's going to be three
the first date is when he's on the
ground the second state is when he's up
in the air jump top and the third state
is when it's come back down to the
ground so we can't use from and to
anymore because that's just covering two
states we need three states so the other
way I'm going to show you is by using
percentages and these are really good
because it means we can use multiple
states in between 0 which is the start
of the animation and 100% which is the
end all right so instead of front we're
going to say not percent that's the
start of the animation and at this point
we want the top value to be minus 40
pixels because that's where Mario starts
if we just zoom up here to where Mario
is you can see the top value is minus 40
to begin with all right so when we come
back down we want halfway through this
animation Mario to be in midair now
halfway is about 50% yet so we're going
to say top - 100 pixels so there's going
to skew up into the air at 50% through
the animation now at the end we want him
to come back down which is up 100%
so we'll say top is minus 40 pixels
again so it's going to come back down at
the end cool so there is our keyframes
animation defined now we just need to
attach it to that dude right there Mario
so let's go up here to Mario and you can
see we've already got one animation
associated with it so now how do we
chain and not
animation to this well it's dead simple
all we need to do is put a comma there
and then add on our second animation and
its values after this so what I'll do is
just scoot down to the next line so you
can read this a little bit easier and
then first of all we're just going to
pass through the animation name which is
jump and then I want this to take about
nine point three seconds and then I want
there to be a little bit of a delay as
well I don't want it to jump straight
away as soon as we refresh the page I
want to wait about one to two seconds so
I'll just bought but one point two
second delay or something like that
let's just put the seconds in there and
then after that what I want to do is set
the timing function to be ease to make
it just look a little bit more natural I
just want this animation to occur once
so I'm not going to put another integer
in for this thing right here the repeat
I'm just going to leave it like that so
now when we refresh after one point two
seconds you saw that little jump right
there and it just does it the ones show
you one more time cool all right so now
we have successfully chained two
animations together on this one element
and that's how we do it that's all we do
we just combine them by comma separating
them dead simple so if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
