very first git and github tutorial okay
so first of all what is git well if you
give a quick google search of that
question you're probably going to get an
answer like this git is a distributed
version control system right thanks
q-ball that really answers the question
so basically what Google means is that
it's a system that's going to retard
changes to our files over time and we
can recall any specific version of those
files at any given time which is really
cool and is going to save you a lot of
time down the line and also it allows
many people to easily collaborate on a
project and they can all have their own
version of that project and the files
within it on the computer to work on in
their own time so to explain why this is
really cool and why you should be using
it on all your projects I just want to
kind of hark back to you when I first
started web development and basically I
started doing websites for clients just
to build up my portfolio who were paying
me basically in coupons or tokens or
offers or something that's how much they
valued me at the time but anyway one of
my first clients they sent me a website
design and they taking you code this
open and said yeah yeah that's fine so I
created a project directory on the
computer put all the code files in there
and then uploaded those to a server and
assenting the link to the website and
said hey here we go it looks like the
design and what he did was take a look
at that and then email back and says no
you know what I don't like all this blue
over here and all this blue over here
can we change the theme just make all
pink so I'm like okay well you should
have put that in the design but okay
whatever I did it and I reloaded all the
files I changed them all in this
directory we uploaded them sent in the
link again and it got back to me I said
mmm you know what I don't like the
layout I simply mean to you know can we
dig the layout move the text over here
the image over here etc so I was like
well alright whatever I'll just make
these changes in the project directory
again we upload them you know send you
the link and they take a look at it and
says I've been doing my research and now
instead of having these links in the
head
really cool if we have these links in a
sidebar instead what you think can you
do that at this point I'm just losing
the will to live but I do it I make all
the changes in my project folder here we
upload them send them to them and say
look here it is here's your final
version at which point he takes a few
days to get back to me and says you know
what really sorry but I think the
original design is 101 so at this point
I just want to fill the website full of
profanities but I don't because I'm
professional I make the changes you know
redo the whole website basically to the
original design now reload them and I
just get it signed off and it all
finishes but basically this wasted a lot
of my time right so I had this amazing
idea which was kind of like my initially
under thought take on version control
because I didn't even know about gate
bugs in so what I started doing and I
really thought this was groundbreaking
by the way he was making different
versions of folders for different kind
of rounds of edits if you like so I
create the initial website and
ultimately a client always comes back
and says you know I want a round of
changes so what I do was duplicate that
folder into one called v2 then just make
the changes in there upload it if you
want some more changes create one called
v3 v4 etc that way if he ever says oh
you know what I want to go back to v2 or
v1 adapter recode anything all I have to
do is a reload this folder
okay so I've not edited that I've just
made copies and this worked well for a
vinyl before I only don't meeting
clients that worried maybe twenty-five
revisions and at this point this was
eaten up and a lot of my hard drive
which was start to look something like
this so I needed a better way of doing
this and this is where I found get and
get with an absolute game changer
because what gets allowed me to do was
store all of my revisions of a project
in just one directory so I have this
kind of revision history and then I
could rewind any revision I made in that
one project that I wanted him okay so
that was immensely cool and save me a
lot of time and it also allowed me to
work on new features without messing up
the main code base and this is something
called burns
which we're going to learn about later
on top of that it easily allowed me to
collaborate with other programmers
developers designers is I was working in
a team which was really cool as well and
she was touching on this last one and we
can easily sync up to github to make
that even easier
okay so github is an online service that
hosts our projects right and we can
easily share a code then with other
developers on our team those developers
can download the projects and work on
them in their own machines we can all
reload our edits and then merge them
into the main codebase at the end so
this is immensely cool great time saver
and yeah I'm definitely glad I found it
now you don't really need to know
anything before you take this course but
I'm getting you some kind of programmer
or designer that wants to kind of Store
revisions as you go along the one thing
I will suggest is this text editor right
here this is what I'm going to be using
for this series it's called Adam and the
reason I've suggested it is because it's
free cool and you can customize the hell
out of it so you can download it at Adam
I all right there just click this big
button there so there we go that's your
whirlwind introduction to git and github
in the next tutorial what we're going to
do is start setting it up on our
computer so we can use it now if you
like these videos please wear friends

and I'm going to see you in the very
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
