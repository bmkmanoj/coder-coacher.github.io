12th boot shop 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at some
button styles Wow alright here we go
then
so either pre-written a lot of code here
and it's not commented out at the minute
except for this stuff right at the top
which is just an anchor tag a button tag
and an input field of type submit' so
these are typically the elements you're
going to use for things like buttons
things that you use it is going to click
on right on your website now this is how
bootstrap stylez them by default and it
is a little bit different from default
browser styles it looks a little neater
and I can demonstrate that by getting
rid of this stylesheet right here so
I'll delete that and you can see it
reverts back to default browser stars
over here not quite as nice in fact
pretty oblique so let's delete that
rather put it back in okay but we can
also add some additional classes to our
button elements to make them look better
all right so let's uncomment this little
chunk of code right here and the basic
style or the basic class that we need to
apply to any kind of button if you want
to use bootstrap styles is the BTN plus
and this is kind of like a global class
and it gives you styles like the padding
on the button the border radius you can
see it's got a little curve at the
corner the central aligning of the text
that kind of thing right so that's like
a global class and then what we also
need to do is add a contextual class
which controls the the look of the
button even more so things like the
color okay or the border or the Holika
so at the mini I'm using BTN default and
that looks pretty much like this right
here now you'll notice if I take away
the BTN default plus see the anchor tag
it looks not much different from this
one here but you can still see that it's
getting that padding around the element
and if we hover over the element you can
also see is getting that border radius
as well so like I say this here is the
global kind of class which applies those
styles and then we add the contextual
class to give it the color all right so
let's put that back in that is the
default contextual class so all the
contextual classes
pretty much BTN - something so this is
default and down here we have got the
other ones so what I forgot we've got
button default but we've already seen
here okay then we've got primary which
is blue then info like a blue warning
yellow danger red and success which is
green now this is better the right for
example button
you know blue or button red because it
actually means something in the hand in
the HTML it's more semantic okay it's
got meaning to it so if something's
gonna be you know a warning then button
warning is more semantic than button red
yeah and the idea is that if you
download different themes or you make it
all bootstrap theme then you can color
these different classes differently so
we want theme the danger button might be
read in another theme the danger button
button that might be purple all right so
you do have a lot of flexibility when it
comes to theme in and whatnot but they
are the contextual classes we use all
right then so we've also got size
classes we can use so I'll get rid of
that comment right there and you can see
we've got an extra small one small one
and a large one and there let me just
make this a little bit bigger over here
so you can see it all so the the extra
small one just has an extra class of BTN
- XS that's those four extra small small
one is BTN SM large one is BTN LG and
that is what they look like in the
browser all right now if you just watch
this small one for a second if I take
away this class right here then it gets
a little bit bigger it reversed to the
default size which is like a medium size
if you like so you only add a class for
extra small small and large nothing for
medium okay so let's put that back in
and one more thing I want to show you is
this thing right at the bottom these are
the active and disabled classes so let's
make this a little bigger as well now if
you've got a button which is currently
being pressed down like if you clicking
and holding then you'd use the active
class to style that you see like that
it's got a little in a shadow so it
looks like so
one is pressing down on it the disable
classic we don't want a user to click a
button that it looks something like that
that's pretty cool right and we can use
them with the other kind of contextual
Styles as well so we've got default here
and primary they all look a little bit
different
all right now we can do it as well read
the other tags so for example button but
we can do this one slightly different so
with button we could say class equals
BTN then BTN default and then instead of
giving it a disabled or an active class
what I can do is say disabled equals
disabled all right and that will also
have the effect if I put some text in
here to say button now if you look over
here that's got the same style as this
but if I hover over this nothing happens
if I hover over the button this happens
which is pretty cool right okay so they
are your button classes in a nutshell
guys if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
