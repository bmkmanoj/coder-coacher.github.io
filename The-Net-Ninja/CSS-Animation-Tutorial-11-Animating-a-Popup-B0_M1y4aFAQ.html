11th CSS animation tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
animate a pop-up ah
or rather dudes so now we know the
basics of animation it's time to kind of
take your skills and apply into some
practical examples we might use on a
website so the first one is this pop-up
now I've gone into web examples right
here and opened up this pop-up dot HTML
file and this style dot CSS file which
is there now
now this HTML is pretty simple I've just
got a div with an idea pop-up then I've
got this image at the top then this
container contains all of this stuff
right here h1 a P tag and input right
here a button and then the cross up
there as well now I've got some CSS for
this which I'm not going to go into too
much because and that's not what I'm
here to them here to show you how to
animate things but if you want to
download these files you can get those
from a github page and just go through
this yourself obviously if you have any
questions about it feel free to ask but
oh yeah basically that's just styling
this to look like it is on the page so
if you scroll down a little bit you can
see this little comment where I've got
pop-up animation styles and we're going
to pop all that stuff right there don't
worry about this stuff an out that's all
for a little tutorial ok so first thing
I want to show you actually on this CSS
is the pop-up id which is near the top
and you can see there it's got a top
value of 200 pixels that's just bringing
it down from the top of the page by 200
pixels I think is that the one yes it is
ok cool so what I want to do is actually
hide this off the screen to begin with
so I'm going to get that pop-up again
and I could apply it to the stuff up
there but I want to keep all the stuff
that we're doing together down here
below this comment so this pop-up I now
want to give a top value of minus 400
pixels instead and that's going to scoot
it way off the page right cool now then
what I want to do is create some
animation effect for this pop-up so
we'll create our keyframes
we'll say at keyframes and we'll call
this drop because what we want to do is
let this pop-up drop down here onto the
page right so we'll call it drop
and then we're going to use the
percentages again that we looked at in
the last tutorial so we'll say at zero
percent at the start of the animation
right nothing actually happens yet you
know we don't want to do anything with
it so we'll go to about 70 percent where
we want it to come down to the bottom
down here so 70 percent through the
animation I want to say give it a
transform property where we're going to
translate Y and then we're going to
translate it by about 700 pixels so
that's going to bring it down by about
700 pixels right so it was it - 400 now
that's going to add 700 pixels to this
it's going to be 300 pixels from the top
makes sense and then when it gets to
100% I want it just to go back up a
little bit so we're getting that bouncy
effect it's going to go boom and then go
back up at the end all right so 100%
will say transform again and this time
translate Y to about 650 pixels that's
just going to bring it up by 50 pixels
that's all it's going to do now all we
need to do is apply this animation to
this pop-up so I'm going to say
animation is going to be drop then it's
going to take about not point 5 seconds
I'm going to give it the ease for the
timing function and then I'm just set it
to forwards so that it stays there at
the end okay so if we take a look at
that again I'll refresh you can see now
is coming down got that little bounce
effect just before it you know go stable
and that was pretty cool okay I want to
do one more thing I want to just give
this an opacity to begin with over 0 all
right and then at the end I want to give
it an opacity of 1 so as well as
dropping is going to fade in as well and
it just looks a little nicer
so we'll say opacity 1 at the end save
that and see what it does and now it's
just kind of fades in as well which is
quite nice all right pretty cool so that
is how we make a nice little pop up
using it keyframes I want to show you
one more thing just for the hell of it I
probably wouldn't do this on your
website but we're just going to give it
this kind of swing defect where the
pop-up comes down stays there for a
second or two and then it will swing
down using this as the origin okay so
let's create another key frames
animation will say at key frames again
and we'll call this swing and what we're
going to do this time is say at 0% we're
going to transform this so that we're
going to translate it by Y to be 650
pixels now we have to do that because I
don't want the translate property the
transform property rather to override
anything we've done previously so
although this is still staying at 650
pixel throughout all these different
transitions down here these different
states rather I still have to explicitly
say it so that it doesn't override this
one down here okay if I left this out
and just use a rotate transform which
I'm going to do in a second then it
would override this and get rid of the
translate Y so I have to explicitly put
that in each state okay so that it's
always translated by 650 pixels
cool I hope that makes sense all right
the next thing we're going to do is
rotate it and this is where we're going
to get the swing effects so rotate Z
because that's going to swing it
downwards this way because the z axis
goes into the page like skew is the page
right and it's going to rotate around
that so rotate Z to begin with it's
going to be zero degrees right and then
what we'll do is say at about 40% so
just under halfway through we're going
to need this thing again because like I
say we pop that through in every state
so that it doesn't override the previous
one and then we're going to set the
rotate Z to be around about 90 degrees
so roundabouts strike down here okay and
then after that at about 70% so towards
the end we wanted to swing buckle it a
little bit because we want to make it
look natural and just swing a little at
the end okay so instead of just swinging
here and stop in there which looks a
little unnatural we want it to swing go
further than it should and come back a
little like that so a 70% we're going to
bring it back in we're going to use that
transform again just to keep that steady
and then we're going to say rotate Zed
again unless
we'll say about 70 degrees so we swung
from zero to begin with down to 90 and
then bringing it back into 7:10 then I
want to do one more and a hundred
percent and I'm going to use that
transform once more and then say rotate
Z and this time we'll say 75 degrees
just a tiny little last swing so it's
going to go like that and just steady on
right at the bottom okay cool so there's
our keyframes defined now we just need
to apply this animation to this as well
so we know how to chain these animations
together now we just put a little comma
right there let's scoot this in in a
little bit
now the second animation is called swing
I want this to take about two seconds a
little longer because it's going to be a
little slower than the other animation
and I also want it to be the be a delay
on this animation because I don't want
it to happen straight away as it comes
down I want it to come down stay there
for a minute or so well not a minute
bought a few seconds and then swing down
so let's put a little bit way I'm around
about three seconds on this that should
probably do then we're going to give it
an easing timing function so it looks a
little more natural and then what also
I'm going to say four words so that it
stays at the end right now check this
out that doesn't look natural because
it's kind of swinging from this point
right here now we don't want now we want
it to swing from this point right here
so how can we tell CSS to do that for us
well we use the transform origin
property now the transform origin
property basically says at what kind of
origin we want to swing around or rotate
around ok so right now by default is
going through the center the skew is
going through the center and we're
rotating about that point which is why
we're getting this weird rotate effect
but we if you look at this one the
rotate point to be here so that it
swings down yet so we can set that by
using the transform origin property so
let's come up here onto this an element
and we'll say
transform - origin
and then we want it to be about ten
pixels across and ten pixels down which
is roughly there check this out now this
looks a little bit better yeah it's
going off the screen but if I make this
fullscreen and refresh then it's
probably going to look a little better
all right there we go so we've got the
the animation coming down and then
swinging at the end pretty cool right
so there we go guys that is how we make
a pop up in CSS animations any questions
feel free to leave those down below
otherwise I'm going to see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
