very first MongoDB tutorial for
beginners and in this video I'm just
going to give you a quick introduction
as to what MongoDB is and the kind of
things you're going to learn along the
way
alright they're straight down to
business what is MongoDB it is a no
sequel database and that basically means
that instead of storing data in tables
as we would with a sequel database like
my sequel we instead store it in
documents or collections of objects much
like JavaScript notation okay now if we
think about this for a minute that makes
sense if we're using nodejs on the
server because it's easier to
communicate with a no sequel database
when we're using JavaScript objects so
it's really good when we're using
javascript and we can use it anytime we
want to store data and persist it in our
application for example a web app right
and Mongo is the N in the mean acronym
so you've probably heard about the mean
stack Mongo is the M expresses the e
angular is a and nodejs
is the n and these are interchangeable
by the way so the way it works is as
follows we have our client the browser
so we navigate to a website in the
browser yeah we've got node running on
the server in this case and when we make
a request to that server the server
handles it if we want to see some data
it goes off to MongoDB it grabs that
data brings it back and it can show it
to us in the client of the browser so
that's all pretty simple right so what
the hell is this dude sitting in the
middle for right here this is called
Mongoose and it is a package that we can
install on nodejs on the server which
makes communicating with MongoDB that
much easier so in this tutorial we're
going to be installing mongoose via no
js' the node package manager and we're
going to be using that to communicate
with MongoDB
so it's much easier for us alright so
that's how it works and in this course
what we going to be doing is first of
all installing MongoDB and mong-koo so
I'm going to show you how to do that in
the next tutorial then we're going to be
looking at basic crud operations that's
create read update and delete so these
are the four operations you're going to
be typically using when you're working
with MongoDB ok then finally or rather
not finally throughout the whole
course we're going to be looking at
mocha as well which is a testing
framework so we're going to be learning
about that on the side and just a couple
of things you will need to know before
starting this course the first one is
JavaScript we're going to be writing all
of our code in this playlist in
JavaScript so that is a must if you
don't know any of that I've got playlist
on that so I'll leave the link down
below and second of all you're going to
need to have no js' installed on your
computer because we're going to use the
npm or the node package manager okay so
i'm going to show you how to do that you
don't need to be a wizard in nodejs or
anything like that
i'm going to show you how to install it
and we'll go from there okay so just a
few more things i want to show you first
of all this is adam this is the TextEdit
said that I'm going to be using in this
playlist a lot of people always ask me
what editor I'm using and it is this
thing right here I think you'll agree it
looks really nice and it's extendable as
well comes with lots of different
packages that you can install okay so if
you want to download that just click
this button right here second I'm going
to be using CMD a or commander however
you want to pronounce it as my
command-line tool so if you want to
download that it's free as well you can
come down here and go to download right
there if you don't want to do that you
can use the inbuilt windows on that one
whichever one you prefer I just like
using this all this is the node.js
website no JSTOR you're gonna need to
install this as well dead simple all you
want to do is click this button right
here get this one if you want the lake's
which features but this is adequate as
well click that it's going to walk you
through a dead simple installation
process just go through all that and
you'll have no js' installed on your
computer if at the end of that you want
to check that you've got no js'
installed on your computer just go to
whatever command line tool you're using
and you can say node V and that's going
to throw back what version of node
you've currently got installed on your
computer so if it throws back a number
like this then you have been successful
well done all right so after that I have
got some course files I'm just going to
zoom in so you can see these a bit
better I've created a repository on
github called MongoDB playlist and all
of the course files are in this
repository I've got a different branch
for each different lesson so if you want
the individual code for each lesson just
choose that branch and you can see all
right here or if you want to download it
all just go to master which is right at
the bot
and then you can come to clone or
download you can download the zip folder
or you can copy this thing right here
and then clone the repository in your
computer and I'm going to show you how
to do that
in the very next lesson I'm also going
to show you how to download MongoDB and
install that on your computer as well so
there we go guys
that is your introduction to MongoDB if
you enjoyed these videos please don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'm going to see you in a very next
