you're watching CSS beginners lesson 36
and in this video we're gonna dive right
into the box model that's coming up Wow
alright so what exactly is this box
model well the box model is a way that
elements represent themselves on a page
in terms of space okay and say for
example we have an element in the middle
any block-level element could be a P tag
and we give that Peter a specific width
and a specific kind that's going to
control the horizontal and vertical
spacing that that element takes up on a
page right now in addition to that we
have a few other properties which
control its spacing also and the first
thing is the padding which is an
internal spacing okay so within the
boundaries of that element it has
padding from the element edge and the
element edge itself can have a border
can be one pixel thick and that's the
gray line here by the way on 20 pixels
thick however thick you want it to be
that also controls a space within the
document and finally we've got this
margin property which we saw in the last
lesson which controls the space between
different elements on a page okay so
that's the box model other glance what
we're going to do now is jump into the
code and have a look at an example Wow
alright guys so Harry I'm back in the
code and as you can see every place the
previous content with these two div tags
here they've both got a class of box and
then just this little bit of text in the
div tags too okay now I'll give this
class of box a few different properties
the first one is the margin if it's also
remember that's the external kind of
spacing between elements the second one
is the padding which is the internal
space and that's got a punning of 30
pixels the third one is the border and
I'm saying I want that to be solid and
one pixel thick and color of zero zero
zero in hex code which is black and then
I want it to have a width of 400 pixels
and a height of 200 pixels so I've got
two of those box classes and we're going
to look at this now in a browser all
right so you can see now this is the
border the content in between and we
can't see specifically how big the
margins are how big the padding
is you know the width that kind of thing
but Google browser Chrome browser has
this cool thing within its dev tool so
we go down to inspect element on this
and if we hover over one of these
elements now we can see yeah okay the
blue box in the middle that is the
content height of width okay so that's
the how I think it was 400 by 200
Jerry's 400 by 200 pixels that blue box
represents that space okay now the green
color on there represents the padding
and that's 20 pixels so you can see all
around the blue we've got padding of 20
pixels and then just beyond that is the
border you can see that faint line
that's one pixel and then all around
that it's a margin of 20 pixels now you
might look at the right-hand side of
that and say well I'm god that's a huge
part in on the right hand side and
that's because there's nothing else in
that space so automatically you know
it's applying that margin because this
is a block level element each block
level element occupies its own space in
their document on top of each other so
it's occupying all the space on that in
Rome if you like okay so it's using the
margin to kind of fill up that space so
that is the box model in action and
google chrome also has this cool thing
down here you can see the box model down
here in more detail and you can see the
main content here in blue is 400 by 200
pixels then ever hover over this bit
here goes green that's the padding of 30
pixels the border is one pixel thick and
then the margin is 30 pixels thick okay
now then you may be looking at this and
thinking well we've got two elements
here okay and when I'm hovering over the
margin you can see that the this space
here okay when I hover over again it's
30 pixels in height okay that margin now
we've got a 30 pixels on the bottom on
as well how is it we've not got 60
pixels in total between the two elements
because we've got 30 on this one and 30
on this one well that is a thing called
the vertical margin collapse and I'm not
going to cover that now I'm going to do
that in a lesson coming up in the future
but essentially what happens is when
you've got two vertical margins they
collapse
the higher of the two is taken as the
margin okay I go through this later in
more detail in a different video I just
want to give you a brief overview now
okay so that's the box model in action
what I'm going to do now is you see what
happens when we take off the whip
properties and the height properties so
let's get these two properties here
delete them so we're not specifying a
wick and we're not specifying a high so
let's open this back up in the browser
see what's gone on all right so what's
happened here is the elements have
stretched to essentially fill the
horizontal space here and that's because
their block level elements and
essentially every block level level
element occupies this on its own space
in the document and takes all if you
don't specify the width or height
property and width of the full kind of
document width there so if we inspect
this element again you can see now we've
got the margin okay at 20 pixels we've
got the padding oh sorry 30 pixels the
padding your third pixels then the
content is the thin blue strip in the
middle okay so the height is specified
automatically by the height of the
content which is just the the twelve or
fourteen pixels have had that the P tag
is okay so they're taking up the full
width of the the parent element okay so
that's what happens when you don't
specify a width now this is not to be
confused with here put in width a
hundred percent because that will be
slightly different and I'll show you
what I mean okay although that SERPs
although that this here is essentially
occupying a hundred percent of this
width here apart from the margin which
is specified if we put specifically a
width of 100% you would expect that to
be the same right let's view it in a
browser and see what happens then okay
now you can see it's gone over and you
may have be sitting there thinking well
what you know I've specified a width of
a hundred percent what the hell's
happening here and this is what a lot of
designers start out doing when they
first start with CSS and they get
confused with the box model and the
reason it's doing this is because this
width here if we right click this blue
width here is given itself a width of
100%
okay so just a blue bit okay and 100%
would be oops all of this area here
right all of this parent element width
so it's given itself that full hundred
percent with now on top of that it's got
the padding of 30 pixels the border of
one pixel and the margin of 30 pixels as
well okay so it's actually 100% plus all
of that other stuff which is causing it
to overflow here alright so when we say
width 200 pixels the overall width is
not too much of pixels that's just the
width of that little blue bit in the
middle the actual content on top of that
we've got 30 pixels on each side of
margin so 30 pixels on the left it
pixels on the right and then we've got
padding of 30 pixels on the left and 30
pixels on the right and then we've got
this border of one pixel on the left and
one pixel on the right so in total it's
essentially 200 in width plus 30 on the
Left margin 30 on the right margin plus
30 on the left padding plus 30 on the
right padding plus one pixel border of
our books one pixel border on the right
so the overall width there is all of
this combined which is 260 320 320 2
pixels right okay so you have to be
really careful when you're specifying
your whips and your padding is just you
know pay attention to all the different
properties you're applying to it so
let's just kind of view this in the
browser to see if that totting up I did
opposite 322 pixels so let's see if we
right-click this and we hover over it
you can see now it's saying 262 pixels
however that's just taken into account
the border the content of 200 pixels and
the padding of 30 pixels it's not
showing you the additional 30 pixels of
margin on each side so we'd add that
additional 60 pixels that's making it
then 3 to 2 pixels
okay so this might be a little bit a
little complicated at first to get your
head around but just refer back to
google chrome dev tools if you're ever
wondering why things are overflowing and
it specifies here for you exactly what's
going on okay so
you probably gotta have a few questions
about this if you have any of those feel
free to comment down below and I'll
answer all of those as soon as I can if
not please like subscribe or share if
you enjoyed these videos and I'll see
you guys in the next video where we're
gonna look at the margin a little more
in depth I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
