CSS for beginners lesson 51 and in this
video we're gonna take a look at browser
support Wow so before we dive deep into
browser support which is a really
important topic by the way I just want
to ask you how do we view websites and
yeah it's a simple answer we view
websites typically in a browser namely
one of these ones here these are the
most popular ones so Safari Firefox
Opera Chrome or Internet Explorer now if
I'm viewing a web site I'll typically
just use one of these Chrome I'll use
but if I'm making your website if I'm
coding one up then before I put it live
I'll test it thoroughly in each one of
these because different people use
different browsers so they'll be viewing
my web site in a different browser than
me now each of these browsers have
different standards and different levels
of support when it comes to CSS some of
them support everything some of them
support most things and some of them
don't support a lot of things so you
have to test each browser carefully to
make sure that all of your CSS looks
good in each browser and if it doesn't
then we have to provide fallback options
or other ways of getting around that so
that people viewing your website have a
good experience of it okay so the first
way we do that is by simple fallback
options now I've talked about fallback
options briefly when we've looked at
gradients okay but not in any depth now
a fallback option is something that you
provide to a browser should a certain
CSS feature not work and we did this
with gradients we said we had our rule
here and we said we wanted a linear
gradient okay
now a fallback option would be this
thing here the background color now
because not all browsers out-of-the-box
support this linear gradient feature if
that this thing here wasn't there if the
browser didn't support this then it
wouldn't have any background property
however because this is here above it
then it will fall back to the white
colored background okay so the CSS
is a cascade remember it comes from the
top to bottom so it comes down here it
finds this background property in this
rule and it calls it white then it comes
down here and it finds another
background property now if it supports
this linear gradient then this
background property will override this
if it doesn't support it that it won't
override this and this will remain so
that is the fallback option okay so
that's one way of getting around browser
inconsistencies now that might not
always work so you want to check whether
certain browsers can use certain effects
or certain features sometimes and to do
that I'm gonna recommend can I use com
so you've probably seen this website a
few times because I've been on it a few
times during this playlist now it's a
dead good website it tells you whether
certain features are available in
certain browsers and that's not just for
CSS but also for html5 JavaScript etc so
it's really good all you need to do is
search for your property up here we'll
put gradient in and then it comes up
with all the browser's here and whether
it can support it now green means it can
support it yellow which isn't here means
it partially supports it and red means
it doesn't support it so you can see
that everything supports it pretty much
except for these here and there so
Internet Explorer eight to nine they
don't support it and what's cool is it
gives you the global browser usage so if
this is really low then the fact that
it's not supported may not matter to you
you know it's less than 1% is my general
kind of rule if the global usage is less
than 1% then that's fine by me okay
however if it's more than one percent
you may want to come up with some
alternative but this is a really cool
website to find out where the browser's
support those features and it also gives
you more notes down here if you want to
read about it some sub features and
resources to the w3 specification and
other links here so it's a really cool
website this is my first stop if I come
across a new CSS feature that I go to to
check that I can use it in all the
browsers ok the next thing I want to
show you is this please
aiyoh forward slash play and this is too
give you a vendor prefix cold so we saw
before that gradients in some browsers
require a vendor prefix and a vendor
prefix is just a bit of experimental
code used by certain browsers to allow
those features to be used okay so for
example the WebKit vendor prefix here
that is so that the linear gradient can
be used within WebKit browsers such as
Chrome okay because that with the box it
may not be supported so we use this
experimental syntax here so that it can
be used within Chrome and then after a
while chrome may adopt it natively and
we no longer need to use this and it
will pick up this okay so what I've done
here is I've just put this little a plus
here I've given it a background of
linear gradient and then over here it
converted it into the code that I need
for it to be supported in all browsers
so it's added this WebKit vendor prefix
in so I just copy and paste this now and
pop that back in macomb so that's a
really cool website for generating
vendor prefixed code and the last thing
I want to show you is a little bit more
advanced it's moderniser which is a
JavaScript library and it detects html5
and css3 features within the user
browser and say you have certain
features within that browser that you
want to use if it enables those features
the browser then you can use them if not
then you can use this javascript library
to provide alternative features and
fallback options so that's quite cool
I'm not going to go into this
interesting much detail because it's
beyond the scope of this course but by
all means get out there and try this on
your own because it is quite cool so
that's about it for this lesson
if you have any questions whatsoever
about browser support feel free to

those otherwise and if you enjoy these
