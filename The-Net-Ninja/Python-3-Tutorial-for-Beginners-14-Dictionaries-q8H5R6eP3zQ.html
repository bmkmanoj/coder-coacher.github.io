fourteenth pointed three tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
victories so I've got some good news
we're going to learn about another data
type you and this data type is called a
dictionary an addiction rate is a
mapping type which means basically it's
a set of key value pairs and if you're
familiar with JavaScript you're going to
think it looks a lot like JavaScript
object notation so let's just dive in to
the interactive shell and start creating
a dictionary so to run the shell I'm
going to type Python and then we're
going to create this new dictionary and
we're going to store it in a variable
called ninja underscore else that's
going to equal addiction right now the
notation to create a dictionary of these
curly braces right here so again very
much like JavaScript object notation
then what we do is we passing in a
series of key value pairs so for example
in this case the key is going to be a
ninja name and the value is going to be
the belt color that they have so the key
is giving in quotations and this can be
single or double doesn't really matter
and this is B crystal and then we do a
colon and then again because we're using
the strings and a value they're going to
be in quotations this is going to be a
red belt to add more values to colors
separate them so the next one is going
to be array and ryu is going to be a
black belt
so we'll put black in for the value so
now we have this linger on the score
belts dictionary so it returns that
dictionary to us when we call it okay
cool so what if we want to retrieve the
value of one of the elements in the
dictionary of one of the keys well we
can use square bracket notation to do
that so we can say ninja belts first of
all square brackets then whatever key we
want to find the value to so I'm going
to pass in a crystal again it's going to
be in quotes so crystal and this should
return red which it does likewise I can
do array loop and it returns black okay
but what if I try and access something
that's not in the dictionaries like
Yoshi
well we get an error so sometimes it's
cool to check whether the key actually
exists in a dictionary before
you try and retrieve it so how can we do
that well we can use something that
called key and get basically and what
this key is going to be is the actual
key we're looking for this is a key word
and paste it in and we're going to lock
in the dicta in this case it's going to
be ninja belts so we're gonna look for
Yoshi in ninja belt so we type Yash it
it's a string so we put it in quotations
and we say in its ninja underscore belts
and then this returns false because
Yoshi is not in ninja belts but if we
try it for example or value then we get
true because we're you is in ninja belts
another way to check the keys in
dictionary to see if something exists is
by getting a full list of the keys and
we can do that by saying ninja
underscore belts and then use a method
called dr. keys so now this is going to
return this we data type called dipped
keys and we have the keys in there now
if we want we could typecast this into a
list by saying the list much like we did
with the int type casting and then
passing the ninja underscore belts and
then dropped keys and now we're going to
get this as a lift which is much better
to work with okay we can do the same
thing for the values we can list all of
the values in dictionary and it works
pretty much the same we can say ninja
underscore belts dot values and this
returns another weird data type dipped
values with the two different values in
there so again we can typecast this into
a list which is what I'm going to do and
I'm going to store this in a list as
well in a variable so I'm going to say
valves equals then I'm going to say list
because we're using that to typecast
then ninja underscore belts dot values
and now we should have this list stored
in vowels cool so now it's in our list
we can work with it like counts how many
instances there are of a black belt for
example I could say vowels dot count and
that is going to give me books I've got
pasta in black stupid legs okay so
that's going to give me how many
instances of a black belt arrange that
list for do the same with med
and I could do the same with something
that doesn't exist and that's going to
give me zero okay so what if we want to
add a new ninja to this dictionary
pretty simple we use square bracket
notation again so I'm going to say ninja
underscore belts then the key that we
want to add goes in here in quotes so
it's going to be a Yoshi and then we set
that equal to something so we actually
is going to have a red bell as well
another press enter and go to ninja
belts this is going to return the
updated dictionary with this new key
value pair in it cool now I want to show
you one more thing before we head back
to the text editor and that is an
alternate syntax or an alternate way of
defining a new dictionary so say we want
to define a new dictionary which is a
person and it describes different things
about that person
so we'll store this in a variable called
person and before we use these curly
braces to create this new dictionary now
what we're going to do and you might see
this sometimes it's a gift
and then normal parentheses and in here
we can specify our key value pairs by
the slightly different way so say name
is equal to a string which is shown and
then age is equal to 27 now notice 27
doesn't have to be in a string because
in this case it's an integer this is a
string so it's in double quotes this
doesn't have to be and finally we can
say height is equal to 6 foot and if we
press ENTER and so person now we have
this person dictionary as well okay so
now I think we know enough to dive back
into the text editor and start to create
a small program like this so I'm just
going to exit out of here and clear the
console okay so now we kind of
understand the basics of dictionaries I
want to put that to use in some kind of
simple example so what I'm going to do
first of all is create an empty
dictionary and I'm going to call this
ninja belts so just send it equal to
this empty dictionary at the minute
nothing in it then what I want to do is
give the user the opportunity to enter
data to put into this dictionary so
you'll just have to bear with me while I
do this then a clicks play I'm going to
create a while loop now I'm not going to
pull
an expression that we're going to
evaluate here I'm just going to say
while true now this in essence is going
to create an infinite loop but what
we're going to do is break out of this
loop at certain points so while true
we're going to ask the user for a ninja
name so say ninja underscore name is
equal to input and I'll say entertaining
just name and then also we're going to
get the ninja belt color so I'll say
ninja underscore belt is equal to input
and I'll say enter a belt color okay and
then what I want to do is assign this
data to this picture so we have a name
which is a key and the belt would use a
value so what I can do is say ninja
underscore belts which is this empty
ditch there at the minute then we're
going to add something to this now I can
do that using the square bracket
notation and remember we add the key in
these square brackets and the key is the
name so ninja underscore name and we're
going to set that equal to the colored
belt so clean just underscore belt and
then we've added that item that key
value pair to this dictionary make sense
all right so now the user might want to
add another belt so we're going to give
them that opportunity
we're going to ask them if they want to
add another so I'll say another this is
the variable name and set it equal to
input and then I'll say in here add
another and they can answer yes or no
all right so then what I want to do is
check whether they've entered yes or no
so I say give another equals y then what
we're going to do is continue through
this loop and remember what continue
does is say ok we'll go back to the top
of the loop and start again ok so if the
enter yes we're going to go back to the
top of the loop and we're going to get
them to enter another name and another
belt and then add that all the data to
the dictionary as well and if they don't
else if they don't enter yes what we're
going to do is break out of this loop ok
so even though we've put through here
and this would
cause an infinite loop otherwise would
manually breaking out of this if they
enter n or any other letter other than Y
okay
so it's not going to cause that infinite
loop it's only going to keep going round
for as long as they say why yes they do
want to add another ninja all right and
so now we've done that what I want to do
is create a function that is going to
cycle through this dictionary after they
click no so once we've entered all the
ninjas that they want to enter and they
click now we break out the loop then I
want to create a function that we're
going to call which is going to cycle
through what the user has entered into
this dictionary and this function is
basically going to output some
introductions from these ninjas so let's
define this function deff and then the
function is going to be called ninja
underscore intro it's going to take a
dictionary in so I'll say dipped of
dictionary and this dictionary is going
to be listing right here later on but
for now what we're going to do is create
this function first of all so we're
going to cycle through this dictionary
so to do that I'm going to use a for
loop and I can say for and with
dictionaries what we can do is we can
cycle through the key and the valve
right so in previous tutorials when we
had a list would say something like this
for ninja in ninjas right and that would
cycle through a list called ninjas and
each element would be referred to as
this singular ninja now this time around
because we're cycling through a
dictionary which has key value pairs we
can actually say for key comet valve
okay so what we're doing is we're
getting the key and the value each time
around we're going through the
dictionary and then we have to say dot
items so that's going to get the items
within the dictionary and we're going to
cycle through those okay so each time
around we're going to have access to
this key and value pair so what I want
to do is output the key in the value
remember the keys the name and the value
is the belt color so I'll print
something here and this is going to be a
formatted string so this quality string
is going to say I am and then for the
output the key
because the key is the names we sent I
am whatever name and I am a valve belt
because well is the color makes sense
okay so now we've done this what we need
to do is call this function once we've
exited out of this loop so down here
we'll call the function or save ninja
underscore intro and we're going to pass
through this dictionary which is being
populated throughout this loop so let's
pass it in all right there and save it
and let's give this a will so I'm going
to say Python dictionaries dot py so run
this file so enter a ninja name actually
and the color is going to be any black
and add another yes and to an
engineering crystal and the color is
going to be red add another yep and turn
ninja name we'll call him Ryu and the
color is going to be green okay enter
another now so now we get I am Yorkshire
and a black belt I'm crystal I'm a red
bill
I am ray oh I am a green belt so cool
this has worked so there we go that's a
simple example of using a dictionary in
probably not a real life example because
we're not going to do this in real life
something so trivial but how we can use
in our code to cycle through data how
the user can input data etc so I hope
now dictionaries make a little bit more
sense to you
in the next video limit take this one
step further and look at sorting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
