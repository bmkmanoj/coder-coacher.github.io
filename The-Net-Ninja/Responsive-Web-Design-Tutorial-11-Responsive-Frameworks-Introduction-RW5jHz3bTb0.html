11th responsive design tutorial and in
this video I'm going to talk about
responsive frameworks Wow all right then
going so what the hell is a framework
anyway well a framework is just a set of
cold practices that are bundled together
in some kind of package which can help
us deal with a particular problem and
bundled in this package could be HTML
files CSS files JavaScript or other
files for different languages depending
on which one we use in right now the aim
of a framework is to make a particular
job or a particular task much easier for
the developer and one type of framework
is a fluid responsive framework and the
aim of that is to create a spot to make
creating responsive websites much easier
so when we use a framework we're going
to write our code in a way that the
framework wants us to so that we can
take advantage of the frameworks
benefits now a few examples of
responsive forum what's currently out
there here the first one skeleton is a
really lightweight frame where it kind
of gives it away with the name and it
just comes with a simple grid system and
a very small number of other features
such as a small style and effects for
forms and that kind of thing so it's
good if you first start out in
frameworks because there's not that much
to learn a much more feature-rich
framework is foundation and you can also
download that and play along with that
as well but the one I'm going to talk
about today and probably the most
popular one at the minute is bootstrap
and that's also very feature-rich comes
with a nice grid and also loads of other
features so we'll take a closer look at
that so one of the core aims of
bootstrap is to make creating responsive
websites very easy that's what it's good
at and to do that it comes bundled with
a fluid grist a grid system based on CSS
which handles a lot of the responsive
code for us so we take advantage of
these CSS rules by just adding classes
into our HTML and then it's going to
make it responsive for us we don't have
to write any extra responsive CSS which
is really cool it also comes with
although UI features such as drop-down
menu sliders
pop ups lots of different things like
that so we can make use of those as well
and it typically does this again for
your CSS or JavaScript now in case you
don't know what grid systems are just
quickly go over what they are basically
a grid splits a web page up into columns
and we can slide our content into
different columns on that web page so
say for example bootstrap by the way
uses a 12 column fluid grid system and
fluid just means it responds between
breakpoints I showed you that in earlier
tutorials so say for example we had a
sidebar on the left and the main content
on the right we could say hey the
sidebar we want to take off four columns
of room on the left
the rest of the columns which is eight
columns on the right is going to be
taken up by the main content so we would
just ride that in our HTML we'd add a
class for four columns for the the
sidebar and then we'd add a class for
eight columns for the main content and
then bootstrap is going to automatically
kind of work behind the scenes to stand
that up for us and make it responsive
really cool so sorry my phone's going
off I've got the minutes so the grid
system does all that for us and it takes
a lot of the development time and work
out of creating a responsive website so
it makes things much easier for us so
that is actually one of the benefits of
responsive frameworks it can prototype
quickly it's got a lot of the code
already made so we'd have to do it
ourselves and it's also good for either
small or large projects whatever you're
working on and one of the good things
about bootstrap is that we don't have to
download the whole thing we can just
download the parts of it that we want so
if we just want the grid we can just
download the grid if we want all those
extra bits like the popups etc we can
download those as well all right so I've
got ahead and gone to get bootstrap comm
which is where we're going to download
it from and we're just going to take a
quick look at bootstrap by the way I'm
not going to dive into it into any depth
I'm going to do a whole tutorial
playlist on this in the future because
that's what it's going to take but I'm
just going to give you a quick example
of what it's capable and how quickly you
can do it so to download you just click
this button right here and there's a few
different options you can download
yourself
and then put it in your folders or you
can get the the source code or this
advanced search option or you can just
use the CDM which is a content delivery
network which is normally what I like to
use so what I've done is copied all that
and I've pasted it into our HTML index
file just here like that in the head
okay so I'm gonna use that in a minute
but if you don't want to download it or
you can also go see this customize link
at the top and down here you can choose
exactly what you want you can change the
colors the typography and loads of
different things and all the different
plugins that you might want to add into
this package and other different
features and components you can deselect
or slept which ever ones you want so
that's really cool I'm not gonna do that
for the sake of this tutorial I'm just
going to download the whole lot because
it's a lot quicker so yeah I've already
done that and it's in the HTML but
before we go into the HTML even further
I just want to show you we click CSS up
here this is gonna show you a list of
all the different CSS features that come
baked into bootstrap and you get a list
on the right here I'm gonna click on
grid system and this just gives you an
introduction to what the grid system on
bootstrap is all about so you can see
here it says it scales up to 12 columns
as the device or viewport size increases
okay so blinded by the black touch of
how to use it here then it gives you the
media queries which it uses and an
example of the grid right there if I
just inspect the element and make the
viewport smaller oops
I'm gonna do is just click that and
choose that option okay now you can see
in a minute the grid is gonna change
like that and now you get all the
columns the 100% way and we'll show you
this on our website in a minute I just
wanted to show you what the grid system
is like on the bootstrap website there
so you can read all about it
I'll leave the bootstrap website link
down below so you can go and check it
out yourself anyway let us now jump into
the code so I've copied their CDN links
and I pop them right there in the head
and what I have done is come down here
and you see where we've got these
featured images if I just open this up
in a browser right now and refresh come
down here these are the
is right here and if we do this we
created this responsive code ourself in
the CSS it does that goes to two in a
row and then goes to one in a row okay
so that was our own code now in this
HTML right here that's there what I've
done is I've copied that code right and
essentially I've pasted it down here I'm
going to uncomment it now and you can
see we've still got the same image a tag
spun and spun again that's those four
elements right here but instead of using
Li tags on this ul and the featured
thing what I have done is I have used
bootstraps framework code practices
that's what you need to do so I made use
of the way that we should lay out our
code in our website using bootstrap that
way they're gonna do the heavy lifting
for us so the way they like to do it is
by using rows and columns okay so if you
look at the website if you think of this
thing right here as a row it's going
across the screen here and it's one
level deep if there were two loss of
these that were two rows but this at the
minute is one row and these things would
be columns right so let's go back to the
code so what I've done first of all is
create a div with a class of container
that's one of the things that bootstrap
likes you to do if you put a container
around your rows or just all your
content whatever you want to do and then
within the container you add a rope
that's that div right here you can see
it's got a class of row and that's
telling bootstrap look I'm going to
create a row of content here and in the
road we could have one column or we
could have four columns or three or two
and we could have the left column four
sorry you want to kind of sections okay
and the left section could be four
columns in width and the right section
could be eight columns and width that's
the kind of thing we're doing here so
we're saying we want a row right and
then right here I've got four elements
you can see four div tags with a class
each associated with them and they've
got the data in and the image the tag
etc okay so this row is containing all
of the columns and these the classes
were using for the columns and what I'm
saying here is okay when the or yeah
when the viewport is above a medium size
okay then I want each one of these divs
to occupy three columns it says call and
date which is out for medium and then
three okay Carl MD three so if they're
all occupying three columns and 3 plus 3
plus 3 plus 3 is 12 right so each
occupying an equal space in the row when
it gets to a small viewport size I want
them to occupy 6 columns each so it's
just gonna be two in each row
essentially yeah so you've got six
columns on the Left six on the right and
then underneath you'll have the same
again six on the left six on the right
and each image is going to take up six
columns yeah so they're gonna get bigger
and then finally when we get to
extra-small and take all X s 12 so extra
small viewports then each image is going
to take up 12 columns so it's gonna be
the full width okay makes sense so what
I'm gonna do is just comment out the top
stuff here because we don't want this
and end it right there I'll save it and
we'll view this in a browser now and
fingers crossed right this is worked
okay yeah so change a little bit there
so now this is bootstrap doing the
responsive stuff and it's going to look
a little bit different because they do
things differently to how I did it in
the CSS but as you watch get smaller
okay and it's from there then get
smaller again it goes to two in a row
and then when it gets small it goes to
one in a row okay so it's a little bit
different to how I did it and to be
honest with you
the way I did the CSS to make it more
responsive I prefer in this case but for
a lot of websites and for a lot of
things you're going to do on websites
bootstrap is amazing because I had to do
any CSS there to make it responsive it's
done all the heavy lifting for me all I
had to do is go along with their code
practices and give this a class of roll
and then choose how many columns I want
each one of these to bake so it's going
to be a lot easier for me as a developer
but don't want to spend a long time
designing or padding out the CSS for
responsive designs then I can just come
in here use bootstrap and add a few
classes and why laughs guys Bob's your
uncle
it's done it for you all right so it's
really easy to start prototyping at
different websites
all right then guys solves that just
about covers it for this tutorial I hope
you've got a better understanding as to
what frameworks and bootstrap is all
about now
