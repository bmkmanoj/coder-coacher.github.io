asynchronous JavaScript tutorial and in
this video we're going to talk about
Ajax requests Wow are the dudes so in
the last tutorial we talked about
asynchronous behavior and that typically
involved going out and grabbing some
data from somewhere and bringing it back
so in this tutorial I want to hold in on
that segment of how we actually go out
and grab that data and we do that by
making Ajax requests an ajax request
basically just allow us to communicate
with a server I make an HTTP request
retrieve data without reloading the page
from that server which we can then use
in our code and this kind of behavior is
all over the show online a quick example
whenever you're viewing one of those
interactive maps where you can zoom in
or out or plot journeys on it that is
probably going to be using Ajax HTTP
requests to update that map on the
flower on the flag without ever having
to refresh the page
alright so Ajax stands for asynchronous
JavaScript and XML and this XML part
that is the data that we're retrieving
although honestly you're probably going
to be using JSON instead these days
which is a data format a lot more suit
to JavaScript and XML is xml's kind of
like Jason's ugly brother or something
so anyway let's have a look at how we
can make these HTTP requests alright
then guys so I've got open here Atem
that's the text edit set I'm using and
you can get that from atom die
oh I'll leave the link down below
completely free really cool text editor
and I've got open index.html which is a
really simple HTML file and all that's
happening is we've got a script right
here in the head linking to a jQuery CDN
then at the bottom of the body tag I
have this script linked up which is my
async j/s and we're going to do all of
our requests in there in a moment I also
have this data folder with a tweet JSON
file inside this is dead simple we're
just going to retrieve that data when we
making requests okay finally I have this
async JavaScript which is where we're
going to write all our JavaScript ignore
this for now this is just a prop for me
later on so that
forget to tell you about these wrecking
states one more thing I am using the
live server that comes with Atem you may
have to install a package for that but
to do that all you need to do is go to
file and then go to settings then you
just want to search for this atom live
server package by going to install just
type that in and install it and then
what happens is you can just spin up a
server by using one of these keystrokes
ctrl shift 3 4 5 etc ok so let us now
start the JavaScript so what we're going
to do is two ways of doing this first
we're going to use the vanilla
JavaScript method of doing it and then
we're going to use the jQuery method of
making these requests and we're just
going to compare the two a little bit so
let's start off by saying window dots on
load and then setting that equal to a
function which is going to fire up when
the window loads right ok cool
so then in this function the first thing
we need to do is make a new
xmlhttprequest object so let me just do
that first of all and then I'll explain
it we're going to store this in a
variable so it's easy to use and we're
going to call that variable HTTP set
that equal to a new XML HTTP request
object like that okay so this object is
supported in all modern browsers and
then basically this allows us to make
those hit TTP requests and get data back
from a server so we're going to be using
this and now it's stored in this
variable so this holds this object and
we're just going to use this for
reference now so how do we make these
requests well we make them by using a
few different methods on this HTTP
variable now and the first method that
we need to use is the open method and
the open method basically just sets up
the request forwards tells JavaScript
where we want to get the data from the
type of request we want to make and
whether we want it to be asynchronous or
synchronous so the way we do this is by
just saying HTTP dot open and the first
thing we need to do is say the type of
request which is going to be a get
request and then the second
we need to do is pass through the URL to
the data we want to retrieve now that's
just in the data folder in my case
forward slash tweets dot JSON all right
and then the third parameter we pass
through is the boolean telling whether
we want this to be synchronous or
asynchronous so it's true if we want to
be asynchronous and false if we want it
to be synchronous I'm going to show you
that a little bit later on just to show
you the behavior of that alright so
that's the first step now we've set up
this request but we've not actually sent
it we're not told JavaScript to go out
and grab the data yet so that's what we
need to do now and we do that by using
the HTTP dot send method now this saves
okay I prepared you now go out and grab
that data and bring it back to us
all right okay cool now what where the
hell is the data what to do with it well
to demonstrate that what I'm going to do
is just walk to the console this object
right here so let's just copy that
because I'm extremely lazy and say
console dot log and paste that in right
there so let's see what's going on all
right
let this here this hate TTP request
object and is being returned to us and
this has a ready state of one right and
the way this works is there's different
ready states of this object as it goes
through this request now ready state
zero it means that the request has not
been initialized yet so that'll be round
about here at the code we've got the
object but we've not initialized it it
turns to one when it's been set up right
here turns to two once it's been sent
turns to three when the request is in
process it's grabbing that data and it
turns to four when the data is retrieved
so what we want to do really is listen
out for when these state changes are
being made and we can do that what we
can do is we can say HTTP dots on ready
state change and set that equal to a
function which is good fire every time
that ready state is change it alright so
when it goes to one is going to find a
function when it goes to two it or 5
root 3 or fire it for it or fire it and
each time what I'm going to do for now
is just log to the
sold console dot log HTTP right I'm
going to delete this log for now so it
doesn't confuse us let's save this so
now you can see in logs that four times
to the console every time there is a
state change right so we can see right
here this is ready state one this is
ready state two when it's been set when
it's been sent really state three when
it's in process and finally ready state
four when the request is complete and
it's at this point that we can actually
use the data is returned to us and we
can use it in our code so really what we
want to do is listen for when the ready
state is full and we can do that by
popping in a simple even check like this
and we can say if HTTP dot ready state
is equal to 4 then we do something with
the data right because that's when it's
available to us but technically we also
want to check that the status of this is
correct as well if we just expand this
and come down here we can see status is
200 which means everything is ok if this
returns to us the status of 404 it means
it can't find it so what we want to do
is also check that this is 200 and
everything is ok before we use the data
so we can just say and HTTP dot status
is equal to 200 so now those are both
true we can do something with the data
I'm just going to log it to the console
for now and the way we get the data is
by using the response or right here okay
so I'm going to say HTTP response and
let's see what that brings us ok so now
we get that data log to the console but
wait a minute this looks an awful lot
like a Java JavaScript string we can't
really use this data very well so what I
really want is this to be in object
format and I can do that by saying json
dot parse and this is going to pass a
string and it's gonna return it into
some kind of JavaScript object format
for us which is much easier to use so
let's save that refresh and now we get
that object with the tweets inside it ok
very cool so I did say I was going to
show
you're the synchronous version of this
currently this is asynchronous which
means the code comes down the thread it
finds this thing right here it sets it
up then it finds this one right here and
it sends the request to a new thread
outside of JavaScript so that we can
carry on down the stack if we need to
now we can kind of test this behavior
applies in console dot log and then say
in test right here now if I save this
what we're going to see in the console
is first of all test is logged out then
this object is logged out
even though test this console dot log
statement is after this stuff right here
okay so why is that that's because of
the asynchronous behavior that's because
this get request is being passed on to a
new thread outside of JavaScript then
inside JavaScript we can carry on down
the queue into new functions or
statements and then when we get the data
back then it fires this thing right here
okay so it's non blocking however if I
say I want this to be synchronous I just
say that's false now this is synchronous
click Save these are going to switch
around so now the object gets printed
out first then test so we're blocking
the code right here we're waiting for
that data beep to be retrieved and log
to the console before we carry on down
the queue now this is bad practice and
you can see right here it even gives you
a warning it's deprecated because it's
detrimental effect to the end users
experience so we don't really want to be
using this we want to keep it as true ok
so anyway that is the way we use an
xmlhttprequest object and how we set up
a request using vanilla JavaScript now
what I want to do is show you the
alternative way using jQuery
so I've already loaded jQuery into this
index file right here so we can use it
in here and let's just pop a little
comment right here say in jQuery it
method and I'm also going to comment out
this right here so it does it confuses
so the way we use jQuery to do this is
first of all we spell jQuery right and
then we come down here and we just say
jQuery of domicile get this is the
method we use and it's in fact the only
method we need to use we don't need to
worry about any of this ready state
change or this object right here etc we
just use this one method and it does
everything for us and what we do is we
passing two things into this method the
first thing is the data we want to
retrieve and we know that's in the data
folder forward slash tweets JSON so
that's the first thing and the second
thing we need to pass through is a
callback function now I'm going to go
over callback functions in the next
tutorial in more depth but basically
this callback function is the function
that fires after this has been retrieved
so again this is asynchronous behavior
right so if we pass a function through
here and it takes a parameter and just
call it data and this is going to be the
data that's passed through to this
function that it retrieves sell this
stuff right here then we can use that
data within this function like so on
sort of log data so basically what's
happening is we're saying jQuery get to
go out and grab that data pass that onto
a new thread outside of JavaScript then
when that comes back with the data fire
this callback function pass the data
through into that function then we can
do something with it and again we can
test this by same console that log to
test just to make sure this is
asynchronous behavior in action save
that and we get test first and then the
object which is cool which means we're
not blocking the code right here we're
carrying on through the queue while it
goes and gets the data then when it
retrieves it we can fire it right there
all right so guys that is how we make
Ajax requests and I think you'll agree
this is a lot simpler to do than all of
this right here kind of abstracts a lot
of things out of it so in future
tutorials I am going to be using this
method rather than this method but I
wanted to show you this way because this
is kind of like the vanilla JavaScript
way and it gets you a better
understanding of what's going on so
anyway you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to leave those down below we
have to be taking a look at callback
functions in the next tutorial in more
depth so I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
