JavaScript for beginners lesson 10 and
in this lesson we're going to take a
look at how we write messages to the
document and the console ah
all right ninjas so this is going to be
a relatively quick lesson I just wanted
to show you a couple of techniques that
are used to test certain things and they
include writing messages or variables or
values to the console which is this
thing here or to the document which is
this here all right so I'm just going to
make a variable first of all we use the
keyword var I'll call it my bar equals
and then I'll do Shawn which is my name
all right so my var now equals shot now
if I wanted to write that out to the
document here say I wanted to see what
was in a certain variable okay and what
to write it to the document I can do
that by saying document dot write and
then within these parentheses here I
just pass through the variable my part
and then what will happen is on this
left side here we'll get the variable
value pop up there okay and we can also
write it out to the console here and the
way we do that is just by writing a
console log and then brackets again same
thing we've got my bar and then it's
going to write out short the value of
this here into the console all right
so you don't need to worry too much
about this here what we're doing these
are just built-in functions in
JavaScript okay this document is an
object and this right is a method okay
and we're going to go through objects
and methods later on this console is a
built-in object and this log is a method
alright so don't worry too much about
the syntax or the way I'm constructing
these different things now I just wanted
to show you these two different ways of
writing to the document and the console
because we're going to use them to check
the value of certain variables as we go
along through this course okay and we
can do it with anything we want
doesn't have to be there variable we can
say document dot right then give it
value like 10 and then that's going to
put 10 up here and it's just going to
place it right next to the other one or
we could say console.log 50 and we could
even pass through formulas we could say
console
oops console.log and say 20 times 5
which should be a hundred right yet
gives us 100 and document dot right and
we'll say 20 divided by 5 which should
be 4 right yeah and it comes out with
full there ok so these are really cool
and easy ways to test your variables or
different types of code that you want to
output to the console and we're going to
be using them quite frequently within
this playlist so you have any questions
about them whatsoever
feel free to comment down below I'll
answer all of those otherwise if you
