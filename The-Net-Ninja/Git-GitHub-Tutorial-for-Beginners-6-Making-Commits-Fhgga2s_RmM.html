get a tutorial any of this video we're
going to start making commits okay then
so far we have modified a couple of
files and index file and a style file
and then we staged both of those files
as well so now they're ready to be
committed so now we're at the stage
where we want to take those files and we
want to commit them and add that commit
to the commit history down here so
remember a commit is basically just like
a save point it's a snapshot in time of
your code at that particular point okay
so I'm going to show you how to make
these commits in this tutorial
okay so I'm still in the same directory
on the left and right and in the last
tutorial what we did is create these two
files and we added them to the staging
area so they're ready to be committed
and we can see that by saying git status
and their boots not its status git
status and they're both in green meaning
they're ready to be committed so now how
do we commit these files how do we make
a commit well obviously is git commit
and then we say the EM flag which is - M
- say we want to pass in a message and
this message is in double quotes and
this needs to be a descriptive message
about what the commit is so for example
if you are fixing a book you type
something like this fixed Bourget in
header
okay so something descriptive what you
don't want to do is something like this
fixed a load of crap because that
doesn't mean anything and two weeks down
the line you're going to look back at
this commit and say well which crap did
a fix I don't know
so make sure your commit messages are
pretty descriptive because you're going
to use them for future reference so in
this case all we've done is added an
indexing style so I say added index some
sales files okay and now we're going to
message back let me just make this
bigger so we can see and it says we've
made a commit right here with a message
and this number right here you can see
is the ID of that commit we've made that
commit on the master branch and we're
going to talk about branches later on
but remember I said the default branch
that we run when we create a repository
positive is the master branch so we made
that commit to the master branch okay
and it says
here as well two files have been changed
and has been 13 insertions
so these insertions are the different
lines of code right here okay so you can
see we've got 10 right here and also in
the Styles we've got 3 so in total 13 so
that's like saying that we've got 13
lines of code added ok so now we've made
this commitment it's been added to the
commit history what I want to do now is
just make another couple of commits so
then we can review the commit history so
first of all let's just add in a title
let's say my second commit we'll save
that now and it's hopefully going to
grow
orange on the left means we've changed
it ok
ok sometimes it goes down into by the
way sometimes it goes green does it
really matter it just means there's a
change on the left normally green means
there's a new file and orange means
you've changed an existing file ok
either way they've been modified but now
what we need to do is add this to the
staging area and by the way you wouldn't
make a commit for something as small as
this right I'm just demonstrating making
several commits right now so let's add
this to the staging area I'm just going
to say git add and then dot add them all
even though it's just one file it's just
quicker then we'll check what's in the
state earth staging area but I think
it's status make sure it's green so the
index file is being waiting is waiting
to be committed so now we can say git
commit and then a message and we'll just
say added index title ok so now we can
see we've added now another commit with
this ID on the master branch again and
there's been one file change one
insertion and one deletion now they're
not grade because we're not deleted
anything but this is just the way it
works right if we change one of the
lines right here we change this one what
git does is actually says we've deleted
the line and we added it ok it doesn't
see it as a change it's easy as being
deleted and re added okay so in essence
we have deleted a line and we have
inserted one it's the same as being one
line change ok so now we have two
commits I want to do one more I'm just
going to come to the Styles and we'll
add in a font size right here of two
ends ok so now what we'll do is just do
a git
against ad this file again I'm using a
period instead of the filename just
because it's quicker or check it in the
get status make sure it's in the staging
area yep
and then finally will commit its or said
git commit and I'm the message this time
is going to be changed body font size
all right so now we've done these three
different commits and again it is to the
master branch we've got a separate
unique ID one file change one insertion
cool so that we've made three commits so
we've got these different three kind of
snapshots in time ease these different
save points if you light as commits on
our master branch in our commit history
what do we do if we want to see this
commit history
well pretty simple we can type in get
locked what this is going to do is show
us a log of all the different commits
we've made so each of these yellow lines
right here represents a different commit
right so if they commit and then the
unique ID and it's a very long unique
string of letters and numbers and
they're all different now remember
before when we solve this little ID
right here these are the first few
letters of one of these IDs okay so
that's kind of like the short version of
these IDs this is a full version of
these IDs so he says underneath who's
made the commit I am Sean JP that's me
my username and also my email the date
that it was committed and the message of
the commit so it says exactly what
you've done so this is cool but if
you've got 22 minutes it's a little bit
kind of over the top you're not going to
be wanting to see all of this
information you might just want to see
like a condensed version so if you want
to see this a little more condensed you
can say get logged and then you can pass
through - one line and what this is
going to do and what it actually meant
is get logged double - one line okay so
what this is going to do is show you all
of the different commits now in your
commit history and but they're going to
squash them onto one line so we've got
the short ID right here and we've got
the message for our ID all right so now
we can see all of these different
commits in our history and later on what
we can do is we can actually rewind to
these different commits and see the
codes
that we created at these particular
point in time all right and we're going
to start looking at that in the very
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
