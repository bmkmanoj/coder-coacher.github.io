JavaScript for beginners less than 32
and in this video we're going to talk
about the Dom Wow alright so what is the
Dom well the Dom is just an acronym and
it stands for document object model now
in technical terms you're going to find
descriptions like it's an application
programming interface but what that
really means is that we can use the Dom
when we interact with webpages and when
I say interact and mean we can add
content to a HTML document we can remove
content from a HTML document and we can
change content on a HTML document all of
that interactivity we can do via the DOM
and we can do this on the fly as your
web page is being loaded or viewed in a
web browser so working through the Dom
one component at a time first of all
we've got the document right and the
document is just the web page now it
doesn't matter whether you view that web
page in a browser like this on the left
or in your text editor on the right
we'll see two different things it's the
same thing it's just the document and
typically speaking when we do web design
and web development that document is a
HTML document so when we say the
document in regards to the Dom we
generally mean the HTML document the
next component is the object now in
Haiti ml pretty much every element
within your document is an object that
means the head tag is an object the body
tags an object the UL tags an object the
P tags an object a tags span tags div
tags any tag in your HTML document is an
object in the eyes of the DOM and we
know by now that JavaScript works very
well with objects we can call methods on
objects we can call properties on
objects so we can use those objects in
HTML all those tags to call methods on
them to change them delete them add to
them etc and finally we come to the last
component which is the model now the
model basically describes how these
objects are laid out in a tree fashion
much like this diagram we've got the
HTML at the top underneath that
have head tags title tags body tags ul
tags div blardy blardy blar it's all
displayed in some kind of hierarchical
tree so that is one aspect of the model
it describes how those objects are laid
out but we can take it one step further
and we can introduce nodes and yet nodes
are pretty much anything we can change
in a HTML document so yes these are all
nodes these objects are these elements
they're all no it's within the DOM and
we can grab each one of these nodes and
change it but also the text within these
elements are also known so the Li tag is
a node but the text within that Li tag
is also a separate node right and we can
grab hold of that separately and change
it and finally HTML attributes are also
know so when they have a href attribute
on a particular tag or a class attribute
or a styles attribute and we can grab
hold of all of those individually as
well they and nodes so what can we do
with the Dom well we can change these
nodes we can interact with them right
and a few examples are here we could
change the text node within h1 tag right
we could change the background color of
an element node we could animate the
logo node from the left to the right so
that's going to be an image node right
we just animate that from the left side
of the document to the right side of the
document we could expand the height of
an element node when you click on it for
example you might have a bit of text
then a read more link below if you click
that link it expands the height of that
element node so you can read more plus
we can do tons of other things with the
Dom as well animations validations tons
of other cool stuff and we're going to
go into a bit of that later on so that
pretty much sums up what the DOM is
and if you have any questions feel free
to ask down below I'll answer any
questions also if you enjoy these videos

see you guys in the next one where we're
going to take this one step further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
