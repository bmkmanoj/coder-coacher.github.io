JavaScript for beginners lesson 26 and
in this video we're gonna talk about
arrays Wow okay there so what the heck
is an array well an array is a single
variable that can hold multiple values
okay or multiple other variables but the
important thing is an array is stored
within a single variable so how do we
create an array well first things first
whenever you see these square brackets
that kind of indicates that we're using
an array and that's how we create one we
just create a variable using the keyword
var like any other variable and we say
my array or whatever you want to call
your variable and we set it equal to
something like that and that there my
friends is saying I want to create an
empty array so we've created an array
but there's nothing in it currently now
if we want to assign a value to that
array to store it in that way we can do
that all we say is my array and then our
square brackets then within those square
brackets we have to specify at which
position or which index we want to store
our value up and remember javascript is
a zero-based language so we start always
with a zero that would be the first
position in the array so we can set the
zero of position by saying my array 0
equals I don't know 25 and then if we
call it back by saying my array position
0 we get 25 so that's stored now at
position 0 likewise we could say my
array position 1 which is the next
position equals 35 and my array - oops
- equals true that's a boolean so we're
storing different things in the array I
could say my array 3 equals hello that's
a string right so we can store multiple
different things and various different
values in an array now if we wanted to
call the array back to see everything
that's in it we can do that too we can
just say my array right here in the
console and that's going to bring back
every value in the array and likewise if
you were writing in a script and you
wanted to love this to the console you
do something like console dot log
and then within the brackets say my
array just like that and that's going to
log it to the console and you can see
all the different pockets here 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
okay so we can also update values right
so currently is it positioned to is this
true
yeah because it go 0 1 2 so if we wanted
to change that to false we just say my
array and then position 2 equals false
and then that will update this position
too so if we call my array again just to
check yep now you can see that this
right here has changed and its position
to false right there is a quick way to
write this array up here we created an
empty array and then we specified each
slot separately right well if we wanted
to when we declare the variable we can
specify the contents of the array right
there and to do that I'll create a new
array I'll say var my array 2 equals
then we'll do the square brackets and
then we just write it out exactly how do
we see here or something like that so
I'll say 10 20 hi and then false and
then that there will create your array
for you and it's already filled up
positions 0 2 3 so if I call now my
array 2 you'll see all of these here
have been filled up so that is the
quicker way and the way I prefer to make
arrays now there is a third way you can
create an array using the new keyword
and that is by saying var my array 3
equals new array and then the brackets
and what we're doing here is we're
saying we want to create a new instance
of the array object and that's going to
create a new array for us now this is
going to have the same result as this
thing would right here okay but this way
we can specify how many slots you want
in the array so I could say far my array
for
equals new array and then within the
brackets we could say five and that's
going to give us five slots within the
array
now if we just do it this way then we
can put as many things in the array as
we want so I always prefer to use this
notation or this notation if I know
what's going in the array straight away
so that's how we create a race now like
any other object in JavaScript arrays
also have properties and methods and
remember methods are just functions that
can be used on certain objects right
they belong to certain objects so what
is a property we can use well like
strings we could use the length property
so what I'll do is get my array two
which we created up there and we'll say
dot length and let's see what that does
it returns for to us that's because
there's four items in that array right 1
2 where is it
this one here 1 2 3 4 so you can get the
length of it so what are some of the
properties not properties the methods we
can use well one method would be the
sort function so let's try that we'll
say my array 2.2 salt and then this is
going to sort the array and either
eh-2-zed or low to high let's see what
happens to it and it goes 1024
so if we had multiple different strings
it would sort them alphabetically if we
had multiple different numbers it would
sort them numerically etc we also have
reverse so if I say my array to not
reverse then it's reversed what this is
currently which is really cool all right
so there's many different methods we can
use on a raise and what I'll do is leave
a link down below in the description you
can go and check that out and check all
the different methods and I have a play
around with those if you have any
questions whatsoever about arrays feel
free to comment down below I'll answer
all of those questions otherwise if you
