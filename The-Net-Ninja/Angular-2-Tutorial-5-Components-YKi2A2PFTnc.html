fifth angular2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
components so in this series so far I've
already mentioned a couple of times that
angular 2 is component based and what
that means is that pretty much
everything on your application is seen
as a component your navbar is a
component your sidebar is a component
your blog is a component your entire
website is a component and when we build
an application they're built up of these
different components and they take on
the form of this kind of tree like
structure where components are nested
within each other now the top component
is called the root component and when we
use the angular CLI to create a new
project a couple of tutorials back it
created the root component for us and
that was called the app component and
that app component kind of surrounds
every other component it is your entire
application of your like okay now within
that root component we might have a
component for the navigation we might
also have a component for the blog page
and within the blog page component we
could have a sidebar component and a
component for the actual article itself
now each component is made up of these
things at the bottom we have the sidebar
component PS which is a typescript file
and that is for the component logic so
that's the first file that makes up the
sidebar component the second file that
makes up the component is the sidebar
component HTML and this is the view or
the template if you like for that
component that's what the user sees and
the third file is the side by up
component CSS and there is where we put
the Styles just for this component okay
so we've got the component logic we've
got the component template of view and
the component CSS and the idea is that
this component logic controls the data
and what is put out into this component
view and then the component CSS just
styles the view up another way of
looking at it is like this
so imagine this is your website and the
whole website is the root component
which as I say is the app component file
which is created for us when we make a
new project then within that we have the
navbar component we have the blog page
component and within the blog page
component we have the article component
and the sidebar component as well so all
of these things can be controlled
individually by each of these components
three files that we talked about okay so
I'm back in the base application that we
created with yong-gil CLI and I've gone
to the source folder which is where we
keep all of our project files and where
we're going to be working in this
tutorial series and in the app folder is
where we keep all of the different
components now when we created this base
project with the CLI it went ahead and
created our first component forward the
app component and that is the root
component all projects must have at
least this one component okay because
that's kind of the root of your
application so you can see for this
component we've got a CSS file we've got
the HTML file and we've got the
typescript file so this is where the
logic of the component goes this is
where the view or the template goes and
this is where the styles goes for this
view so let's have a look at this
typescript file first of all which is
where the logic goes and first of all
you can see this import statement and
this is importing this component class
from the angular core and that's because
we use this component right here okay so
whenever we typically use something in a
typescript file we have to import that
thing that we're using and we'll see
more examples of this as we go along
right now we're just important the
component so we're using that component
right here and this is what's known as a
decorator
it's decorating this class and we know
it's a decorator because of this @
symbol at the start and it kind of tells
us a bit more information about this
class and how this class works okay and
in the class itself is where we have all
the logic for this component so just to
go up to the decorator first of all all
we're doing is passing through an object
with some different options now this
module ID right here you don't need to
worry about too much that's just so we
can use relative URLs for things like
this okay so leave that as is the next
one this selector is the app root okay
so that is the name of the tag which
this component and this component view
is loaded into so if you remember this
index dot HTML file which gets loaded up
when we start our application down here
we had this tag right here and it's
called up root okay so right now it's
got the text loading as soon as our
application loads you can see right here
it's going to find that this component
has this selector app root and where it
finds that in the index dot HTML it's
going to replace that stuff here this
loading with the component HTML instead
okay so we define that tag right here
and where it finds that tag it inserts
this component and this component view
so that view gets dumped down here okay
makes sense
cool so next we have the template URL
and that is a reference to the view or
the template it's going to be output
when you find this tag and that's right
here so this is the stuff that's been
output when it finds this tag so this is
just a relative URL like I said that's
because of this thing that we've set up
that allows us to do that then we have
an array for the style URLs and there's
just one item in this array and it
refers to this thing right here nothing
in it at the minute but if we wanted to
style up this view then we could do that
right here in the CSS file and if we put
h1 and do some rules that is only going
to target this h1 in this same component
it wouldn't target h1s elsewhere it
would just target this one which is
pretty cool but I like to use a
different style sheet as well so we'll
talk about that later anyway so back to
this that is what the decorator is for
this component decorator so it tells us
a little bit more about that can
itself then we have the class itself and
the name of the class is app component
and that's because we named this
component up okay if we name the
component navbar it would be called
navbar component and we're exporting
that class which means it's available
outside of this file so what we're now
doing is giving this class some
properties right here and we're giving
this class a property of title at the
minute and whatever properties are in
this class are available to us in the
view for that component so we can output
that data right here and we'll talk
about how we do that more later on but
right now know that in this component
let's just get rid of that in this
component we can add properties right
here and also functions or methods that
we can use within this view right here
this template okay so if we wanted to we
could change this we could say up works
woop woop okay I'm going to save that
and then when we save it by the way I've
already gone to the terminal here and
I've done ng serve and that's serving up
and the website for me so you can see
I've gone into the ninja directory first
of all which is here that's important
then you do ng serve that's going to
spin up the server for you and then when
you make a set and a change and save it
in here it's going to automatically
reload it on the local host server for
you so you can see right now this is
automatically reloaded and that local
host : 4200 and it says upwards whoop
whoop so I've changed that and it's
updated it for me in the view right here
likewise I could add another property I
could say name and set that equal to
ninja and I'm going to save that you'll
notice over here in a minute it's going
to see the loading probably and then I'm
also going to output that down here and
say P and I'm going to output the name
property and
and this is going to work as well so if
we just give this a second now to
refresh over here or you can just click
refresh if you don't like waiting then
it should print out the name down below
as well
all right cool there we go ninja so that
is how components work we have a
different component for each different
area on our website each different
section and each component is made up of
this type script file which controls the
logic of the component classes data to
the view adds functionality through
methods to the view and then the view
itself is displayed to the user can
access the data from that touch script
file from this component and this is
what is output to the user we also
specify a tag or a selector in this
component in this decorator record so
that when angular finds this tag it can
output this component in its place all
right so that's kind of your
introduction to components we're going
to be working a lot with them as we're
going along so any questions so far
leave those down below otherwise I'm
going to see you in the very next
