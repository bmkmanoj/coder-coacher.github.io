21st angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
staggering our animations Wow okay they
go so in the last tutorial we went ahead
and injected this ng anim dependency
into our module so that we could use
those animation effects on our
application things like that where they
swipe to the left or the fade in between
the view swaps now what I take this one
step further and I want to introduce you
to the stagger effect for these
animations now the stagger effect works
great when you're animating several
items at once so say for example we want
to remove all of these things just say
we had a button that removed them all at
once okay we want to clear the list now
we could apply the stagger effect to
those so that they remove one at a time
and I'll show you what that means in a
minute as we work through this example
so I'm going to go ahead and add that
button into this review so that we can
remove all of them at once so let's go
on to the form and just have a simple
egg tag the href attribute doesn't have
to equal much at the minute and then
we'll give it an ng-click directive
we're going to set this equal to a
function which we're going to define on
the controller in a minute and we'll
call that function remove all like that
we're going to call this function when
this anchor tag is clipped so I just put
some text in here and it's gonna be
saying remove all ninjas something like
that okay cool so now we need to go
ahead into the controller and define
this function so let's go there down
here and we need to put it on the scope
objects or say scope dots remove all and
we'll set it equal to a function and
this is the function which is gonna fire
when that link is clicked all right so
all we want to do is get rid of all of
these ninjas in one fell swoop so to do
that we need to set this day to this
scope dot ninjas to equal just an empty
array where there's no ninjas and bed it
into it right
so we'll just copy that and paste it in
and set it equal to an empty array and
if we do that and save it then when we
click this link now it's just going to
swipe them off the screen and that's
effect is from the animations that we've
already applied to those list items okay
now what's happening is they're all
swiping off in one go all at once at the
same time now this is where the stagger
effect comes into play because I think
it'll look pretty cool if when you say
remove all integers this swipe kind of
one at a time quickly after each other
so what we can say to angular is hey
look when we animate these Li tags if
we're animating you know quite a few of
them at once like we are doing here I
want you to stagger that animation
between each one so say for example wait
not 0.2 seconds between each animation
so this then this then list and this
that kind of thing right and I think
that a little pre swanky so let's go
ahead and use this staggered effect so
same again we want to grab those Li text
so it's ninja ninja - list Li and then
the class we need is ng - leave because
they're leaving the application we can
do the same to enter but they leaving it
in this case - stagger
right so now we can give this two
properties the first property we want to
give it is the transition delay how long
do we want it to wait in between each
animation so we'll say transition -
delay but we'll set that equal to not
point one set in fact not point two
seconds okay so they're going to remove
themselves not point two seconds after
the previous one the next thing that we
need to do and this is recommended by
angular is to to just say transition
- duration 0 okay and that just prevents
this from inheriting any other
transition so let's save that and try
removing all the ninjas now and you'll
see one after another
okay let's pretty slick that done it so
instead of them all just movin up at
once there's a naught point two second
delay in between each one sliding off
the screen and it does look a little bit
more slick alright so there we go guys
that is ng stager and it's great for
working with multiple sets of items
things like ng-repeat where you've got a
whole whole term items being repeated
one
another all right so if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys don't forget to
share subscribe and like and I'll see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
