welcome to your 29th PSD to WordPress
tutorial and in this video we're gonna
talk about widgets Wow artha so what
exactly is a widget well you see this
sidebar right here everything in this
sidebar is a widget this right here is a
widget these recent posts is a widget
this is a widget this is a widget etc
these are all widgets and widgets are
things that we can control in the admin
area of WordPress so I can add and
remove widgets to the sidebar in the
admin area now how would I do that well
if we go to the admin area and go down
to appearance then go to widgets you can
see here this is the sidebar and these
are all of the different widgets and
each one of these corresponds to one of
these things that you see here okay so
we've got the search recent post recent
comments archives etc and if we want we
could rearrange these like that so we've
done that it's saved if I go over here
refresh now you're gonna see that search
drop down here I want to go to the top
so I'm gonna put right back at the top
like that but if we wanted to take some
stuff off all we do is grab it and drop
it over here let's take off the recent
comments drop it over here okay in fact
we don't want to put it in inactive just
up here so if we go over here now to the
right and click refresh now we only have
those widgets all right so if we want to
add new ones we can just pop them over
here like that we'll put pages there and
then the title we can say is pages and
we can sort by any of these things here
we'll just sort it by page title and we
can exclude any IDs separated by commas
if we want it so we'll save that and
refresh over here and now we have the
pages likewise these titles in each one
of them can be changed by expanding this
and putting the title and you also get
different options depending on the
widget that you use okay so that's how
we add widgets to the widget areas or
the sidebar now if we wanted to we could
add more than one widget area on our
website all right so let's jump into the
code and take a look what is controlling
these widgets
I'll just head over to the archive
template because we know that the
sidebar is on that and you see this
function right here get sidebar this is
the template that we talked about it
earlier and what this is doing is going
out and getting the sidebar dot PHP
template and loading in the contents of
it right here so let's have a look in
there side by dot PHP and you can see
right here we've got this div with a ID
of secondary class of widget area and
then we've got this function called
dynamic sidebar and whenever we see this
function that is a widget iced area in
your WordPress theme okay so you can see
it's got an identifier of side by hour
one so if we wanted to we could copy
this and we could make another and we
could call it footer right so let's grab
that again let's copy it from there and
pop this in the footer so if we head
over to flutter dot PHP and put it right
at the bottom run about here and save it
we could have another widget area in the
footer but that's not all that we have
to do we have to tell WordPress that
look we want another widget area
okay so we're loading in that widget
area in the footer but we have to tell
WordPress that we want to register that
widget area in our theme also and to do
that we have to head over to the
functions dot PHP file and then here is
a lot of different functions that extend
the functionality of your theme this
came along without blank theme when we
got it from underscores website so we
can add more in here so if you scroll
down a little bit until you find this
thing right here you see this function
called rest Oh widgets in it this is
gonna initialize all the widget areas in
our theme you can see right here we're
registering the sidebar and the name of
that is sidebar and the ID is sidebar
one now this might look familiar it's
because it's in a side by dot PHP that
ID right here okay so in the footer
we've put the ID to be footer so that's
what we need the ID of our new sidebar
in the functions dot PHP file to be
called so
that is where we put it so what I'm
going to do is copy this function to
register a new sidebar in our theme like
that and then the name is going to be
footer the ID is going to be footer like
that on lower case we can give it a
description everyone the before we G
option is going to put this aside tag
before it with some dynamic classes on
IDs and then after that we G is going to
close that a side tag the title of the
different widgets that we put in or
before the widget itself is going to be
h2 and then after that it's going to
close the hasty okay so now we've
registered that sidebar in WordPress so
we can save it and now in the footer a
wordpress is going to recognize that
extra dynamic sidebar and it's going to
load it into the WordPress admin area so
that we can add widgets to this dynamic
sidebar in the footer so let's go over
to this page again if i refresh this
time you're going to see another widget
area called footer which we just added
in and we can add widgets to that let's
just add in a search like that and we
don't need to give it a title let's just
save and go over here go to the home
page and if we come down to the footer
now you're gonna see that search right
there because this is where the other
widget area that we just created is okay
so this is what widget is all about
little snippets of code or sections that
we can add into dynamic widget eyes area
in our theme one more thing I want to
show you is this texting right here we
could add in this widget and this is
basically where you can add HTML so you
can add pretty much anything you want
which isn't already here all right so
that's which is in here in a nutshell if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
free to comment down below otherwise
guys I'll see you in the next video
where we're gonna take a look at plugins
and install one on the WordPress website
I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
