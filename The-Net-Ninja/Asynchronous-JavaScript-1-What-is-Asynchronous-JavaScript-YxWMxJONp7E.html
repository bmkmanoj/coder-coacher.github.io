asynchronous JavaScript and lesson 100
kala so what the hell is asynchronous
JavaScript well asynchronous JavaScript
is absolutely everywhere on the web and
if you write JavaScript a fair amount
then chances are you've written some
asynchronous code at some point to fetch
some data or something but there may be
not known that it was asynchronous at
the time so in a very very small
nutshell asynchronous code can start
something now and then finish it later
that's what it's all about
so say for example we used an API such
as the YouTube API right and we use that
to go out and grab some data but then
instead of blocking the code and waiting
for that API to respond
what asynchronous JavaScript does is
allow the code to carry on until that
API responds and then when it does then
we can do something with the data and
this is in stark contrast to synchronous
JavaScript so let's just take a little
look at that first of all so the
JavaScript code that you write runs on a
single thread which means it can only do
one thing at a time okay and synchronous
code waits for one action to complete
before moving on to the next so I've
just done a little code example right
down here which is synchronous right and
it's going to use an API which has a
function called read sync and this is
going to go out read some data but it's
going to do that synchronously so it's
not going to wait for some kind of
callback function it's going to wait
until this completes and then move on to
the next thing because remember
synchronous code waits for one actions
complete before moving on to the next
right so it's going to go out read this
wait for it's complete then it's going
to log that to the console then it's
going to go out to this it's going to
read this one synchronously and then
it's going to log that to the console
and you might be thinking well yeah this
is fine it's just moving through things
one at a time however what happens if
this file is extremely large okay and it
takes about ten seconds to read it then
what you're doing is you're blocking up
your code or right here it's not moving
anywhere until this is fully read so we
have to hang
and for 10 seconds before any of the
other JavaScript is fired okay now
that's not great so that's why we use
asynchronous code to kind of combat this
so this is an asynchronous version of
doing the same thing okay this time
we're using an API with a function
called read async and this is going to
go and grab something asynchronously so
what this is doing is going to perform
some kind of request whereby it's going
to say okay well I'm going to pass this
on to a separate thread and you're going
to go out and get that data right and
then I'm just going to carry on my
thread through the code and carry on to
the next function and then when the
other thread which goes out and grabs
this returns with the data then we can
fire this callback function which is
going to log it to the article so no
longer are we waiting in line for this
to be fully read before we move on to
the next one okay what we're doing is
passing this on to a separate thread
okay and then the code thread is moving
on to the next function but wait a
minute I said that JavaScript only runs
on one thread and the distinction is
this JavaScript that you write only runs
on one thread but then requests such as
this are handing off to a separate
thread which runs outside of JavaScript
so that frees up then the JavaScript
thread to move on to other things so
let's have a look at this in a kind of
diagram which better explains it so this
is an asynchronous version of the thread
and the queue of functions so say we
have some code and we've got a lot of
functions in it and each one of these
things on the queue is a function okay
so JavaScript makes this queue when it
first reads your file and it goes
through these functions one at a time so
it fires the first one completes that
moves on to the second one now right
here we have an asynchronous quick
request and what happens is it passes
that request onto a separate thread
outside of JavaScript which goes and
grab some data but in the meantime on
the JavaScript code thread it can move
on to the next function and carry on and
carry on and carry on and carry on and
carry on and when this data is retrieved
the callback function from this request
is added onto the end of the thread or
the end of the queue and then when the
rest of the functions are fired
then it can fight this callback function
with the data is retrieved so that's a
nice way of doing things whereas the
synchronous way would be like this in
Phase ups gone back a slide there fires
the first function then it fires the
second one which is asynchronous with
request this time and it waits until
that file is completely read and it's
brought back to the JavaScript so then
it's delaying the rest of this code it's
blocking it right here this might take
10 seconds or something then when it has
that code it fires the function it needs
to do and move on to the rest ok so this
is clearly a better way to do it and
this is just one way to control the flow
of this asynchronous request the art or
the ways right and we're going to look
at these ways in this tutorial series so
the first way which are just shows
briefly is a callback way yeah this is
good but it can get messy we're going to
take a look at those in probably the
next tutorial or a couple of tutorials
time promises are a better way to do
things and we're going to take a look at
those too and then generators are a new
addition to every script 6 which are
really awesome when it comes to
asynchronous JavaScript so we're going
to take a look at those as well so there
we go guys that is your brief
introduction as to what asynchronous
code is all about if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise I am going to see you in
the various tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
