web pack for beginners tutorial lesson 1
okay so before you get started you need
to know a couple of things first of all
the first being JavaScript and this is
absolutely essential because we are
going to be using that quite a lot as we
go on so if you don't know any of that
check out my JavaScript for beginners
playlist first of all before you start
this I'll link the link to that down
below secondly you need to know I'll
rather you don't need to know but we are
going to be using a little bit of CSS
sass and HTML so it is going to benefit
you if you do know that and I'm guessing
if you want to learn web pack then you
probably do know those in case you don't
I've got playlist on all three so I'll
leave the link to those down below as
well okay so the rest of this video is
going to concentrate on how to use the
course files and the different tools I'm
going to be using throughout this series
as well as talking a little bit at the
end about what web pack is for and white
so good so if you want to skip straight
head into installing web pack then go
ahead to the next video otherwise this
is the repo which contains all the
different course files for this playlist
so it's private at the minute but I am
going to make it public before you
upload this video and you can find it at
this URL which I'll link down below as
well so it's split up into different
branches and each branch corresponds to
the starting point of each lesson in
this video so we run lesson one so we're
going to be using these files right here
which I'm going to show you how to clone
in your desktop shortly now if you want
to clone them along with me and use git
then you're going to need to install git
so you can get it from this address
right here I'll leave the link to that
down below as well and just click
download go through the installation
steps dead simple and then you can use
those git commands along with me
otherwise you can also just download it
to your desktop by clicking this button
right here so what I want to do is copy
this address now so we can use it later
because that's what we're going to use
to clone this repo in our computer so we
do also need nodejs installed as well to
install web pack and that's because we
need to know what package manager for
that so to do that go to no js' dog and
install the latest version right there
just go through the installation steps
don't change anything and it's
all going to install on your computer
along with node package manager or NPM
for short if you want to learn more
about nodejs
i've got a series on that as well which
I'll leave the link to down below and
the description at this rate is just
going to be a series of links anyway to
install that and then finally I'm going
to use atom as my text editor in this
series and that's because it's free and
it's really cool so there's a couple of
packages which I'm going to show you for
atom as well which are going to be
really helpful in this series but to
download it all you need to do is go to
Ateneo and click this button or right
here okay so I'm Aneta and I'm going to
open up the settings by pressing ctrl +
comet and I'm going to show you the
different packages that I'm using for
this series two of them anyway so the
first one if I click on packages is the
atom live server
I never click on this you can see there
down here if I click ctrl shift 3 it's
going to spit up a local server for me
on port 3000 and I'm going to use that
to serve the files to the user ok so if
I go back to packages again the other
one that I've installed and I want to
show you is this thing right here
platform IO iv'e terminal and that gives
me this thing right here so I can tab
git commands in here and webpack mum's
and other things as well so that's going
to make it easy for us instead of using
the command prompt all the time which
looks really ugly so if you want to
download those just go to install in
your settings and search for them or
right there okay so what I want to do is
clone the repo right here so to do that
I'm going to navigate to the folder a
book which is nettinger
right here this is just an empty folder
at the minute and I'm going to say git
clone and then I'm going to paste this
URL that we copied from the repo before
and then I'm going to hit enter and
that's going to go ahead grab that
repository and clone it or right here
you can see that new folder now has
appeared it's got that little git icon
which says it's a repo and then all
these different files right here now
this has downloaded the master branch
which is the end result of final files
of the whole series we want to start at
lesson 1 the first branch so to get
there what all we need to do is say CD
oops
down here CD we need to go into this
directory right
where the repo is so it's webpack -
playlist and then we'll say get checkout
and we use checkout to check out a
particular branch and the branch name is
going to be less than - one so what
that's going to do is check out less
than one branch for us and update this
code tree right here to show us the code
in that branch so that's the starting
point for this tutorial and all we have
in it at the minute is this get ignore
file which is just going to ignore any
known modules and the distribution
folder which we're going to create later
on it's also got an index dot HTML file
the license and a readme which has
pretty much nothing in it anyway
okay so index dot HTML let's open this
simple index file so finally because
that talking about web pack and what
it's good for so how many times have you
seen this we have an index file where
we've got all these different scripts
being loaded in and many times many more
than this we could have 20 different
scripts loaded in it now that is not
great for performance because every time
you use it goes to the website and
request these different things it's
going to make however many different
requests 5 in this case Bam Bam Bam Bam
to the server which is going to slow
down your website decrease its
performance as just generally not good
practice so ideally what we want is just
one script file or two maybe and we can
use webpack to bundle these different
script files into that one file okay
that's what it's really good for in its
most basic form so I'm going to show you
that in the next tutorial but it can
also do different things so anyway web
pack in a nutshell web pack takes all of
our assets and it outputs them to a
production ready bundle which is going
to reduce HTTP requests and just speed
up the site performance ok so it does
that by bundling up that those
JavaScript files like I said into one
file and minimizing the HTTP requests we
can also use webpack to process sass or
less files into CSS and then we can
modular eyes our CSS into different
components if you like and only use the
CSS that we need where we need it we can
also use webpack to confer JSX which is
used with
or es2015 the new features in that
interval Nilla javascript which browsers
can then understand because they can't
understand these things by default or a
lot of these things okay so that's why
web pack is so good it's why you should
be using it in your front-end project so
we're going to start in the next
tutorial by bubbling these scripts or
just a couple of scripts into one file
I'm going to show you how we can do that
and also show you how can install web
pack as well so there we go that is your
introduction to web pack don't forget to
subscribe and like to catch all the
updates and I'll see you in the next
