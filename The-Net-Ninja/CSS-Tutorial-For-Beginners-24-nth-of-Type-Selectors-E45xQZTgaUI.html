this is CSS beginners lesson 24 and
today we're gonna talk all about these
enter type pseudo classes that's coming
up Wow all right guys I'm here back in
HTML and as you can see I made some
changes to our lists dot HTML file and
put some articles in here after come to
think of it I should have done this in
the articles HTML file but the hell
they're here now and we've got four
articles here and between them we've got
a Chuan's HRH to me with a marketing
message and our link h-hour down here at
h1 at the top and then they're all
nested within this div parent tag okay
now in the last lesson we talked about
enchants electus and how we can use that
to target children and parents acts and
we can do that here you know if I wanted
to target say this article or this
article I can do that so an example
would be we're going after an article
tag pseudo-class starts for the column
and then we'd put entailed and say we
just want to go after this one here it's
the second child in the list so we say
two and then we can start it and it's
the second child because this is the
parent element this is the first first
child and this is the second child third
fourth fifth sixth and so on
okay so that would grab this article and
we could style it by giving a background
of great makes sense right did obviously
in the last lesson so let's just view
this in a browser just to make sure it's
worked okay yeah there we go it's giving
a background color grade to this first
article okay cool
now this nhi old pseudo class does not
take into regard the element that comes
in the list and by that I mean this is
the first child is h1 this is the second
child it's an article this is the third
child it's HR this is their fourth child
h2 and so forth all the way down the
list okay so for this to work for us to
style individual articles we need to
know what child it was within this list
okay and we may not necessarily know
that so it's going to get a little
tricky because you might have marketing
who want to put different messages in
between articles etc and it's got no
kind of pattern to it so we can always
do it this way but what we can do is use
another technique called enth of type
okay the way this works is this we do
map : the same as we would any other
pseudo class and we pop enth or tank and
then we put one okay and then this is
still going to grab this first article
and the reason is because this is the
first article of that type and by typing
mean it's the first article tag okay
this is the first of type of h1 this is
the first of type of HR first of type h2
so this is the first of type article so
we say we want an article and get the
end of type which is one which is this
here and it's going to style it with a
background of gray so let's just make
sure that's worked we'll review this in
a browser again yep and there we go guys
is still gray so cool now we've used the
end of type so what else can we do with
it bare with this well we can do other
things like keywords as well so say we
want to get all the odd ones which is
the first one and the third one yeah
again it's going to disregard all these
other types here because then of type
article and it's just going to say the
odd ones are the first one and the third
one so let's give that a whirl eh let's
put odd in here just like we did with
the empty child and open this up in a
browser curl there we go one and three
and it's tissue yeah in any of the
children within the list because they're
not articles we don't want anything
except for the odd articles so this is
really cool it doesn't matter where
these articles are on the list we can
target them using enth of type let's try
a formula we saw formulas in the last
lesson so let's try 2 n plus 1 and what
this is saying the friends is that we're
starting to end with 0 so we'll say 2
times 0 is 0 plus
one is one so we want the first end of
type to be colored gray which is this
and then we go up to one and we'd say
two times one is two plus one is three
and the third length of type is this so
it's going to be the same as the odd
keyword so let's view it in a browser
make sure it's worked and there we go
again beautiful that is styling the
first and third ones with a background
color of gray so this is really useful
when you've got all the tags in between
the tags that you want to style you want
some kind of pattern with your articles
but you don't necessarily want the tags
in between to kind of mess up that
pattern
well enter type will be your new best
friend so that's about it for enter tag
if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to comment below I'll try not
to run off those as soon as possible
