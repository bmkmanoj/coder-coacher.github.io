JavaScript for beginners lesson 24 and
in this video we're going to take a look
at strings ah
all right the gang so so far in this
playlist we've taken a look at two types
of data we've looked at billions and
we've looked at numbers now I want to
take a closer look at strings and you've
seen these so far fleetingly but I want
to take a closer look and we'll just
create a variable called my string and
the way we initialize a string is just
by putting it in quotes and that can be
double quotes or single quotes I
normally use double ones and then right
now string within this so I'll put I am
a string now then that is how you create
a string simple there are a couple of
things you need to watch out for the
first one is if you place another double
quote within this string something like
this I'm a full string that is going to
cancel out the string it's not going to
work and the reason is this because
you're closing the string right there
it's looking at this and it's thinking
misses the string because that's the
opening quotation mark and that is the
closing one so how can we combat this
well we can combat it using the single
quotation marks we can surround the
whole string with the single quotation
marks so now this is no longer closing
it this one here is but again what if we
have a single quotation mark in the
string also so instead of I am I well
now we're going to pick alright because
we've got both types of quotation marks
we can't just replace these because now
this is closing the quote the string so
what do we do well we can escape
characters in a string so we want to
escape this character and say look it's
not closing the string it's just a
character in the string and we do that
by putting a backslash before it just
like that and now this will work so
let's log this to the console just to
make sure my string and save that let's
refresh over here and now we can see
it's coming out just as we expected so
that is how we initialize a string and
how we escape characters within a string
now much like any other object and
strings are objects they have method
and properties now one such property is
the length property so we can find out
the length of any string that you create
by length I mean the number of
characters in that string so let's try
this one console dot log my string dot
length and that is the property name
just my string period or dot length and
that's going to turn back to us the
number of characters in that string so
let's save it and refresh and we can see
there's 18 characters in that string now
that is a property of a string we also
have methods of strings and remember
methods are just functions so there
kinds of functions that we can perform
on the string that are built into string
objects so one such method or function
that we can use is the two upper case
and that is going to take the string my
string and it's going to convert every
letter into an uppercase letter so let's
save it and view it over here and now
you can see there are capital letters
likewise we have two lowercase and
that's going to bring them all to
lowercase like that and finally we have
one called index of I say finally this
isn't the only other method there's
loads of methods by the way this is the
only other one I'm going to show you in
this tutorial and we can find index of
any particular letter or phrase within
this string so let's say I'm looking for
I don't know the word string so that's
going to return the point at which it
finds the word string in this string so
let's save it and refresh and it says
it's at point 12 so if we count from the
start we can see one two because the
backslash doesn't count three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
and then it starts okay if it can't find
the phrase or the letter within the
string let's say ninja
that's not in the string so that will
return a minus one and that's basically
JavaScript saying hey the index of ninja
in the string is nowhere to be seen the
word doesn't exist here so I'm going to
give you back a - want to let you know
that and we can use this minus one in if
statements to check whether certain
strings have a certain phrase or letter
included in it so let's try that let's
make an if statement will say if my
string oops
my string dot index of ninja is equal to
minus one then we'll do this code block
and we'll say console oops
console dot log the word ninja is not in
the string all right so let's save that
and find out now we can see the word
ninja is not in the string so it's
looking for this word ninja trying to
find the index of it in this string it's
finding that it's not in the string so
it's saying well okay I'll make this
equal to minus one so then this
statement is true so then this bit of
code gets executed now we can say else
console got lock the word ninja starts
at position and then we'll plus we'll
concatenate this because it's going to
give us the position of the word danger
and then if we say I'm a faun Ninja
string and refresh it says the word
ninja starts at position 11 okay
now let's put a space there just so
we've got the spaces in between here and
the word ninja starts at position 11
which is right here okay perfect so I'm
going to show you one more thing and
that is comparing strings so let's just
get rid of all this stuff here and we've
seen that you can compare numbers like
this
does nine equal eight and that will
return false does 94 nine that will
return true is nine less than ten that
will return true is nine greater than
ten double return false we can do the
same kind of thing with strings so how
do how does that work well let's make
two strings let's say string 1 equals
ABC and let's say string 2 equals b c d
alright now that lets console.log string
1 equal to string two all right let's
have a look what that says we get a
false and that's obvious this is not
equal to that right but if we do ABC and
refresh that's true however if we do ABC
capital that's false so this is case
sensitive unless then the same case then
they will return false the way we can
get around this like if you didn't care
what case it was and you wanted this to
return true you could do something like
this to lower case copy that and paste
it over here and then it's going to
return this in lower case here and this
one is going to be this in lower case so
they should now be equal right true so
that's how you get around that now what
if we say let's get this back to the BCD
if we say string 1 is less than string 2
let's try that and this is true and it's
true because a is before B in the
alphabet simple as that so that's seen
as less than B okay however if this was
a capital b and i refresh over here
that's now false and this is one of
those stupid things in javascript in my
opinion because I would see capital
letters as great
than non capital letters bought in
JavaScript it's the other way around
okay
and this a lowercase letter is always
greater than an uppercase letter if this
was uppercase a then this would return
to true there we go all right then so
that is strings in a nutshell there's
quite a lot of other methods you can use
on strings I'll leave a link to that
down below you can go out and check
those out if you have any questions
about this whatsoever feel free to
comment down below otherwise please

I'll see you guys in the next video
we're going to look at splitting and
slicing strings I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
