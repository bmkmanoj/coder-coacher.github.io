tutorial and in this video I want to
walk you through the files and the
routes component okay so in the last
tutorial we use the view CLI to create
this brand-new project right here and I
said all the meaty stuff within this
source folder so when we run this in a
browser we see this this is kind of like
the baseline project that vmj s provides
us with when we install a project using
the vu CLI now this is just to show you
how things work basically so all this
stuff in the source folder this meaty
stuff is what we're going to be editing
throughout most of this series and the
rest of this we can just kind of leave
as is right so first of all we have this
assets folder right here which contains
a logo in it at the minute just an image
so any kind of images that we want to
use we can place in this assets folder
and reference and later on secondly we
have this main GIS file now this is the
file that kicks in when we run this
application so this kind of controls
everything from the start so first of
all we have these two import statements
at the top now we can have these because
we can now use es6 syntax some new Java
scripts such as this import statement so
we can use these es6 features because we
have this web type setup which is using
babel somewhere along the line to
transpile es6 code into vanilla
JavaScript which is readily
understandable in browsers okay so
importing the view library first of all
which means previews view in this file
and then secondly we're importing this
app from App dot view
now this app is this thing right here on
the left and I'm going to go through
that in a second
but basically what we're doing is
creating a new view instance just like
we've done from the beginning so this
new view instance is looking for this
thing right here this app right and if
we go to the index file this is the file
which is served up by the server
initially okay and you can see that
right here this app ID so this means is
is creating a view instance now which is
going to control this entire section
here and the way this works is that all
of our applique
in college is going to eventually be out
put in between these two things here we
don't have to be you can output whatever
static content you want outside of this
but all of our kind of view cone is
going to be rendered in here our view
template color great so basically we
have this initial view instance right
here right and what we're doing is
rendering some content now this is
rendered we've not seen yet so when
we're working like this with different
view files which I'm going to go through
in a second we tend to use this approach
where we use this render method right
here and you don't really need to
understand what this h2h fat arrow
function is and basically all this is
doing is taking our routes component
right here this app which we import
right here so this is a route component
that it's important and what it's doing
is it's rendering this to this right so
this right here this app top view this
is our route component and I'm going to
go through all of this in a second but
just understand this is our route
component the component that lives at
the very top of our application and
we're going to be able to nest
components later on in the series and
I'm going to go through that in the next
tutorial but understand for now this is
the very top kind of parent route
component right so all of this template
right here all of this code right and
this functionality here the route
component all of this is being rendered
now because we say in the main dock yes
render all of this up we render all of
that template in the index right here
okay so once again we've got this route
view instance here which is controlling
the app demo rendering this routes
component this app top view which we
import right here we're importing this
app top view and we're rendering that
route component right here to this thing
here in the index dot HTML file okay so
that is why when we view it in a browser
we see all of that HTML from the view
file from that route component we're
seeing it in the index file right so all
of this here and all of this sorry all
of this here cool so this would
component
this is a view file and as we go further
into this series we're going to create
various different view files okay and
they'll sit within this group component
but basically a view file is just an
extension of a component and remember we
talked about components a few tutorials
ago where we can create reusable
template of functionality code which can
be used in different parts of an
application right that's all this is
except this time this component and its
own file and that is a view file its dot
view okay so this is called app view so
this root component has a template right
here and when we registered components
previously we added that as a property
something like this if we say my view
dot component and then you know the name
and then we took an object we said
template and then we passed in some QT
ml code in here like this this is the
same kind of thing except this time what
we're doing is we have our template here
in template tags at the top of this
component file this view file okay so
this is where we create our template for
this component so this is all hex ml and
inside this template we can access data
from this object so this is the
component as well so this is in a script
tag right because this is a view file
not a script file a jazz file we have to
add a script tag and what we're doing is
exporting an object so what we're doing
now is exporting this object and this
object right here kind of represents
that object that we pass through when we
created a new component in here a minute
ago when we said view not component and
then the second parameter was an object
that is existing right here okay
so we have a couple more things on here
we have the name right here this name is
the name of the component and later on
when we start nesting components we're
going to use this a bit more we also
have this data right here now remember I
said when we use components we have to
use a function for data I didn't write
it like this I did something like this
data function like that
okay now this right here is exactly the
same thing
this is es6 code in action so instead of
writing data colon function we can just
do data with the parentheses on and
that's exactly the same so again we're
returning our data object right here
like this and then find that we have
this style tag and this controls the
style the CSS of this component right
here okay so just to kind of demonstrate
what we can do it I'm just going to
delete a lot of this out because we
don't want the default kind of content
they provide us with we want to make our
own content right so let's delete all
that crap and also I will delete this
message right here we don't want a
message the name we don't need just yet
so we can delete that as well well keep
this as simple as possible and up here
what I want to do is get rid of all of
this we don't need to really give this
an idea of app either so we can just
have a div now in a template we do have
to have a single element surrounding the
whole thing so we can't write div and
then another div down here with
something else in it this won't work
right we have to have everything within
one kind of route elements so we have
our div now let's create a h1 and we're
going to output a title in there we're
not creating this to accept underneath
the h1 let's have a key tag and then in
here we're going to have a method which
is going to be a greeting so we're doing
the same kind of stuff as we did in the
earlier tutorials when we didn't have
this development workflow and using this
the view CLI but we're now we're just
doing it in a separate view file okay a
separate component file but all the
behavior is still the same so we have
our title which we can add in the Delta
right here so we'll say title and this
is going to be your first view file room
okay and then we want to mess it as well
so we'll come after the data right here
and we'll say methods and this is going
to take an object and in here we need a
method called
King and this is linear function inside
this function I would agree so I'm just
going to say return and a string
something we can output here in between
the P tags I'm going to say okay calves
are okay so that is what we're returning
they're just going to scoot this in a
little bit and if we save this now and
view it in a browser we can now see your
first view file whoo hey cowboy so this
is now working very cool so we have
created our first view file which is the
route component which is outputting them
to the browser because we're importing
this route component into this main J's
file which flies up to begin with and
we're rendering this app component right
here to this app ID which is in the
index file so I implore you to take a
few minutes just to kind of wander
around these files see where all the
moving parts are going like I've
explained just get your head around it
before you move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
