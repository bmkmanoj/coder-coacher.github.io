first CSS grid tutorial alright then
so before we start talking about the
awesomeness that is CSS grid I first of
all want to make sure you're up to speed
with HTML and CSS because if you're not
this is not the course for you my
friends you want to check out either my
HTML for beginner series all my CSS well
beginner series the links to both of
those are going to be down below and
popping out when you screen right about
now so for the rest of us at some point
in our front-end development career we
have probably been tasked with creating
a simple layout similar to this we have
a header at the top some main content
and we have some kind of sidebar with a
couple of different sections inside that
and then a footer at the bottom so
nothing too taxing just a simple layout
and using CSS there's been various ways
over the years we can accomplish this
kind of layer so one of the most archaic
writings is to use floats so this is
what we all used to do and read for
example just place this at the top
without float in it because it's full
width then when we get to this part
right here we have two sections the
right section and the left section so
what we probably do is place a wrap
around this left section float it to the
left and then embed two different
sections inside that then we'd float the
main content to the right and of course
because we did that we're taking all of
these elements out to a normal document
flow then it collapses we get this
collapse and this footer syncs up behind
the content so what we need to do is
come up with some kind of clay fix to
place that at the bottom that footer and
it appears at the bottom and this all
seems a little bit happier right so we
don't tend to use floats for this kind
of reason anymore and this is the
mark-up for using this layer so we'd
have these kind of extra divs for the
middle section and the sidebar so we can
wrap the other elements and float them
correctly and we don't really want to
add in that unneeded content it's just
kind of for the benefit of the layout if
you like right so then what we did is we
moved on to flexbox hallelujah flexbox
was awesome because it allowed us to
create these different layouts without
using floats but again it has its
drawbacks for start flexbox is only good
in one direction so we can
they use it in wrong direction or column
direction if you like we can't use them
in the same direction at once also we
still have to use some extra markup if
we want to nest these flex items much
like we have done over here so what I've
done here is I've flexed this to the
right the sidebar and this to the left
then I've nested these two items within
that flex item so we have this extra
markup that we don't really want as well
so we can accomplish these kind of
layouts really simply using CSS grid as
well and this is a huge leap in creating
cool responsive flexible layouts on web
pages it is immense believe me you're
going to learn all about it so we can
create this kind of same layout
very simply using CSS grid and I'll show
you the markup for that so it looks
something like this the content div
right here acts as the grid wrapper then
we have whatever elements we want inside
that grid displayed there and we don't
have to miss these elements with inside
other elements for example these so here
the aside and the nav which are here and
here we don't need to nest those within
a div to place them there we just place
the elements we want to appear on the
grid inside that grid wrapper right and
the cool thing is it doesn't really care
for the order of these elements for
example this main right here it could in
fact be underneath the aside and this is
not going to make a difference to the
layout because what I'm saying here is
look I've got these elements inside this
grid and I'm wanting to place these
elements at different positions inside
this grid irrespective of where they are
inside the grid wrapper right so we have
ultimate flexibility here and also no
extra or needed markup
another cool thing about CSS grid is
that we can rearrange the content
depending on the screen size so for
example we've just seen this kind of
layout imagine we had that for the
desktop now because CSS grid doesn't
care for the order of the elements
inside the HTML markup for a mobile we
could say well okay I want you to
position a footer on a mobile under the
header it doesn't care that it's at the
bottom of the markup now using flex or
floats this would be quite tricky we
might have to use some jiggery-pokery or
JavaScript to do this which is quite
Hacket with CSS grid we don't need to do
this because CSS grid just treats the
web page as a grid that's all it is
a kind of box of rows and columns then
within the grid wrapper we're just
adding in our HTML elements that we want
to add within this grid and it doesn't
matter what order there room so I could
say well okay I want an element there
the next element I want to place here at
the bottom the next element up there on
the right and the next element down
there on the left so we're just taking
elements with inside our HTML structure
and we're placing them in different
sections on that grid then we can
rearrange this for a mobile of how we
see fit so CSS grid is really really
cool and you can do an awful lot of
different things with it
so we'll be seeing how to make these
kind of layouts first of all with CSS
grid learning the basics then we're
going to move on and I'm going to show
you how to make a 12 column grid to
create layouts and how you can toggle a
grid so you can see what your layout is
doing at the same time okay we can also
create mosaic style layouts like this so
I'll be showing you how to do something
like this as well really simply with CSS
grid now as always I've created course
files for every single lesson in this
tutorial series so you want to head to
the CSS grid playlist repository on my
github to access the code for these
lessons I'm going to leave the link to
this down below and if you want to take
a look at the code for lesson 3 for
example you just select the lesson 3
branch right here and you're going to
see an index file go into that and
you're going to see all the code right
there ok so now you know why CSS grid is
so freaking awesome
in the next tutorial we're going to jump
right in
and take a look at how we can display
elements on the page in different
columns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
