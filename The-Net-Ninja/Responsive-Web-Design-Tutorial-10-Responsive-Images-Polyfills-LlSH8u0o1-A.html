tenth responsive design tutorial and in
this video I'm going to introduce you to
responsive images Wow alright then guys
so you've already seen during this
tutorial playlist a responsive image in
action be it inadvertedly so this is it
right here the banner and it's
responsive because it has in the CSS a
width of 100% which is a relative
measurement so what I'm saying is
whatever the viewport width I want the
main planet image to be a hundred
percent of that width okay so if it's
this wide then the image is going to be
that wide it is this wide then the image
is going to be that wide so that is
already making the image responsive
however when we scale down images this
way we're losing a lot of the image data
for smaller screens and that's because
the images default size is quite large
to suit desktops which is kind of this
big right so the image is pretty big
when we view the image on a smaller
screen like this then we're still
downloading that large image file but
then squash need to fit on the smaller
screen so we're essentially downloading
a large image for mobiles and small
tablets when we only actually need a
small one so this makes loading the
images on mobile devices more time
consuming and a more data consuming
process so ideally what we want to do is
download large images for large screens
such as desktops and there's small
images for smaller screens such as small
tablets or Mobile's or something like
that okay so we only ever downloading
the size that we need so the whole idea
of responsive images is that we provide
a multitude of image size options to
browsers and devices so that we can
choose which image to download based on
the viewport size for example the
viewports small like this will say to
the browser hey download this image if
the viewport size is large we'll say to
the browser hey download this large
image okay so there's something we can
use which is built into HTML to you know
provide these different options to
browsers and that is the picture element
all right then go so this is the picture
tag or the picture element and it's a
relatively new HTML element and
essentially what we do is open it up
with a pick
like this and we closed it up with the
picture tag and then between those tags
what we do is provide a multitude of
different source options using the
source tags right here and then the
fallback image tag when none of these
apply so within the source tag we first
provide a source set attribute and this
is just the image that we're going to
use for this particular media query if
you like okay so what we're saying here
is lock the media is max width for gen 8
pixels so anything which is for gen8
pixels or smaller such as mobile devices
then use this source set the small image
so we're going to load in that image for
small devices okay for this one I've
said max width is 768 pixels so I'm
saying okay well then if that's the case
if it's below 768 pixels but then it has
to be above this right then you load in
the medium size image okay so that's
going to be first tablets and things
like that and then if it's above this
pixel width then we're going to just
default back to this image tag which has
a source set of big jpg so that's going
to load in the big image for desktops
however there is one slight snag as
there always is a encoding and that is
that this HTML element is pretty new and
it's not fully supported in all browsers
okay that's why I've got a head - can I
use comm and attacked in the picture
element at the top here and it's brought
down which browsers support it on which
don't so everything in red doesn't
support it everything in green does
there you see all these versions of ie
don't support it edge 12 doesn't Safari
iOS Safari Opera Mini and these older
versions of the Android browser all
don't support it so that is a pretty big
problem if we want everyone to be able
to view these different picture sizes on
different devices since that's the whole
point right so we're going to have to do
a little extra work if we want to use
this picture element now we can use
what's called a polyfill to allow
browsers which don't support this new
HTML picture element to support it okay
so basically if you've ever used this
thing called I think it's polyfill or
something like that it's in a little car
you can spray on your wall
filling gaps and it's essentially does
the same thing it just fills in the gaps
in browsers so if they don't natively
support something then the polyfill will
add in that support so that we can use
the new feature in our code okay so
basically they're typically just J's
libraries which fill in the gaps in two
browsers so there's polyfills for all
kinds of web features but the one I want
to show you today is called picture fill
and you can find that this address right
here I'll leave the link down below and
this just allows us to use the picture
element in our code so let's just go to
the quick start right here and it says
to start using picture field download
the files bulb by the black places in
the head
however the recommended usage is right
here okay so you can see we're adding
this script first of all which is a
html5 Shiv which basically says document
create elements and then this picture
elements so if the the browser doesn't
recognize these elements then it's going
to create it for it then we're adding in
the picture fill polyfill j/s file and
we're saying these asynchronous so we
want it to load as the rest of the page
loads so we're going to pop into the
head of our document so I'm going to
copy it now come over to our code and
let's paste it right there like that and
just shimmy this along a little bit all
right but the only problem is oops
then we don't have this picture fill yet
file in our files or folders there so
what we need to do is just link to a
hosted version or download it here I'm
going to link to the hosted version and
you can find that right here picture
fill there we go it can have a download
the developer version or the production
version I'm just going to go with the
development version for now you can see
this is a content delivery network so
I'm just going to grab that URL and I'm
going to paste it into this source
attribute right there
alright so now we've got that sell now
we can use the picture tag within our
document so I've already written out the
HTML for that I'm just going to copy it
I'm going to paste it down here so you
don't have to watch me write all out so
what I'm doing is just going to them
butter and I'm going to replace this
current image there which is the banner
image with the picture element so I'll
just paste it in and you can see we've
got the picture tag right there and then
close it off right there
then I've got these different sources
and the first one is same with a max
width of 480 pixels so that's for small
devices such as mobiles and I'm going to
load in the small image and then for the
second one this is the second source of
M tag and it's got a source set
attribute of medium banner and this is
for a max width of 768 pixels and then
finally if it's bigger than mix that
it's just going to download the desktop
button which is just banner j/s which is
the original one that we had now I've
already created these three banners in
Photoshop I'll just quickly show you
these things you can see this is the
original large one this is the medium
one we're going to load in for and like
tablets and things like that and then
this is the small one and what I've done
is just put a little L for large M for
medium and s for small on the different
banners so when we test it in the
browser you can see what's going on okay
so that's all the HTML that we need so
I'm going to save that right there and
then I'm going to pop back to our
website I'm going to refresh and now if
we look in the source let's go to the
elements and down to the main banner you
can see now we've got the picture
element and these different source tags
and then this image tag to fall back on
now it's currently falling back on this
image one right here this main banner
and that's because none of these filters
here max with 76a or max with 480 have
been reached yet because we're quite big
the the viewport size so it's showing
the large banner you can see that with
young but when we go down to what is it
7 6 8 pixels we'll do that now you can
view the size up here so nearly there
now 7 6 8 let's get there okay now we've
loaded in the medium ballot okay so if
some loaded the web page on this size
viewport it would just download this one
and not this so therefore it's going to
download quicker because it's a smaller
file and you're not going to waste any
data on your big image pretty cool right
same again if we take it down to four
hundred eighty pixels we're going to
load in that small one there we go
however because of those styles that we
applied in one of the previous tutorials
there we're stretching the image we'll
just get rid of those styles right now
we inspect and go to this rule it's this
thing right here making the width 100 a
pixel a percent and then scooping it off
to the left so let's delete that now we
can see this is the small button alright
so that is responsive images in a
nutshell it's a pretty cool little
technique and it's good for not wasting
data or download time on smaller devices
okay so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise guys I'll see you
in the very next video where we're going
to take a look at frameworks I'll see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
