ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 2
what is HTML now before we start I'm
going to say this much this ain't going
to be a big history lesson on the
derivation of HTML if you want to learn
that you're more than welcome to go and
scour the internet for plenty of
articles out there in fact what I'm
going to do is pop a link to one of
those articles in this video description
so you can click that and read to your
heart's content but me I'm just going to
give you a brief overview like a bird's
eye view of what hTML is and how it
works with other web technologies and
then we're just going to dive in and
create a website from start to finish
all right so first things first what do
HTML stand for Lenny stands for
hypertext markup language
now this isn't that important to be
honest but I thought I'd mention it
anyway it's not a programming language
it's a markup language and the
difference is that a programming
language contains off in some kind of
business logic so say for example I do
something on a website the website it
says ok the users on this it reacts and
it shows me certain content that would
be a programming language or a scripting
language that handles that kind of
functionality a markup language like
HTML is just a way of presenting content
in a structured and logical way to a
user and we do this using something
called HTML tags and I'll talk about
that later on just remember for now it's
a markup language
ok so HTML is what I call one of three
awesome technologies and together with
CSS and JavaScript you can create some
top looking websites alright so there
the three kind of core technologies you
want to know to create some good looking
websites so HTML like we've said is the
structure of a web page CSS is more to
do with the design kind of aesthetics of
the web page if I want to change the web
page color or if I want to change the
font size of the title or the font
weight or the font family if I want to
move things around and position them
different differently on the website
then I'm going to do that through CSS
which by the way stands for cascading
style sheets and I'm going to do a
course on CSS in the future the third
one is JavaScript only small that the
the interactivity or the websites brain
so like I said before if I go to website
click something and say for example a
pop-up comes up and says you want to
join this mailing list that pop-up is
probably going to be controlled by
JavaScript and like with the CSS I'll do
a course on JavaScript in the future
this is all going to be about HTML which
is the structure of a web page now I
mentioned before that we control the
structure of HTML with things called
tags and that's what you've seen on this
page here and there's loads of different
kind of tags this is just a few select
examples and basically all web pages is
a series of tags of different tags and
on top of each other underneath each
other and nested within each other
and we'll go into more detail about how
this you know how it's all structured
later on but just know for now that
everything that you display pretty much
to the user is going to be within a tag
right so some examples we've got here is
a paragraph tag and by the way every tag
normally opens like this an open angle
bracket tag name closed angle bracket
then the content and then you close the
tag off with an open angle bracket
forward slash the tag name then a closed
angle bracket so the top one is a
paragraph tag and that's going to be
great for things like articles you can
have the paragraph tag at the heart of
all articles and so you've got the P for
that and then you put the paragraph text
in between the tags the next one is an
anchor tag or an a tag and that's use
for links so we've have got a navigation
on the website and I've got loads of
different links then I use a combination
of anchor tags to display links to the
user the third one is the h1 tag and
that's to display headings and the range
from h1 they're most important right
down to h5 I think and they're the least
important kind of headings but then
we've got a blockquote that's great for
kind of displaying things like quotes
and finally the image tag and you're
going to notice something a little bit
different about this it's not going to
close in bracket and the reason is is
because it's a self-contained tag and
that means that everything within the
image tag is within the angle brackets
that's all we need you know while the
information is there to display the
English to the user and I'm going to go
in more detail about the image tag later
on in fact there will be a video no
doubt devoted to the image tag so for
now what
want to remember is that everything
pretty much in HTML documents is
controlled or structured via these
things called tags and in fact what
we'll do now is take a quick look at an
example of a web page alright so here we
are on the net ninja code at UK homepage
and as you can see in the top left here
we've got a logo and that's a h1 we've
got some links here for the navigation
we've got the title
that's a h2 a thing then we've got some
images here a link here and all this is
controlled by different HTML tags and if
I just right click this screen and
inspect element this is going to bring
open google development tools I'll just
slide that over here and you can see
this whole HTML document here it's just
a series of different tags and they're
on top of one of each other they're
nested within each other and if we drill
right down you can see at the heart of
it all we've got these basic tags like
the h1 tag for the logo like I said and
a tag that actually links to the home
page that's within the logo itself and
we've got some h2 tags there some list
tags that's for displaying list items
and we'll go through all this later I
mean you're not going to recognize most
of these tags and just giving you a
brief overview of how its structured and
so yeah that's pretty much it so what
we'll do in this course is we're going
to go through a lot of the more popular
tags certainly enough tags for you to
kind of start making your own websites
but before we do that I'm going to go
through the syntax of HTML and how you
kind of start a HTML document so we'll
do that in the next movie I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
