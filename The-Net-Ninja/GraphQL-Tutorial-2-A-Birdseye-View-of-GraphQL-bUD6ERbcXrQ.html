gives us an alternative a more flexible
approach to managing data in our app
than restful design but how does this
idea of graph QL actually work and what
does it look like well to understand the
graphic you are full in first let's
think about how a REST API might be
structured so typically we'd set up
specific URLs or endpoints in our API to
control different pieces of data for
example authors books now from the
front-end what we do is would make
several different Ajax requests to these
different endpoints to retrieve
information about those different pieces
of data for example authors now when
we're using graph QL we don't have to
worry about setting up these different
endpoints or making different requests
to all these different endpoints instead
what we do is we have just one single
supercharged end point where we've
mapped all of our data onto what is
essentially a kind of graph and I guess
if you had to put it on paper it would
look something like this so the idea
here is that we can then jump in to this
graph at different points from our
application right and we can land on
this graph at different points like this
then when we're in the graph we can walk
to related data to get that data and
send it back as part of that request so
for example imagine we had a request
like this we say we want the initial
query our landing point or entry point
to be the book with an ID of 1 so that
initial request would have was land on
this book with an ID of 1 then we're
saying we want the title and genre from
that book well that's fine we can get
that from this piece of data then right
here we're saying we want you to walk to
the author of that book so we can say ok
we'll walk to this author it's connected
in this graph ok once we're here we're
going to grab the name and the age of
that author then I want you to walk to
the books that that author has written
so again we can walk to those books and
their related data and we can grab
information
on those books the name in this case and
sent those back as well so once we've
landed got the data walk to the
relational data and collected everything
together we're gonna send that back to
the front end so that would be the
response to this query we'd get all that
data back okay and all of the time this
is just one query so likewise we could
have a query that looks like this we're
saying initially our root query or entry
point should have us land on the author
with an ID of two so let's jump and land
here we get the name of that author then
I want you to walk to the related data
books so we're grabbing the books of
that author right here then from those
books I want you to get me the similar
books so maybe something with the same
genre or a similar kind of plot and get
me the name of those books so we run the
books I'm looking at these and saying
okay well yeah the similar books are
this one and this one so we can watch
both of those grab those books and send
those back as part of the response to
the request as well so you can see how
flexible this whole approach of graph QL
is we jump in and then navigate this
graph right here and collect the data we
need to send back after one single
request to one single supercharged
endpoint now at first you might be like
huh so what's so special about this but
I guarantee you after using it for a
while you'll love the flexibility of
querying data this way and you will not
go back
so that is a crazily high bird's-eye
view of the idea behind graph QL and
what's kind of going on behind the
scenes in the next video I just want to
take a few minutes to go over how will
be structure in our application and the
different technologies that we're going
to be using to create it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
