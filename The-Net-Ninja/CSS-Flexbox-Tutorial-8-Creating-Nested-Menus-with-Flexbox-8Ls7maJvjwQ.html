eighth flexbox tutorial and in this
video we're going to go through our
second example and creating nested flex
menu ah okay go so I'm gonna head and
opened up this example 2 folder and I'm
in the nested menu HTML file which you
can see right here I've also linked up
this style sheet right here which we're
going to work through in a minute so
this is pretty much where we left off in
the last tutorial where we created this
flex menu at the top the only thing I've
done is added this ul at the bottom of
the class of social and to Li tags
within that each with an anchor tag one
with a class of Facebook one with
Twitter and these are going to be
another kind of menu that we're going to
pop to the far right over here in the
top bar and they're going to be little
social icons so you might be thinking
well why have I created a completely
separate URL for this why not just dump
these in here and then they're still in
the top and they're floating to the
right can of and that kind of achieves
the results and yeah we could do that
but the thing is these flex items right
here they all have that grow property
and they're all growing to the available
space to them so these are much too kind
of wide for what I want I want these to
be controlled separately from these and
be small little icons and flop to the
right so the way we're going to do this
is by creating that separate menu for
them right there and we're going to
control them differently so if you
remember in the last tutorial we said in
the style dot CSS that these UL tags
every year well tag within the mouth is
going to be a Flex container therefore
all the Li tags within them then become
Flex elements so the same is true for
this one got a UL tag and because it's
within that now it is a flex container
and these therefore become Flex items
and they're exhibiting that behavior
right there so we've got two flex
containers one on the top one on the
bottom and then flex items within them
so what I want to do now is make these
go into the top row and the way I can do
that is by making this now a Flex
container because if I do that there
these two ul tags are going to be called
flex items a remember the default
behavior of flex items is to stack up
left to right so this flex item is going
to be on the left and this flex item is
going to be on the right make sense okay
so let's save this now and jump into the
styles and do something like that let's
just say now give this a display type of
flex like so okay and now we get those
left to right like that pretty cool yet
now I also want these to appear on the
far right so the next thing I need to do
is say justify content and what I'm
doing say space between and that's going
to pop some space between these things
right here and these things over here
okay looking good so next what I want to
do is style or Pat these things so that
they have icons instead of text so the
way I can do that is by grew up here I'm
going to comment for social menu base
tiles which I'm going to pop here and
I'm going to say egg TW which is the
Twitter one and then I'm going to give
this a background image and I'm going to
set that to a URL which is image /t W
dot PNG and that's found here in the
images folder now we don't want that to
repeat all over the show so I'm going to
say no repeat and I'm also going to
censor the image like that now I'm going
to set this background size to be about
80% just make it a little bit smaller
and then I'm going to copy this and do
the same for the Facebook one so F be
instead of Twitter or TW rather like
that okay now I need to get rid of that
text so let's grab both of these l8x by
saying social oops social and then a I
remember that social class is the class
attached to this URL so I'm grabbing
both of those a tags right now and I'm
going to say text indents can be -
10,000 pictures so they shoot right off
the screen now because we no longer have
that space the text is totally gone
these are shrunken so we need to kind of
rectify that a little bit so what I'm
going to do is set a kind of grow
property to this ul remember that's a
flex item this ul so we can set a grow
property to let it expand into all these
space available to it so what I'll do is
come down here and I'm going to say now
ul social and then I'm going to give
this a Flex property the Flex is going
to be one and then we'll give it a
street property of 1 and 0 for basis now
it's taking up too much room now the too
big before they were too small now the
to be so I say we give this ul and
max-width
so I'm going to do that up here
separately because this is just the Flex
tiles down here and I'm going to say
social and what I'll do is give this a
max width of 80 pixels like so and now
that is looking pretty good right so
let's just take a look at this we've got
the behavior we want pretty much on the
navbar there but when we go smaller
let's take a look this isn't quite what
we want at the Mini for smaller screens
so what I want to do now is just add in
a few more styles to make this look
better on smaller screens and the first
thing I need to do is kind of
centralized these two over here so to do
that I'm going to go to this social
class which is the UL containing these
and I'm going to say margin is zero and
Auto and that's going to centralize
those it's going to give it an auto
margin to the left and right okay the
next thing I want to do is sit these
left to right rather than on top of each
other so to do that I have to make them
flex items now currently the UL is only
a Flex container when we get to bigger
screens like this we don't want that we
want it to be a Flex container for
smaller screens as well so we can set
that property right up here the UL that
social will say display
flex like so okay but now these are too
small so we need these to expand into
all the available space so those Li
items right there they are now flex
items and we can do that so we'll just
grab this and we'll bring it underneath
and we'll put an li on the end of it to
grab those tags and we'll save flex is
one one and zero
alright so now they look a bit better
for mobile pretty good when we make this
larger you'll notice one thing has
happened this thing right here is no
longer on the far right and it's kind of
moved in and that's because of this
margin of zero and auto right there
we've got an auto margin left and right
so all we need to do is take that way
for larger screens which we'll do down
here just social and we'll take away the
margin will say margin is zero and now
it's going to flow or not flow up but
sit on the far right so there we have it
guys that is how we nest containers
within containers and make a multi
nested navigation bar that's pretty cool
right
so let's good on smaller screens and on
larger screens any questions feel free
to pop those down below otherwise don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'll see you guys in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
