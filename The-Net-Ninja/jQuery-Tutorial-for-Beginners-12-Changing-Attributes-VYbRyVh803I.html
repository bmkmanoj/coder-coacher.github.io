jQuery for beginners on lesson 12 and in
this video we're gonna start changing
some attributes Wow okay they're going
so there's gonna be times when you're
developing websites for clients you're
gonna want to reach into your web page
in the JavaScript and either read and
attribute change in attribute or delete
it completely
now there's two methods in jQuery which
make your life a really simple when it
comes to doing this and these are remove
attr and attr just stands for attribute
this method does exactly what it says on
the tin it removes an attribute
completely from whichever element you
want to remove it from the second one is
attr stands for attribute and this can
do one of two things you can either read
an attribute or it can set an attribute
so let's show you these two methods what
I've done is found this map image in my
HTML and what I'm gonna do is remove the
alt attribute right here there's no real
purpose to this I just want to
demonstrate to you this remove attribute
method so let's do that let's first of
all go around that image it's in the
contact section so I'll say contact if
we can spell it right contact image and
then don't remove attr and the attribute
we want to remove is the alt attribute
so let's do that if I save this right
now what I'm gonna do is close that and
refresh over here and if they inspect
this element now you're gonna see there
is no alt attribute anymore that's
because we've removed it like magic
using that method awesome now we can use
this one right here to change the
attribute or set the attribute name so
that's what I'm going to do right under
this I'm going to get that image again
so I'll copy there and paste down below
then I'll stay attr and with this method
you have to pass in two values the first
value is the attribute you want to
supply a value to and the attribute name
is alt the second value is the value
itself and I want to say this is going
to be the location
so we're changing it essentially for a
map to location so let's save this again
refresh over here and now you can see
alt equals a location pretty awesome and
by the way to do this thing right here
you don't need to remove the attribute
first of all this can be a pre-existing
attribute which it is up here and this
method will just change it so I'll save
it again just to demonstrate that and
press refresh and it's still location
awesome all right we can also read the
value of an attribute using this method
so let's not set it anymore
let's delete that a second value and all
we need to do is pass through the
attribute name that we want to read I've
done that right there so I'll save it
and what I'm gonna do guys
is log this to the console so I'll write
console dot log and a pop this thing in
brackets like that and then hopefully
it's going to log it right here so I'll
save it and refresh and this time I get
map in the console which is the alt
value right there awesome alright then
guys so when if you're going to want to
use this well there's a few different
ways we can use it a couple of examples
could be if you have some kind of image
gallery say this is a little gallery
right and I click a mix button or a next
are all right there every time I click
that I might want this source attribute
to change so that it loads in a
different image each time and I can use
that method right there to change that
source attribute another example could
be when we play around with the
Instagram API we could play around with
that request a feed of images back from
Instagram then we're going to
dynamically insert those images into our
web page once we've done that we're
going to circle through the images and
apply and alt attributes each one of
them alright so that's the kind of
things we can do with these methods if
you have any further questions feel free
to comment down below otherwise guys
