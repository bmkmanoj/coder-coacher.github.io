18th nodejs tutorial and in this video
i'm going to show you how we can serve
json to the client okay then do so in
the last tutorial we set some HTML to
the browser to the client and we did
that via a read stream and then piping
it to the response now in this tutorial
i want to send back some json instead
and i'm not going to use streams in this
tutorial so i've taken those out deleted
them I'm just going to send it to the
response object directly by using the
end method which you've seen before a
few tutorials back so how do we do this
well the first thing we need to do is
change this content type to application
forward slash JSON because that's what
we're sending to the browser so let's go
ahead and create an object that we want
to send back as JSON so same file I'm
going to call this my object on my table
and I'm going to set that equal to an
object then let's add a few properties
in here first of all the name which is
going to be array then a job and he is
obviously going to be a ninja
and then finally the age and we'll say
it's wedding out okay so there's our
object and we want to send this back as
JSON to the clients so we'd say response
object dot end we've seen this a few
tutorials but this is how we can send
data back to the client and then we pop
the data in here now we can't just write
my opt-in if we spell it right
we can't just write that because this
method right here end expect here either
a string or a buffer and this is none of
those this is an object so what we need
to do is serialize this we need to
create it into a string and that string
has to be in JSON format and we can do
that by saying JSON dot stringify pass
that into there and that's going to
convert this into a string and it's
going to be in JSON format so if we go
ahead and save that and run it now load
up then if we open up a browser refresh
let's just go to
port 3000 we're going to see all of that
data returned to us as Jason adjacent
string and if you right-click and go to
inspect to open up the developer tools
then go to the network tab you'll need
to refresh to see this request down here
click on that and you can see the
response right here is the JSON the
headers States code is 200 and the
content type is application for sliced
JSON so it knows what it's getting and
it gives you us so how why would we want
to return some JSON to someone why would
someone request this in a browser well
just imagine that we had some JavaScript
running on the front end of our
application in the browser now that
JavaScript might make this request not
up here but it might make this request
and then this is essentially going to be
an API endpoint that's going to return
some JSON so imagine the request was to
something like thawed slash API or slash
ninjas then if we sent a request to this
it's going to send us back this data and
we've not done routing or anything that
in this tutorial series yet so don't
worry about routes but just imagine that
this URL here return to the JSON like
we're doing here then we can return that
to the front-end JavaScript in the
browser so then it can do something with
that JSON
it could output that JSON to the screen
in a particular area in the HTML and
basically update the view for the user
so that's why we'd do it typically okay
and this is how we do it so if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
leave those down below otherwise guys
don't forget to share subscribe like all
that jazz and I'll see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
