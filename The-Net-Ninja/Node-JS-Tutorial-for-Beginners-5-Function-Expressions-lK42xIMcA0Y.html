nodejs tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about function expressions
alright guys so we're about to talk
about modules in nodejs and how we work
with them and we do use modules a lot
when we're creating no to us
applications they are an important
feature but before we do that I want to
take a moment to talk about something
that the module interface kind of uses
and again we're looking under the hood a
little bit here so that you understand
what's going on better when you start to
write code in no js' so the thing I want
to look at is function expressions so
how would we normally make a function
statement in JavaScript we do something
like this so normal function statement
and then we'd write something like this
function then the name of the function
I'm just going to call this set high and
then inside here we can have some code
that fired it's when we invoke this
function I'm just going to put
console.log and we'll say hi okay so
then we can invoke this function by
saying say hi like so and if I save this
now and run the app in node then we're
going to see hi logged to the console
okay so we know all this already this is
bog-standard
JavaScript so what is a function
expression well function expression is
something like this we can set up a
variable and call this say bye and then
we can set that equal to a function like
so and then notice now I'm not giving
this function a name here like this this
is an anonymous function okay and we're
setting that function equal to a
variable and this is a function
expression right here and we can pop the
code inside function so again I'm just
going to write console dot log and this
time by and we can invoke this function
the same way we can just use the
variable name so we'll copy that and
paste it and then we can invoke it with
the parentheses
this okay so the variable is equal to
this anonymous function and then we're
invoking this anonymous function by
calling the variable with the
parentheses afterwards okay so this is a
function expression and we can run this
and it's going to do a similar thing
it's just going to log this to the
console by okay so why am I telling you
this
well I'm going through this because
you're going to see this pattern quite a
lot in nodejs and I just wanted you to
know how this was working okay and one
more thing I actually want to show you
is that we can pass functions from one
thing to another so I could create
another function let's get rid of this
one up here I could create another
function up here and let's just call
this a call function and this takes a
function as a parameter okay so I'll
just call that foot I'll call it full
and then in here we can say phone and
then call that function so we can pass
through a function into another function
okay and then call that function so now
instead of saying by I say something
like this Paul function and then pass
through say by like that again I can
save that and what's going to happen is
this variable is going to be passed
through to this function and then we're
going to call that function say by which
is going to fire this anonymous function
right here okay so if I save it and go
up the same node app then it's going to
do the same thing again the only reason
I'm showing this is we're going to see
because you're going to see this kind of
pattern in nodejs when you start to work
with it a bit more and I just want you
to be familiar with it okay
so there we go guys and all this has
been a really quick tutorial but if you
do have any questions feel free to ask
those down below otherwise I'm going to
see you in a very next tutorial where
we're going to get cracking on with
modules I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
