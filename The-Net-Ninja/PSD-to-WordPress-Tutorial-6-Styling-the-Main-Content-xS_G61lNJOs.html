PSD to WordPress a lesser sit and in
this video we're gonna start styling got
the main content why are I going so we
are getting all very nicely so far we've
done this header and we've done this
banner right here so in this lesson I
want to move down to this stuff and
stile up that baby so let's have a quick
look in the PSD to see what we're up to
so we're going to go from here down with
so first of all we need that red little
light at the bottom of the image and
then we need to style all this stop
stuff up right here alright that should
be simple enough let's start by grabbing
that image then so it is the main banner
image I'm going to give that a border
bottom of six pixels solid and the color
of that little red line we saw was f3
four nine four nine okay so let's just
have a look at that perfect there we see
it all right there so the next thing we
want to do is move down to this menu
thing right here remember that's that
little kind of flag in the middle so we
need to give it that background image
and then move the text itself off the
page so let's grab the whole menu
section home - menu and then it's the h2
billion app that we want to style and
we'll give it that background image URL
which is in the images folder forward
slash and then it's like menu head
that's it
perfect but you can see it's repeating
itself all the way across so we don't
want that to happen let's say background
- repeat no-repeat and then just one of
them will show but it's not fully
showing and that's because it's not
quite big enough it's not high enough
okay this wide enough we need to reduce
the width but it's not quite high enough
so let's explicitly give us some
dimensions we'll save the width to be
about 100mm 56 pixels that's about right
and then the height is about 74 pixels
of that image I'm not just plot these
numbers out of thin of hair and I didn't
actually work out the size of this image
before all right so the next thing we
need to do is do a text indent off about
10 or minus 10,000
pixels rather so it's scoops that text
off the page now we need to centralize
it so we can imagine zero top and bottom
and then auto left them right it zooms
into the center right there but there's
still a little gap between this and that
border I don't want that and the best
way for me to fix that I think is by
giving it a position value of relative
now what I can do is offset that little
logo or that little image rather by
using the top property and say man is
four pixels but I needed this position
of relative to do that okay so now we've
done that let's move down to these list
items right up first of all I want to
grab the UL which is there it's within
the whole menu section still so let's
grab that whole menu ul and now by
default you l's have this padding on the
left the browser's give it to them
I want a strip of that padding because
it kind of just messes up with the
dimensions that I'm gonna give to these
li attacks so I'm going to say padding:0
- take it away
all right the next thing I'm gonna do is
give it a list style type of knot and
that's going to take away the little
circles you saw at the start here a
minute ago
all right right next thing we need to do
is grab the Li tags themselves so let's
say whole menu Li and we're going to
float these to the left float left and
the width is going to be 42% about so
now gives me eight percent for each
column to give two magic right because
then eight plus four to make fifty 50
plus 50 is 100 so I'll make sense right
so 42% for the width padding is going to
be zero
just to strip anything that might be
there already I don't think that was but
anyway and then the margin is going to
be 20 pixels to the top zero to the
right 20 pixels to the bottom then 8% to
the left right now you can see each one
of these Li tags now has this margin to
the left there and also on this side
there now here it's fine
but on these ones I don't want the
margin on the left I want
on the right so we have a bigger central
column there that has space in it and
this stuff is all moved over here like
that now to do that I can just tag it
these Li tags and override this margin
and to do that I'm going to have to use
the enth child pseudo class so I'll say
home menu
Li then pseudo class enth child and then
I'm going to say odd to get all the odd
ones right here yeah and then I'm going
to change that margin property and it's
gonna be 20 pixels to the top then it's
gonna be 8% to the right there's gonna
be 20 pixels down below then zero to the
left so now we have that central column
there of space these move over to the
left these to the right and it looks a
lot better
alright now if you want to learn more
about this kind of stuff I've gone
through that in my CSS for beginners
playlists you can check out that I'll
leave a link to the playlist down below
in the description so now we're going to
move on and we're going to stand up the
text within these Li tags alright so
let's first of all grab this dish class
that's the name of the dish right we're
going to give this a float profit of
left so we can flog that to the left and
then we'll give it a color of about 5 5
5 which is a medium grade we'll give it
a font weight of bold perfect and I
think we'll give it in fact that will do
for now we'll come back to this in a
minute because there is another few
things I want to do to it but for now
we'll move on to the price and we're
going to float the price to the right
float to the right just like that and
then again give it a color of 5 5 5 and
a font weight of bold just like a book
and then that will do all so for now I'm
going to come back to both of these
because there's something I want to show
you in a minute which is quite cool well
for now let's move on to this
description I'm just going to copy and
paste that because it can't be Bob and
rightfully I'll you know me by now very
lazy so let's go to this and what I want
to do is first of all
play those floats okay because currently
it's sitting up here I want to clear the
floats play both rather not playful oh I
don't want to play both and then what
we're gonna do is display it as a block
level element because by default span
tags are in line so we wanted to display
his blocks with 100% width like that all
right then so we've got that and we're
going to change the color so a slightly
lighter gray about nine nine nine yeah
that will do and the font style is gonna
be italic then the font size was a
little bit smaller I think I'm going to
set this to about 14 pixels just like
that oops
italics not work because we've got a
random w there that's fine and then this
is the neat little trick I want to show
you if we take a look at the PSD you can
see these little lines right here now
unless you start absolutely positioning
things then it's gonna get a little
tricky especially when they're all
different lengths you'd probably have to
do each one differently but I'm going to
show you a little trick now that we can
do without any of that and it's quite
simple what I'm going to do is give this
description thing here a padding top of
about 10 pixels all right then I'm going
to give it a border top of one pixel
solid and then a light gray which is
about Dedede right so if I move away
from this now you can see that little
border right there now I need to give
this a position property of relative so
that I can know G upwards a little bit
because they want this line to be up
here and I will nudge it up by about
minus eight pixels not eighteen minus
eight pixels like that all right so now
you can see this line going across there
but it's going over this and it's going
over this so to combat that what we need
to do is change the stacking order we
want this to be above the line and give
it a background of white so that it
appears above the line now to change the
stacking order we need to give it a
position property so I'm just going to
say
relative first of all and now it has
that position property I can change the
stacking order of it I can give it a
z-index property now
are going to Zed indexes in my CSS
positioning tutorial series so I'll
leave a link to that video down below
you can learn about that there but for
now I'm going to say Z index and it's
gonna have 1 which is greater than 0
okay then a background and by the way
this has AZ index of 0 by default all
elements have that by default so a
background of white and a padding right
of about 15 pixels like that okay so now
you can see that this line stops right
here because you have that padding and
it's got a background color of white and
it's got to Z index of 1 so it positions
itself on top of that line and so the
line can't be seen underneath okay we're
going to do exactly the same for this
price thing right here we're gonna say
position relative and remember we need
to give it that position property so if
we can control the Z index that's the
whole idea of that position property Zed
index 1 so that it's greater than 0
which is what this line this border
currently is so that it appears on top
of the line then we need to give it a
background of white so the like so the
line can't be seen behind the element at
all and then a padding left this time of
about 15 pixels up as well so now with
the line can't be seen behind this
little bit also so now if I click off
you can see we have these lines there
are all different lengths now that are
going to these text portions and yeah it
looks pretty cool
doesn't matter how long you text is here
could walk to here and the line would on
the gob to here alright so that's a cool
little trick that I like to use when
things like this occur so we've done
those now we've done the menu I'm pretty
happy with how that looks again this is
a pixel perfect I'm not trying to do
that now because the whole aim of this
tutorial series is about converting HTML
into WordPress so we want to just get
some workable HTML and CSS to turn into
a wordpress theme so let's move on to
these babies
right here and this should be pretty
straightforward so this is the featured
section I think let's have a look yep
featured so it's got an idea feature so
let's grab that first of all and I'm
gonna give it a margin top of about a
hundred pixels I'll by the way you'll
notice that that margin didn't work
right and we need to fix something and
that is because if I hover over this URL
right here let's move up this URL you
can see it's got no high this blue is
the height of that element it's got no
height but it should be this high and
that's because we've not played these
floats right here because all of these
mi tanks are floated and so therefore
the height of this collapses to this
height and we can't apply margin to the
elements which come after this property
of this element rather effectively all
right now again I talked about this in
my CSS positioning playlist so I'll
leave a link that to that down below but
essentially what I need to do is clear
these floats and I can do that by using
the after pseudo-class again I talked
about all this in the CSS positioning
plane they still go check that out if
you like but all I need to do is say
content do it an empty string clear:both
and then display us block now you can
see that margin just appeared and if I
hover over the you well again
it retains that full height awesome so
let's start these things right here then
we need to grab the feature ul first of
all so feature it like that and we want
to grab the UL tag within it like that
and then we're going to strip away that
default had him again perfect so now
we've done that we can start styling
these Li tags off so I say featured li
and then what we are going to do is say
float to the left and then give it a
width of 23% that leaves me two percent
on each li tag for some margin so I'll
give a margin of one percent all the way
around that's a two percent in total
left and right remember and then I'll
give it a list style
type or not just to get rid of those
little circles now what I want to do is
grab the images within those Li tags and
so I'll say featured li image and I'm
going to set the width of these images
to be 100% of the Li attack like that
perfect and we also need to give it a
margin bottom of back 10 pixels
something like that perfect now let's
style these things up right here so
let's grab the 8 X within the featured
allies so featured Li a and then the
first thing I want to do is give it a
color of black deep gray which is 3 3 3
and then text-decoration is going to be
done and then we're going to float them
to the left right up my typing is
currently terrible alright final thing
we need to do is grab the spun which is
this dollar sign right here and the
amount so let's grab the featured a line
span and then we're going to float this
to the right that's what we're doing
we're gonna float this to the right and
we'll give it a color of that deep gray
as well it's 3 3 3 alright perfect so
now guys we're in a good position just
to crack on with the photo now we're
gonna do it in this lesson I'll do that
in the very next lesson but you can see
so far it's looking pretty good I'm
quite happy with that so far
so we'll just finish up this footer in
the next lesson then we can start
turning this into an awesome WordPress
theme so until then guys if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
