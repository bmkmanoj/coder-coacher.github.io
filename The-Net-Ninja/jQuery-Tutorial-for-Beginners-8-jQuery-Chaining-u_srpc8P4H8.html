watching jQuery for beginners a lesson
eight and in this video I want to
introduce you to chaining Wow okay then
class so what earth is chaining in
jQuery well chaining is one of those
really cool features of jQuery that just
speeds up our code production it's
really good for that and essentially the
crux of it is the ability to chain
together and multiple functions on
methods on a particular set of jQuery
objects or elements that we grab from
the page in one line of code and we
chained them together using the dot
syntax so you've probably seen me using
chaining in previous tutorials in this
series but you've not tweaked that
that's what I'm doing so what I'm going
to do is give an example of a long
statement chain together with different
methods so the first thing we do like we
always do is use the dollar sign to say
we're using jQuery and then we're going
to go after an element on our page to
begin with now I'm going to go after
this contact methods ID right here so
I'll just type in hash contact methods
and that's gonna return oops that's
element to us now the first thing we
want to do is change the CSS so that it
has a border of two pixels solid and red
okay now the next thing you want to do
is say dots next and we've seen this
already in the previous tutorial all I'm
saying here is go after this next
element in line okay and then dot CSS
I'm gonna change the CSS of this element
as well and before I do that you're
gonna notice I'm doing dot this dot this
dot this I'm linking all of those
methods or functions together in this
one statement that is what chaining is
all about okay really cool so let's
carry off I'm gonna give this next
element this image a border sorry we
need to a yeah border that's right and
then I'm gonna make this two pixels
solid and green this time
okay then so after I've got the image
what I'm gonna do is say get the closest
we know closest goes up the doll until
it finds the nearest elements and match
and I want the closest section tag so
we're gonna go oops we need to put that
in a quotes right with that I'm gonna go
up the Dom it's gonna go up here and it
says okay I found a section tag so I'll
stop there
grabs that for me then I'm going to
change the CSS of that and we're going
to give this a border of two pixels two
pixels solid and this term will do blue
all right then so I'm gonna save that
and now we can see first of all we've
got concept methods give it a border of
red which is this then we're saying next
get this image give that a border which
is green there and then get the closest
section so it goes up the Dom primes
this section CSS give that a blue border
which is right here so all of these
methods are chained together in one
statement really cool right but I will
warn you here don't get too carried away
with chaining because as you can see
already it's becoming a little bit
unreadable if this was twice as long
forget it you have too many I would say
but to make it look a little better a
little more readable what we can do is
after every change that we've done on an
element we can click enter like that and
then enter like that so each one of
these now is on a different line and
it's performing a different action yeah
we're going after this contact methods
on the first line and changing the CSS
the second line we're grabbing the image
and changing that CSS and the third line
we're going after the section and
changing that CSS so it's got a logical
kind of structure to it now yeah that
would be the way I would set out these
long statements when we chain them
together so guys that is what chaining
is all about it's really cool when used
in small doses don't overdo it like I
say and have chains that are really
really long because it's going to become
untidy and it's gonna become hard to
follow especially for other developers
when they're coming to your code and
have a lot
so yeah there it is use it wisely we
have any questions feel free to drop and
comment down below otherwise guys I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
