seventh CSS animation tutorial and in
this video we're going to take a look at
the animation direction property ah
alright then gang so so far we've made
this little animation where mario just
keeps on cycling around around around
around now I want to look at the the
animation Direction property but I'm not
going to change Mario because he's quite
happy just going round and round so
we're going to use our other body Luigi
and we first need to add him into the
HTML so I've just got into the index
file and underneath this Mario image I'm
just going to place another image and
it's going to be a class of Luigi and
then the source of that image is going
to be image forward slash Luigi PNG like
so and then hopefully he should appear
on the page cool currently mario is
running over his head so let's just
stand him up a little bit so I'm just
going to come under Mario and save Luigi
and I'm going to give him a position of
absolute and then I'll set his top
position to be about a hundred pixels so
he comes down into the second Lane and
Mario is no longer running over him left
I'm going to set to zero as well and
that will do so now what I want to do is
set up another animation on this dude so
that he does the same thing but it's
going to reverse so we don't need to set
up another keyframes right here and say
reverse or anything like that we can
just use the animation Direction
property and we can say that we wanting
to reverse backwards okay and so let's
go ahead and at the end of the animation
name first of all animation - name and
it's still gonna be the same one drive
and the animation duration is going to
be a bit slower because when you reverse
it it's always a little slower so so do
it over five seconds instead of three
the animation fill - mode is going to be
both again because we want it to stay at
the end or go to the start at the
beginning and then we want to say
animation
iteration - count is going to be
infinite again as well alright so
currently the buzz going forward but
Mario's got a bit quicker right now we
want to make Luigi Traverse so how do we
do this we say animation - Direction
right and the direction can be alternate
alternate reverse normal or reverse so
currently it's just normal this is it
it's going from this point here from -
but we can change this to reverse and
that's going to make him go backwards
now so now he's reversing around the
track over and over again it just goes
from this point to this point instead of
this point to this point so that's
pretty cool
but you probably saw some other options
we had as well you can see we've got
alternate reverse alternate and we've
seen normal and reverse so let's just
try alternate right so now what happens
is he goes forwards then it should come
backwards after a while there we go we
see him come backwards so what it does
alternate is it starts and it goes from
2 and then it goes - from then it goes
from 2 then it goes - from so it's
alternating the direction and we can
have alternate - reverse which does the
same thing but it's just starting here
and it goes - from then it comes back
then it comes back then it comes back so
it's doing the same thing but it's just
starting at a different position it
starts in the reverse mode and then goes
forward right so let's just keep him on
reverse at the minute just going
backwards around the track and there we
go guys we have changed the direction of
the animation without having to create a
new keyframe set to do so pretty oh yeah
all right now so if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
