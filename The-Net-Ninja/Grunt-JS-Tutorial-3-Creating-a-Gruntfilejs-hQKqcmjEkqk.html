third grunt GS tutorial and in this
video we're going to pad out our grunt
file yes
alrighty guys so in the last tutorial we
went ahead and created our grunt file
yes it's right there and currently there
is nothing in it at all but we're going
to pad this out in this tutorial but
first of all let's take a look at
exactly what the grunt file is for and
I've split this up into three points so
first of all it configures our tasks and
it tells plugins where to find certain
files okay for example if we want to
plug in to run a task on our CSS files
then we're going to tell that plug-in in
the configuration where to find our
titles okay so that's number one number
two we can lower the plugins into this
grunt file for example we can load in an
oak leaf I plugin which is going to run
a task to ugly fie our files and that
basically just means compress them on
minify them and that's the material so
number three we can register tasks in
there which need to be run okay so for
example if we load a plug-in in which is
going to do something and another
plug-in which is going to do something
else we can create a task which runs
both of those plugins simultaneously
okay and if that doesn't make sense now
it is going to make sense in the future
when we look at plugins anyway so keep
those three points in mind and let's go
into the grunt file yes and stop having
this out so like I said at the end of
the day this is just a module in nodejs
at the minute so what we need to do is
export this module and if you don't
understand that again you might want to
check out my node js4 beginners tutorial
series down below there is quite a few
tutorials in there about modules and how
we export them etc so the module that
exports equals a function and this
function takes in the group's object
okay so we're going to use this grunt
object inside this module exports
function so like I said this is split
into three sections so we're going to
comment out each section as we go along
so the first one is the configuration
so the way we do this is by first of all
saying grunt dot init config like so and
then we pass in an object into this
function okay so it's just on this grunt
object that we're working with and we
passed in there and the method is in it
config which means basically initialize
the config and this takes an object now
in here we're going to pass in options
to plugins and references to files TTC
ok and we're going to take a look at
that when we create or when we install a
plug-in into our project so we'll leave
that for now but that's the first thing
we do in this grunt file j/s which is
this top one right here all right so we
configure everything in here
the second thing on the list was to
lowered plugins into the file so if we
go down here do a little comment and say
Longwood plugins and the way we would
load a plug-in in is by saying grunt
dots blowed NPM tasks ok and right here
we would install a plug-in our reference
a plug-in that we've installed down here
ok now we're not actually going to
install a plug-in in this tutorial so
we're going to revisit this possibly in
the next tutorial so finally the last
thing on the list that we do in that
file is register tasks which needs to be
run ok so if we come here and say
register tasks then what we can do is
say grunt dots register tasks and then
we're going to give this task a name and
for example I'll just say rot okay and
then I'm going to pass a function into
this task as well I'm just gonna create
like a dummy task in the minute this is
not going to really do anything useful
I'm just showing you how they work so we
say grunt dot register task and we give
our
tasks a name now in this instance and
passing through a function but in future
instances we might just pass through
reference to the config where to find
that task so let's do something we'll
just say console.log and then I am
running okay cool
so let's create another task we'll do -
and I'm gonna say register task and this
one is gonna call this is going to be
called sleep and change this to sleeping
ok cool so now we have created two tasks
write these two bits we've not really
done anything with them yet but we are
registering tasks and I'm gonna run
these tasks now just to show you how
they work so down here in the terminal
I'm gonna say grunt and I'm going to put
the task name now this tough name is run
and this task name is sleep so let's say
grunt run and this is how we can run
tasks that we register we say grunt
first of all and then the name of the
task so let's go ahead and run that now
and hopefully we can see running the run
task I am running and again if we do the
sleep one so we'll say groups sleep this
is going to run the sleep task and log
this to the console so now we've created
two tasks and we're running them and
yeah these don't do anything useful at
the minute but I just show you I want to
show you how we create or register these
tasks and the are going to get useful in
the future I want to show you one more
thing when it comes to registering tasks
and that is how we can fire both of
these off at once so to do that again
I'm going to say grunt dot register sass
and this time I'm gonna call the task
all as in I want it to run all of the
tasks and I'm gonna pass it through as a
second parameter not a function but an
array of tasks I want to run and it's
gonna be sleep and also run so it's
gonna do both of those things at the
same time sort of thing I wouldn't
normally recommend in everyday life but
I say Groot now and say all and if we
run this
then hopefully but we get an error and
that's because I probably said it girl
you can see right there so let's say we
want all is there gone
and hopefully this is now going to run
both tests you can see I am sleeping
I am run it so it run both of those in
order cool so that is how we register
tasks and believe me these are going to
get much more useful in the future in
later tutorials
I just wanted to show you how we can
kind of pad out our grunt file and these
are the three things we do in it and I
know we've not looked at these in much
detail yet but in the next tutorial we
are going to install plugin and we're
going to cut out the configuration as
well fallout plug-in so until then any
questions leave those down below
otherwise I'm going to see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
