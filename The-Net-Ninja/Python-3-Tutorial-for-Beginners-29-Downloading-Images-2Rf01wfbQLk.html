Python 3 tutorial in this series and in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can download images from the web using
Python alright so this tutorial is
actually going to be a bit of a sneak
preview to one of the latest series I'm
going to do all about Python networking
and in this video I'm going to show you
how we can reach out to the web and grab
an image download it and store it on our
hard drive so I've already created this
DL underscore I am GUI file and also are
created this images folder in the same
directory in this project directory
right here so the first thing we need to
do is employ the help of some kind of
module so I'm going to import that first
of all so I say import at the top and
it's going to be URL Li be URL library
dot request so we're importing that now
right so we can use it later on but the
first thing I want to do is ask the user
which image they want to download for
the web so they can enter in some kind
of URL right so I'm going to say URL
equals input so we're going to ask your
user to enter in a URL so we'll say that
hit enter IMG URL to download and then
also I want to ask them for a file name
what do they want to save this as right
so I'll save file underscore name is
equal to another input statement this
time I'm going to ask them for a file
name to save us so enter file name to
save as cool so now we've given the user
those two questions we've got that data
now what we want to do is actually
download that image that they supply the
URL to and save it as this name right
here that they give so let's create a
function that encompasses that
functionality so I'll define this
function ok and I'm going to call it DL
underscore
I am rather jpg download jpg right so
this is going to taking some parameters
first of all the URL which image of a
downloaded then it's going to be a file
underscore tab where we're going to
download this in which directory and
then finally it's going to be the file
name which the user provided down here
and that's going to be what the name of
the file is ok so inside this function
what do we want to do well first of all
we want to create the full test
to where
this file is going to be saved so I'm
going to create a variable and I'm going
to call this fault underscore pad and
I'm going to set that equal now to file
path which we supply here and we're
going to supply that later on so that's
kind of like fold slash images or
whatever the folder that we're saving it
in to then that we want to concatenate
that Wiggly file
underscore name and then finally we want
to tuck out at the end
dot jpg right we're saving a JPEG so now
we have the full kind of path and
filename and extension as to where we're
going to be saving this image when we
download it so now let's download it
what we want to say is URL Lib dots
request dots URL retrieve a nice about
retrieving I can never do it there we go
and then inside here we want to passing
first of all the URL to the image and
then secondly we want to supply where we
want to save it to which is going to be
default path so what we're doing here is
we're using this module to retrieve a
URL an image from the web we're going to
download it this thing right here this
method is going to download it and it's
going to save it to this test that we
supply it with and this is the path that
we just created using these variables so
the file path the file name and dot jpg
and the URL we supplied here as well
which we entered in at the start
so now let's call this function so I'm
going to say down here DL underscore
image and then we need to pass through
the URL first of all that's the first
parameter that we need and that's what
the Euro the user provided which is
stored in this URL variable so we can
pass that in first of all then we need
the file path so I'm going to make this
up I'm just going to say images so this
is the images directory right here
forward slash okay so we add the forward
slash because after that it's just going
to be the file name that we tuck onto it
and by the way this should be applause
ok so now we need to pass through that
file name that the user input so I'm
going to pass in that variable if you
file underscore name and now we can run
the file and hopefully think his grasp
this is going to work so I'm going to
run this file by saying painting DL
underscore image dot P why do we have an
arrow not so far so
let's enter an image to download now I'm
just going to go to the best website on
the internet and copy the image address
of this image right here so we'll just
download that and then what we can do is
paste it in here so that's the image we
want to download then we need to enter a
file name to save this as I'm just going
to call this async right so I think and
it's going to suck on a dot JPEG at the
end right here so press ENTER and we get
an error and that's because DL
underscore image is not defined
if DL underscore JPEG knew it wouldn't
work the first time around but anyway
save that let's run it again
download image and we'll paste this URL
and again we'll call it a sync and this
time come on down Lord yes we have
successfully downloaded this image and
we can see that pop up now in this
images folder right here where we saved
it and if we click on that we can see
this amazing image right here okay so
there we go were friends
that is how we can use this module right
here to download an image using this
method supplying the URL and the full
type that we're saving it to and that's
like to take a sneak preview into an
open coming series a very soon when
we're going to look at networking it
with titles so that's it for this series
now 29 lessons it hope it's been of some
benefit to you and you've enjoyed it
along the way as well
like I said more Python series coming
soon I'm going to do - I'm going to do
with networking series and also I'm
going to look at general creative
websites with jungle so I'll see you
guys in those playlists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
