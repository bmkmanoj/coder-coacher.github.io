22nd titan-3 tutorial and in this video
I want to talk about maps all rather so
what is a map well maps are a way to
take a list apply some kind of function
to each bank and within that list to
change the items and then spit out a new
list with those updated items within it
okay so the weight works use something
like this we have the map function and
then inside it it takes two parameters
first of all the function that we want
to pass the data through to change the
data and then the data itself okay so
what we do is we've set some kind of new
variable to say new list is equal to
this right and that would spit out the
new list and pop it into this variable
so we'll come back to this in a bit but
for now what I want to do is create some
data a list basically of words that
we're going to do something with using
the map function and we're going to pass
those lists of words through our own
custom function to change them and then
spit them out using this map function
into a new list so first of all let's
create some data and what we're going to
do is create just a list of strings so
I'm going to say words equal to a list
and inside we'll have beetroot and then
carrots and then another one potatoes
okay
can I spell no anyway we have a list of
words now what I want our function to do
in this case it's going to be this
function within the map function itself
how I want to change the different
elements is I want to form an anagram
based on each individual word right and
then I want to spit it out into a new
place called anagrams so I set that
equal to an empty list at the minute so
first of all let's define this function
which is going to make these and
allogram so we'll say def and we'll call
this function jumble it can be named
whatever you want and it takes in a word
so this word is either going to be
beetroot carrots potatoes etc so inside
this what I want to do now is say
anagram is equal to
list and then inside work so we're
taking this word which is past the end
which could be any one of these and
we're making it into a list and what
that does is turn the word into a list
of characters so for example B would be
B and then e and then E and so forth so
we've got a list of each individual
character in this list now right so
we've turned this word into a list now
we want to jumble them up and to do that
I'm going to employ the help of a module
called random so I'm going to take from
random import a method called shuffle so
we're going to use this shuffle method
to mix up these things so I'm going to
say shuffle the anagram and that's going
to mix up the list of words and then
what I want to do is turn that list of
characters back into string right so the
way we do that is by using the join
method so I'm going to return this I'm
going to return and then this is going
to be an empty string and this empty
string is the separator between the
items that are going to be in the string
so if this was for example a dash then
we get back something like this okay get
my point so is the separator now I'm
going to pass through an empty string so
there's nothing in between each letter
when we return it and I'm going to say
join and these are going to join
together the shuffle dot and a gram so
anagram okay so now we're going to get
back a string from this which is an
anagram of these things make sense so
when we pass a word into this we're
going to get an anagram back so now what
we want to do is actually use the map
function but before we do that I'm going
to show you how we do it using a for
loop so we could do something like this
for word in words
so we're cycling through this thing
right here and referring to each
individual item as a word each time
around
so for word in words we're going to take
anagrams stops at end so we're going to
add something to this list right here
and the thing we're going to append is
the word which has been jumbled so we
need to call this method right here
jumble this function and then passing
the word
makes sense so that's going to return
those a jumbled up word and each time
adding that jumbled up word to this
anagram sized so then what I'm going to
do is just print the anagrams all right
so let's say that and this time of 101
maps py so I say Python map stop key
wide and now you can see we get these
anagrams of these items right here all
right so that's the way we do it with
four loops and that is absolutely fine
but I want to show you how we can do
this using the map function now
so let's uncomment this and the way
we're doing is I say map and then
passing the function we want to use on
each individual item well that's the
jumble function right there so I'm going
to say jumble and then the data is words
like so and that is going to do pretty
much the same thing it's going to cycle
through words and it's going to perform
this jumble function on each one of
these individual items that it's going
to spit them back out so I'm going to
say this time prints the result of this
now this isn't exactly right and I'm
going to show you why in a second so
we're just getting this map object back
so this is actually returning an object
which is a map but all we need to do is
type classes into a list so I'm going to
say list then open up my parentheses and
I've just destroyed that map word okay
and then close my parentheses over here
so now what we're doing is we're using
this map function right here to map
these individual items then we're
turning the result into a list which is
going to give us a list now of
individual words so let's save it and do
it again and this time we can see we get
exactly the same thing okay
and yet the anagrams are different
because this is absolutely random when
it shuffles so the ILA grams are going
to be different each time around cool so
that is how we use the map function now
just for the hell of it I'm going to
show you how you do this using the
comprehension way which we learn in the
last tutorial so the first thing I'm
going to do is print the result and then
inside this print what going to do is
this comprehension so how is this
comprehension going to work
well what do we want to output first
jumbled up word so I'll say jumble and
then word that's what what output in
each time the function right and then
what we're looping through well we'll
say for whereas in words myself so this
is going to do exactly the same and
you'll see if I run this again and this
time gets three different anagrams cool
so this is all working these three
different ways of doing it absolutely
fine and it's up to you which one you
use now some high semesters might have
something to say about using maps and
probably would suggest using loops or
comprehension to do snow that uh school
but you know what I like maps they're an
easy way to convert one laced into
another and they don't take up much room
yada-yada-yada anyway then yeah that's
how we use maps use them if you want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
