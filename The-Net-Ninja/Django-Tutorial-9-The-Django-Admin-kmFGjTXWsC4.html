tutorial and in this video i'm going to
show you how we can control the content
of our site using the Django admin
alright then so now we know how to
interact with a database using the
jungle Oh erm we've created our model
and that's mapped to a table now I'd
like to introduce you to the Django
admin area which is a really awesome
feature of Django comes fully baked with
it we don't have to do anything to set
it up and it is really cool so the admin
area is an area for site admins to
control the content of the website
essentially or the contents of databases
we can create instances of models such
as articles or something else we can
control users of our website etc so when
we first started this project we saw in
this URLs file in the jungle Nautique
app that we have this admin URL set up
which is at forward slash admin so that
suggests to me that the admin section is
going to be all right here
so the first thing I want to do is make
sure I'm running my server Pythian
manage top py run server once that's
running I'm gonna go over to a browser
and I'm going to go to forward slash
admin and it's important you put a
forward slash at the end of this and we
should see this thing right here now
it's pre-populated because I've done all
this before but if I try to log in then
I'm gonna get an error message because
this username and password doesn't exist
yet
and in fact no username or password
exists just yet we're not created for so
how do we do that well let us come to
our terminal and cancel out of this I'm
going to press ctrl C and we're going to
create a super user using the manage dot
py file again
so it's Python managed py and we need to
say create super user and a super user
is someone who's gonna have access to
this admin area okay but not normal
users we're going to cover those laters
just super users who can go into the
admin section so let's run this and it
says username leave blank to you Sean
well okay I'll leave it blank then and
email address I don't need to enter that
in but you can do if you
- the password I'm gonna do test one two
three four it's quite funny I think you
need to do at least eight characters and
there needs to be a combination of
letters and numbers in there I think
anyway
I'll test one two three four again all
right super user created successfully so
now let's run up this server again so
python managed to py one server this
time if I try to go to four slash admin
and log in again with sha and this a
hope is test one two three four but I'll
just double check it then go to login
now we gain access to this thing over
here so we can see groups and users who
uses is all of our users and we can see
me right here Sean I've just created
that user and its staff status is a
green tick because it is a super user if
normal users were in this list as well
they wouldn't have this green tick
because they would not be super users
and again we're going to come to normal
users later on so don't worry about that
too much yet so in this jungle admin
area the whole idea is that it's a bit
of a CMS we can add instances of our
articles or whatever other models we
have now at the minute our articles are
not showing up here and we can't really
do anything with them so why is that
well it's because we've not said to
jungle that we want our articles model
to appear in the admin area and we do
need to do that for it to appear ok so
inside our articles app folder right
here we have this admin file so let's
open that and what we need to do is
register our model which is going to
appear in the admin section right here
so we want to register this thing the
article so the first thing we need to do
is import it so I'll say from and then
it's dot models which means get the
models file in the current directory
okay then we're going to import article
all right so
now what I'd like to do is just delete
this dude and instead say admin dots
cite dots register and this is the way
we're telling Django to register
something on the admin site all right
so admin site register what are we going
to register well we're going to register
the article model so now
Django knows that in the admin section
we want to see the articles so if i
refresh over here and now we see just
like magic
the articles have appeared that is
freaking awesome and we can control
these articles and remember when we
explored the jungle o RM and interacting
with the database we created two
articles there right here if you still
see object or something like article
object here what you need to do instead
is go to the models WI and inside this
class of article make sure you have this
because if you don't have that it's
going to show model or object or article
object or something like that okay so
then we can click into one of these and
we can edit it if we want to we can give
it a different slug or body so I can say
test and save it or we can delete it
every one and now it's seen this field
is required to slope so I'll just say
Django - rules because this is our URL
friendly field so this is what will be
the URL forward slash articles slash
jungle rules when we come to do the
detail page that is so let's save that
now okay if we want we can add a new
article so I'll just say something like
Django notic opening
and we'll just copy in fact we want
we'll just write it again Django Nortec
I've been opening again this is the URL
friendly string and in the body will say
something like welcome to the new
website alright save that and now my
friends we've also created a new article
and that's now stored in our database as
well how cool is that
so later on when we come to showing the
articles on the front end of the website
we'll be retrieving these and we'll be
showing them and then if we want to add
a new one as an admin we can come to the
admin area add an article and then when
we view it in a front-end again
it's gonna appear that okay so that's
really cool
so this is the Django administration
area really really good and dead dead
simple to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
