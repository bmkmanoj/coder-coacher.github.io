PSD to responsive website lesson 10 and
in this video we're gonna dive right in
to do some mobile styles or I think I
saw this is looking pretty good at the
minute we've got our basic desktop
styles which look like this and then
we've got some breakpoints for tablets
which are at 960 pixels right there so
it goes like this and it's all nice and
spacious and then again about 768 pixels
around about here and there we go and
this is for smaller tablets so it's all
looking pretty spacious but when we get
a bit smaller you'll notice things start
to look a little squash roundabout for
donator pixels there abouts this is
stance a little squashed up here these
are a little bit squashed not so bad
these are fine
but down here it's all squashed as well
so we're going to do another breakpoint
which is gonna capture everything below
about 480 pixels for mobiles and that
kind of thing
so let's come to the bottom of the
styles and do our media query at media
screen and to attach a filter and then
the filters can be max width 480 pixels
okay so we'll put all of our styles for
mobiles in here so the first thing I
want to do is grab these things right
here and make them one in a row so it's
one after the other going down so to do
that I'll grab the selling points dip
and then allies within those because
within that because each one of those is
an ally and then we'll make the width of
those 80% and then what we're going to
do to centralize them because they're a
bit off to the left at the minute it's
just give them a padding of 0 top and
bottom then 10% left or right and that's
gonna centralize them and bring them
away from the edges a little bit I also
want to give them a margin of 20 pixels
top and bottom and 0 left and right ok
then
so that looks pretty cool next thing I
want to do is come down here and just
make these a little bit bigger so
they're taking up more room on the
screen so to do that I'll get the latest
work ID and then the Ally tags within
that because these again
I like text within that div and what
I'll do is pretty much the same here I'm
gonna give them a width of 80% but then
I'm gonna give them a will give them a
padding oh no looking through my margin
this time over around 30 pixels top and
bottom and then we'll get 10% left there
right now that's not doing anything
that's because there's a previous rule
overriding certain things here we've got
an important going on somewhere up there
there it is so we need to override that
again I'm just going to put important
again and that's going to bring them
into the center and make them 80% in
width so that was pretty cool now and
the next thing I want to do is come down
to this quote right here and a little
there we go to grab that ID and then
what I want to do is make this a little
bit smaller in font size so I'll say
font size 16 pixels instead of 18 then I
will still make it bold font-weight:bold
so it sticks out a little bit that's
absolutely fine
then we need to sort these things out
right here so we need to grab the you
owls currently I think they're 25 not
25% 50% in width let's have a lot yet
okay so we need to double that up to
make them full width so what I'll do is
grab the footer you ELLs and then I'll
make those width 100% like that okay and
I think I'll take away the floats
because we don't need those anymore and
what I'll do is give them a border just
to separate them for the top of about
two pixels make it solid and about three
three three which is a kind of light
gray and that first separates those all
right so now that's looking a bit better
so I think what we'll do now is focus on
the small pile menu but what I'll do is
I'll leave that till the next lesson
because I'm gonna make a whole lesson
about the JavaScript that we need to do
and the little icon and what not so I'll
leave it here for now this is OK for
mobiles
except for this navigation right here
which we're going to look at in the next
lesson I think they
is okay for mobile styles now and if you
get smaller it's still gonna look pretty
neat and spacious
okay so we'll tackle this in the next
lesson if you have any questions about
this one feel free to drop a comment
down below otherwise guys I'll see you
in the next one don't forget to share
