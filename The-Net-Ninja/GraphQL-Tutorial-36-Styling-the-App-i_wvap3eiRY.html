got the functionality of this app down
to a tee so we can do all kinds of magic
inside it however at the minute it's
looking very much like a program
developed by a server-side programmer
who doesn't know any CSS at all so let's
try our best to rectify that and just
make this look a little bit better so
let's head over to the code and we can
see this is the root up and we have this
div right here with an ID of main so
let's grab that first of all and style
up that one so we'll go into index dot
CSS and this is where we can add all of
our CSS for this project the first thing
I'd like to do then is get that main ID
and we'll style the h1 inside it and
we'll say color is going to be 444 and
then text aligned is going to be Center
so basically it 444 is kind of a deep
great and we're just putting it to the
center as well
next we'll take the main container
itself not the h1 inside it
we'll give it a padding of 0 pixels and
then we'll give it a box sizing of
border - box that just basically takes
into consideration the padding and the
border when it works out the width of
something and then the width is going to
be set to 60 the sense of the screen and
the height is going to be a 100% alright
so we have the main thing sorted let's
save this and view it in a browser
probably not gonna look that much
different to be honest at the minute
okay no nothing much I do here but
anyway it's getting there so let's go
back into this the next thing I'd like
to do is style up that book list so
let's take a look at this we have down
here an ID of book links we have a ul
inside it and a lies inside that so
let's stand up those bad boys will say
book list first of all and that's going
to have a padding of 0 and then after
that we'll do the Li tags inside the
book list so book list Li and then
underneath that we want to display each
one as in line block that's going to
place them next to each other rather
than just one on top of the other the
margin is going to be around 12 pixels
each
way around the padding about 10 pixels
and then the border Raiders
border-radius rather is going to be
about 4 pixels just to give it a kind of
softer feel and the border itself is
gonna be one pixel in width it's gonna
be solid and it's gonna be a color which
is kind of like a pinky color which is 8
8 then 0e then 4s all right so I have to
moved on that let's give this a box
shadow just to lift out of the page and
give it a bit of depth so the box shadow
is going to be 1 pixel to pixel 3 pixel
then we'll use RGB a so we have an alpha
Channel and we can set the opacity 0 0 0
and then not 0.3 for the opacity so it's
like a kind of black box shadow but only
semi-transparent okay so the cursor is
going to be as well a pointer because
when a user hovers over a book I want
them to know they can click it and I
want that little hand pointer instead of
just an arrow and then finally the color
of the text inside here is gonna be the
same as the border which is 8 8 0 e F or
was it 4 F yep 4 F cool all right there
so are we doing something's gone wrong
here or we need the semicolon at the end
cool so let's save that and take a look
in the browser again all right starting
to look a little bit better now I'm
zoomed in to X let's zoom out a little
bit go to 150 or even a hundred and
twenty-five percent okay so we can start
to see these are looking a little bit
better now so we need to stand up as
well the form so let's do that next
we'll go back into our CSS and so I get
the form I'm just gonna give myself a
little bit of room so the form is next
now this form is going to have a
background of white so it stands out a
little bit on the page now don't do what
I've done and do everything in capitals
because just not good at all we'll do
background of FFF
so that's white it stands out on the
page the padding is going to be about 20
pixels the position is going to be fixed
because it's gonna be fixed in the
bottom left of the screen so
wanting to stay there so left is going
to be zero and bottom is also going to
be zero
sweep the width of the forum I'm just
going to set to forage of pixels for now
all right so now we can start each field
inside the forum if we look at book
where the forum is we can see we have
these different fields right and they
all have a class name of field so inside
the CSS we'll say for and then dot field
and inside here we'll say display grid
and grid template columns is going to be
one fraction and one fraction again so
that's for the label and the input box
now if you're unsure on CSS grid I've
got a whole playlist on CSS grid I'm not
going to spend this video explaining the
nuances of it go and check that out if
you want to I'll leave the link down
below so also we're going to give this a
grid gap off around ten pixels that just
means there's a tempest will gap between
each column if you like and row so now
we've done the fields
let's style up the labels will say farm
label and this is going to have a text
align property of right so it's going to
scoot over to the right for the label
and a padding of six pixels
something like that let's just see how
it's looking at the minute go over here
mmm all right looking okay so this is
the grid and the text align in place we
have the farm fields on the right and we
have the labels on the left ball text
aligned to the right so start to look a
little bit better already and if I go
back now to the code we can carry this
on so I'd like to also style up the
Select and the input fields
so we'll say form select and form input
like so and inside here I'd like to say
the margin of each one is going to be
four pixels the padding is going to be
around six pixels and the box sizing is
going to be border-box
all right cool now we want to style up
that button on the bottom left down here
okay
want to make it look a little more
puppet and stand out so let us make some
space again and say form button and this
is going to have a color of white so
that's the text inside it so FFF the
font size is going to be two M's and the
background is going to be kind of like a
pinky color and the hex code for that is
a D one four five seven cool all right
now we want a border of zero on the
button itself the padding is going to be
zero top and bottom but ten pixels left
and right the border radius is going to
be fifty percent and what that does is
turn it into a circle when the border
radius is 50% or more of something it's
going to turn it into a circle right so
all if it allows to be a circle it's
small enough to be a circle that is so
the cursor is going to be a pointer so
we know we can click it the position is
going to be absolute and then the bottom
is going to be ten pixels so it's going
to shift up a little bit from the bottom
and also from the left as well ten
pixels so let's have a look at that
button right now see what it looks like
all right cool so it's looking a bit
better now let me just zoom in a little
all right here we go
take that off so this is looking pretty
good so far we have now the farm sorted
and we have the list of books down here
sorted I suppose all we need to do now
is stand up this thing so it's some kind
of panel on the right so let us go back
to the code and do that if we go to book
details we can see that this has an ID
of book - detail so let's use that will
copy it and we'll paste it over here
alright so book details now the position
of this thing is going to be fixed on
the right hand side so we'll say top is
zero so it's flush to the top and right
is also zero so it's flush to the right
the width is going to be 40% and the
height is going to be 100% alright so we
have the content on the left which is
60% in weight
I think let me just check yep the main
is 60% in width then we have this on the
right which is going to be 40% in width
make sense the height is 100% so
hopefully it's going to take up the
whole height of the screen all right so
the background of this is going to be
kind of like a pink color so we'll use
that same hex code that we used for the
button right here so let me just copy
that and paste it down here all right
the padding and we'll say about 30
pixels the overflow is going to be auto
so we'll get a scrollbar if it flows
over the initial height the box shadow
is going to be minus 2 pixels because we
want to scoot it out to the left minus 3
pixels and 5 pixels and rgba so we have
an alpha channel as well again we'll do
0 0 0 which is black and not 0.3 for the
opacity all right then we want a box
- sizing of border box and then finally
the color of the text inside is going to
be white whew oh my god so that was a
lot of CSS to cram into what is about
seven or eight minutes so at the minute
we can see no book selected if we select
a book now we can see all the book
details on the right all right so let's
just try adding one more book my great
book this doesn't exist
genre let's do something else let's do
horror and then we'll just assign this
one to Brandon Sanderson for the hell of
it ok so now we can see my great book is
here if we click on that we get details
about that book as well awesome so my
friends there we go that is your tour
