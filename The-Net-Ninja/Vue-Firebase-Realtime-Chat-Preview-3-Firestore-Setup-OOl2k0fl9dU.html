application with firebase midway through
but that's because I was easing those
into the project now I actually think
it's a good idea to set up our database
from the beginning and get our app
hooked up to it from the offset so then
we don't have to start worrying about it
later on when we come to use it so first
of all let's go to our console so that's
it consult up firebase google.com you
can also get to it by clicking console
in the top right when you go to the
firebase website and we'll add a new
project so first of all the name of this
project is gonna be udemy - ninja - chat
you can call it whatever you want choose
your country or region and create that
project ok so now he's created we'll go
to our control panel and we'll set up
our database over here so click on
database first of all and inside here
we'll choose the firestore option which
is over here on the left get started and
we'll start it in test mode again an
able okay cool and now we have our
firestore instance setup so we can now
use it in our project now we want to set
up a configuration file inside our
project where we're initializing our
firebase application on the front end so
to do that let's go back to our project
overview first of all and click on this
option where we want to add firebase to
our web app so once this loads we want
to grab this stuff right here again
inside this script tag and copy that
remember we load in the firebase library
via NPM not via this script right here
so we'll cross that off and head over to
our code editor now and then go into
source and create a new folder inside
here and this folder will be called
firebase and in here we'll create a new
file called in it is to initialize our
firebase project now first of all we'll
paste in this stuff we just copied now
we don't yet have firebase installed so
we'll need to install that down here in
the terminal now make sure you're inside
the ninja chat directory the root
directory of our entire project here
then we'll say npm install firebase and
if you have a early version of npm
you'll need to do double dash
save to save that to your dependencies
all right so now that's installed what
we can do is import it up here at the
top of the file so we'll say import
firebase from and it's firebase so we
needed that because we're using firebase
down here to initialize our app we're
also going to store this in a constant
called firebase app you can call this
constant whatever you want by the way it
just makes sense to call it five eight
up to me and then underneath this we
need to export something now we want to
export our database which is going to
use the firestore method so first of all
we'll need to import firestore at the
top import firestore from firebase
forward slash fire store so now we can
come down here and say exports default
and we want to export the firebase app
up here which is our initialized up then
we want to say dot fire store because
we're exporting our fire store database
reference okay now we've exported it
there we can use it inside our other
components in a future lessons hey gang
gets shown here from the future with a
quick update because since recording
these videos the firebase team have
updated the firestore API slightly and
they've done that to add a new timestamp
class to represent timestamp fields in
the database now by doing that the
knock-on effect is that we get a big fat
red error in our browser console now you
may have seen this you may have not seen
this it depends on which version of
firebase you have installed in your
application if you have version 4.1
three and above you probably will see
this error if we ever tried to use the
firestore if you have something below
that you probably won't either way all
we need to do to get rid of that error
is add in one line of code inside this
initialization file image is where we
initialize our fire store application so
where we see constabies up equals
firebase dot initialize app and then
inside config we want to come below that
then paste in this line of code
we take the firebase up then we get the
firestore dot settings and inside the
settings function you pass in this one
object now inside this object we pass in
one property and that property is
timestamp in snapshots camelcase and we
set that equal to true so by doing this
we're going to get rid of that big error
that we see in the console every time we
try to use the firestore now this code
is not going to have any effect on any
of the other code that we write inside
this project or any of the other
projects we do in this series but it is
going to get rid of that error if you
were seeing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
