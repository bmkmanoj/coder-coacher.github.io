25th nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at the second
part of template engines all right on
campus so you're gonna have to excuse my
voice for this tutorial I've just had a
really bad cold and I've still
recovering but hey ho the videos must go
on so in my last tutorial we went ahead
and we created our first view which
looks something like this the profile
view and we output some data using that
profile view like this okay now in this
tutorial I want to show you some more
advanced things we can do with views
because it's not just data we can output
them we can output actual JavaScript
code control flow of statements that
kind of thing so in this tutorial what
I'm going to do is pass through some
more data into this object and then
through to the view then cycle through
that data and output that as well so
let's go ahead and add some more data
I'm just going to add some puppies in
here I'm going to set that equal to an
array then in here is just going to be
so puppies will call it eating fighting
and I don't know fishing okay so now we
want to pass through that data let's
call this hobbies not hobby this data
through to here right so we don't need
to do anything else here because it's
all stored in this data object so that's
being passed through to the view now so
I'm going to save this head over to the
view and let's output that data now I'm
not just outputting a single variable
there's an array of data so what I need
to do is cycle through that array of
data using some JavaScript so let's do
that under here first of all I'm going
to do a h2 and I'm going to call this
hobbies and then what do we do well and
then what I want to do is display each
hobbit in an li tag so we need to cycle
through the data and output an li tag
for each hobbit in the array because
there could be three hobbies to cover a
hobbies we don't know how many there are
so we can't just hard code them we have
to cycle through them dynamically so the
way we output some JavaScript code in
ejs is really similar right here we add
the angle bracket percentage side and
then the equal side to output data
that is five output data when you're
just doing code all you need is these
two not the equal sign okay so let's do
the open angle bracket percentage sign
then we're going to grab that data which
is on the data object dot hobbies so
this is an array and then because that's
an array I can use the for each method
on it which is just a JavaScript method
and what that is going to do is cycle
through each one of these items in the
array and fire a callback function but
each one I'm going to pass through that
item in the array okay
so for each item what we want to do is
output an li tag well first of all we
need to close this tag here so that we
can add HTML again right here so we'll
close that off there so percentage side
close angle brackets and that we need to
do the same thing down here because
we're opening the JavaScript code again
so percentage side and same over there
to close it off okay cool so now we can
output an li tag right here in HTML and
I think we want to output is this item
right so let's output some data we know
to output data we use the equal sign as
well so let's pop that in and then this
time we don't want the data to age we
want the item that we pass through right
here all right so let's get rid of that
space and I also want to add in a couple
of little styles first of all the ally
text can also have these styles and I'll
say the hates too we'll just copy this
stuff right here and change it a little
bit so we'll say 30 pixels and I think
that will do to be honest ok let's save
that dude and let's run this through
knowing mark source a node 1 is and view
it in a browser so it's running now
let's open it in profile and you can see
hobbies eating fighting fishing so we've
output those now to the view and the way
we've done it is by using some
JavaScript code right here this for each
method using ejs tags like this so
remember when we output data we use that
equal tag when we just output JavaScript
we
just need the percentage sign and the
angle brackets alright so there we go
guys any questions feel free to leave
those down below otherwise I'm going to
see you in a very next tutorial where
we're going to take a look at partial
templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
