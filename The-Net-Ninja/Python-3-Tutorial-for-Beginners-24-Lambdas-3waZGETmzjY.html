tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about lambdas so then lambdas
are a bit like anonymous functions which
means they don't need a name or any kind
of identifier so why would we want one
of these well think about it if you only
ever use a function once there's no need
to name it if we're not calling on it
again so we can use a lambda for that
just a small anonymous function that we
only ever used once so that's what
lambdas are useful and we can use them
in conjunction with a few the methods of
Euler functions we've seen in the past
couple of tutorials things like map
functions or filters so I'm going to
show you an example of how to do that in
this tutorial so first of all let's
create a list of numbers I'll just call
this numbers and I'm going to have it
equal to one two three four five and six
so we're creating this so that we can
use the map function in a minute so
imagine we did a map function on this so
we printed it out we'll print out and we
typecast it to a list remember first of
all and then we're printing out the map
and then in here we'd have some kind of
function and then de passing the numbers
as the data right so this function right
here is going to perform some kind of
action on each element right here and
then this whole thing is going to spit
out a new list based on that function so
what I'm going to do first of all is
define this function we're going to do
something with the numbers and all we're
going to do is square them so I'm going
to say def square this is the function
name and then it's going to take n as an
argument the number and inside all it's
going to do is return a value which is
end times and the square of n right so
now what I'm going to do is just press
this square function into the map so I'm
going to say Square and what's going to
happen now is this map function is going
to run through this list pass each of
the numbers into this square function
right here and then that's going to
return the square of that number and
output it in the new list which is
returned by list so if we
save it and run this in the console I'm
going to save Peyton and call lambdas Qi
and now we get the square of each number
okay so that's fine but since we're only
ever using dysfunction once we don't
really need to define a name for it
because we're not going to call on it
again so what we could do is use a
lambda which is an anonymous function
and a line that looks something like
this would say lambda first of all then
we take the argument which is n then a
colon and on the same line we don't
return anything as we did here right all
we do is write the expression and times
n and it's automatically going to return
this right so now this is kind of like
an anonymous function it's a wonder
expression so we don't need to define it
there the whole idea of these lambda
expressions is that we can just define
them in line so instead of calling upon
a function I can just paste this lambda
function right here and it's going to
run in line and then we don't need to
define this anywhere else okay so this
is going to do exactly the same thing so
if I run this five again then we see we
get exactly the same thing out now if we
had different arguments if we had more
than one argument in a lambda all we
need to do is comma separate them so say
for example I also want to pass in X
right then I do n comma X now we don't
have X at the minute so we don't need to
do that but if I wanted to passing in
multiple arguments I can do like that so
then we go lambdas are basically like
inline anonymous functions and they're
good when we only need to use a
particular function once so we can just
use them in line within things like the
map function or the filter function all
