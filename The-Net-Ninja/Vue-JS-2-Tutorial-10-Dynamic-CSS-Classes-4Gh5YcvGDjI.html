tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about dynamic CSS okay so in
previous tutorials we've already seen
data binding we can say we bind and then
bind to a particular attribute on a HTML
element such as hate ref or value then
we can control the value of those
attributes via the view instance itself
right now we can do the same kind of
thing with classes because at the end of
the day class is just a hasty ml
attribute right we can say class equals
something so we can bind to the HTML
touch of U and we're going to go through
two examples to illustrate this so first
of all example one I'm just going to do
a simple div and then we'll save the -
defined as we would normally to bind to
an attribute and then this time we're
binding to class sprite and at this time
this right here expects an object so
killer braces that is an object this is
got nothing to do with template syntax
when we do two of them this is just one
curly brace for an object and then
inside here we have a series of key and
value pairs now the key is going to be
the class name and the value is going to
be a building either true or false and
it's true then this element will have
that class if it's false it won't okay
for example if we want this to have a
class of red we'd say red is true make
sense and if we check this out now in a
browser then it should have a class of
red which it does if we say false then
it won't have a class of red so you can
see this update right here should move
that class and we can add more than just
one we can say blue and that's going to
be true and by the way these are comment
eliminated you can see that comma right
there if we save this now it should have
a class of blue which it does and it can
both be true of both defaults so if I
make this true then it should have a
class of red and blue cool so that's all
very good but at the end of the day this
is not really very dynamic is it we're
not driving this via the view instance
we're just putting true here for both of
them right it's kind of hard coded if
you like if we were to do this we could
just get rid of rebind altogether and
just
red blue so we want to make this a
little more dynamic so let's get rid of
red and blue pluses first of all and I
want to give this a class of available
but I want it to depend on this property
right here that I've already created
available so when this is false on the
video instance then I don't want it to
get that class when it's true I do want
it to get that class right so since we
have access to that property on the data
right here we can say available is going
to be available right so the class
available right here is going to be
either true or false
because this refers this one here to
this thing right here so currently the
fault it's not going to get the class so
if we saved it and check it out in the
browser then currently it shouldn't have
that class port if we change this to
true then it should get that class you
see and let's illustrate this a little
better by adding a click event to this
in fact what we'll do first of all is
add a span in here right and this is
going to be the name of someone let's
exit taxi driver and when this has a
class of available this taxi driver is
going to be styled green because green
means available and when it's not got
class if available it's going to be
styled red now first of all we need
those classes so I'm just going to head
to my repository on my other screen and
copy those classes you can get those as
well by going to the repo the links down
below
it's the branch which is lesson 10 so if
we paste it in here you can see that
it's styling a spanned by default as a
background of red here when it has that
available class attached to the
surrounding element and then this span
has a background or a green okay so if
we save that now what I want to do is
add a click event to this so we say V on
and then click and then what we're going
to do is say available is equal to
exclamation mark available and what this
does is reverse what available is
currently so if it's currently true then
this negation operator turned it to Fox
right and it's false it turns it to true
so it's going to keep swapping it
we click on this thing right here so if
we check this out the browser now
currently it's true because by default
it's true but when we click this is
going to change that to false it goes to
red and we remove that class click it
again we add that class because now it's
true click it again in the conforth etc
any styling differently so we've got
some kind of dynamic classes going on
there so we can style things differently
depending on user interaction with the
web page which is really cool okay so
that's a really simple example I want to
show you something which is slightly
more complicated but really not
complicated at all so let me come in
let's do that and come underneath
example two so we're going to do
something very similar but this time
what we're going to do is pass in this
whole object from the view instance
instead of writing out the object there
remember I said we could have a list of
different classes so say we've got a
list of five classes we don't want to be
writing them all in the HTML that
doesn't make sense it becomes a very
ugly and hard to update if instead we
had this object defined here so that
would become much easier and what we're
going to do is define that object right
here in the computed properties right so
this is going to be called comp classes
right so computed classes that stands
for and this needs to be a function and
it's going to return to us an object
because at the end of the day that's
what we're expecting here an object this
is what we want to return so it's going
to return an object which is going to
contain two key value pairs these two
things right here so class of available
and class of made by let's change this
to false and a box of false to begin
with so if we return we want to return
an object and the first object sorry the
first property inside that object we
want to return is available which is
going to be this dots available which
refers to this thing right here yet
lists are available refer to this
property on the data object and then the
second one we want to pass through these
nearby and this is going to be this dots
nearby okay so we're returning this
object
which is going to be either true or
false depending on what these are right
here and looking controlling is by
listening to event click events that
kind of thing
so now let's return this object in an
element somewhere let's go over here it
and come below to example two and what
I'm going to do is say div V - bind is
on the classification equal to comp
classes right so this comp class is is
this computed property or right here so
it's going to look at this and it's
going to return this object and every
time one of these two changes this is
going to run again and return the
updated object right with the values are
updated so it's returning that right
here so if we save this now in fact
we'll just add in the Sun again Ryu okay
so if we save this now and check it out
then currently if we inspect it's got
none of those classes attached to the
div right because they're both false in
here they're both false so let's have
some click events to change those so the
first thing I want to do is add a couple
of buttons right and the first button is
going to say
toggle nearby so that's going to toggle
this thing right here change it to true
or false and the second button if I just
copy this and paste it down below is
going to toggle available so it's going
to toggle the other property right here
available between three or false okay so
to do that we need to add those click
events don't worry we need to say V on
and then click is equal and then we can
fire something here now we want to do
the same kind of thing as we did before
except we're doing it with nearby here
so if I say nearby equals exclamation
nearby then that's going to toggle this
between true and false if we do the same
here V on click is equal to and I just
copied that a minute ago so I'll paste
it in
then we're toggling this one as well so
now if I go over here I can say double
available and this works and you can see
that if we inspect you can see in the
classes so it gets the available class
and this total nearby means now we get
this little nearby thing which is
controlled by this CSS you can see if we
have a class of nearby then we apply
this after pseudo element to the span
where they add some nearby content in
okay so that's where that's being driven
from so you can see over here we get a
class of nearby and this nearby text
appears right and when we tell them
available it all becomes green so we're
very good that is how we can dynamically
use classes inside this view instance
right here and output them and bind them
to the plus attribute on HTML elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
