eighth angular 2 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to talk about nested
components alright so in the last
tutorial we went ahead and created this
new component called whole component
which sits in this whole directory and
if we set it beneath the root component
now we created all rather angular
created a simple template for that whole
component and we had a tag for it app
hole and then we wanted to insert this
component within the root component
right here so we place that app home tag
right there so hopefully angular sees
that tag and then finds this component
and pops that home component viewing it
but it wasn't working so why is that not
working well it's because this app
component this root component right here
that we're trying to put or rather nest
the home component in because we're
trying to nest it in this view right
here that doesn't know what the home
component is ok we have to tell it
explicitly the look we want to use the
home component in this component and the
way we do that is by importing it at the
top so the way we can do that is by
seeing import and then we want to put
here in the name of our component and
that is this thing right here home
component so let's copy that and go back
here so we want to import this and then
we want to say where we're importing it
from and that is from this file right
here home component so that is in a dot
forward slash to say well in the root
folder that I'm currently in right and
then forward slash home because in the
whole folder forward slash and then it's
just going to be index and the reason I
put in index is because we have an index
file right here in this whole folder and
if we take a look at that you can see
what this is doing is exporting
everything from the whole component ok
which is this ring thing right here so
it's exporting this
right so now we're importing from here
which is getting this class right here
and now we can use it in this app
component all right so let's save that
now and see if this works
and it probably still won't work let's
just refresh and find out and nope it
still doesn't work and that's because we
need to do one more thing in here in
sorry in the app component yet we've
imported that component right there so
it knows to expect it however we need to
do one more thing and that is to say you
need to expect a certain directive
because this thing right here is a
directive and a directive is something
that just tells angular to do something
we're going to look at directives a bit
later on but just know for now that this
is a directive so we have to tell this
component as well as important this
thing also expect this directive uphol
so how do we do that well we just come
down here in the component and we go
inside the decorator and then we say
directives column and then this takes an
array and it's going to be the home
component right here it's going to look
in this home component for the directive
so now if we save and go to a browser we
get an error and that's because I put
directive and not directives save that
now and this should work and there we go
so now we see whole works so what we've
done now is nested a component in this
app component so going back to the
diagram we have this route component and
we've nested the home component beneath
it and we've nested it by telling the
route component look expect a home
component and expect the whole component
directive in your view file alright so
that's how we next components so just to
go over it one more time we have this
app component file which is our route
component that's our entire application
component
then within that we have nested this
whole component right here in the whole
directory we create this component and
this component is called home component
right and it has this selector so what
we've done is we placed that selector in
the app component view right there
so we say whatever you come across this
now you should replace this tag with the
content of the home component view right
and in order for that to work we had to
go into the app component type script
file and we had to import the whole
component so that it could use it in
this component and also import this
directive or rather tell this component
that we're going to use this home
component directive okay so that's how
we nest components any questions feel
free to leave those down below otherwise
I'm going to see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
