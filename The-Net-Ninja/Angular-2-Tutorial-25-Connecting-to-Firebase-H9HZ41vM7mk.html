25th Angela to tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
hook our application up to firebase okay
so in the last tutorial we went ahead
and created this data service right here
which you reach down into the public
folder and grab this data right here in
ninja's Jatin now typically we're going
to want to hook up to some kind of
database instead of just getting Jason
from our server so in this tutorial
we're going to hook this application up
to firebase and grab the data from there
instead so the first thing you want to
do is head to firebase google.com
yep this is a Google product it taps
itself as a back-end as a service which
basically means we can use it as a
database to help with authentication for
storage hosting etc now in this series
I'm just going to talk about the
database side of things I am going to do
a whole firebase series in the future
where I talk about all of these
different things as well but for now
we're just going to concentrate on
hooking our application up to the
database so if you've not already got an
account just click get started for free
and create one otherwise click go to
console and this is going to take you to
the console where it's going to list all
of your projects now I kind of prepped a
project already but I thought instead
what I'll do is create a new one from
scratch to show you what I do so I click
this button right here create new
project give it a name so I'm going to
call this nn4 nettinger
- angular and then my region is United
Kingdom click create project and this is
going to spin up this project for you
and then redirect you to the forge or
what was known the forge at one point
it's basically where you can control
your application okay so these are all
the different things we can do in our
application like I say for now I'm just
going to concentrate on this database it
right here so let's click that and the
first thing I want to do is head over to
the rules tab right here
and then what we want to do is set read
and write to true for both of these here
so there's going to be no kind of issues
when we're writing or reading from this
database in a real world application you
might not want to do this but for now
this is fine let's click publish and
then go back to data so Phi of X is a
little bit like MongoDB in that it's in
no SQL database
meaning we work with collections and
objects rather than tables so this is
our database right here and we can add
different fields to it now we can either
add these fields manually by clicking
these our child things or we can import
some JSON ourselves which is what I am
going to do so to do that I'm going to
go to these little three dots and click
that import JSON and then click the
Browse then you want to navigate to
where we created that JSON file core
ninjas in the last tutorial double click
that and we're going to import that
jason up here so now we have these four
different objects in here okay so if we
click open them we can see we've got
Yoshi Ryu crystal and shot cool so now
we have that data how do we pump it into
our application well what we need to do
is first of all grab this URL right here
so I'm going to just grab that and copy
it to my clipboard and all we're going
to do is hook this up in our application
so back in our service I'm going to get
rid of this ninjas Jason and replace it
with this URL right here but that's not
enough I need to do dots jason at the
end of it okay and that's going to
return back to us the jason so if I save
this right now and then head over to the
browser those ninjas output right here
and just to test that this has worked
let's go and change the belt color of
one of these dudes let's change Yoshi to
yellow so it's the first one let's
change that to a yellow click enter and
that's going to change it right there
and now if we go back here and refresh
we can see that this has updated as well
now we have a yellow belt instead so
that is how we hook up to 5x and how we
can load in data from there instead of a
JSON file on our server in the next
tutorial I'm going to go into this a
little bit more and show you how we can
post data to firebase as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
