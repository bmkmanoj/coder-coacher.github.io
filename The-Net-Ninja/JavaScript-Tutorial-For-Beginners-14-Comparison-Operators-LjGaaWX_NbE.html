JavaScript for beginners lesson 14 and
in this video we're going to talk about
comparison operators Wow alright and
gang so in the last couple of lessons
we've been looking at if statements and
else if statements and essentially what
they do is control the flow of a
document and which exit conditions if
those conditions are met then we output
some code if those conditions are not
met or the false then we output some
different code ok so it looks something
like this if condition and then block
here of code and this condition would be
something like if X is greater than 5
right now this thing here is a
comparison operator we're comparing X
with 5 and there's many different
comparison operators that we can use
within this evaluation between the
brackets so that's what this lesson is
all about I'm going to show you some
different comparison operators so that
you can use them in your logical
workflow so we've already seen the
greater than if we first declare a
variable a simpler VAR x equals 5 right
and we can say X is greater than 4
because it is and that will return true
if we say X is greater than 5 which is
not it is 5 it will return false okay
now what if we want to say it's great to
2 or equal to 5 well we can do that we
can say X greater to or equal to 5 and
because it is 5 then it will be true all
right and we could say if X is greater
to or equal to 4 that's us or two
because it's greater to or equal to 4
and we have the same for less than we
could say is X less than 5 no that's
false what is X less than or equal to 5
true okay
so they are the less than equal to and
greater than equal to comparison
operators now some more we have that
we've already seen is the double equals
remember the single equals is the
assignment operator which we use for
declaring variables the double equals is
the comparison operator which we use to
compare two numbers so we could say
something like is X equal to 4 that's
false but is X
equals five well that's true okay
there's also something called the triple
equal comparison operator and we'll use
this to check the value and type okay so
we could say X triple equal to five and
that's right and we're saying is it an
integer this isn't a string this is a
number right so we're saying is first of
all the value equals five well yet and
is the type is it a number equal to five
well yet again but if we read eclair x
and this time we set it to a string of
five okay so now X is the string of five
we can still say double equals we can
still compare X to be five and that will
still return true now what's happening
here is the double equals is just
checking the value so even though this
is a number and this is the string the
values are the same so it's quite
lenient however I don't like to rely on
this I always like to use the triple
equals because then I know I'm dealing
with a number or a string so I'd always
say is X triple equal to five and this
time it's false and that's because the
type does not match this is a number and
this is a string if I were to say X
triple equals to the string five then
this would be true because it's matching
the number and the string okay so there
the equals comparisons I'm just going to
read eclair this back to normal five
number and then finally I want to show
you the negation operator and that is
simply this exclamation mark and we put
that in front of an equal sign so we
want to check that X is not equal to
four
okay so this is saying it I want to
check if X is not equal to four okay and
that returns true because this is true X
is not equal to four
okay if we were to say X is not equal to
5 then that's false and same again if we
add another equal sign we'll do the type
as well so we can save that and because
they're both numbers this is false if I
was to change x equals two the string
again five and I put X is not equal to
five
this time it's true because
even though the value is 5 yeah the type
is not number the type is string of X ok
so again I always like to use this one
the double one rather than a single ok
so they my friends are the comparison
operators what I would suggest is you go
back and try a few of these out with
different if statements and and in the
next lesson I'm going to show you some
logical operators that we can use in
conjunction with these to make our if
statements a little bit more complex so
if you have any questions about this so
far feel free to comment down below I'll
answer all of those otherwise if you
