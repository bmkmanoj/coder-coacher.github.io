JavaScript for beginners lesson 4 where
to put your JavaScript that's coming up
ah alright guys so in the last video you
saw me do this grip right here at the
bottom of the body tag and that's fine
okay if I had a little script like this
and it was just a one page only I'd put
it at the bottom of the body tag for
that page absolutely fine and I've even
seen other people put this wherever the
hell they like on that page up here or
in the head someone like this however I
would advise against this and I'll show
you why the HTML page is loaded from top
to bottom okay so if it comes across it
here in head or here at the top of the
body then it's going to run this
JavaScript first before loading any of
the content in and in certain
circumstances that can have a negative
effect on your webpage this is one of
them I'm going to show you that now I'm
going to save this in Chrome in brackets
and go to a browser so this is the page
however if i refresh now that the script
is at the top watch this the alert comes
up without loading the page so I don't
know what web page I'm on here could be
on anything so once I click OK then it
loads the rest of the page now if I was
to go back to the code and take this
script and put it right at the bottom
here this now the content above should
load first so let's give it another
whirl let's save it and go again to the
browser refresh this and now you can see
in the background this comes up the
content so I know where I am and then
the alert pops up so that is a much
better way of doing things
okay so small scripts like this only for
one page just paste at the bottom of
your content just before the closing
body tag now in some circumstances you
are going to find links at the top here
and there are occasions when that's
absolutely fine
when the JavaScript is asynchronous and
it loads in conjunction with your HTML
page and I'll get into that later on but
for now we're just getting to the habit
of putting your scripts right at the
bottom here so it has no effect on the
content now that is only
for small script okay if you had a
larger script which was maybe 10 20 30
or even more lines of code you're going
to want to take that script and put it
in an external file so that a it doesn't
mess up your content page in your HTML
here big if you're using it on multiple
pages then you only have to update it
once and see it's just more tidy needs
here meteor I don't know what that word
is neater and it keeps things in a
logical place all right so I'm going to
show you how to do that now so instead
of putting this here I've delete it I'll
just copy that in fact and I'm going to
create a new file I'm going to call that
test is OKs there we go and I'm gonna
paste it in there and save it now we'll
come back to that in a second but here
just going to scoot this back up there
now we've linked that J's file in just
like we would a CSS file okay but
instead of putting it in the head we
keep it down here in the body at the
bottom so the way we link it in is by
having our script tags like that and
just put in source equals and then test
j s so this link is relative if it was
in a folder we'd have to put the folder
name in here and you know all about
paths from the HTML course if you don't
go and check that out first of all
and once we've linked that in this will
then come down here find the test J's
file and then pass that code it will run
the code in here and we don't need the
script tags in here because the browser
already knows it's a script from this
and for the fact that it's got a J s
ending okay all JavaScript files have a
dot J s ending so that's how we link of
the script and just to prove that this
still works I'm going to save this and
open it up in a browser give this a
refresh and boom there we go guys
still works so here are the rules if you
have a small script just for one page
feel free to and bed that script at the
bottom of your page otherwise
externalize it and put it in a separate
file then link to that file at the
bottom of the page
using this script tag reference okay in
some cases you may want to put the
script up here when the script is
asynchronous
but generally speaking we're going to
put our scripts down here like this all
right so that's where you write your
code if you have any questions about
this feel free to throw some comments
down below answer all of those otherwise

or like them and I'll see you guys in
the next one when we're going to take a
look at Google Chrome's
