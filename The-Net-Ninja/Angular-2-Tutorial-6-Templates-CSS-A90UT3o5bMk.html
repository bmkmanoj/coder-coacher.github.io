sixth angular tea tutorial and in this
video we're going to go over how
templates and CSS work all right there
so I've still got the server running by
typing ng serve in this command line
right here so it still ruined over here
in the browser and as we saw in the last
lesson
when we created our first project using
the angular CLI it went ahead and
created our first root component for us
called app we've got app component CSS
app component HTML which is the view and
app component es which is the typescript
file which controls the logic of this
component so I said in the last tutorial
it's referencing this link right here
this app component HTML for the template
URL which is this file right here so it
knows to output this when it finds this
tag okay and it finds this tag in the
index file right here so that's how it
knows how to output this file but
instead of referencing an external link
and external template if we've only got
a small template which we have right
here then we could go ahead and get rid
of this URL section of the property and
just say template instead and then
instead of passing through a URL which
is passed through a string of HTML so
I'm going to do that right now I'm going
to say h1 I'm going to output the name
which is ninja down here and close the
h1 tag and if I save this now that
hopefully it's going to reload in this
browser and it's going to this time
output this template instead of this
thing right here okay cool so now we see
a ninja in the browser so I typically
like to use template URL unless it's
just a small little string of data like
this this is fine however if we're using
a large document of HTML then I
typically like to use template URL as
the property and then supply the path to
that view so it's app component
dot html' okay cool so let's save that
and let's head over to this view just to
see what it's outputting we're going to
get rid of this name right now and
instead what I'm going to do is just
write a few different tags some basic
tags
I'll give it a header and then first of
all we're going to put that h1 back in
and we'll output the title again and
then underneath the title what we'll do
is a simple now bar like that and we're
going to fill this up later on in the
tutorial series and just create
installed content now some dummy content
just so we've got something on the web
page so let's copy that and do one more
link and then we'll do a section
underneath the header give this an ID
equal to main and then we'll dump our
main content there later on when we
create new components okay so this is
just the root component at the minute
that I'm editing and this is going to
appear on every page so it's okay being
in the root component if we wanted to we
could split this nav out into another
component but really there's no need to
add a minute
so I'm just going to save that for now
and then this should update on the right
cool so now we have that header and we
have this URL right here with the two
links so how do we work with CSS well I
mentioned before that we have a CSS file
for each different component and if I
write styles in here it's only going to
target things in this component so why
not target this h1 just for a laugh
let's make this a color all right so if
I save that now and refresh this then
you're going to see that text change to
red however I don't really like using
these CSS files I prefer to have my own
CSS file in the public folder which we
can reference and put all of our styles
in there so I'm going to get rid of this
for now and I'm going to save it and
instead what I'm going to do is come to
my public folder right here
with a right-click and create a new file
and I'm going to call these Styles dot
CSS and then anything that we write in
here we is going to be output in this
distribution folder right here okay so
we just need to make a reference to this
in the index file which I'm going to do
right here so just before the head
closes I'll say link href equals and
then all we need to do is /to stay at
the root then styles dot CSS and when we
do that is going to look in this public
folder and find whatever we have in here
okay so that's pretty cool let's in rel
equals stylesheet and type equals set
forward slash CSS and then we've got
we've linked up to our star C right now
so now anything we put in here is going
to target the whole application now not
just one component and I prefer to work
that way keep all my Styles together so
if I again say h1 and this time color
purple save it and then hopefully it's
going to refresh automatically over here
and now we can see that's also work and
targeted this h1 cool so that is how we
work with templates and CSS in angular 2
any questions leave those down below
otherwise I'm going to see you in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
