sixth and final html5 forms styling
tutorial and in this video we're gonna
go over some simple and validation
styles okay so you're probably seen on a
lot of websites when you enter something
into an input field like this when it is
valid it will kind of give you some
feedback to say that it's valid like a
little tick or something all right are a
lot of times it goes green to say yeah
this is valid now we're going to do
something like that in this tutorial and
I'm to do it we're going to use two
things first of all in the index dot
HTML we would have noticed before this
span with a class of tick so we're gonna
give this a background image of that
little tick image which is right here
when this field is valid we're also
going to make this field have a white
border we're going to make this icon
right here
white as well to say when it's valid
okay so we're going to do that by using
the valid pseudo class so you see right
here it says required I'm required now
this is html5 in action it's doing its
own kind of front end validation for you
so if you enter something which is valid
the browser is going to know that and we
can use the valid pseudo class to style
something that is valid a field that is
valid okay so how do we do now well
first of all what I'm gonna do is just
style the input fields when the
following we're going to give this a
border first of all so we'll say input
type equals email pseudo class valid
okay and we're also going to do the same
thing for the type equals phone number
so let's copy that and paste it down
below change this to phone number and
then stylus own all we're gonna do is
give it a border two pixels solid and
white so let's save that now you'll
notice straight away this one goes white
right here okay so this one down here if
we delete that it's still not going
white
and that's because I stupidly call it
phone number when it is in fact
telephone okay so now it should be white
cool all right so the next thing I want
to do when these fields are valid and
make these icons white now remember from
this inputs dot PNG we had those little
white icons underneath the black one so
all we need to do is change the
background position when an input field
is valid to show this icon and this icon
instead of the black ones so let's do
that first of all let's grab it at this
selector and paste it down here and
we'll change the background position of
this one first of all and we're going to
change it to seven pixels along the
x-axis and minus 22 pixels on the Y so
let's save that and now we see the white
icon there if I delete this goes back to
black but as soon as I type in my email
which is valid then it goes to white
cool now we want to do the same thing
with the phone so let's copy this dude
and paste it down here change this to
telephone not phone number all right and
change this y-coordinate to minus 97
pixels press save and now we get that
white telephone number so let's delete
this and Twitter number and we go cool
so now what we want to do is also show
those ticks so again we're going to use
these two selectors right here these
valid selectors and we're going to paste
them down here and then we're also going
to use the adjacent selector so that's
close and we're going to look for this
thing right here because this is
adjacent to this okay so when an input
field is valid and it has this as an
adjacent elements if you like then we're
going to style this and that class is
tick so let's say plus dot tick and then
down here plus dot tick and we're going
to stir those up and then we're going to
do that is by giving it a background
image first of all of this tick thing
right here
so I say background is going to be URL
and then it's going to be image at
forward slash tip
dot PNG and then I'm gonna say sensor
background size this is going to be in
100% it's gonna display as block the
width is going to be 20 pixels and the
height is going to be 20 pixels we're
going to float it to the left so it
entities up against the input field and
then finally we're going to give it a
margin of 10 pixels all the way around
so let's save this to see what happens
okay not much at the minute so let's
just get rid of this little error I made
there save that okay and the tick still
isn't showing and that's because I've
not spelled background correctly okay
cool so let's save that now and now we
get those ticks but they are in the
wrong position and that's because these
things right here they're not being
floated left so the tick is going to the
next line automatically so let's go back
up to those let's float them left so
it's these things right here email and
telephone and we're going to say float
left I'm gonna say clear both as well
let's save that and now we get those
ticks to the left cool so now let's take
this off and let's type something here
Shawn Shawn calm never go now it's valid
okay so pretty cool and I know this is
kind of like a basic and validation
style but I just wanted to show you the
techniques we can use this valid pseudo
class to apply different styles to a
field when it is valid so there we go
guys that pretty much concludes our
farms tutorial any questions leave those
down below otherwise I'm going to see
you in the very next series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
