and guitar tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how you can flock
a repo on github in order to contribute
to some kind of open source project so
then sometimes when a developer makes
some kind of new project or framework
what they do is open sourcing which
basically means they make their source
code freely available to all the
developers online now to do that they'd
probably use a service like github and
create a public repository to host their
code on so that all the developers can
see it and that's really cool because it
means that other developers can then
contribute to that code work on it in
the wrong time develop new features and
overall the project is going to move
along much quicker than if just one
person was developing it so that's
really cool so it works a little bit
differently than if you were working in
a team on a repository and I'm going to
show you how that works now so I want
you to imagine we find this cool kind of
JavaScript framework online called
awesome J source I've just made this
repo on a different dormant account for
now and we'll take a look at this and we
know that we can improve it right so
what we want to do is download this repo
to our computer make some changes and
then push these changes to this repo
right here but we can't just do that
because we don't really have access to
this repository it's not being granted
to us because if you want this
repository and this framework you
wouldn't just want to give anyone access
to it so they can just upload branches
all the time or even update the master
branch you don't want to allow them to
do that so instead what we need to do is
something a little bit different so if
we come across some kind of framework
there's someone else owns and it's open
source what we can do is we can fork
that repository and basically what that
means is it's going to create a copy of
this repository from this account from
net ninja ones account to our own
account so let's fork that I'm going to
click that fork button right there and
it says forking nettinger one and this
should just take a few seconds and now
you can see it successfully thought that
so that now on my account right here I
have this repository and
now what I can do is I can clone this
repository to my desktop so what I'm
going to do is come to the client or
download and I'm going to click this to
copy to the clipboard
and we've seen how to clone a repository
to our local hard drive all we need to
do is come to our terminal and we need
to navigate to where we want to clone it
I'm going to go up one level and I'm
going to clone it right here so I say
git clone and then paste this URL in so
that's going to clone it now to my hard
drive and then what I'm going to do is
go into that directory so that directory
is going to be called awesome Jas sauce
so we'll say CD balsam - Jo - sauce and
we're going to go into this directory
okay cool so now we can say something
like git status just to make sure
everything is fine yet what on the
master branch in Seoul today
so now what we can do is we can open
this project in Atem over here so I'm
just going to click all to get that menu
and then go to open or add project
folder and then I'm going to go to
recording and it's called
awesome Jaya sauce so I'm going to open
up this repo right here cool so now we
have access to the main JavaScript file
and also this source stuff in here so
what I'm going to do is just come under
here and I think what I want to do is
console.log your prep website is now
awesome so this is my addition to this
library which was already really really
good nothing so basically all I've done
is make that one change now normally
what I do is I take out on your branch
to make this change and then push the
branch up etc but this time what I'm
going to do is just stay on the master
branch just for simplicity and for the
sake of this tutorial so anyway now
we've made this change what I want to do
is add this change you need to say git
add and then I'm just going to do a dot
add everything then we'll commit it and
we'll leave a message to say improved
awesome Jas
and then what I'm going to do is push
this now to the origin
remember when we clone a repo like we
cloned the one on our account it
automatically sets up that alias origin
right so it knows where to push too so
origin and we're pushing the master
branch so once I push that up I should
be able to see it on the github account
but let's just give this a second to
give us some feedback cool that's all
done now let's go to the github account
so now if I go into the source folder
and I go to awesome j/s I can see that
the Eddy I created is now there okay I
remember this is all on my accounts this
isn't the original repo for the
framework I thought this to my account
cloned this repository and then uploaded
the new addition to my repository on my
account and now what I want to do is I
want to contribute this change to the
original framework the original
repository so how the hell do what is
that well let's just go back to the main
page of this fault repository and we're
going to see this button right here new
pull request so if we're happy with what
we've done and we want to add this
functionality we want to contribute this
to the main repository what we can do is
click this new pull request and that's
going to check if this can be merged so
it can and what I want to do now is say
create pull request right here so it's
going to pull it into the master branch
of this thing over here nettinger one
right because that's what we're pulling
into this is the original framework
where the repository is located so I can
leave a comment here if I wanted to blah
blah blah and I can go down and I can
create this pull request
so once I've created this notice I
cannot merge this not from here because
I'm not allowed to do that if anyone
could just merge into this then anyone
could just enter at any time without the
original creators knowledge so the
original creator is going to have access
to who is allowed to merge basically and
he has to review or she has to review
the changes so I've opened this account
in a different browser and if i refresh
now and if I take a look at the pull
request I can see there's one pull
request right there so someone wants to
make a contribution so I can click on
this and I can view what they want to
contribute I can see the file has
changed and I can see we've added this
console that log thing right here so if
I'm happy with this
what I can do is I can write a comment
if I want I can say yeah good don't know
what action that was okay I can merge
this into the main branch the master
branch so I'm going to confirm this
merge they've made this framework ten
times better and now if I go to this
original repository I'm going to notice
that the awesome.js file has now been
updated with my contribution I feel so
special
okay so let me know that's how you
basically contribute to some kind of
open source project now every different
open source project is going to have
different guidelines for contributing
and normally they're going to have some
kind of file in their repository called
contributing contribution or
contributing dot MD so I'd advise you
always to read through those first of
all because there will be some kind of
guidelines you have to adhere to and if
by the way you just want to play around
and fork a repository I've created one
on my account and you can do that and
that is called git playlist so if you
want to fork this and just add some
different commits you know try and pull
requests into it if I like it then I'll
merge it at the minute it's just a ninja
JavaScript file with a control that log
so it's entirely a blank canvas for you
to play with so yeah feel free to go
ahead and add to this imagine it's some
kind of cool new framework and do what
you want and yeah have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
