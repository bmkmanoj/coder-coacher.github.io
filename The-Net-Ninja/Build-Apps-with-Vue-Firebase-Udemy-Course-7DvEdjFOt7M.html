here with a very quick update because I
have finally finally released my udemy
course build web apps with UJS and
firebase it's been in a long time in the
making and I was up late last night
making sure I could release it for this
morning so in this course what will we
be doing we'll be learning all of the
basics in view j/s it's kind of like an
updated version of the view JS series I
have on this YouTube channel but it's
going to come bundled with loads of
extras too namely we'll be making three
real-world projects with firebase as
well so we'll be hooking the two
together now firebase acts as a back-end
to our view applications and we'll be
looking at things like the cloud fire
store to store all of our data in
authentication so that users can sign in
and log out of our applications cloud
functions which enables us to run
server-side code without managing our
own server and also we'll be deploying
all of our applications to firebase
using firebase hosting as well now one
of the projects we'll be creating is
this geo ninjas where we can login or
logout signup all of that jazz and it's
a geolocation based social app so it's
going to take our geo coordinates POTUS
on the map and also plot all the other
users on the map as well and we can go
to the different users and interact with
them so that's just one of the projects
will be creating so I'd love to see you
all there the links in the course is
going to be down below and if you do
sign up make sure you do so with this
coupon code ninja whitey 18y T stands
for YouTube by the way that is going to
ensure you get it for the discounted
price of nine pound 99 instead of the
original price now the link to the
course is going to be down below it
would be awesome to see you all there
one more thing before I leave just
because I'm doing udemy doesn't mean I'm
gonna leave YouTube I am never gonna
make like this channel in any shape or
form you're still going to be getting
all the free content that you've been
used to over the last two or three years
just as regularly and in fact I'm
working on a series that will be coming
up very shortly as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
