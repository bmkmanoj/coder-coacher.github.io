twelfth of UJS tutorial and in this
video I want to show you how we can loop
through arrays and objects with the
directive v4 okay then so so far in this
view instance we've been making data
which is pretty simple like this and a
property which is just a single value is
strict now that's cool but I want to
move on to some more complex types of
data in particular arrays so I've got
two property cell appeared characters
and ninjas
they are both arrays the first one is an
array of strings the second one is an
array of objects so I'm going to show
you how we can output this data to the
browser and we can cycle through this
data in our template using the directive
at v4 so let's save this and move over
to the index.html so say we want to
output every single element in that
characters array right then yeah we
could use something like this we could
say characters then zero then we could
do characters and then one and you know
go through each one and so we've listed
every single element in this array which
is fine hey what if we don't know how
many items are in it right that we won't
know where to go up to here and B if
there's a lot of items in the array then
this is just a waste of space right
because we're just repeating ourselves
over and over so a better way to do this
would be to use a directive called v4
which is gonna loop through and a reg
forest so how do we do this well to
demonstrate I'm just going to create a
ul and then inside and Li now the way I
want to do this is to output a single
character from this array this top one
in each Li right so there'll be a
character named each Li going down now
instead of writing for allies all I need
to do is use a directive called V - 4
right and set that equal to what I want
to loop through now I want to loop
through the characters right so what I
need to say is character in characters
so this right here this is the name of
the data property
here and in each cycle round when we're
looping through we're going to refer to
a single character right so we can make
this up this could be X this could be Y
but basically this is a single item in
this array and each time we loop through
using this V for that single item is
going to be referenced using this
character variable okay so we're just
saying character in characters so now we
can output this thing racking at this
single character so I'm going to copy
that
I'm going to paste it in so now if I
saved it and check it out in a browser
we're going to see all of these
characters listed right here and if we
inspect you're going to see each one of
these is going to be in an li tag so
what this has done has looped through
our array right here and it created an
li tag for every single element in that
array and that's because we're using
this v4 directive to cycle through that
array and then we're out put in the item
in that array each time we cycle through
okay so let's do another simple example
this time I want to cycle through these
things right here so I'm going to do
another as well and then inside this
another Li unlike before we're going to
say V - 4 to cycle through and this time
we're going to say ninja in ninjas
because ninjas is the name of this ting
right here and then Ninja is going to
refer to a single item each time around
as we go through your row so this time
we can't just output ninja because this
is an object right each item in this
array right here is an object and what's
going to happen if we output this to a
browser well let's have a look we get
this which is not very nice so what I'm
going to do is get each property from
this object right here and output each
property now we know we've got a name
property and we know we've got an age
property so all I need to do really you
say ninja dot name and then I'm going to
do a little dust
and then I'll do ninja dot gauge all
right so we're using this template
syntax right here to output two separate
variables the name property on the ninja
and the age property on the ninja
because that's how we're storing it name
and age so if I save this now let's
check it out again this time we're
getting those variables output onto the
screen a lot nicer
so another thing I'd like to show you is
how we can output the index of this item
and by index I mean the position in the
array so this has an index of 0 this an
index of 1 this an index of 2 right and
then 0 1 2 3 so how can we output that
index to the browser well all we need to
do right here is do our parentheses
around ninja right and then next to
ninja we can pass through the index so
now that's going to refer to whatever
position this ninja is in the array so I
can output that as well by saying index
and then I'm going to do a dot here and
save that that dot is just so it comes
after the number you don't need that and
we view this in a browser now we can see
0 1 2 and I can do the same for the top
one right here we could enclose this in
parentheses and add the index here and
also here now preview this in a browser
this is going to do the same thing ok so
that's how we output the index now I
want to show you one more thing first in
fact two more things first of all what
if we don't want to output Ally text
well we can do this in whatever we want
if we want we could do a div tag and
then we could say v4 is equal and again
I'm going to do the same thing as this
so I'm just going to copy and paste and
then inside this div say we want for
example a h3 and that is going to output
the index first of all
and got now what we'll do is output the
name as well so we'll say ninja name and
then underneath the h3 we might want to
output the Apes order a pizza and we'll
output ninja age okay
so this time around we're not using Li
tags we're using a div tag and it's
going to cycle through the div tags and
create a new div with this kind of
template inside it for each ninja so if
we save this now and check out in a
browser now we get something like this
okay they re inspect this over here you
can see there's a separate div for each
different ninja which is okay but this
div right here in my opinion it's just
kind of extra markup that we don't
really need yeah we're using it to link
through these items but it doesn't need
to be in the HTML so what we can do is
instead of using div if we don't want
this to be in HTML and we just want it
to be a series of h3 and peas then all
we need to do is change this to
templates and UGS is going to look at
this and it's going to say hey this is a
template tag and it doesn't want me to
output this tag to the browser all it
wants me to do is take the template
inside this and output that to the
browser so we're still going to cycle
through because we've got v4 but all
we're going to do is output what's
inside to the browser so if we save this
now we still get the same kind of output
but this time those do tags are not
around so this is kind of cleaner markup
okay so now I want to show you one more
thing we've looped through both of these
arrays right but I want to show you how
we can also loop through objects because
in this array we have three objects
right and each object has got two values
two different key and value pairs so one
key one for each object to loop through
every single key value pair so instead
of saying for example when we said ninja
name and ninja age what if we don't
necessarily know the name of these
properties and we just want to output
each one to the browser without doing
name or age well we can do that as well
so what I'm going to do is another
template
first of all and then inside this I'm
going to do another v4 and this you can
say V 4 equals ninja being ninjas so
first of all we're cycling through the
array again just like we did over here
but without the index right so we're
cycling through this array and each one
of these is gonna refer to that single
ninja so each time around it here now we
have access to that single ninja object
so what we want to do now is cycle
through that single object right and we
can use another v4 to do that so I'm
going to create a div right here and I'm
going to say V - 4 is equal to and then
this is going to be Val key I'm going to
explain this in a minute in ninja ok so
right now what we're doing is taking
that single ninja object and we're
cycling through it so it looks like we
cycled through the array this time
because we have access to that single
object in the array we're now cycling
through that single object and what
we're doing is we're getting the value
and the key of each of those objects or
properties rather in the object so we're
getting the value and the key each time
around and we're cycling through each
one of those so now what we can do is
output those separately without knowing
the name of those keys right so I could
say P and I'll put the key and then -
and I'm also going to output the value
okay so if I save that now check this
out in the browser now we get the key
and the value the key and the value
okay so this right here all of this is
one object and we cycle through the keys
and the values and without put them in
each individual object each individual
ninja okay and we've done that for all
ninjas because recycling through each
ninja in the array as well okay so that
is how we cycle through data in UJS
using v4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
