way and we've learned a lot about jungle
along the way and essentially what we've
done is create pretty much a fully
functioning blog at the end of it but
it's still looking a pretty crappy so
why not style this mother up so I'm
gonna be using the chrome developer
tools to style this up and then just
copy all of the styles from here and
paste them in the editor when we're done
so to open up this you can press f12 and
then navigate to source is to get your
styles and these things right here these
are the base styles we added it way way
back in like episode 3 or 4 or 5
something like that we're just going to
build on from these now so the first
thing I'd like to do is grab this a
wrapper thing right here which contains
all of our content it's on the header
and this div right here and I want to
make it centralized so that instead of
sitting way out here on the left is
centralized in the middle of the page
somehow so let's grab that class we'll
go to sources and then say dots wrapper
this is gonna have a max width of 960
pixels and also a margin of 0 top and
bottom Auto left and right that will do
the kind of centering of the content on
the page and you can see that right now
so we have this margin on the left and
the content will go to about here
something like that a sit in this
central column alright so now we've done
that let's open up our dev tools again
and underneath that we want to style up
the h1 that's in the wrapper
so we'll say div dot wrapper because the
h1 and what a style is this thing right
here inside the div not the header so
div dot wrapper h1 and then inside text
align it's gonna be Center so that's
it's in the center now we also want to
say margin is going to be around a
hundred pixels top and bottom and then
it's gonna be auto left and right and
then the font size there's gonna be 2.4
m/s just to make it a little bit bigger
okay so now I want to style up the
header over here so we'll grab that
header tag and I'm gonna do this
bleh this as grid now if you want to
learn about CSS grid feel free to check
out my great tutorial series I'm not
gonna explain this in Bali's probably
going to be a seven or eight minute
video so display grid grid templates
- comms is gonna be one F R and that
stands for fraction one F R so two equal
columns and the padding is going to be
twenty pixels top and bottom zero left
and right so that's the header so now we
can see this is split up into a grid and
then each take it up a column of 50%
essentially all right so this nav right
here I don't want it to sit on the left
side I want it to sit over here so let's
grab that nav element and will say
justify self and this will be end so it
moves way over to the right that looks a
little bit better now we just need to
style up the Li tags inside the nav so
now if Li and this is gonna display us
in line - block so they sit next to each
other and we get rid of those little
spots if you like we also want to say
margin - left
is gonna be 20 pixels to spread them out
a little bit okay now the next thing
we've got this button right here I want
to style that slightly differently so
I'll say nav button and this will have a
background of tada
none cool and also we want to give this
a color of white and get rid of those
quotations we don't need those okay so
white for the color we also want to say
cursor is pointer just so that when you
hover over it we get the hand like so it
always like that effect better and I'd
like to also say the border is 0-2 strip
out that border and then the font size
is gonna be I don't know 1.2 m/s or
something like that or maybe just one M
so let's get rid of that point - like so
so it's the same size as a new article
alright so now we have the button sorted
out for now the next thing I'd like to
do is the articles themselves so
if we right-click over here we can see
these have a class of articles right
here and each individual one has a class
of article so I'm gonna style up these
dudes next so let's give ourselves a bit
of space and we'll say articles first of
all that's the surrounding container
surrounding everything and then this is
also going to display as a grid now the
idea here is that we're going to show
one two three four or something next to
each other maybe three so we're doing a
grid to display them that way so again
we need our grid template - columns like
so this time is gonna be three columns
all one of our 1 fraction each so
they're all the same size
now there's only two articles at the
minute which is why we get this gap over
here but when there's three they'll
equally take up this room okay
so the next thing is the grid - gap so
the gap between the elements and that is
going to be 30 pixels all right cool so
let's do the individual articles now so
dots article and then the padding of
each one is going to be around 10 pixels
and then each one will have a border of
one pixel we'll say solid and this is
the hex code zero zero DB a zero and we
get that kind of green thing there here
which is similar to this helmet I don't
think it's exactly the same but it will
do for now anyway the next thing is
going to be the position property which
will be a relative and I'll tell you why
we do that later and then the padding -
bottom is gonna be around 40 pixels all
right so this is looking better already
the next thing I want to do is style up
these things right here now these I
think are h2s yes they are so let us
grab those which is the article h2 and
in size will say font size is going to
be a 1.2 m/s so just reduce that a
little bit alright so for now I think
that's looking pretty good for this kind
of homepage so let's just copy all this
stuff we've done so
Farmar into our text editor in the
styles so that we don't lose it
we'll save that let's just try
refreshing over here to make sure that
those work and it's not working so hard
refresh now it works cool so we can go
to an individual article now and stand
up one of these bad boys which is
looking pretty messy at the minute we
still get that border because this has
got a class of article but the rest of
it is looking pretty shocking so let's
go right down to the bottom and style
this up so this is all sitting in a div
called article detail I think if we open
this up yep article detail so let's copy
that bad boy and over here let's do a
new rule for article detail and then we
want the article which is inside it so
dot article because there's a class of
article inside it right so this inside
will say we want a padding because
there's a pattern of about ten pixels
around here at the minute of zero just
to strip that out so that the the image
is flush to the edge all right that's
all we need to do in there really the
next thing is to style this image inside
it so again we'll say article detail
article and then IMG and this will have
a max - width of 100% because right now
it's scrolling way off the page I wanted
to sit nicely inside this container so
we'll say 100% for the max width of that
banner which is looking loads better
already
okay so next I'll style up this h2 right
here so again article detail and then
article and then h2 and inside we'll
just say text align it's going to be in
the center the margin will be a room de
beauté 20 pixels top and bottom I think
that will look okay auto left and right
then we'll also give this a font - size
of two M's just to make it bigger
standing me face a little bit more
alright so just these two dudes now we
have the h3 which is this thing at the
bottom the date and also this P tag
right here so let's do the
a ch3 first of all article detail
article and then a ch3 and then inside
will say text - a line is going to be
Center like so as that worked nope let's
see why not let's go inside the article
and this is actually a PITA so we don't
need to a ch3 let's just change this to
AP tag now it's fine
everything senses in the middle awesome
so this is looking pretty good now I
want to copy this into the code over
here and there's one more thing I'd like
to do in this video and it is as follows
if I go back to the home page right here
we see these different articles but I'd
like to also output the author of each
article so to do that I'm going to have
to go to the template for article list
now that is in the articles app over
here in the templates and in articles
and it's article list right here so I'd
like to add the author right at the
bottom over there so let's do another P
tag and then inside in fact we'll give
this a class of author so we can style
it differently class equals author then
inside the P tag we want to output the
author so we'll say added by and then in
double curly braces because we're
outputting some data right here we'll
say article which we have access to
remember this thing right here article
dot author dot username okay because we
have access to the author which is on
the article model now remember that is a
foreign key and it references a
particular user and that user has a
property called the username so without
putting that right here so if we save
this now and refresh over here then we
get that at the bottom however again I
just want to star this up so I'm going
to press f12 once more to style up this
thing and then it will place this up
here near the articles maybe somewhere
like this and we'll say article author
and inside we'll say the padding is
going to be 10 pixels
background is going to be that same
green color which was zero zero DB a
zero cool
we also wants you position this
absolutely now this is why I positioned
this thing here relatively because we
want to position this absolutely
relative to the article
so we'll say position absolute and we'd
like to say the right is zero and the
margin or rather the bottom is zero and
the map the margin is also going to be
zero to remove it and that's looking
pretty good let's just change maybe the
color of these things right here because
why is it really standing out to me so
we'll say color and this time it's gonna
be hash 0 F 1 - 1 F alright so now
that's kind of like the blue color of
the background and that is looking
better so one final time let's copy all
this and paste it in these Styles over
here save it and let's take a look at
this so hard refresh everything is
looking a lot better at the minute now
if I log out we can see these things are
still up here well log in then the farms
are still looking pretty cruddy to be
honest so in the next tutorial what
we'll do is style up those forms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
