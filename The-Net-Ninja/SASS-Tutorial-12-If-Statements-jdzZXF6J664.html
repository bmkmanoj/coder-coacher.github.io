twelfth sass tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about if statements
Wow alright then go so if you've got a
programming background then you're
probably going to know what if
statements are they're just control flow
statements whereby we say if something
occurs or rather in a certain condition
is true but then do something okay so we
can apply the same logic to suss to
apply styles dependent on certain
conditions so in the last tutorial what
we did was create this media query right
here okay we said media screen and
max-width
is this variable right here whatever we
pass it through and this media query is
going to look something like this when
it outputs to CSS it's gonna look like
this 600 pixels or something and then
it's gonna play cell content in between
right but sometimes media queries are
not always this simple we sometimes have
a min width as well okay so we could say
and and we could say min width is I
don't know 200 pixels something like
that all right now this mixing right
here is not gonna kind of control this
for us it's a very simple one so we're
going to introduce if statements to show
you how we can apply this one instead
depending on what we pass through here
so obviously if we want a media query
just like this then we're just going to
pass through one argument and that's
going to set that media query for us but
if we want a media query like this we
need to pass through two arguments or
two variables first one and the second
one okay but how does this mix in know
whether we're going to be accepting of
one variable or two variables right it
doesn't so what we can do instead is put
three little dots here and what that
does is say well look I don't know how
many arguments or variables we're going
to be accepting into this mixing but
whatever they are put them into a list
and then we can access that list later
on down here in the mixing okay so if
there's only one then we can use just
one and the way we views it is by seint
and this is a function that we can use
to grab something out of the list but in
brackets we say the list name which is
listing right
here and then we just pass through the
position of that particular variable in
the list now if we pass in a list some
variables if we pass a four and a nine
then this is position one this is
position two this is position three all
right so whatever the first value is
right there is going to be this here
it's going to grab the first value and
that's always going to be applied for
the max width all right the first value
now that if there's just one argument
passed through I want this to apply but
we don't know that so how do we check
well we do a little if statement right
here we say at if and then we can use
another function to find out how large
this list of variables is how many of
them are out and that's called length so
we'll say if the length of them in
brackets the name of this list of
variables which is Arg
if that is equal to one then we'll just
go ahead and we're going to do this
thing right here but we've only got one
variable pass through it's got to be the
max width variable the 600 pixels or
whatever it's going to be and we're just
going to output a simple media query
like this okay if we pass through two
variables we want to do something else
so what I'm going to do is another if
statement right here and I'm going to
say if the length of this list of
variables is equal to two then we're
going to do something different so we're
gonna paste that same thing in again but
this time I'm gonna add on here and mid
width is gonna be mm then arcs or rather
arc - okay so we're saying if we've got
two variables passed through towards
then we're going to create this other
media query which is a little more
complex and this one needs two arguments
so the first one again is going to be
the max width and the second one is
going to be the mint Bertha min width so
right now we're calling this mixing
right here which is passing through one
variable so what that's going to do is
by default it just use the simple media
query and apply that to the match with
you
I want to specify a min wig as well all
I need to do is pass it through here and
we're going to say minimum with 100
pixels okay and then what that would do
is say well okay now there's two
arguments so it skips over the first one
then it finds out that there's two
arguments and it applies this media
query instead so the first one is going
to be applying to the max width and the
second one applied to the min width now
this doesn't really make sense to have a
min width as well on a media query so
I'm just going to take that off and save
it I'm going to save this mixing as well
and what we're going to do is apply this
mixing now to a different rule if you
like all right so the rule I want to
apply it to is going to be up here and
we're going to find a spun which is here
okay so right now this spun is applying
rules to this okay
but if we have a look when we get to a
large screen size it's a little bit
small the text okay so what I want to do
is supply a media query so that large
screens then it's going to be a certain
kind of font size a bigger font size so
what I'm going to do is come down here
and then in here I'm going to say
@include got media query and what I'm
going to do is pass it two variables
this time I remember the first one is
the max width so the max weight I'll
just put something like I don't know
1000 or rather you know 3,000 pixels so
anything up to 3,000 pixels and if
you're not with that like I don't know
some high definition TVs or something
that will do so with an ounce but up to
3000 pixels that's okay that's the max
weight then the min width is going to be
1200 pixels okay so in between these two
sizes right here we're going to apply
the following styles and the style is
just going to be a font size which is
going to be 68 pixels all right so let's
save that now and you can see currently
this is the font size when we make it
larger the font size gets bigger all
right pretty cool so that is how we use
the if statements to check where
we have I don't know a certain length of
argues but we can also use them for
other things as well so there we go guys
any questions feel free to leave those
down below this is the last tutorial of
the series in the future I might do some
more advanced ones but we'll leave it
there for now so don't forget to share
subscribe and like guys and I'm gonna
see you in a very nice tutorial playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
