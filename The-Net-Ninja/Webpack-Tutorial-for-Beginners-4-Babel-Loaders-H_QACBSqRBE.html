fourth webpack tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about Babel
Lotus okay so what is a loader anyway
well when it comes to web pack a loader
can help us perform transformations on
our code so imagine we're creating an
application and we want to use es2015 in
it ah read miss gripped six now we know
that not all browsers can support every
single aspect of es2015 so what we need
to do is transform that es2015 code into
vanilla JavaScript before it's served to
the browser so a babel loader can help
us do that can convert that es2015 code
into normal JavaScript which the browser
does understand and it can also convert
JSX which is a combination of JavaScript
and XML we use that with react in Suva
Nilla JavaScript as well so that's what
we're going to take a look at in this
video I'm going to take a look at the
babel loader to transform some es2015
code into normal JavaScript but there's
loads us for other things as well such
as SAS which we're going to take a look
at in a later tutorial so how do we use
the babel log well those three steps
first of all we've got to install the
babel core and the babel loaded via the
npn into our project so we'll do that
first of all then we have to install any
presets that we're going to be using to
perform transformations for example if
we want to transform es2015 code we have
to install the es2015 preset if we want
to use JSX
and transform that we have to use the
JSX preset so we're going to install
whichever preset we want as well using
NPM too then finally we have to
configure the web config file to tell
web pack to use the babel loader to
transform our code so we're going to
perform all of these three steps now
okay so first of all here's the Babel
website you can find it a babel gesture
io and read more about it there in a
nutshell it says you can use
next-generation JavaScript today so read
that for more information it's pretty
good
so back in our file so far what we've
been doing is compiling just regular
JavaScript
say I want to use es2015 well let's give
this a whirl
so in es2015 we can use constants so I'm
going to say Const and then give this a
name I'll just say message equals and
then we'll copy this dude right here and
paste it up here all right
much older exports equals message like
so now if this was run with web pack in
the bundle yes right here if we scroll
down to the compiled JavaScript you can
see it's not changed that constant into
a variable so it's not changed our es
2016 or 2015 code into vanilla
JavaScript so that's why we need the
babel loader and the babel preset to do
that for us
okay so that's what we're going to
install now so first of all what I want
to do is come down here and say npm
install and we're going to install babel
call we're going to install babel loader
and we're also going to install those
presets so that's the babel - preset and
the preset that we want to use is for es
2015 so it's - es 2015 and we're going
to save all of those to our dev
dependencies so hit enter
let those install and when it's done
just check out your package JSON file
just to make sure everything's been
installed there they are sweet okay so
now we can use these dudes in our
project so the next step is to configure
our web pack config file so we've done
the first two steps which is install
this install this and then install the
preset so now we need to configure this
dude right here to tell web pack that we
want to perform these transformations so
the way we do that let's park over there
is to use the module property then this
is an object and this might look a
little confusing at first but deadly is
once you've got hangar it so then we say
we want to use some loaders and this
load is going to be an array we put all
the different loaders we want to use in
our project in here so each loader is an
object and this object contains
different things so let's do this object
so this is the first loader
and we're going to say test first of all
for our first property and what this is
going to do is test particular files
okay because obviously we don't want
this logger to run on every single file
like HTML files or this file or this
file we just want it to run on
JavaScript files so we want to perform a
simple test to only run on files which
have a dot J's extension
now the way we do that is by using a
little regular expression so I'm going
to do that then J s and then it's going
to be a dollar sign and then forward
slash again so that there is going to
test for any JavaScript file any dot J's
file okay we're going to use that loader
on that next I want to tell web pack to
exclude certain files so don't want it
to run this loader on every single
javascript file I've got here because
there's loads of JavaScript in here and
I don't want it to run on ax so I'm
going to say exclude and then forward
slash and it's going to be the node
modules folder like so five slash and
then it's not going to run this test on
this folder just the JavaScript down
here all right cool so comment next I
want to say which loader I'm going to
use for this and of course it is the
babel loader so I say loader Babel -
loader and then we need to do one more
thing we need to say which presets we're
going to use do we want to transform JSX
code or do we want to transform es2015
code so we need to specify that right
here so comment and the way we do that
is by saying query and then this is
going to be an object in this object
we're going to say presets that we're
going to use and this is going to be an
array of presets which we're going to
use okay now we're just converting
es2015 code into vanilla JavaScript so
let's use the es2015 preset okay
so let's save that now and that's how a
web pack config right there done and if
I come down a and run a web pack again
press ENTER this is going to run it all
through and when it's done if we go to
the bungalow chassis its scene output
file and let's just give it a second to
update
okay so let's open this again go right
down and we can see the Const is changed
to a variable because webpack and babel
now know that we want to transform that
es2015 code into vanilla JavaScript
which is what we're doing here we're
changing that comes into a variable so
that there is going to work for whatever
es2015 code you have in your project
it's going to convert it into browser
ready JavaScript code pretty cool right
so I did say we can use it to convert
JSX code as well into normal JavaScript
and we're going to be giving that in my
react series which is going to come up
straight after this web pack one so
we'll leave that for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
