titan-3 tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about ranges okay then so
what does a range do well in prices a
range basically generates a list of
numbers for us which we can then use to
iterate over with for loops so in
previous examples when we looked at for
loops we've done something like this
we've created some data some kind of
collection items and then we've looked
through those using a for loop to say
okay well for singular in plural in this
collection and this singular variable
right here can be whatever you want it
to be called but it refers to whatever
item we're currently looking through in
that particular collection that list
then we're going to do something with
each iteration round so in this example
I want again stick with for loop sport
this time we're going to use a following
with a range instead of this data so
let's get rid of this we don't need this
anymore and what we're going to say is
for n in range and then we're going to
pop a number in here and then we're
going to do something so do something
right here now what this range does
remember is just generate basically a
list of numbers from 0 to whatever
number we specify right here in this
case 5 but it's non inclusive of 5 so
what this is going to do then is loop
through this for loop from 0 1 2 3 4 but
not 5
okay so until so it's 5 times because it
includes that 0 so let's try this let's
print out n each time around so save and
that let's run this it's called ranges
py to Python ranges dot P Y and we see
those numbers printed back to us 0 1 2 3
4 cool so basically that's what aralia
allows us to do with a follow now when
we only specify one argument in here
we're saying we want to go up to that
point but not including it and
automatically that range is going to
start at 0 but what we can do is specify
our own the starting point everyone's in
which I'm going to do now so let me copy
this dude and comment out I'm going to
paste it down below and this time what
I'm going to do is go from 3 or
2:10 so the first argument right here
that is the starting point and it's
inclusive of that three the second
argument is the endpoint not inclusive
of that number so again we're going to
do the same thing just print n and see
what happens so now we get from three to
nine remember none inclusive of 10 cool
let me just clear this give us a bit of
room now what we can do as well is also
add on a third argument and this third
argument is a step size if you like in
what step you want to go up or cycle
through this range the default is 1
because we're just going round every
time going up 1 and printing out n which
is increasing by 1 each time around but
what we can do and I'm going to copy
this to demonstrate it and then comment
it out paste it down here we can specify
a third parameter here which is saying
okay well instead of going looking ones
I want to go walk in and say fours I'm
going to start this at 0 again and this
time we'll go to 20 so we're going from
0 to 20 and we're going up in steps of 4
so let's see what happens we'll print n
out each time around
oops not clear Python arranges so now
you can see we're starting at 0 I've got
up to 4 8 12 16 in steps of 4 all the
way but not inclusive of up to 20 okay
so then basics of ranges now we can also
use ranges and we've data if we wanted
to so I'll go through another example
this time I'm going to create a list and
this is gonna be called burgers and I'll
just set this equal to like a few
different strings which are going to be
the type of verb is so beef first of all
then chicken will also do a veg one and
we'll do a Supreme a lot places have
supreme burgers and also a double one
alright cool so now we have our
different types of burgers and what
we're going to do is use a range to kind
of loop through these burgers so again
we'll say for and in a range now
remember when we only specify one
argument then the range defaults by
going from 0 up to that number that we
specify now what if we don't necessarily
know how many items are in this list and
we don't know what to go up to well how
many times to cycle through
well what we can do is find out the
length of that list by using the length
function so I could say I want to go up
to lengths of burgers so now since
there's five elements in here length
burgers is going to equal five one two
three four five and remember it's not
inclusive of that five which is cool
because it goes from position 0 1 2 3 4
right so we're going to cycle through
this range and we're going to print out
first of all and then comment then
burgers and we're going to use this
square bracket notation to indicate we
want to grab one particular element from
that list and we're going to pass
through n whatever n is at that point so
the first time around n is 0 so it's
going to print out the 0 then burgers 0
at position which is beef second time
around is going to be 1 so then it's
going to print out one and burgers one
which is chicken and so forth so let's
just give this a whirl and we get it all
right there cool okay so something
slightly more advanced now I'm going to
just comment this out and again what I'm
going to do is say 4 and in range and
this time we're going to pass through a
few different arguments and I'm going to
show you a little trick here so I'm
going to specify a starting point first
of all but I want the starting point
this time to be at the end this thing
right here so how do we do that well
what I'm going to say is the starting
point of the beat length of burgers
which is going to get me length 5
and then I'm going to say minus 1 and
that will give me the index of the last
item in that list so if it's 5 in length
minus 1 is 4 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm right here
I'm starting here now why would I want
to start there well because I'm going to
show you how to go backwards through
this list so that's the start position
where is going to be the end position
well I want the end position to be right
over here
0 but remember the end position is not
inclusive so if I put 0 it's not going
to include this so ideally what I want
the end position to be is here as well
so I can just say minus 1 for that
that's going to go to the last one
and finally the step size is going to be
minus 1 as well because
we go backwards what each time around
okay so now if we print ad first of all
then burgers and we should go backwards
through this list and if we print this
out here for double three supreme two
veg once again at zero beef so there we
go
that's why I like ranges because they
can be quite fun working out how to
cycle through things in different ways I
advise you to play around with these a
little bit and just get your head around
them before you move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
