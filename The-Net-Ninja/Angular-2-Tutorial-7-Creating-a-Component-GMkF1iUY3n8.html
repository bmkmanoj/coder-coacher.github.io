seventh angular tea tutorial and in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
create a new component
alright so thus far we have seen that
when we generated a new project with the
angular CLI we have these app components
created that our root components and
this root component has a select of up
roots so when the index dot HTML gets
fired up and it finds this app root tag
it knows to look for this component
because that's the selector and then get
this view which is defined in that
component and to serve that HTML in the
place of that tag in the index dot HTML
right here okay so that's our root
component now what I want to do in this
tutorial is add a new component and I've
done a little diagram to demonstrate
what I want to do so this root component
automatically generate for it is the app
dot component it sits at the top of the
tree then what I want to do now is
create a component for some kind of home
page so we'll call that the home
component and it's going to sit under
that root component and it makes sense
to call this whole component now before
we create it and I am going to be using
this terminal down here in this tutorial
which is just a package for angular so
if you go to file and then go to
settings which is here and if you go to
install you can search for packages and
the package is called if we scroll down
here it's called platform a our IDE
terminal so if you search for that and
download it you can then use this all
you need to do is click the little plus
icon right there to pop-up this terminal
so typically what I'm going to be doing
in this series is using this command
prompt to serve up the files to create
server using ng serve and then using
this terminal down here to do things
like create new components or new
directives using the angular CLI as well
ok so let's go ahead and create this
home component underneath the root
component so the first thing we need to
do is navigate into this app folder
since this is where all of our
components are going to live we're
currently in the angular 2 playlist
folder so we need to go into the ninja
directory then source then up so I'll
say CD ninja - directory doesn't know
that that's because I missed the why and
they will say CD and its source for
slash up and now we're in the app form
so now we can use the angular CLI ng to
create a new component and the way we do
that is by saying generate and it's a
component and then we can give this
component a name and I'm going to call
this home alright so what that is going
to do is generate a new component and
create those files folders the CSS file
the typescript file and the HTML file
for that component and notice right here
it's put it in the home folder within
the app folder so this signifies that
it's kind of one level deeper than the
app component file okay because it's
within another folder called hole so if
we look at the diagram this root
component sits in fault slash app then
this whole component sits in forward
slash hole underneath the root component
makes sense alright so now you can see
we've got the CSS file the HTML file and
the tactical file as well as this test
file which I'm going to delete because
we're not going in that in this tutorial
so let's go ahead and open those up and
see what it's done for us let's see in
that okay that's the view and this is
the class itself you'll notice this is a
little bit different from the other
class first of all it says implements on
in it okay and this is just some kind of
event so when the view when this
component has been initialized then this
function fires and whatever we have in
here whether it be some other functions
that we want to fire or variable
declarations that happens when the
component is initialized when it's kind
of loaded and we're going to talk about
this and other events in the component
cycle later on so it's automatically
created this selector for us so it's
going to import this or rather insert
this component where it finds this up
whole tag okay and it created this view
for us and the CSS for us as well and
notice is also imported this on Amit
thing right here this interface okay
that's because we're using it down here
so we'll talk about that a little bit
later on this constructor function as
well we're going to talk about later on
as well so that's a new component now
how do we get this into the other file
the other component because it's nested
within it because right now if we go to
the localhost over there nothing has
actually updated it's not showing this
homeworks so how do we show that how do
we get it on the home page well what we
need to do is insert this tag this
reference tag right here
much like the app component was on the
index but where do we put it well we put
it in this component right here because
it's sitting underneath this this is
like the parent component here and
within that parent component we want to
display this home section right so let's
grab this copy it and let's go and paste
it right here like that okay
so we don't need to put anything in it
but we can put something like loading
video I'm just going to keep it like
that I'm going to save it and what would
you expect now would you expect all of
this content here to be dumped into this
thing right here because that is the tag
name right well let's find out let's go
over to the browser and you'll notice
that nothing has happened okay even if i
refresh and it reloads the page you'll
notice nothing is going to happen and
that's because we've not injected this
component into this component right here
it's not expecting to use it so I'm
going to show you how we can do that in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
