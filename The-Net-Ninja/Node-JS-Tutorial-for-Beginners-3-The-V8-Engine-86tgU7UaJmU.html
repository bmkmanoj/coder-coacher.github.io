third nodejs tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
v8 engine alright then so we can fully
understand how nodejs works I want to
dive under the hood a little bit and
talk about the different components that
it's made from and the first one is the
v8 engine
now the v8 JavaScript engine is at the
heart of no TSO I do think it's
worthwhile knowing a little bit about it
and how it works so first of all what is
a JavaScript engine so when we write
JavaScript the computer itself does not
understand it it takes a JavaScript
engine to convert that javascript code
into machine code something that the
computer can't understand so that it can
be processed
okay so it looks something like this we
have machine code right here at the
bottom of the stack and that is what
computers run on it's what they
understand but it's very difficult to
program in machine code it looks an
absolute messing you don't know what's
going on so then we started to abstract
away from it using different languages
we have assembly language which sits
just above it but still very much like
machine code then we have something like
C++ or C and these are really popular
because the abstract away quite a lot
but they still remain a lot of power and
then finally we have things like
JavaScript which sit at the top of the
pile and abstracted a lot away from
machine code so when we write in
JavaScript we need a way for it to be
converted into machine code for it to
understand what we want it to do so no
js' itself is actually written in C++
which might seem a little bit off the
wall at first since it's all about
writing in JavaScript but here's the
distinction nodejs
itself is written in C++ but as a
program it allows us to write JavaScript
which can run on a computer or server
okay and the reason that nodejs is
written in C++ is because it uses the v8
Java
engine created by Google which is also
written in C++ so we know that nodejs is
written in C++ and we also know that at
the heart of nodejs is the v8 JavaScript
engine which converts the JavaScript
that we write into code that the
machines understand machine code so if
you do want to read a little bit more
about v8 then you can come to the
developers google.com/webmasters EA and
you can see here it says that v8 is
Google's open source high-performance
JavaScript engine written in C++ and
used in Google Chrome so it's also the
JavaScript engine that's run in Google
Chrome so when we create JavaScript in
Google Chrome in the browser then v8 is
used at that point to to translate it ok
and you'll see down here that you can
see it says it can run standalone or be
embedded into any C++ application so we
know that nodejs
is a C++ application and what it does is
take v8 and it embeds it into nodejs so
how does nodejs
work with v8 nodejs is written in c++
right and v8 is embedded into it right
there so when we write JavaScript and we
run it through nodejs
it's passed into VA and converted into
machine code which the computer can
understand
now v8 is just a part of the nodejs C++
call and there's other parts of nodejs
written in C++ too so what do they do
well the rest of the C++ in nodejs hooks
in to the JavaScript v8 engine and it
adds additional features to it so
initially JavaScript was designed to run
in a browser and it wasn't meant to deal
with lower-level operations but C++
ports dubois sorry so it's far more
powerful than JavaScript so no GS which
is written in C++ hooks
into the v8 engine and it extends it in
such a way that passes on these
additional features to JavaScript such
as reading the right files or connecting
to a database so this is what makes no
GS so so exciting the fact that we now
have been given much greater power with
JavaScript that we didn't have before
and therefore it enables us to create
server-side code in JavaScript which is
really cool so I think that'll do now
for v8 gives you kind of a rough
background of what it does and how no
js' works any questions drop those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
