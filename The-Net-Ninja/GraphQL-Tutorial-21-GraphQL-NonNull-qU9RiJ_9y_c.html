email server to work with MongoDB now so
we can query data and we can also add
data we can make these mutations but I
want to show you one little nuances
imagine we go to make a mutation and we
want to add a new author and we're
passing through a name now we're not
passing through an age property right
here but graph QL is still gonna do this
for us if I press play then we're not
going to get any kind of error but we're
going to get that name but because we
requested it right here and if i refresh
the authors collection now we will see a
name of John this is the forth author it
doesn't have an age property right now
ideally I don't want to allow that kind
of behavior I don't want someone to add
a new author and just skip out the age
property or even skip out the name
property they could have easily just
added in an age here instead and if that
will do that will just say age is 20
right so we don't even know the name of
the author will return the age here and
it allows us to do that we're going to
get another author object right here who
doesn't even have a name we just know
the age of this author and this is
useless information we don't want this
to happen so how can we prevent these
kind of queries being made where they
don't pass through all the relevant
information well we're going to do that
in a very simple way the first thing we
need to do is grab another object from
this thing right here right so let's do
a comma and the thing we want to grab
from this is called graph QL and then
it's non null all right so we're gonna
use this right here to say a certain
field is required we're not going to
accept a null value for certain fields
does that make sense
cool so when we're making the mutations
down here that's where we ideally really
want to say that things should not be
null so if we go to add book for example
right here then what we can do is place
in front of this graph cabal string a
new then we're going to paste this graph
Kewell non-null property in and surround
this in parentheses so what we're saying
here is that this name property on the
arguments when we go to add a bulk needs
to be a graphic of our string and it
cannot be null
right if they've not passed that through
then do not allow this mutation to take
place so we're gonna do the same thing
for these two down here so new graph QL
non null and wrap those and again down
here new graph QL non null let's
surround the graph QL ID I'm gonna do
exactly the same thing for the author up
here alright so the name new graph QL
non null so they have to pass through a
name property when they use add author
and also for the the age so new graph QL
non null and surround that as well so
that was simple let's give this a whirl
so on the front end now if I just get
rid of this stuff then you can see when
it tries to make this query if I play it
we're gonna get this error message back
and this gets a little squiggly line so
first of all the error message says that
the add author right here is required
this name field is required and it's of
type string and it's not been provided
so it's not going to go ahead with this
mutation so we can test that if I change
this to 40 and try to press play if I
then go to the authors we're not going
to get that record at it with an age of
40 you can see the last one is still
this age of 20 so this is good now it's
stopping us from doing this and if we
hover over here we can see that error it
says field add author argument name of
type string is required but not provided
sweet so now we need to pass through the
name property so if we pass in now a
name of I don't know David then press
play then now this is going to work
right because we've passed through an
age and a name and if i refresh we're
going to get that in our database over
here David 40 now if I take out the age
is actually quite as well so again we're
going to get a squiggly line and it's
not gonna let me do this so this
is kind of like a way of validating
which properties are sent right we're
saying we need an age we need a name and
if we want to add a book then we need a
name of the book right we also need a
jean rrah with the book which is going
to be I don't know fantasy surprise
surprise and we also need an author ID
right and only when we add this author
ID in then this squiggly line right here
is gonna get removed from ad book right
so there we go that is graph QL non-null
and that is how we can say to the
front-end news and look you have to send
certain parameters right so I think
we're in a good position anyway on the
back end in our graph QL server
everything seems to be working quite
well we might return to it later
but now what I want to do is move to the
front-end starting in the next tutorial
and create a react applications interact
with our graph QL server instead of just
always making queries from this thing
right here in graphical all right so
I'll see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
