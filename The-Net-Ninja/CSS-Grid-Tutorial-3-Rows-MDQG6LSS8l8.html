tutorial and in this video we're going
to take a look at rows so with the
minute we have three rows in our grid
one two three and the reason we have
three rows is because in the last video
we said we wanted three columns right in
equal width so that's one two three and
because we have nine elements what
happens is when we get to the last
column the third column right here the
next element is automatically placed on
the next row in the first column again
and we repeat the process alright so
this is the automatic behavior of rows
rows are created when we have the
content to do it automatically now at
the minute the height of these rows is
given by the content inside the elements
and also because we gave it a padding
now if we take this padding off then the
row height is going to be minuscule and
that's why I added the padding on in the
first place so we can see the row height
now is just the height of the content
let's place this padding back on now if
we add more content into one of these
elements then the row height is going to
be dictated by that amount of content so
for example if I go down to the third
element and add in a lot of lorem ipsum
right here
come back over here in fact we need to
save it come back over here we can see
the row height is now governed by the
amount of content inside this third
element because it's on this first row
okay so if we want to override this
behavior and say actually we want each
road to have a set height then we can do
and we do that using a property called
grid auto rows so I'm going to show you
that first of all let's come up to the
content which is the grid wrapper itself
and underneath grid template rows I'm
going to use a property called grid -
Auto - rose so right here we could pass
through a height for example 200 pixels
and then every single row inside this
grid is gonna have 200 pixels in height
so if we save it now we can see that it
has that height however this content is
getting cut off right here so it totally
disregards any content inside of the row
and just says hey I don't care about
that you've told me you want a height of
200 pixels I'm giving you a height of
200 pixels and I'm cutting off the
content you've placed inside it if it's
over 200 pixels in height now this
really isn't what we want but we can
kind of circumnavigate this problem by
using the min/max function
server instead of giving it one height
right here we can say min max and inside
the parentheses we can pass through two
parameters first of all the minimum
height of a row
which you can say is 200 pixels then
also the maximum height of a row which
I'm going to say Auto and what this is
saying right now is said hey if there's
nothing in the row dictating the height
then apply a minimum height of 200
pixels to that row
however if there is content in that
height which takes it over 200 pixels in
height then I'm applying a height of
auto just take the height of the content
inside it so if I save this now and
preview it did we can see that this row
right here takes on the height of the
content which is high Auto and the
height down here of these rows is 200
pixels that's the minimum height of a
row make sense okay so that's pretty
cool that's how we can set the row
height if we want to now I did say that
we can also specify how many rows we
want the default behavior is that it
automatically places the elements on the
road to fit but if we want to we could
say actually we don't just want three
rows we want ten rows and we can do that
by using a property called grid template
rows so much like we used grid template
columns to specify the number of columns
and the width of each column we can do
the same thing to specify the number of
rows and the height of each row now
since we're specifying the height of
each row in this new property called
grid template rows I'm going to comment
out this because we won't need it
anymore so instead I'm gonna say grid -
template - rows so in here I could say
something like 200 pixels 300 pixels 400
pixels 200 pixels and that is going to
create four rows for me the first row is
going to be 200 pixels in height second
300
400 and the fourth 200 pixels if I save
this and view it we can see that right
here
the first is 200 then 3 &amp;amp; 4 then we also
have a fourth row down here there's no
content in it at the minute but the
space is there for the fourth row which
we set at 200 pixels in height so much
like we did with the columns right here
we said repeat instead of writing them
all up separately we can do the same for
grid template rows so I'm going to say
repeat and then inside I'm going to say
I want three rows and I want each row to
have a height of 200 pixels so if I save
this now we can see that we have three
rows again and each row is a height of
200 pixels again we're cutting off the
content so remember when we're
specifying the row height instead of
just a 1 value we can say min max and
place the minimum height and then the
maximum height which is Auto inside
therefore it's going to repeat this now
three times once for each row so if I
save that then we get those three rows
again we have a minimum height of 200
and a maximum height set to auto awesome
now if we wanted to we could say we want
10 rows right here and that's going to
create the space for 10 rows down here
however nothing is in the other minute
so a lot of the time we don't really
need to use this property to say how
many rows we want because the default
behavior remember is to create new rows
when we have the content to go under
okay the world returns when we use this
and you'll see that later on in this
series but a lot of the time we won't
need to use it now I want to show you
one more thing before we stop this video
and that is how we can add a gap between
each of these columns and also between
each of the rows now you might be
sitting there thinking well I could just
use a margin and you can I'm going to
come down here to each div and say we
want a margin of 20 pixels right between
each div save that and while I would get
it however check this out if I inspect
this element over here I'm gonna make it
a little wider we can see that the
margin goes all the way around it's not
just on the left over here it's all the
way around so we have it on the right
over here as well we don't really want
that
the only one in between the columns we
don't want it on the outside of the grid
right so instead what we can do is we
can use a property on the grid itself
called a grid gap so let me get rid of
the margin down here first of all and
save that and instead I'm going to come
down here and say grid then - then
column and - then gap and I'm going to
set this equal to ten pixels so this is
going to set the gap between the columns
right here - 10 pixels yeah pretty cool
and now we don't get a gap on the left
side of the grid and the right side of
the grid much like we did when we used
margin on each div we just get it
between the columns right here we also
have a property called grid - ro - gap
and that's going to be set to ten pixels
as well and you guessed it this is going
to place a gap of ten pixels between
each row now if we wanted to we could
combine these into one single property
called great - gap set that equal to 10
pixels save it and now we get 10 pixel
gap everywhere all right so there we go
that is rose in a nutshell and grid gaps
and the next video we're going to take
this one step further and we're going to
take a look at column and row lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
