to your very first PSD to responsive
website tutorial Wow okay let go so just
a little bit about what this playlist is
going to be about and what it's not so
it's going to be a PSD to responsive
website single page development okay so
I'm going to take a PSD website template
and I'm going to turn it into HTML CSS
and JavaScript to make a responsive
single page website it's not going to be
built on a framework like bootstrap or
anything like that because I want to
show you how quickly I can prototype
using my own media queries and I think
it is always beneficial to understand
the inner workings of something and how
to use media queries and whatnot before
you stop jumping into frameworks anyway
so once we've done this playlist maybe
I'll do another one in fact I'm will be
doing another one on bootstrap so snow
can be built on a framework and it's not
going to be pixel perfect that's not the
aim of this tutorial series you know I'm
not gonna be using the exact font sizes
or padding or anything like that my aim
is to show you how quickly I can
prototype and how quickly you can
prototype a responsive website from
scratch okay so this is what you're
going to need to know what probably
should know before start in this
playlist the first one is a bit of
Photoshop don't need to be an expert you
just need to know what the slice tool is
and how to slice images and I'm going to
show you that anyway in case you don't
and how to move different elements about
because we are going to adapt our
desktop design in Photoshop and create a
new PSD which is going to represent the
mobile view okay so just a few different
things you need to know in Photoshop
just the basics secondly going to need
to know how to color per page in HTML
and how to use CSS and possibly a little
bit of JavaScript just a little bit to
make our responsive mobile drop-down
menu thirdly you probably should know
the basics of responsive design because
I'm not going to go into any great
detail into what the viewport tag is or
the media queries or anything like that
if you want to know a little bit more
about that then I'll leave a link to my
responsive design tutorial series where
you can learn all the basics first leave
that down below you can check that out
first
alright then guys so I thought I'd just
give you a little preview as to what the
end product is going to be of this
tutorial playlist this is it right here
I've built it already and this is the
desktop view you can see just a single
page website is pretty neat
and then as we change the viewport size
you can see it's fully responsive and
flew it as well so it's getting smaller
and then we're going to hit a few
different breakpoints in a second you
can see where the design changes like
that and again in a minute there it is
and then again for mobiles and we have
this drop down navigation here so that
is the end product that's what we're
going to be building in the next kind of
10 to 15 tutorials or something like
that tutorial videos and just a couple
more things I want to show you first of
all this is where I got the PSD file
from this is the website we're going to
be building and you can get it from this
website I'm going to leave the link to
this down below so you can go there and
download it yourself secondly I'm going
to be doing all my coding in a text
editor called brackets because it's
pretty cool and it's free and there you
can download that right here at brackets
dot IO so that's it for this
introduction in the next lesson what
we're going to be doing is diving into
the PSD and we're going to start slicing
up some images so I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
