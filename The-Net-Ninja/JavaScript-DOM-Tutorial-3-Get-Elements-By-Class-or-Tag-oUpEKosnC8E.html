your third javascript in the dom
tutorial and in this video I'm going to
show you how we can grab elements by
class or tag name alright then so in the
last tutorial I showed you how to query
the Dom and grab an element from the web
page based on its ID using this method
right here get element by ID now in this
tutorial I want to show you two
different ways we can query the Dom the
first way is going to be querying it
based on the class name of elements and
the second way is to be based on the tag
name of elements so let's do the class
way first of all so over in the elements
tab we can see in the header over here
we have this h1 and it has a class of
title now because we can use the same
class multiple times on a web page I
also have a hate 2 down here with a
class of title as well so say for
example I want to reach into this web
page and bring back every element with a
class of title so we're not just
querying the Dom for one element right
here we're querying it for several
elements we want to hate email
collection back well we can do that
using a method called get elements by
class name and it sits on the document
object again so if document get elements
by class name and all we need to do is
passing the class name right here which
is going to be title so if I store this
in a variable so we can have access to
it later I'll call this titles click
enter and then type out titles we can
see that we get back this thing right
here which looks very much like an array
but be careful because it's not an array
then we expand this right here we can
see that this is actually a hate email
collection and in some ways this behaves
like an array but in some ways it's
different from at a rope so one way that
it's similar is that we can access
elements from this collection using the
array square bracket notation for
example if I wanted to reach in and grab
the first element right here I could say
titles then use the square bracket
notation 0 for the first element right
here remember javascript is zero-based
indexing so if we click enter now we can
see these first element
returnables likewise if I put in a one
right here we can see the second one is
returned to us okay so that's the first
method I want to show you how to
retrieve a collection of elements based
on the class of them
the second method I want to show you is
get elements by tag name so this is what
you've used if you want to return a
collection of elements that all have the
same tag for example in the elements tab
again we can see this ul has for Eliza
me if I want to reach into the Dom and
grab every single Li on the page I am
going to use this method which is get
elements by tag name so let's again
store these in a variable I'm going to
call them Allies set it equal to
documents get elements by tag name and
the tag we want is Li so if we click
enter and then say Allies then we can
see all of these right here which is
again a HTML collection but likewise we
can still access the individual elements
by saying something like Allies zero or
allies two etc okay so that's how we
query the dog to get these different
HTML collections however if we are
generally querying for Dom what we
intend to do is do something with the
elements that we retrieve so for example
I might want to query the Dom for all of
the title class elements and style them
in a particular way so we need a way to
kind of loop through all of those
elements because the maybe turns them on
a page and it happens there's only two
in this case but there could be more so
what we could do is a for loop to cycle
through those and do something with each
one in the collection so for now I'm
just going to press these icon up here
which is going to close this console we
still have access to all the different
variables we've created but what I'm
going to do now is a for loop to cycle
through these titles so let's start this
for and then we're going to start our
index I at 0 then what we want to do is
cycle through this collection for as
long as I is less than the length of
this collection now we have access to
the length property right there you can
see it's 2 so let's use it so for as
long as I is less then
titles got length and then the final
thing we want to do is increase I by one
each time around so we'll say I plus
plus to do that
okay so we've constructed this for loop
and inside all I'm going to do is log to
the console so I'll say console that log
and we're going to log the element each
time around that we're currently cycling
through and the way we do that is by
just referencing the titles collection
right here and then using square bracket
notation passing through I which is
going to start out with zero but then
each time around is going to increase by
one until it reaches the length of this
collection so if we press ENTER we can
see now that each one of those is going
to be loved to the console so that's how
we can cycle through these Hatem our
collections obviously we're not just
going to be logging them to the consult
every time we cycle through them we
might me give me something like changing
the style of them adding an attribute or
another class etc and we'll see all of
that later on
so this is one way we can cycle through
the HTML collections but I want to show
you another way which I actually prefer
in some cases so to do this I just want
to move over to Adam and I mean up jes
this is why we do all of our JavaScript
for this series and it's already linked
up at the bottom of the HTML page right
here remember these files are on github
if we go to app Jess I want to show you
this all the way to cycle through this
HTML collection but first of all again
we need to create these variable titles
to store those titles in so it's
document dot get elements by class name
and then the class remember is title so
now we're storing those in this variable
now I want you to imagine for a minute
that this variable titles is actually an
array so we're cycling through an array
one of the methods we can use on an
array is for each so we could say
something like this titles remember
imagine this is an array for each and
then what we do is pass through a
function here and take the item and this
item is the item which is returned each
time around we're looping through the
array okay and what we could do is
console that log this item so if I save
this this is not going to work we get an
error we get titles that for each is not
a function and that's because this is
not an array this
a hasty mail collection so this is one
of the ways that it differs from an
array we can't use array methods on it
all right
but what we can do to get around this is
turn this into an array so let me just
comment this out for a second I want to
show you something what I'm going to do
is console.log and then I'm going to say
array dot is array
and we pass things through into this
function right here I'm going to pass
through titles so we're passing through
titles here and this right here is going
to in false if this is not an array and
true if this is an array so this is a
way we can check if something is in a
rape
so if I click Save then we can see folks
this is not an array because it's a hate
from our collection but we can turn this
into an array so underneath here if I
say console dot log and I'm going to say
array dot is array to check if something
is an array and this time what I'm going
to do is convert this thing into an
array and the way we do that is by again
saying array dot prompt and then in
brackets we want to pass through the
titles so essentially what we're saying
is we want to create an array from this
haste in our collection all right so
this right here is now going to be an
array therefore this method should
return true so let's save this and we
get uncut error array dot that's because
I've made a typo so array dot is array
we need two R's there save it and this
time we get false then true so we've
successfully turned that into an array
okay so now then we can employ this
method right here down here to turn this
into an array so let's uncomment this
dude again and I'm also going to comment
this stuff out
what I'm going to do is turn this into
an array so we'll say a red dot from
titles to turn this into an array then
we can say dots for each on it because
now this is returning an array and we
can use the dot for each method on
arrays so we're cycling through this
array of HTML elements now and each time
around we cycle we get the item we're
currently cycling on and we're logging
back to the console save it and now we
can see we're outputting those two
different elements so that is just
another way we can cycle through these
HTML collections which sometimes I
prefer them for loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
