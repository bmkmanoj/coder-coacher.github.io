watching CSS positioning a lesson 12 and
in this video I want to talk about
clipping content and also what we're
going to be doing next Wow I think I saw
I'm exactly where I left off in the last
lesson but I'm looking at this web page
and although it's freaking off I've
decided that what I want to do is click
these boxes right here so that they're
all ending at the same position I still
want this stare effect at the top I just
want them to all end along this kind of
a line here so essentially I need to
click a little bit off the bottom of
this and a little bit off the bottom of
this one right here so how do we do that
well dead simple technique we use the
overflow property and we give the parent
elements at maximum height okay so let's
do that right now we know that all of
these service blocks right here are
within this services class okay
so let's grab that services class in
fact we should already have a rule for
it down there somewhere let's find that
and so this is after okay no we don't so
let's put that right in here services
and what I'm going to do is give that a
maximum height and the max height is
going to be like 150 pixels for now so
now you can see that right there yet
this blue box is the services wrapper
this div right here however even though
we've given that a maximum height these
boxes still overflow so what we need to
do is clip anything that overflows this
maximum height and the way we do that is
very simple guys we just give this
wrapper this services div and over
flogged property and what we're saying
here is we can control this stuff right
here
so anything that overflows we can add
the set to auto which pretty much just
puts a scroll bar on it now I think that
is kind of a bit ugly in this
circumstance now we can do that for
example if this was just a big column of
text then we wanted it to occupy this
amount of space and the user can just
scroll we could do that but for this
instance I don't want to do that what
else can we do
we can set it to hidden
that is what I want to do all right so
now everything that overflow is that
maximum what a height of 150 is hidden
so they're all clipped at the bottom
right here so they still have that
stereo fact at the top but nice and
straight at the bottom awesome okay now
if I wanted to I could show these I
could say oops visible I mean that's
what it is by default so I don't really
need to explicitly say visible unless
I'm overriding a previous rule and the
only other option we can have is scroll
we can have inherit as well which just
inherits the kind of a parent element
value for this property or we can use
scroll and that's going to add the left
and the right scroll bars as well as the
top and bottom okay even though we don't
need these like to write a thinks okay
below I'm telling it makes perfect sense
but there we go so I'm going to set this
to hidden and that's going to clip off
all the bottom bits of those services
all right so that my friends is how we
clip content in CSS we just use a max
height property and set the overflow
portion to hidden all right all right
guys so that is the end of this
relatively short playlist this CSS
positioning playlist and by now we
should be in a good position to really
start making some websites but there's
one thing we've really not looked at at
all on this channel yet and that is
responsive design so what do I mean by
that well you gotta take this
and I make it smaller you can see the
website has changed
it still looks alright and it's just
responded to the size of the browser
okay so that is what responsive design
is all about so whether I view this
website on a phone tablet or a desktop
computer it's still gonna look all right
so that's what we're going to be doing
in the future the very near future I'm
going to do a playlist on responsive
design so it's going to take everything
we've learned in CSS from the CSS
beginners playlist and this one we've
just done we're going to combine those
to create a responsive website alright
so if you have any questions whatsoever

otherwise guys don't forget to subscribe
to get all those up
case share and like and I'll see you in
the very next tutorial playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
