17th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about Jason
and the HTTP service ah ok lindo so
currently in our application we're
defining all of our data within this
controller right here down on the scope
object right so we're passing through
all of this data to the scope object now
in practice we're probably going to want
to externalize that data and then bring
it in from an external source so that
it's easier to manage and we're going to
do that in this tutorial by converting
this data to Jason externalizing it in a
JSON file and then requesting that file
using the HTTP service in angular when
we need it
so that we can have access to it in this
controller and then output it here to
the screen ok so what is Jason then well
Jason just stands for JavaScript object
notation and it's a format in which we
can store data which works really well
with JavaScript and writing Jason is
dead easy it's pretty much just like
writing a JavaScript object like this
except in JavaScript we can get away
without putting quotations around the
property names there in jason we have to
do that something like this ok that's
where a lot of people first coming into
Jason go wrong and we could go through
the entire kind of array of objects and
do this to each property but I don't
like wasting my time or boring you guys
so we're going to make use of one at
angularjs is methods to give us that
jason forest alright so to convert this
into jason all we need to do is
something like this you can see I've
said console dot log and then we're
using a method on angular called
- Jason and this takes an object or an
array of object or some kind of data and
it converts that into Jason Forest in
some file a - Jason ok so I pass through
all of this data right here into this
method and then I'm going to save it and
open it up in the console and hopefully
we should have all that data right there
so angularjs has got all that data for
us and converting it into data and you
can see the little quotations now
around the property names so what we
need to do is copy that and paste it
when we need it so incidentally if you
want to learn more about Jason go ahead
to this website it's pretty cool dead
simple and there's a few examples on
there as well so I'll leave that link
down below and also this is a cool
website jason lint if you're ever
writing Jason and you're unsure as to
whether it's going to be valid Jason or
not go ahead and just paste in your
Jason right there and click on validate
and you're going to see right now if I
like Jason so this is ok also it's
laying it out a lot better as well so
I'm going to copy that and that's the
stuff I'm going to paste into our JSON
file later but this is really good as
well for spotting errors so see you've
got tons of different objects right and
you've made an error somewhere along the
line but you don't know where it is say
you forgot a comment like that
okay and you don't know rifle through it
all to find that error you just want to
come here paste it over here click on
validate and it's going to find where
that error is for you so it's really
cool okay so I lived on into this down
below as well now let's go into our
application and I want to pop all of
that Jason into an external file and
we're going to store that file in a
folder called data just to keep it
separate and then within there I'm going
to create a new file called ninjas Jason
all right cool now let's paste all that
data Rick and that is our JSON file
that's simple so we've stored that data
in an external JSON file now what we
need to do is use the HTTP service in
angular to go out grab that data and
make it accessible to us in the
controller so that we can put it all
right so I keep talking about a service
now in angularjs a service is just a
little bit of code which handles common
tasks within your application so the
service that we want to use to bring
that data into our project is called
HTTP and that handles communication and
the passing of data between our
application here and the HTTP server or
HTTP server okay so that's what we're
going to use now we'll get rid of all
this junk right here now because we
don't need that anymore and then to use
the HTTP service we need to pass it
through here as a dependency in this
array so let's go ahead and do that
it's dollar sign
HTTP put a comma after that and then we
also need to pass it through to the
function as well so that we can use it
so again HTTP and then what we need to
do down here
is just write http dot get that's a
method that we're using to get data and
then we pass through into that method
just a string which is going to be a
path to that data now we know it's in
the data folder forward slash ninja's
dot jason so that's the data we're going
to get
now if angular successfully gets that
data is get a fire this success method
right here okay and within there we need
to pass through a function and that's
going to take a parameter called data
and I'll explain this in a second and
it's going to fire down there
so we're saying okay use this HTTP
service to get some data and the data we
want is at this path so go ahead and get
that when it successfully gets it right
here then we're going to fire this
function and we're going to pass in the
data that this method gets for us into
this function okay so this data now is
all of this stuff right here and we can
use that data within our controller now
so instead of setting scope dot ninjas
equal to that big array of objects right
in here I can just say scope dot ninjas
impulse the data okay so that's all
there is to it now and this looks a lot
cleaner in our controller it's a lot
better practice just to grab the data
from an external source and then bring
it okay so that's doing exactly the same
trick now so if I save it then hopefully
we should see no change over here and
all the other ninjas are still being
loaded in we can still use all the
functions and we can search so no
different whatsoever okay so guys that
is the HTTP service and how we grab data
from an external source in this example
jasa
and then load it into our application
okay so if you have any questions
whatsoever oh by the way I want to say
that for this to work then you're going
to need to run this application on some
kind of server either local or life now
I'm just using this local one using a
pack
each that I installed in atomist text
editor and I showed you how to install
that package in the first tutorial so
I'll leave a link to that first tutorial
if you want to go ahead and install that
package so that you can run your
application on this local server as well
if you don't want to use this then you
can use some kind of Python server or
something else or a live server okay so
I just wanted to point that out in case
anyone's experiencing you know
difficulties getting this to work so
there we go guys anyway if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise I'll see you in a
various tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
