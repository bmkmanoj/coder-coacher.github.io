welcome to your 20 minutes yes that's
the beginners tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a look at text
decoration and that's coming up Wow
alright so what the hell is text
decoration well to show you that I'm
gonna view this in a browser and what
can it open in Chrome okay so go to
articles here now you see this blue link
it's underlined and blue and we know
that's the default browser styles right
but if I expect this element here this
link we can see that it's got a
text-decoration:underline so that one's
a line there is caused by this text
decoration property and there's a few
different keywords we can use to give it
different decorations so let's take a
look at a few of those so we'll tell you
a tag and we'll say text-decoration:none
okay so that is now gonna say you don't
want that underlined you want no text
decoration and by the way that's the
name of the property here text -
decoration okay so let's save that and
view it in a browser and now we strip
off that underlining style
so we'll view this again in the chrome
dev tools and you can see now
text-decoration:none
it's overridden this
text-decoration:underline and that kind
of proves an important point you can
only have one text decoration you can't
have multiple text decoration rules
where you're given a give it and
underline and an over line or anything
else it has to have one or the other
okay
so let's have a look what else we can do
you've a delete this and we go back to
the start I'm going to drop down list
and that's brackets telling me all the
available values for this property and
the first one is inherit and that's
basically saying look whatever styles
this is inheriting indirectly just apply
those for the text decoration so say for
example we give the article tag here
that we give that
let's do it here an article property of
text-decoration all the line yeah oops
are saying that every element within the
article now through inheritance is going
to inherit this text-decoration property
of over line now if we say just inherit
what we're saying is we're over oops
we're over riding that default browser
style because we're giving it a specific
value here we're seeing in Harriette now
we're going to inherit the style that is
possible through this article tag so
that should be over the line let's save
it view it in the browser Google Chrome
cool and now not only are all these peas
on the line which looked around the
bazaar now the a tag here is Overland
because it's inheriting that style
through the article okay so let's get
rid of that and see what else is
available to us so we'll come back here
and we'll get the drop down again line
through okay that's like a strikethrough
so these are pretty good for lists so
you've got a list of things to do and
you've got like four of them that are
crossed out then that's a pretty cool
style too to use in this case so let's
view this again in a browser see what it
looks like open with Google Chrome okay
there you can see now it's got a
strikethrough or a line through so
that's that's value and what else do we
have we have not we've seen over line
we've seen under line is the only one
we've not seen well we have seen it
because that's the default browser style
but we'll view it again in a browser
just to make sure it's worked and now
it's underlined again so really you only
have three main text decorations and
they are line through over line or
underlined or if you don't want any you
can have none or if you want to leave it
down to inheritance and inherent
whatever the parent element is styling
for then you can use the inherit keyword
okay so
that about covers it for text-decoration
if you have any questions whatsoever
drop a comment down below and I'll
answer all of those otherwise guys I'm
gonna see you in the next video I'll see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
