JavaScript for beginners lesson 19 and
in this video I just wanted to go
through a practical example of willing
to use a loop in JavaScript
all right then guys so as you can see
I'm back in the index file right here
and I've got some links numbered from 0
to 5 there now I've started at 0 because
normally javascript is a zero-based
language meaning that when we use arrays
or index variables as we've seen in
loops we often start at 0 so I thought
it makes sense to start at 0 for these
links as well so what I want to do is
show you an example of how loops in
JavaScript can cycle through elements on
your webpage and change them in HTML all
right so let's jump over to this test
file which is our a link table and I
don't need to pay too much attention to
the code that are right here I'm just
showing you how loop can work with a web
page we're going to cover all of this
extra code later in this playlist so
let's start off with a variable called
links and this is going to be array
which is going to hold all of the anchor
tags on the page so we'll use the get
element by tag name to do that and we're
going to go up to our 8x so now it's
going to store all the anti links in an
array for us and again don't worry about
arrays yet I'm going to cover those
later
now we'll do our for loop and the
components we need remember are the
initializer the index variable and we'll
set that to be I equals 0 then we want
the loop to continue for as long as I is
less than links length so that means
that for as long as I is less than the
number of links on the page we'll
continue to do this so then it will
catch all of the links and then finally
we want to increment I by 1 each time
around alright so let's do the code
later so each time around we have I as a
specific number if that's off 0 then 1
and 2 and 3 now we can use that number
to grab all of a specific link in this
array so that's what we're going to do
so we'll say links which is the array
and then we want the eighth number
of that later array so we'll start at
zero that would first time round be zero
set time rounded one then two etc so
each time I is going at one and that's
going to get us the first and the second
then the third link etc and each time we
iterate through this loop we want to do
something to those links or that link
and we're going to give it a class name
each time so we're going to give the
class name to be linked - then we're
going to concatenate whatever I is so
that will be linked 0 then link 1 then
link - etc going through and again don't
worry too much about this code here in
this code here I'm going to show you all
of this later in the playlist this is
just an example of how we can use loops
okay so let's save that off and refresh
over here and as you can see now it's
looped through each link in a HTML
document and it's given one each sorry
each anchor tag a class of link 0 then
link 1 then link to and that's this bit
right here so we've achieved what we set
out to do so that's how we can use loops
to cycle through elements on a page and
do things with them and this is just one
of many different things we can do with
those things if we wanted to we could
animate those links or change the style
properties whatever you want to do you
can do that so I hope this has made
sense I just wanted to give you an
example of where we'd use loops and if
you have any questions about this
whatsoever feel free to comment down
below I'll answer all of those otherwise
