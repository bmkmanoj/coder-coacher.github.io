Django tutorial and in this video we'll
talk about URL parameters and regex
alright then so this is the current
state of our article list template and
what output in the different blogs right
here and at the top of each of these
blocks is a link and the idea is that
when we click on this link we want to go
through to a individual blog page and
show the rest of that blog
now we've not set that up yet but that's
what we're gonna start doing in this
video so to do this we're gonna have to
set something else up in our URLs dot py
file inside the articles app over here
but before we go into that I want to
explain how this URL structure should
work so if we click on this Django rules
then I would like the URL to look
something like this forward slash
articles four slash Django - rules like
so and that URL will show us this
individual article or if it's this that
it would be forward slash article
forward slash Django notic - opening so
this thing right here this Django -
rules or Django notic - opening this
looks very much like the slug that we
created inside our model so if we take a
look at this model over here we have a
property called slug and the slope if we
take a look inside the admin looks
something like this
it was a URL friendly string so instead
of spaces there would be a hyphen and it
would also take up the capital letters
and replace them with small letters even
though it doesn't really have to do that
so this is essentially the URL for this
article and we'll use that's look right
so the way we have to do this in our
URLs dot py file is to use what's known
as a named capturing group so what does
that mean exactly well the first thing
we really need to do is sell another URL
for our article detail page that will be
a page which shows the details of one
particular article
so we'll say URL and then the first
parameter is the raw string with our
regex in we'll leave that for now
and come back to it in a minute but then
we'll send them two views article
underscore detail so we don't have that
view function set up just yet so let's
do that first of all we'll go to views
and below this will create a new
function and this function will be
called article underscore detail and
that will take in the request object
right here so ideally for now let's just
return a HTTP response and in order to
do that we'll need to import it at the
top so from Django HTTP will import HTTP
response and what only doing this for
now until we figure out how to set up
these URLs for individual articles later
on we'll be rendering a whole template
for now we'll just be returning some
kind of HTTP response so how do we then
set up this URL this is the bit that
we're struggling with the regex
for our article now we don't have to
write the forward slash article bit
that's already taken care of in our main
URLs file over here when we said forward
slash articles include the article URLs
so we don't have to worry about that
that's already included we just want to
worry about the next part so this slug
bit right here so this is the bit that
we need to define as a name to capturing
group and the way we do that is by first
of all in here saying okay this caret
means it has to go at the start and then
open up our parentheses then a question
mark then P and then in the angle braces
like that we say what we want to call
this group and this will be called a
slug and this name is for the benefit of
the views over here because we can take
in this parameter slug right here okay
so we capture that variable inside the
URL right here
using this thing right we capture that
variable and then we can send it through
to the view as a second parameter now
after we've said okay we want this to be
a named capturing group right here after
we've said that we need to say after
this slug bit right here what we expect
this to be now in my eyes this URL could
be anything any kind of letter or number
and - so the way we do that in regex is
by opening up our square brackets then
inside we say backslash W to say any
kind of letter so that could be a
through to Zed in lowercase or uppercase
and any number as well as any underscore
and then also it could include a - so we
have to pop that in as well we also want
to say this could be any length of
numbers or letters at all we you know
there's no limit on this this could be
like 50 characters this URL so if we
want to put a plus sign at the end over
there to say that this can be any length
as well finally we want our forward
slash at the end and then we want the
dollar sign so just to run through this
again
this means it must come at the start and
this means it must be at the end so
we're just containing the regex in the
middle then to create a named capturing
group we have to say parentheses
question mark P then in angle brackets
the name of the thing that we want to
capture this can be anything you want
but I'm calling it slug we don't have to
name it slug we can name it a b c if we
want to and that will be passed through
as ABC down here but we're naming it
slow because at the end of the day
that's what it is
we're naming this slug and then we say
okay well what can this slug be in the
URL well I've said right here that it
can be any kind of a letter A through Z
on number or underscore that's what
backslash W means inside the square
brackets then we've also added in the -
which means - can be included in this
URL as well and then we've added on the
plus outside the square brackets to say
okay well this thing right here can be
any length it's not just one character
any length so when you use the types in
all
that into the URL over here then all of
that bit this bit here will be captured
into this variable and this variable
will then be sent to this function over
here and we can receive in that function
as the second parameter we've called its
slope so now let's send that response
the slug that we capture to the user and
see if this works so if I go to forward
slash articles forward slash jungle
rules press ENTER then it looks like
we're gonna get an error and I think
that's because we misspelled something
somewhere okay that's because we have an
S on the end over here it should be
article detail let's try this or one
more time
so now we get this thing over here this
look parameter that was from this thing
and it doesn't matter what URL would go
to so if I put a game over here then we
get jungle rules again which is the slug
sensors back in the browser we can put a
number on there this still works okay so
now we've done the first step we've
captured where the user wants to go to
and we have access to that now inside
this view function over here so now we
have access to that slug I suppose what
we could do is take that slug query our
database to look for an article which
has that slug and if it does then we'll
retrieve that article send back a
template with that article so the user
can see it does that make sense so
that's what we'll do in the very next
