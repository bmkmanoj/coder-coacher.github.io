pages three tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about how we can go
about reading files on our system ok now
so one of the cool things that Python
can do is allow us to open up files and
read the contents of them and then do
something with the contents of those
files so in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to do that now you might
notice I've already created this read py
file it's empty at the minute but also
this files directory and inside there is
two text files this DNA sequence text
file and this it some text file now both
of these files are on my github
repository if you want to download them
what we're going to do is start reading
these files starting with Lee scripts
and file so before we read anything out
of a file we first of all has to open it
and the way we do that is by things open
and then whatever the file name is on
the path to the file and this is a
string so it's in the files directory
forward slash tip some text now this is
going to open the file but really what
we want to do is store a reference to
this file in some kind of variable so we
can access it down in the code so what
I'm going to do is store this in a
variable called gypsum on the score file
okay so I normally like to do this to
underscore file after my variable names
when I'm opening up some kind of file
alright then so now what I can do is
read this file and we can do that using
a variety of different methods the first
method I'm going to show you is by using
a for loop so we can actually cycle
through this file this Epsom duck text
file line-by-line using a for loop I'm
going to access each line each time
around each iteration through so how do
we do that well pretty simple we just
say for then I'm going to call this
variable line you can call it whatever
you want what line makes sense to me
since that's what we're reading each
time around for line in Epsom underscore
file and then we can just print out this
line if we want to so I can say print
line let us save this and run the file
then we can see now we print out each
line of that file now you're going to
notice this gap in between each line now
we can't strip that off if we want to
and we can do that using a method called
our
great so now if I save this I'm going to
come over here and play the contents of
the console and run again now we can see
the same lines output but we stripped
out that gap in between each line ok
cool so that's one way we can read the
contents of this file using a for loop
now I want to show you another way so
I'll come over here and down here I want
to say lines I equal to itself
underscore file remember that's
listening right here our reference to
the file and then we're going to use a
method called read lines and what this
method is going to do is read the
contents of the file and each line it's
going to store as an element a string in
a list and I'm going to store that list
in this variable so now we have access
to this first of all I'm going to do is
print this list out to the console over
here so I'm going to save print and then
right now is this going to work well
let's try it so a clear first of all run
the file again and first of all we do
all that text from above up here but
then what we get is this empty list
right here there's nothing in it well I
thought we were reading the lines from
this file and storing each line in this
list so why is there nothing in it well
this is because we've already read
through the file up here where we went
through this for loop we went down line
by line through this file and by the end
we ended up here in the file at the end
so when we come to read the lines we're
already at the end of the text right
here and there's nothing else to read
which is why we're not adding anything
to the list so what we need to do is
reset the cursor over here at the start
of the file so it can read the lines
again and we do that using a method
called seek so I'm going to say down
here it's jump underscore file our
reference to the file dot seek and then
we pass in what character we want to
seek to now I want to go to the start so
that's the 0 character but if I wanted
to go to say the 100th character I can
do that as well so anyway if we seek to
the 0 character the very start to file
then we can start to read the lines and
store them in this list so let's say
this do it against Clint console and
what
and now you see right here this is where
the list starts this is where the list
ends and we can see each line is in this
list and their Commerce separates you
can see the commas right here right so
that is another way we can read the
contents now I want to show you one more
method but to do that I'm just going to
comment this stuff out so down here what
I'm going to do is say it's a file first
of all dot seek and I'm going to go to
maybe I don't know the 50th character so
we're going to read from the 50th
character right I'm just doing this to
show you then what I want to do is maybe
read 100 characters from that point so I
can say file underscore text then I can
say is equal to its own underscore file
our reference to the file dot read and
then in the brackets right here and say
how many characters we want to read I
want to read 100 so again this is going
to first of all find the 50th character
in the file start there then it's going
to read 100 characters from that point
and store that string in this file text
variable so now I just want to print
file text to the console and see what
happens
so clearly studios and run this again
now we get 100 characters from the 50th
character in ok so what we need to do
really once we've finished reading our
files and doing whatever we want to do
with the data what we need to do is
close this connection because otherwise
if we start opening the files but not
closing them it's going to take a
performance hit we want to keep them
closed
when we can't so to do that to close a
file or we say is it so underscore file
our reference got close and that's going
to close that file and now if we try to
really down here it's not going to work
right so let me go that is one way we
can open a file read stuff from it and
close it now this is cool but all this
opening and closing down here not the
best idea sometimes you forget to close
a connection it happens right so I want
to show you
out a different way to do this so I'm
going to cover all of this junk out and
what we're going to do now is start to
read this DNA sequence file instead but
to do that I'm going to show you a
different way which doesn't require us
to close the file afterwards so the way
we do this is by using the width keyword
first of all right so we're going to say
with and then open then we're going to
pass through the string which is the
location of our file we want to read so
it's in the files directory /v la
underscore sequence txt so with that
open basically we're saying as DNA
underscore files so what we're doing is
we're saying while this is open or with
this file open as DNA file that's what
we're storing this reference as do
something right so we have our colon
there so now looks like we named this
reference right here this file it's on
file and we could use methods on that
within this one DNA file and we can use
methods on that but this time around all
I'm going to do is indent our code block
here we've got this little color or
indenting a code block right so while
we're indent you that we can access this
and we can perform methods on it to read
data with this thing open and we don't
have to cause the connection if we want
to carry on later we just come out of
the code block
I'm not indenting anymore so this is in
my opinion a slightly better way to do
it
all right so the first thing I want to
do is read the lines of this file so I'm
going to say again lines are equal to
DNA on the score file our reference dots
read lines okay now then what I want to
do if you take a look at this file what
I want to do is just print out these
things right here right so I don't want
to print out these things they start
with this open angle bracket or closed
angle bracket then says sequence once
equals to and underneath is the actual
DNA sequence now all I want to print or
all I want to store in a list and these
things right here not these things so
we're going to have to read through this
file and some way filter out these
sequence lines right here so the key
word there in filter
want to learn about that so what I'm
going to do is create a function first
of all and it's going to be outside of
this color block right here it doesn't
mean to be inside so I'm going to define
a function and it's going to be called
sequence underscore filter right so what
we're going to do is pass in here align
each time that we read and then if it
has for example this close and we'll
break it in it then we're going to
disregard it if it doesn't then we're
going to keep it in the list makes sense
if you need a refresher on filters just
hit back to about five tutorials back or
something like that so inside this
function what we're going to do is
return a true or false statement right
basically so if we return through that
line that we pass in stays in the list
if we return false
that line is removed from the list so
what I'm going to do is look for this
closing bracket so I'm going to say
that's not in and then line which is the
line that we pass in so it's going to
check to see if that is not in the line
now if this is true if that is not in
the line then we want to keep this in
the list however if this is false then
we want to take it out so it's going to
return true if it's not in the line
which is cool but keeping that in a list
and false committees is going to remove
that line from the list make sense call
so now we have this filter right and
we're storing our list of all of the
lines in here so what we need to do is
apply this filter to this list so the
way we do that is by coming down here
and saying filter and then we passing
the function we want to use to filter
this list so I'll say sequence
underscore filter which is this thing we
just created then we pass you into what
list we want to run through this filter
which is lines we've just read that
right here from this file
okay so we're filtering those now and
then what we're going to do is typecast
this filter into a list remember we have
to type category because otherwise it
returns some kind of felt object so I'm
going to save a list and then pass all
of this into the brackets
now what I want to do is print the
results so I'm going to print this list
itself they've crates and then open the
brackets up again and close them
together and know this is a lot of
brackets if you want you can store them
in variables instead and then just put
the variables I'm just doing this
because I find it easier so first of all
we're reading the lines from this file
with it open then what we're doing is
we're using this filter this sequence
filter on the lines passing each line in
once at a time we're looking for this
closing angle bracket if it's not in the
line that we're going to keep that in at
the list if it is in the line we're
going to take it away because we don't
want these things in the final list so
I'll start without those lines then what
we're doing is we're typecasting that
filter into a list and printing it to
the console makes sense so let's save
this and run it and we can see now we
get this list out here and it's removed
those lines with the angle brackets in
it where it says sequence 1 sequence 2
and now we just have a list of the
actual DNA sequences which we could do
something with later on down the line
there we go really cool right so like I
said we don't now have to close this
connection because all we do if we want
to do something else is come outside of
the code block and we can carry on with
our program down here and this file
would closed ok so there we go that's
how we open and refile in many different
ways
in the next tutorial what I'm going to
do is show you how to write two files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
