tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about the view instance okay now
before I dive into any code whatsoever I
just want to show you one package I've
got installed for us and which might be
quite helpful
it's called atom live server and what
this does is spin up a local server
format and this is to a certain port so
if I press control shift three is going
to spit up a server and listen to port
3000 okay so that's what I'm going to
use to serve files in this series if
you've got your own that's fine this is
why I'm using so in the last tutorial we
added the CDN for UGS right here which
means we can now use a religious code in
this file or if we want to in an
external file which is what we're going
to do so I'm already going to head and
created this app giant file in the VGA
playlist folder there's nothing in that
whatsoever just yet I've also linked up
right here
so now we're linking to this external
file and we could do all of our view
duress code in here so then how do we
start writing view J's code well the
first thing we tend to do is make a view
instance and that is just an object that
review J's provides us with so what
we're going to do is quickly create this
instance then I'm going to explain what
it does so we'll say noobs review like
so and then we'll pass through an object
there like that okay so what does this
view instance do well its role is to
control either the whole part or just a
certain part of our application so we
could have an app with just one instance
to control the whole up so the whole app
is wearing through view j/s and that's
controlling it right or we could have an
application where they say three
instances to control three separate
areas on that website so if we were
using them as widgets for example so
imagine you have a website with a search
box a friends list and some kind of
dynamic menu each of those three kind of
widgets or components could be
controlled by a separate view instance
and they have no relation to each other
they're all controlled independently so
that's what we have the three different
view instances in our case we're just
going to use one at the view instance
could see where to control the whole
application so how does this
control the app well it takes this
object right here as a parameter and
inside this object we're going to pass
through some options remove some data
some methods to describe how this view
instance is going to control the
application right so the first thing I
want to pass through here is a property
called L and this L property is going to
be a string and it's going to say which
elements on the page this is going to
control this view instance now I said
that this is going to control the whole
application and yes it is but what we
need is a root element okay so for
example let's go to our index file and
down here create a div and this is going
to have an ID equal to view - up right
and then all of our application code all
that HTML which is rendered to the dog
is going to go inside this div so this
is the root element and this is the
element we want our view incidents to
control make sense because then it
controlling everything inside it the
whole application okay so let's go to
this and our L then is going to be this
I gave you up so let's copy it and
importantly we have to do a hash symbol
because this is an ID then paste that in
some now EMGs is going to make this
connection between this instance and
this give right here with this ID and
this view instances they control
everything to do with this and
everything inside it okay so any kind of
dynamic data which we want to output in
here is going to be controlled by that
instance any kind of interactivity your
event handling or data binding is going
to be controlled by that instance for
example we could have some kind of data
we want to store inside this instance
right and then we want to sync of UGS
okay
output it right here so how do we do
that well we do that using what's known
as template syntax or string
interpolation and say we want to heat
one and then we want to output some kind
of name or whatever there well we could
define that data in here on the view
instance then output it so we'll do a
little color
to this and our next property inside
these options is Grievous data property
this is where we store all of our data
for this view instance and this is will
be an object and inside this object is a
very different key and value pairs of
like different objects even inside this
data objects itself so with the store
name the store title refers to an array
of data whatever you want inside here
I'm just going to store a string called
name and this is really shown so say I
want to output this now to this HTML
what we need is double curly braces and
then say name and because this instance
is controlling this thing right here and
everything inside it it knows now to
look for that instance and find a data
property called name and then output it
here where these h1 is okay and we don't
have to say something like you know the
view name or whatever the name of the
instance is we'd have to do that with
just our output name and then it's going
to find that data and output it so if we
were to save this now and check it out
in a browser then we see shot we don't
see clearly braces at name so if we look
inside here we don't see those curly
braces or anything like that we just see
Shawn so how is this all working how are
you doing s taking that data and
outputting it to the Dom well this hast
email that we write here this code if
never actually output to the dog we
don't see these curly braces anywhere
okay so behind-the-scenes view GS is
taking this HTML code that we write is
creating a template from it in
JavaScript format attaching any kind of
data that we want to output and then
it's building the resulting HTML code
and it's going to render this HTML code
to the Dom which is what we see here
okay so that's what the view instance is
all about it's all about controlling a
certain part or all of the application
and storing different things within that
view TAS different options like data
we're going to have methods later on etc
and then controlling the template right
here of that view instance okay and
we're going to dive much deeper into
this as we go
so in the next tutorial what we're going
to do is move off from data and also
have a look at methods which we can
attach to this view instance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
