the old people I'm Sean from the net
ninja and this is HTML basics lesson for
your first web page alright so you might
want to take a deep breath at this point
because you need to prepare you're gonna
create your very first web page and by
the end of this you're going to
basically be a hasty mail wizard no joke
all right first things first though in
the last lesson we talked about tags and
we said that pretty much everything in a
HTML document is controlled by these
tags and we've got different types we've
got tags for text tags for images tacks
for headings you know the list goes on
and on and basically whatever you want
to show to the user you've got a tag for
it an HTML document or a web page it's
just a series of these tags built up on
each other and nested within each other
so that's where you were up to in a
minute so we're gonna take it one step
further now we're gonna dive in and
we're going to create a web page from
scratch
okay so for the rest of this course I'm
going to be using a text editor called
brackets and it's a free one so you can
download that too I'll put the link in
the video description I'll just show you
the website now where you can download
it alright so here we are brackets dot
IO with a brackets website and this is
where you want to go to download the
brackets interface now it's an awesome
text editor it's free and it's
color-coordinated so you can know what
everything is and it's got this cool
feature called intellisense which is
basically like called him so you forget
how to do something brackets is there to
help you out all right so what you want
to do is click this big download button
in the middle and you can do these for
Windows and Mac so we'll do that I've
already downloaded it it should take you
to another page nope it downloads it
automatically great I've got it twice
now you just need it once so once you've
downloaded that just run through the
installation and I'll see you on the
other side in brackets all right here we
are in brackets I've opened it up for
the first time we've got no files here
whatsoever so what we want to do is
create our first
HTML document and to do that what we
want to do is go to file and new and
you're gonna get this little thing here
on titled five mine says that's because
I've done it four times already and this
is my fifth time of taking hopefully
it's just gonna say untitled one for you
so I'm gonna save this straightaway go
to file save as and we want to call it
index.html and we're using index because
it's the first page the index makes
sense right and we're giving it the
extension dot HTML that's really really
important
every time you create a HTML document
you want to save it dot HTML all right
if you don't save it as that then the
browser is gonna be like well I don't
know what this is what you want me to do
with this is it HTML is it a word doc
you know save it as HTML every time and
the next thing you want to make sure is
that it's all files here is the file
type and then you click Save and there
we go we've got this little index.html
in the sidebar so let's get cracking now
the first thing we want to do at the top
of every HTML page is put the doctype
tank and the doctype is one of those
things that you're just gonna have to
get used to putting in the top of your
documents alright when I first started I
was like what the hell is this you know
they were so convoluted back in the day
they had loads of different doc types
but it's really simplified these days
and basically what a doctype does is it
just saves to the browser hey I'm HTML
this is the type of my document I want
you to render me as HTML alright so you
need to make sure you put this at the
top of every HTML document and it's dead
dead simple you want to open it like any
other tank you would do and you put a
exclamation mark first of all doctype
HTML simple that's all you need to do
right next thing so I'm going to quote
another author when I go through this
and I'm gonna quote James Williamson and
he says that a HTML document is very
much like a sandwich and that is an
awesome analogy a sandwich has got two
pieces of bread and a HTML
it needs two pieces of bread or rather
to tax to open it and close it and these
pieces of bread are HTML tags and would
you look at that that's another cool
feature of brackets you open attack it
closes it for you
brilliant all right so HTML there your
pieces of bread everything in your
sandwich or everything in your web page
goes between these two tags all right
now then your first time that should go
at the top is pretty much always a head
tag and you want to think of the head
tag it's like the the relish or that the
mayonnaise that goes on your sandwich
it's not the big meaty content but it's
the things that make it taste nicer and
it's the same for a web page it's the
things that tell our browser look I've
got this extra information about this
web page I don't want you to show it to
the user but I'm telling you look this
is about my web page so it's the little
extras all right and some things that go
in the head are some meta tags and they
tell you know search engines like google
your keywords so see you've got a fish
website you want to sell fish and I want
to put in my I want to tell Google look
your people search for these keywords if
people search for salmon or trout I want
them to come to my website so what you
want to do is you want to put a meta tag
in here in this head part and you put
your keywords in there other things we
can put in are the meta Cassatt and
we're going to do that now and basically
what this says is I'm using the utf-8
character set of my document and that's
pretty much a standard you don't need to
know much about it I certainly don't if
you want to read about it you're more
than welcome to there's plenty of
articles out there and would you know
it's about this tag it's got a little a
slash inside it and that's because it
doesn't have a closing tag it's a
self-contained tag I've talked about
them briefly and I think the first video
tutorial in this course where as a head
has got two tags opening and closing and
we've got the forward slash in the
second tag the closing tag this one
doesn't have a closing tag so we put the
slash just before we close the
self-contained tag and that's pretty you
know you do that with every
self-contained tag
so what else goes in the head we can put
things like CSS references we can put
things like JavaScript references I'm
going to talk about the head in the next
movie and I'm gonna talk about
JavaScript and CSS in separate tutorials
also for now we're just going to put
another tag in there called the title
and the title tag is the thing when you
open a web page and at the top of the
tab you see the website title that's
what this is so let's just call this my
first web page all right so we've done
the head for now what's next we won the
body not the bottom my mistake
don't know what the hell about we want
the body and the body is like the meat
of the sandwich the roast pork the corn
if you're vegetarian
whenever's on your sandwich and this is
in the body whenever is on your web page
that you want your users to see this is
in the body anything goes
alright so what are we gonna put in it
we're gonna put in a title and we'll
call this my first web page and then I
think we'll put a paragraph tag in as
well and we'll say yo kids
the flat no we won't because that sounds
a little strange report yo guys hope you
like my website we sell fish and there
we go we've done it that is your first
website you've got your HTML doctype tag
at the top you've got your HTML opening
tag and closing tag surrounding the
entirety of the HTML document that's
your bread you've got your head with all
your mayonnaise and everything that
you're telling the browser is about your
document and then you've got your body
you've got your meat of the HTML page
your actual content that you want your
user to see and that is the HTML
document simple as that I mean it can
get a lot more complex and we're going
to certainly pub this out as the course
goes on but for now let's just save this
and we're going to view it in a browser
another cool thing about brackets you
want to right-click by the way I just
click ctrl s to save the document if you
right click this index file here
you say show in Explorer it's going to
pop up the Windows Explorer with your
index file in it you just want to double
click this and because it's a HTML file
it had that dot HTML extension on it
it's opened up in a browser and there we
go guys we've got our first web page and
have you been following along with me
congratulations you want to give
yourself a pat on the back because that
is your very first web page alright so
just to recap we've gone through the
doctype we've gone through the opening
HTML tags the head tags and the body
tags so we're going to flesh this out a
little bit more as we go on and in the
next lesson we're going to look at the
head tag I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
