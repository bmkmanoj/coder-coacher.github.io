JavaScript for beginners lesson 36 and
in this video we're gonna start changing
some styles Wow okay then so in the last
video I showed you guys how to dive into
this HTML grabber element then read or
set the attribute values using two
methods that was get attribute and set
attribute now we can do the same thing
with the style attribute so I'm going to
do that first okay then we're going to
look at the style property so let's
first of all grab an element to play
around with and I'm going to choose this
Haiti - or right here it's got an ID of
page title so we'll store this in a
variable Kollek title equals document
get element by ID and then pass in the
ID page - title and that is going to
store this element right here in this
variable so now we can call those
methods on it so we'll say title set
attribute and currently you'll notice
it's got no style attribute associated
with it but that's okay because we can
use this method right here to give it a
style attribute so we'll say that we
want a style attribute giving it to it
okay and then the value of that style
attribute is going to be
position:relative all right cool let's
press ENTER and you'll see now it's
updated over here in the HTML and it's
giving it that style attribute with a
value of position:relative cool now
let's add another will say title dot set
attribute and we'll say we want to
update the style attribute and this time
we want to pass in a left of 10 pixels
right we want to add that rocks we now
press Enter ah now you'll notice that
it's overridden this rule I didn't want
to do that I wanted to add it to it all
right but what it's done is say okay
well whatever you've put in here I'm
going to replace all of what's currently
there with that okay so if we wanted to
update this here so it's got both rules
in we'd have to do something like this
we'd have to save that and then
when 10 pixels as well so both within
this value parameter right here press
enter and there we go it's updated it
now as you can imagine this is going to
get tiresome if you need to add styles
on the fly and technically you could do
it by substituting a variable in here to
grab the current style content and then
appending to it but again not the best
way of doing it I prefer to use the
style property and that is something
like this we take title dot style and
then dot and then we'd say whichever
property name CSS property name that we
want to update now I will update the
left property right here okay so
currently it's 10 pixels but I'm going
to say equals now now within quotes I'm
going to say 20 pixels so we'll change
from 10 to 20 and I press ENTER and that
there my friends has updated this
property right there but it's left this
property intact which is cool all right
so I don't have to worry about what's
currently there I just update the styles
that I want so we can do this again I'll
say title dot style dot top and then
give that a value of 10 pixels and press
Enter and cool that's worked as well
let's do another title got color set
that oops title got styled up call it
beg your pardon set that equal to red
awesome that's updated there as well now
what if we do something with two words
will say title dot style dot and then
we'll say background color background -
color this is how we write it in CSS
right and we'll change that to blue but
in JavaScript we get an error and that's
because of this - our right here when we
update properties this way we don't use
a hyphen we use camel case so this in
fact would be let's copy that paste it
down here this would be instead
background color with a capital C and
then we set it equal to blue press Enter
and now it updates alright then guys so
that is how to update styles in
JavaScript
