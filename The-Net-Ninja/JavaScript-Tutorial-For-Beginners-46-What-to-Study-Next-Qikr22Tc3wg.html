very last JavaScript for beginners
lesson number 46 what the hell to do
next
Wow alright first of all guys I just
want to say a huge thank you to you all
for watching this video playlist I've
really enjoyed making this one
javascript is a really cool language to
program in so yeah thanks again for
sticking around with me hope it's been
of some benefit to you
however we ain't finished there there's
more to come this was just a beginner
class and in the future I'm going to do
other tutorial series that and more
advanced but if you want to do some
further reading yourself you can look at
some JavaScript libraries we've already
briefly seen jQuery that is a really
cool library tons of stuff you can do
with that and there's loads of kind of
tutorials on the jQuery website and I'm
also going to be doing a cool jQuery
series right after this one so stay
tuned for that
another library's new tools and not
quite as popular but still good so you
can check that out and modernize as well
which is more to do with kind of keeping
up with browser standards so that's a
cool little library to look into also
I'll probably do a tutorial series on
moderniser as well in the future maybe
mootools depending on how many people
want it alright we've also got Ajax and
Jason and yeah you've probably heard of
these things they were like buzz words
for awhile people like to use them a lot
and basically people sometimes think of
Ajax as a completely different
technology to JavaScript but it ain't
it's just the same thing it's just
essentially a part of JavaScript a way
of working with it and what it does is
allow us to communicate with a server
using JavaScript without having to leave
that page I'll refresh the web page
which is really cool and a great example
is when you use Google Maps and you know
when you like scroll in to zoom in you
get more detail that is basically ajax
going to the server
bringing back new information
and then displaying that in the browser
without refreshing the browser so really
cool now Jason is basically just a way
of organizing data and sometimes we
might store data on your server in the
form of Jason or if we go and get like a
Twitter feed or something like that then
maybe we'll get data back in the form of
Jason which is just like an object
notation way of storing data and it
works really well with JavaScript so
kind of goes hand-in-hand with Ajax as
well so again in the future look out for
this course on my youtube channel
because I am going to go into a jet and
do a whole playlist on that in the
future all right
and lastly basically we've kind of just
covered the first part of JavaScript in
this playlist this was like a beginners
course bare essentials and now you're
gonna have enough guys to go off and
start making some little programs of
your own and experimenting but there's
still quite a lot we haven't covered so
things like regular expressions which
are used in advanced form validation to
check that like you've entered your
email correctly and you have not entered
some you know random word like hamburger
or something like that all right so
we're going to do that in the future
object oriented it'll climb and say it
oo B which stands for object orientated
programming and we can kind of replicate
this in JavaScript and a lot of people
do so I'll kind of maybe touch on that
in the future as well and then finally
if there's loads of kind of projects
that I want to show you how to do things
like image sliders drag and drop project
animated menus so I'm going to cover all
of these things and more in the future
so stay tuned guys if you have anything
else that you want me to cover then feel
free to comment down below love to hear
your feedback also don't forget to
subscribe guys you'll catch all the
updates and I'll see you in the next
tutorial series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
