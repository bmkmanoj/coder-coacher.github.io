three-point fifth rehab tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you the
react dev tools okay so before I go any
further and show you those tools I just
want you to check out one thing in the
last tutorial we created this component
and it had one element in it but what if
we want more say for example I wanted
after the h1 a paragraph tag to say
hello something like that okay now okay
let's save this and see if it works come
to the browser and it's not working and
if we look in the console you can see
we've get these errors right here so
what's happening here is we've got two
top-level tags within the return
statement now react doesn't like that it
wants you to put everything in the
return statement in one parent tag so we
can't still do this but the way we get
around it is by doing a div tag at the
top get the closing tag and put it at
the end if you can okay this isn't going
well okay so I'll put it at the end like
that and shift these in and now because
everything is contained within one
parent tag this will not work so ever
save it check it out now in the browser
this should work if i refresh okay
ninjas hello so we can't add multiple
elements but we have to put everything
within one single parent tag okay so
anyway now I want to show you the react
dev tools so I'm just going to zoom into
the console right here and you can see
on my toolbar I have the reactor tab I
never click on that resume out one
because we can't see anything at all
okay you can see this to-do components
so it's showing the components on my
application which is really cool and not
only does it show you the component but
if you click on it it's going to show
you the props and the state of that
component etc and you can expand it to
see what's inside so that is really cool
now I'll talk about props and state and
everything later but I want to show you
how to download this react dev tool so
you can use it when you're developing so
what you want to do is go to the Chrome
Web Store and search for react div
the tools it's right here I've already
installed it but if you click on that
you should see an Add to Chrome button
so just click that and then that is
going to install it for you so all you
ever need to do then is just right click
I've got to inspect or open up your
console however you want to do it and
then go to react and it's going to show
you the different components on the
application if it's a react website so
some other websites which use react is
the BBC home page so I've gone to open
my dev tools again and got to react and
you can see there's quite a lot of
different components in this thing this
thing this thing and when I click on one
you can see now the props here there are
all the different properties inside this
component and I know you don't know what
these are in a minute I'm just showing
you we have all these different
information snippets about this
component so you can see how you've done
it and you can expand them okay which is
really cool
so the BBC use it and also air B&amp;amp;B use
it so again in the react app I can see
the different components that they've
created expand them see the information
about them etc so I think this is a
really cool tool that you can download
it's really going to help you when it
comes to developing react applications
and also looking at how other people
have developed them to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
