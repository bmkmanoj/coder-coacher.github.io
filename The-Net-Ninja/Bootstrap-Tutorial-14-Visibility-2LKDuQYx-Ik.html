fourteenth bootstrap 3 tutorial and in
this video we're gonna talk about
visibility Wow alright then campus so
boots job gives us a few different
classes we can use to control the
visibility and display type of elements
on our webpage so it's pretty simple to
hide elements we use a class called
hidden - then whatever size you want to
hide it out ok so then that element will
be hidden at that particular size that
break point to show elements then we use
the other class visible - whatever break
point or size rather that you want to
show that element out so if I do visible
XS then this element is only going to be
visible at that size if I do visible MD
it's only gonna be visible at medium
size screens and not visible at the rest
okay so we can also use a variation of
these invisible classes which is visible
then size like empty then - you'll
display type now that can be block
inline or inline block now when we use
this by default it uses block okay but
we can also specify that as well
ourselves and we can use inline or
inline block to kind of overwrite this
default behavior so we'll jump into the
code now and show you a few examples
alright then guys so we have got our
images here much like the last lesson if
I save and just go over here and refresh
ignore those pink boxes for now we've
still got those four images up like that
so what I want to do is hide a couple of
these at specific sizes right so what
I'll say is for the first one I will use
hidden and then at X s so extra small
screen sizes I want to hide that first
one and then on the last one I'll say
hidden at will say LG two large screens
right so for all other widths then all
four are gonna show but for extra small
widths this first one is not going to
show and then for large widths this last
one it's not going to show so let's move
over to the browser and have a look now
first of all if we go to the large one
we should knock off that last one
perfect so that does it show then we'll
move through the other wits
I'll show until we get to extra small
yeah and now is only three didn't notice
but the first one is dropped off as well
so the first one yeah it's shredder over
here so what shredders got all right
cool so that's how we are hide elements
and they're only hidden for that
particular width all right so let's get
rid of those now and then what I want to
do is say use the visible class and what
I'll do is say this is only gonna be
invisible extra small screens okay then
this one down here is only gonna be
visible at and I'll say medium screens
okay
so extra small screens this first image
is going to be visible but for the rest
of the spectrum of width is starting to
be visible okay that's what this
clusters and then likewise for this let
me the obsess screens this image is
going to be visible but for the rest of
the width extra small small and large
it's not gonna be visible all right so
let's save this bad boy and reviewing in
a bruiser save okay so what's going on
here let's have a look rip the extra
small width right and if we look in the
code then it says it's visible
extra small widths only okay that's the
first one so let's have a look at that
cool then as we go to the next
breakpoint none of them are visible that
this is the small breakpoint because
like I say this is only visible at the
Escher small width now with the small so
it's not visible and this is only
visible at the medium width went out in
a small so he's still not visible all
right so he's only showing those other
two in the middle is that right image
for yeah that's right okay so as we get
to the medium then the third the last
image should come on we should get three
there it is okay but when we get to the
large screens that one's going to go
back off okay so I know this might look
a little bit complicated at first but
basically all we're saying is look I
only 1 whatever element I apply this
class to I only wanted to show at this
width okay I don't want it to be visible
at this width okay if you just want to
hide it for a particular width you use
the
hated plastic instead all right so let's
get rid of those two classes now just
ignore those images for a minute when I
come down here we're having a bit of
code and I basically this is just two
nice manly pink boxes and what I've said
is that I want these to be visible only
at the medium size right now remember by
default when we use visible MD they are
given that style of that display type of
block okay that's the way bootstrap
works and by default these elements
without bootstrap are inline style
elements so what we're doing is actually
by doing this giving this element access
to all those kind of block level
properties such as the width we control
the width and stuff so if I save this
now and open this up in a browser we
need to get to the medium size which is
there okay so now these two spans have
got that width and they're showing the
width because they're being displayed as
block level elements and we're getting
that display type of block right here
somewhere there it is visible MD you can
see that's the class we apply to to
display blocks that's what bootstrap
does it gives it a display type of block
okay but we can override this by saying
in line at the end of that so we could
say visible MD and we want to show it as
an inline element so let's take a gander
at what that does to us all right now
these are inline elements pretty cool
yeah you can see they're a visible MD in
line that's the display type in line so
now they no longer get those block level
properties applied to them like the
width because inline elements don't get
those right so let us now change this to
inline block and the behavior of inline
block is like a combination of inline
and block so they go from left to right
still in line but we also get access to
those block level properties such as the
width so let's save that
take a look what it does okay perfect so
we're getting that width to 40% which is
what they're taking up each and we're
also seeing them in line okay so that's
it for the visibility classes some
hidden classes if you've got questions
