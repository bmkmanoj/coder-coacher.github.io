last PSD to WordPress lesson and in this
video I want to show you where you can
go to take your WordPress knowledge
further Wow are they mean just so first
things first I want to say a huge thank
you for bearing with me during this
tutorial series
I hope it's had some impact on you and
it's been beneficial to you in somewhere
on there so hopefully now you can go out
and at least attempt to make your own
WordPress theme okay
so thanks once again but there are a few
different things we can do to take up
WordPress knowledge further this course
has been a fairly kind of beginner ish
okay we've delved into a few more
advanced topics like creating custom
loops but it's kind of an introductory
course if you like to theme development
there's tons to learn alright and this
website right here has been a goldmine
for me in the past when I've been
learning WordPress okay
it's the wordpress code reference I'll
leave this link down below if you want
to go check it out I've spent days and
weeks in here just mining through the
different functions and what they do all
the different options here from the API
so if you want to learn something you
have to do is search for it here I'll
just click on what they suggest here and
you can read all about it it gives you
an in-depth discussion most of the time
tells you what parameters the functions
take where to use it etc a really good
reference site so go check that out
second thing I want to show you is the
plug-in directory and I mentioned once
before you can pretty much do anything
you want in WordPress with a plug-in any
kind of extra functionality you want to
add to your website there will be a
plug-in most likely for you and I know
that's not always the answer sometimes
you want a very custom approach to
something and for that my friends you
are going to have to probably learn PHP
otherwise you can go and check out the
plug-in directory search all these
plugins and find something for your
WordPress site which is pretty cool
they all have well most of them have
good documentation so they'll tell you
how to use them and all that jazz the
third thing I want to show you is the
theme directory and when I first started
great themes I didn't really know where
to start
so what I do is have looked for themes
in the theme directory and a download
them and
browse through the code and I'd find
common pieces in the code between
different themes and that's how I kind
of learn a bill from these common common
pieces so what I suggest you do is go
and check out a few different themes
download a few that you like check out
the code if there's any kind of neat
functionality or dynamic stuff that you
like on it
find out how they do it by just delving
into the code that's all there is to it
so like I say these are the three kind
of areas I'd probably go off and
research to take your knowledge one step
further in the future I'm also going to
do a WordPress 101 playlist on this
channel so I'm going to be doing like
tip bits here and there little one video
tutorials and how to do more advanced
things in WordPress so stay tuned for
that I'm also going to do probably a PHP
course in the future as well so if you
want to kind of dive deeper into
WordPress and create your own plugins
are extending in any way shape or form
then you want to then you're going to
want to check that course out that's
probably coming in a few weeks time so
yeah thanks once again for watching this
playlist if you have any questions
whatsoever whatsoever feel free to
comment down below
one of us guys don't forget to subscribe
share and like and I'm going to see you
in a very next playlist I crate
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
