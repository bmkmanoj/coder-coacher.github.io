tutorial and in this video we'll take a
look at how it can extend our templates
so then to explain exactly how extending
templates works and why we'd want to do
that I want to walk you through a simple
scenario imagine in this application we
have not one template but say 20 or 25
templates now in each of those templates
the way things are going here in the way
we're doing things we'd have all of this
stuff at the top the head and the body
and maybe some kind of footer down here
as well now if we want to at some point
update the head for example of our
website then we'd have to go through
each of those individual templates and
change the head in each one of them and
that is a lot of work and probably not
the best way of arranging our templates
we can do this a better way and we can
do it by extending a base template so
the idea here is that we should have a
base template which has all of the
global stuff that's on every template
like the head the stuff at the top maybe
a footer as well
all that goes in some kind of base
global template then our individual
templates extend that template so they
have the base template around them and
then we nest specific content for that
individual template inside it so I'll
show you how we can do that in this
tutorial so first of all let's create
our global base template and we'll do
that inside this templates folder we
created way back in one of the first
lessons so we'll create a new file and
call this base underscore layout dot
HTML and inside here we want to create
the HTML which will appear on pretty
much every single page in our
application so all of that stuff we've
already created inside this thing so
it's all of the head and the opening
body tag paste all of that inside the
base layout because that will be on
every template as well then all of this
stuff is unique to this individual
template right here article list but
this stuff at the bottom that will be on
every single template as well so this
right here this is our base template
this is the stuff that will appear
everywhere
now then the stuff unique to each
individual template will go right here
and in fact what I'll also do is create
a div with a class of rapper because I
think that will be on every single
template as well and then that
individual template content will go
inside this wrapper for each of those
templates so how do we then say that
look this is where we want our template
content to go well we can create a block
and we can create various blocks and
output those blocks wherever we want
inside this base template for example if
I want to create a block here I can open
up the template tags and then say that I
want to create a block first of all then
the name of that block which I'll call
content because this will be the main
content of the actual template then we
need to end the block so again template
tags then end block like so so now we're
saying hey look in this base template
this is where we want a block called
content to go so if you come across a
block called content in an individual
template I want you to take that and I
want you to put it right here inside
this global template so let's do that if
we go into this individual template
right now the first thing we need to do
is get rid of all of this because it's
already in our base template so this is
the only stuff that's unique to this
individual template right now and then
at the top we need to say first of all
that this file this template is going to
extend from this base template and the
way we do that is by using our template
tags again so curly braces percentage
like so and inside we say extends and
then in single quotes base underscore
layouts dot HTML all right so now Django
knows that this template wants to extend
from this template or right here now I
that we need to say where the block is
because we have this block right here
and Django will look for this block
called content inside our individual
templates and if it finds it it's gonna
grab all of that block and paste it
right here so we need to say look this
is that block and the way we do that is
by saying curly brace use percentage
again then block and then the block name
which is content like so and then at the
end after the block has ended we can
open up our curly braces percentage
again and say and lock to say this is
where the block ends so then let's just
neaten this up a little bit and save it
and this should hopefully all still work
if i refresh over here we still get the
articles page and it still got all of
that style in it and whatnot because
we're extending from this base layout so
now when we create new templates we
don't need to write all of the head out
again we've already got that base layout
we just write the individual content for
that particular template and say look
this will be injected into this block
called content on this main template
okay so there you go my friends that is
how we extend templates in Django</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
