19th angular2 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about directives
okay so what the heck are directives
they are just instructions and they're
instructions which tell angular to do
something or that depending on the
directive that we use and we've already
seen a few directive so far in this
series a couple of them are here first
one is this router outlet which is in
the form of a tag and this tells angular
to load in the view that this point
won't finds in the tags when we request
a specific one in the URL bar this one
down here this router link takes the
form of a hex demurrer property and this
allows us to load in different views
without reloading the actual page so
typically when we're working with
directives there's two kinds attribute
and structure attribute directives
interact with the element that it's
sitting on in order to change its
appearance or properties for example ng
class which allows us to give the
element different classes structural
directives changes the actual structure
of the HTML code when it's output to the
browser for example ng F or ng 4 so
we're going to look at both of these
kinds in this tutorial ok so before we
start I just want to show you I've made
a few changes to the files that were
working on I've just cleaned them up a
little bit that's all first of all in
the abductor out file I've changed this
back to directory instead of using the
parameters on this one I've also gone
into the app component type script file
and I've just ripped out all the
different variables we had here so it's
nice and clean just the title remaining
in the home component type script file
I've also cleaned up this nothing in the
constructor and only this home title
left in the class in the directory
component nothing left in it just this
ng on in it and this constructor
function and in the home component HTML
just this whole title in the P tag a
finally in this directory component just
this P tag a valid these Styles down
here these different classes for this
tutorial ok cool so let's take a look at
these different directives that we can
use first of all I'm going to take a
look up the attribute directives which
sits on an element and it changes the
way that element look
essentially okay now one type is ng+ so
I'm going to show you that first of all
so ng+ is how it's written and we set
this equal to something now we're going
to need property binding for this
particular directive so to do that we
need to pop these little square brackets
around it like so then ng class expects
an object in here so we use object
notation and then the way we do this is
by supplying a list of properties which
are going to be the class names and
their values are going to be either true
or false and it is true then this
element has that class if it's false
then this element doesn't have that
class okay
so these are the classes of pre-made
blue red and underlined so let's make
these in the object we have to put them
in the single quotes right here because
we're already using double quotes okay
so the class is going to be a balloon
first of all that's the property name
and then this is going to be set equal
to true in this case comment next well
then red is going to be false so I don't
want it to have the red class and then
finally underlined I'm going to set this
equal to true as well so now we should
have underlined class and blue class
when we save so let's give this
somewhere I've saved it and let's just
refresh over here and cool there we go
blue and underlined so that's worked now
if we go back and change these so we'll
change the red to true and we're going
to set change blue to false and then
underline or set this to false as well
and save it then check it out in a
browser to make sure it's updated cool
so this has worked as well awesome so
you can see if we inspect this element
that it's going to have this red class
and that's the only class it has if we
would have checked this before it would
have had the blue and the underlined
class so it's applying these classes to
it dependent on the values of these
properties in this object and the cool
thing is this object doesn't have to be
here it can sit on the component class
itself so let's go into that is the
directory component right here and if I
create a variable called classes and set
this equal to this object right here and
save it
in the view over here what I'm going to
do is set this equal to classes because
we have access to that variable oops
right here okay so I've saved this as
well and hopefully now this will still
work will just refresh cool yeah this
still works it's still getting that red
color awesome and the cool thing is now
we can just go in and if the user is
interacting with this view for example
they click a book to change the
different classes then we could change
these on the fly in the class and we
could change this to false underlined to
true and save that and this is going to
update how it looks in the view itself
awesome so that's updated there as well
okay so I'm going to show you another
directive now and this time it's going
to be a structural directive so I'm
going to do another P tag right here and
I'll say only show is test is true so
I'm going to use ng if and this is a
structural directive and structural
directories have this little asterisks
in front of them so ng if are necessary
equal to something now the way that ng F
works is that it only shows a particular
tag in the HTML if whatever is in here
evaluates to true if it's true then this
P tag is output to the view if it's
false then this P tag doesn't appear
interview okay so let's just take a look
we'll set it equal to true first of all
and save this and head over to the
browser to refresh okay so that's
showing right there and then if I set
this to false then this shouldn't show
and let's refresh cool and now that
doesn't show so this is changing the
structure of the HTML code it's either
showing this element or it's not showing
this element and again we don't have to
declare true or false right here we can
do that on the actual component itself
so I could create another variable down
here I'll test and set that equal to
true and save this component and then in
the view again I could set this equal to
the variable we just created which was
called test here on the directory and
then if that is equal to true it's going
to show if it's not equal to true then
it's not going to shelter let's just
right alright awesome so that is working
as well so that is your introduction to
directives like I said we can have
attribute directives like this or we can
have structural directives like this we
are going to look at more as we go
through this series coming up in the
next video is ng for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
