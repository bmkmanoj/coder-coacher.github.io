jQuery for beginners lesson 14 and in
this video we're gonna start working
with classes Wow okay so in this
tutorial I want to show you three simple
methods in jQuery that we can use to
manipulate classes in your HTML
documents and the three methods are
remove class and that does what it says
on the tin it removes a class that you
specify from the matched elements add
class does exactly the opposite it adds
a class which again you specify to the
merged elements and toggle class kind of
combines these two together so that it
adds or removes it depended on its
current state okay so let's start with
this remove class and what I want to do
is remove this wrapper class from this
div right there okay so if you remember
the wrapper is keeping everything
essentially if I remove the wrapper
class from this div in the header then
the header is gonna splay right to the
left and right and go full width makes
sense so let's do that let's first of
all grab this div now we know it's in
the header so we can write header don't
wrap it yeah and it's gonna grab that
div right there then all we need to say
is remove plus and the class we want to
remove is little wrapper class which is
that thing right there so let's save
that and beautiful screen now you can
see it's no longer keeping it within the
central column because we've removed
that class all right now what we can do
is add the class so I'm going to copy
this gonna paste it down here and I'm
gonna change this to add and we need
that dollar sign at the start now this
is not gonna work and the reason it's
not gonna work is because it's looking
in the header for a div with this class
now we remove this class right here so
it no longer has that so instead what
I'm gonna do is the descendant selector
like that the immediate descendant and
then sake div now what this means is get
the header and then get the deal that's
directly under that header the direct
child okay so it's going to grab that
div right there
if you don't know what this means then
feel free to check out my CSS for
beginners of playlist I'll leave the
link down below so now we've got that D
if we want to add the class wrapper so
it's going to keep it within that
central column again so if I save this
again then we should say yep it's within
that central column now the last one
right here
toggle class is a little bit different
typically we'd use toggle class if we
for example click on a button and that's
what I'm going to do for this little
example now what I want to do is say
when this button is clicked right here I
want these to show initially I'm gonna
hide these so I need to go into the CSS
first of all let's do that lets go into
the style dot CSS and you can see I've
added this class right here open and
then we've given open a height of auto
and set that to important okay so then
basically whatever the height naturally
is is gonna be the height okay so what I
want to do now is find this element in
the HTML you can see it's down here
somewhere Lee burn our main content
points of sale now what I want to do is
just say style equals height zero and
then all the flow hidden save that and
refresh over here now because this
section as a height of zero and we're
saying hide anything that overflows at
height nothing is showing whatsoever
right so what I want to happen is when
we click this button I want this to show
and to do that what I need to do is add
the open class to this section because
when the open class is applied remember
it's giving it a height and auto and
send it to important so it's going to
override that height of zero rule okay
then when we click it again I want it to
take this class away so that it hides
the content again makes sense yeah let's
do that now I'm gonna use vanilla
JavaScript to do this event because
you've not called jQuery events yet so
the first thing I want to do is grab
this element right here
no sorry at this element because that's
the click event that's
click event will be happening so that is
in the lead banner and it's this thing
right here so let's grab that we say bar
butter equals and then we can use jQuery
to grab it it's in the lead - banner and
then it's the anchor tag within that and
there's only one so it's going to grab
this thing or right here okay now let's
do the JavaScript event we say button
and then we need to unwrap it remember
because we're going to use vanilla
JavaScript so we do that by specifying
which object we want in that array which
returned that javascript object
so we've unwrapped it there by
specifying the zeroth one then we can
save dot on click equals a function and
then within that function is where all
the magic is going to happen so
basically all I need to do in this is
toggle the class of this points of sale
section yep so let's grab that points of
sale like this and then what I'm gonna
do is save toggle class and the class
we're going to toggle is open and then
after that I'm going to return false and
the reason I've returned false is
because when you click this button I
don't want that to be I don't want it to
go anywhere okay so I'm returning false
I'm kind of negating that default
behavior by an anchor tag all right so
this should do it guys let me just save
that and test it if i refresh over here
if you want will work yet it shows up
click again and it hides it on off on
off etc okay so what's happening here
guys is that we're saying every time we
click this button yeah toggle the class
open all these points of sale right so
currently it doesn't have that flex when
we click the button toggle the class
which means basically give it that plus
alright so when we click it again it
currently has that class so take it away
that's what toggle does
gives it or it takes it away depending
on whether it has it or not already
alright then so they are the class
methods guides if you have any questions
about this feel free to comment down
below otherwise I'll see you in the very
