CSS positioning lesson 4 and in this
video I want to show you how to float
elements ah alright then guys so before
we start coding anything at all I want
to show you a couple of things I've
already done the first thing is this div
with a class of wrapper now that is
where all of our content is going to go
in this playlist so you can see within
here I've got all of this content which
is commented out correct I'm going to go
through all of that in a second but this
wrapper is this white thing over here
you can see I've given it these styles
down in the CSS it's got a background of
white max width of 960 pixels padding of
20 pixels all the way around and then
this margin it was zero top environment
and auto left and right now this Auto
value right here is what's positioning
this wrapper this rapid if in the center
and it's giving it this margin of auto
left and right now I talked about that
in the CSS for beginners play this so
I'll leave a link to that down below if
you want to check it out this final rule
right here you don't really need to pay
attention to this is just clearing some
floats and I'm going to talk about all
of that later so ignore that for now so
what I want to do is talk about floats
now floating is one of the most used
techniques in page layouts for server
for positioning content and it lets us
position an element to the very left or
the very right of a parent element and
in doing so it removes itself and that
normal document flow we've been talking
about now initially for it was designed
to a developer could wrap text around an
image but nowadays it's useful other
things too like making text columns or
grid galleries things like that okay so
to begin with let's look at that image
example wrapping text around the image
okay so you can see right here I've got
this cloud JPEG this is just a little
cloud picture I found online and I'll
show you guys that now just this little
thing right here very prettier so what I
want to do is put that image right here
so do my image oops it's all capitals
image source equals cloud there we go
found it all right just like that what
the hell have I done all right guys
there we go flag doc JPEG then it's
absolutely huge so we're just going to
give that a whip of
300 there we go that'll do right now if
we were to put a paragraph tag
underneath and I tell you well let's get
some lorem ipsum shall we
lorem ipsum all right larysa gangster
this is what I'm talking about let's
grab this second paragraph it's a bit
bigger so I'm going to copy and paste
that right here in the P tags and save
that then you can see what's happening
is the paragraph is going below the
image that is normal document flow rate
and that is how before floats this would
have been displayed on a web page now
this is where floats were originally
designed now if we float this image
let's come down here to the stack also
we'll just save image float left what
we're doing it is floating that image to
the left we're taking it out of the
normal document flow and we're
positioning it to the very left of the
document or the very left of the parent
element right which is this wrapper so
what we'd want to do as well is give
this a margin of say 10 pixels just so
the the text is not right up against the
side now we can float left which is
positioned it to the leftmost area of
the parent element or we can float it to
the right so if I delete this and put
right instead it is exactly the same but
it flows to the right and now this time
the text is over here all right
so pretty cool then we can mess around
with this let's make it 400 or even 200
yeah 100 so you see the text now goes
below it right so as soon as the height
of the element is reached then the
texting go below that image so that was
what the float was initially intended
for let's just delete this stuff that we
just don't because I want to show you
some more techniques we can use by using
the float so i'm going to uncomment
these three things right here and I'm
gonna get rid of this stop here and you
can see now if I come up here I've got
these styles down here and it's just
blue red green and box all right so
let's uncomment those and you can see
what I've done now is just made 3d
IFS what with a class of blue one with
red one with green and they've all got a
class of box right so I've just colored
the blue red ones and the green ones by
giving them a background color and then
the box I've given a height of 100
pixels now by default these div elements
are taking at 100% width that's because
they are block level elements and by
default block level elements take up
100% width right so what we need to do
is specify a width property I'm going to
say 100 pixels and make them into
perfect squares right now I want to show
you these floats in action right so what
I'm going to do is come to the blue box
right here I'm going to float this to
the right and now you can see what
happens is this blue box flops all the
way over to the right but that's not the
only thing that's happened as well as
that these two boxes right here have
scooted upwards right and that's because
this blue box has been taken out of
normal document flow so it no longer
occupies any height in normal document
flow it's been taken out there and it's
been floated to the right okay so that's
what happens the content underneath it
then scoots up as if the floated element
wasn't there at all likewise I could
float this red element let's float it to
the left this time and okay the red
element doesn't move but the green
element vanishes you might be thinking
what's got on there well again we've
taken the red element out of normal
document flow now it's not moved
anywhere because it was already on the
left so we're flowing it to the left but
it's not needed to move position right
but the green one has zoomed up and it's
gone behind the red element right and I
can demonstrate that by giving this a
margin left of 10 pixels so now you can
see that little green element sneaking
behind all right if I change this
instead to float right you're going to
see that green element is there at the
top likewise I can come down here and
float this to the right and it's going
to zoom it over there or could float it
to the left and it's not going to move
either way we've now taken the green one
out of normal document flow also all
right so that is floating in action and
you can probably start to see now
we can use this to make grid galleries
if I float this to the right you can
imagine now that we could have a gallery
of thumbnails going all the way across
and about four columns deep or whatever
right so that is one of the uses of the
float property now what I want to do is
show you one more thing alright we're
going to do practical use of this float
property so I'm going to delete these
things right here like that and a custom
or the styles back here well one of the
style and all this is doing let's get
rid of that comment there we go okay so
what we're doing here is putting three
gifts in the document each with a class
of service right and I want you to
imagine this is a website where a
company has three services on offer but
they want to display them a little nicer
than this so we've got the service title
in each div and we've got the service
description in the paragraph tag right
so while I've done so far is targeted
those h2s and those PS and I've given
them a color enlarging and a text align
property so now what I want to do is
flow each of these service boxes or
these service divs to the left of this
tag left to right so let's do that now
you just want the service class and then
we're going to flow each one to the left
right still doesn't look very nice so
we'll give it some other properties will
say background EEE
and then we'll say padding I know it
will say width first is 29% right and
I've done 29% because they also want to
give them a margin of 1% and padding of
1% all right so now 29% and remember
we've got margin left and right so which
one percent on either side so that takes
up to 31 yet then with the padding left
and right as well that takes up to 33%
in total width right so 33 3333 which
means 99% width which is virtually
default kind of length
if we wanted to get picky we could say
twenty nine point three three and then
it's going to be 33.33% with each one in
trouble all right so let's give this a
height of one hundred and forty pixels
something like that oops little fourteen
to the forty all right guys so now you
can see this is taking shape and okay
you might not display exactly like this
but oftentimes a company with a website
will display the services in little
blocks left to right like this I'm going
to use the float property right there to
do that if I was to take this away it
would look pretty rubbish don't you know
you've got all this space over here
that's wasted it's not presented in a
logical way where is this looks much
better all right so this is another
example of how we'd use the float
property to structure elements on a web
page all right so that's it for this
lesson if you have any questions about
this whatsoever feel free to drop
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share and like and
I'll see you in the very next tutorial
where we're going to look at clearing
these floats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
