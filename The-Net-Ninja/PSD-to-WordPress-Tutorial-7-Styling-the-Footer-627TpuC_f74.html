PSD to WordPress lesson 7 and in this
video we're gonna star the footer
Wow alright so look at this gang we've
almost done the HTML and CSS for this
page right here the only thing left is
this footer at the bottom that's only
going to take a few minutes so let's get
cracking if we take a quick look at the
PSD we see the footer background is this
calll I'm just gonna press tab or shift
rather to grab this color picker find
that color right there and copy it and
I'm going to color up the footer that
color so let's grab that footer and give
it a background of that pull up we just
grabbed like that now you're gonna note
something any guys the footage stretches
right up to the top of these elements
right here and again this is because
we've not cleared those floats because
each of these Li tags are floated to the
left that means that the parent element
this UL tag right up here let's find it
where is it this one here this has
collapsed
okay so what we need to do is grab that
and then do the clay fix which we've
been doing on previous elements so I'll
grab the featured you well then I'll do
an after pseudo-class to insert some
content which is just going to be an
empty string and then we want it to
display as a lot and then we want it to
clear oh and now we're gonna get that
footer down below because all these are
cleared now alright so we've done that
little trick there to play the floats
within that element now we can apply
some margin to this will do a margin top
off about what your pics or something
like that that will do and will also
give me some padding at the top and it
will say about 30 pixels to the top and
bottom than 0 left and right awesome so
now what we want to do is grab these
URLs right here and float them to the
left right because they're all stacked
from left to right going across so let's
grab those 48 new ELLs and float them to
the left like that now again you can see
this
corrupt this flotsam this photo because
all of these elements within it are
floaty that I would not play them so
let's again grab the footer do this
little player fixed by saying after to
inject some empty comforter empty
content can't say that guy's empty
content after around at the end of the
footer source a content empty display
block and then three both alright so now
we've done that let's come back down to
these we're gonna say padding:0 and
we're gonna get rid of those little
circles list-style-type:none and then
we're going to change the color of all
of these Li tags or Li types within the
UL s to something like EEE like that
perfect we also need to give them a
width will say 23% that means that they
can have a margin right of 2% like that
just to spread them out a little bit
perfect alright so let's move on now to
the Li tags or State footer alright and
the first thing I want to do is just
give them a little bit of margin so 10
pixels top and bottom and then to left
the right here in fact that's the only
thing we need to do with the Li toes
final thing we need to do is just stir
up these links right here because
they're all horrible and purple and you
can hardly see them at a minute so let's
say footer 8 and stop those babies up by
saying color EEE
and then text-decoration:none none
whatsoever
I'm just gonna get rid of that line
underneath them alright so let's save
those now and let's have a look at this
thing in the full browser looking pretty
sweet guys we've got everything sorted
now pretty much in the HTML and the CSS
for this basic home page so now what
we're going to do is start applying this
to WordPress making our very own theme
but the first thing we need to do is
install a server on our local computer
so what I'm going to do is go through
all
first in a very next tutorial I have
been going quite fast so far through
this series and that's because I just
wanted to get to a point pretty quickly
where we've got some HTML and CSS to
work with I mean this isn't a HTML
course or anything like that you should
already know but HTML or CSS so maybe if
you're struggling keeping up at this
point you might want to check out my CSS
for beginners or hasty muffle beginners
or even my PSD to HTML series I'll leave
the links to all of those down below but
what I will do from now on because we're
getting into new territory and when we
start diving into the WordPress stuff I
am gonna start going a little bit slower
alright so everyone can keep up and
again if you have any comments questions
or anything like that feel free to leave
those down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share like and I'll
see you in the very next video where
we're going to set up a server on a very
old Windows machine I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
