now where we user types in their name
and clicks enter chat now we need to
figure out a way whereby we grab this
name when they click this button and we
push it into the next component the chat
component so that the chat component
knows what the name is so essentially
what we'll be doing is passing in this
name property into the chat component as
a prop when we click this button and
redirect them so we need to figure that
out but first of all let's create the
basics of this chat component so in the
code let's create a new component by
right-clicking over here go to a new
file and call this chat dots of view
okay so first of all we need a template
and this template will be pretty simple
to begin with a div with a class of
chats and also a class of container okay
now inside that we'll do an h2 and this
will just say chat for now now we'll
flesh out this template later but for
now let's just do the script tag first
of all and inside here we'll have our
object the name is going to be chat and
this needs to be a colon on that symbol
okay and we also want to do our data
function which returns an empty object
we'll fill this in later okay finally
let's do our style tag just in case we
need to add any styles later okay so we
have the basic component here for the
chat window now I'd like to hook this up
to our router so that if we go to
forward slash chat we get this component
right here
so inside index J is inside the router
file
first of all we'll import that new
component so import chat from and it's
that's forward slash components forward
slash chat okay
now let's create our routes object for
this component so a new object right
here the path is going to be forward
slash chat and the name of this route is
going to be chat and finally the
component will use is chat so now when a
user goes to forward slash chat it
should load up this component right here
so let's save this and give it a whirl
over here we'll go to forward slash chat
and we see that component cool so this
works
okay so now we have this component set
up what we'd like to do is when a user
clicks on enter chat we take the name
that they type in here and we pass it
through into this chat component right
here and redirect them to this component
so first of all what we'll do is go into
this component and we'll check that they
first of all have in fact entered a name
because we don't want to redirect them
to the chat component if they've not
entered a name yet so to do that inside
this entered chat function will delete
console dot log and we'll say if this
name so if this name is null then we're
not actually going to do this we'll do
something else and the else will be to
offer them some feedback now first of
all we'll need to create a feedback
property over here which will be null to
begin with but if they try to click the
button right here enter chat without
inputting the name the else statement
will run and we'll offer some feedback
so we'll say this dot feedback is going
to be now equal to you must enter a name
to join okay now we want to output that
feedback if they try to click this
button without entering a name so we'll
do that just above the button so we'll
do a pee tag now this will only output
if feedback is true now currently it's
null which means it's false so we'll say
V if on the P tag and we'll set it equal
to feedback so for as long as this is
null then we won't offer that feedback
if it's not null then we will offer this
feedback so we'll output it right here
like so now we also want to give this a
class of red text to make it red and
stand out all right so first of all
let's try this out if I now try to enter
the chat without entering a name it's
just gonna feed me back this information
right here okay then so now if they do
enter a name then we want to fire this
bit right here and what we'd like to do
is first of all redirect them to the
chat component so let's do that first of
all I'll say this dots router with a
dollar
before it remember this is how we access
the router object to redirect users and
then we redirect them by saying we want
to push on to the router so this takes
an object as a parameter this method and
we can pass through some options into
this object now one of those options is
the name and that is the name of the
component we want to redirect them to
now we call the name of the chat
component right here chat so let's grab
that and paste it in right here
okay so we're redirecting them to the
chat component now now let's see if this
works I'll just enter in any old name
Mario and enter chat and we forwards
denounced in the chat room but we still
don't have access to that Mario name so
we now need to figure out how to pass
through that name Mario as a prop into
this thing right here and there's a
couple of steps to doing that first of
all we need to go into our router file
over here and inside this route object
we need to tell it that we want to
accept props as parameters when we
redirect them into this route so the way
we do that is by simply adding on a new
property here called props and we'll set
that to true so now when we enter this
route right here it's expecting to have
props passed to the new component okay
now the prop we want to pass is the name
so first of all we need to go into our
chat component because when we pass
props into a component remember we need
to also accept them into components and
to do that we need to add on a props
property right here inside this
component so the props that we want to
accept are the name props or rather the
name prop so now we've said to the
router lot we want to plus a prop
through to this component when we
redirect them or go to this routes and
we also inside the component are now
accepting the prop called name so the
last thing for us to do is actually pass
this prop into this component when we
redirect them now that is pretty simple
to do we'll go to our welcome screen
over here where we redirect them and
after this name property we want to add
another
option now surprisingly this is not
props as you might think it would be but
in fact we use the params option right
here now we've seen this before when
we're passing through a route parameter
right now we use the same option when
we're passing through a prop as well
it's just that now we've done a bit of
extra configuration we've said that
we're passing through props and we're
accepting that prop because this time
we're not passing through the parameter
in the actual routes it's not going to
be /ch at /the name of the person we're
just passing it through as a prop which
is not going to be seen inside the URL
so the prop that we want to send is
going to be called name because that's
what we're expecting to accept right
here the name and we'll set this equal
to this name right here so we can access
that by saying this dot name so we're
redirecting them now to the chat
component and we're passing through a
parameter which is actually passing a
prop and we've said that we want to
accept that prop in here now this name
right here name and this thing over here
they must be the same thing because
we're passing one thing and accepting
one thing right they must equal the same
thing so let's save that now and view it
in a browser and see if this works
we'll go back to the welcome screen and
say Mario and in fact we can only find
out if it works if we actually do
something with that prop inside here so
why not let's just output it this name
because remember when we accept props
and we get data like this inside a
component we have access to them now by
just saying this doc name much like we
would have access to any data down here
on this object
so let's output this and Mario will be
our name enter chap and now we can see
chat Mario let's try a different one
Luigi enter Chat Chat Luigi awesome and
notice it's not that parameter up here
it's not forward slash chat forward
slash Luigi right here it's just forward
slash chat and we're grabbing that name
as a prop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
