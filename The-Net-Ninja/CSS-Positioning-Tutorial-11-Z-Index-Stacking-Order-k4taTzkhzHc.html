11th CSS positioning tutorial and in
this video I want to talk about z-index
unstacking order Wow alright then guys
so in the last lesson you saw me create
this nav element right here then I gave
it a position fixed property and put it
right at the top okay so it appears
right here on the page you'll notice
that no matter where a scroll it's
always at the top and it's above or the
elements okay like the other elements go
under this bar at the top okay
now you might be wondering why I place
this nav element at the bottom of the
HTML when in fact it's at the top of the
page and there is a reason and I'll show
you that reason now I'm just going to
cut this now and we're going to go up to
the top of the page and I'm going to
paste it right above there at the very
top all right so now if I click save and
refresh you'll notice that that now
hides behind the other elements alright
so the other elements go on top of it
instead of under it and that's all to do
with the default stacking order of
elements on a web page alright so the
further down you are the higher the
stacking order so these elements right
down here will sit on the top of the
pile and the further at the top you are
the nearest to the top then you have the
lowest stacking order alright so imagine
instead of elements you're putting down
like plates and you're stacking plates
so this is the first plate we're putting
down on the web page then we're putting
other plates on top of it right so this
one is at the bottom so as we scroll
down here it's getting hidden at the
bottom right essentially so that's
what's happening and that's why I put
this at the bottom so that it goes on
the top of the stack and it appears on
top of the other elements when we scroll
down now I like semantic HTML code and I
would like this to be at the top because
it makes more sense right it should be
at the top because it's at the top of
the page so how can we get around this
default stack in order
well I want to introduce to you the
z-index property and I want to show you
quickly just an image to demonstrate
this okay this is just something I found
on google images and it's
X Y Z graph right now we've already been
working with y and x coordinates which
said like bottom zero and left 50 pixels
so it's going to be positioned right
here yeah
so we've already been working with those
two two position elements on the page in
different areas now when we start
playing around with stuck in order the
third damage comes into play which is
the Z dimension that's like the 3d
damage nor the stacking dimension and
this is called the Z index in CSS all
right
so this is what we can use to explicitly
control the stacking order when we don't
want to use the default stacking order
so what I would say is that I want this
thing right here even though it's at the
top of the page and default stacks it at
the bottom I want it to be stacked above
the other elements right so I can give
that a z-index property and say hey I
want this set index to be bigger than
these elements right here so let me get
that picture again by default all of
these elements on the page have a Zed
index of zero so they're all on this
level right here I could say I want
something to be a zip Z index of 1 and
it's going to move it up the stacking
order it's going to kind of project
outwards on the page so that Z index of
1 is going to be above in the stacking
order all elements with a Zed index of 0
likewise we could say set index 2 and
that's going to be at the top of the
stacking order over the 1 and the 0 okay
and we can go as far as we want up the Z
index so let's do a little demonstration
let's bring this now right to the front
so what we need to do is find our
selector and then say z 9 Capital Z -
index give that Z index of 1 save it and
let's go refresh your here and now you
can see that it's above all the other
elements even though it's at the top
right here ok because by default all of
these elements remember have a Z index
of 0 we've given this nav a Z index of 1
which is protected it further up the
stack in order so it goes over all of
the other elements
so just to complicate things a little
bit let's just give this banner a Zed
index as well let's find the rule down
here there it is and I'm going to say Z
index - all right and now the banner is
displaying over the nav bar at the top
that's because the Z index is higher all
right so we've got 0 for all the other
elements then we've got one for the nav
at the top then 2 for the banner so then
the banner is at the top of the stack
this is under the banner and then
everything else is at the bottom so you
have to be careful when using Z indexes
not to go giving them out willy-nilly to
all these different elements because
you'll quickly get confused as to what
is we're in a stacking order ok and I've
seen guys just go something like this
you know well I want this to be at the
very top and I don't know what else is
going on so I'm just going to give this
as an index of like 9 zillion or
something stupid like that alright and
that's going to move it to the top but
then later down the line they're like
well I want something else to go to the
top so I need to give this as an index
of like 9 trillion bisily whatever the
numbers right I don't know
these numbers but you hear the point
just keep it nice and simple don't go
giving everything a set index on your
page and try and work with kind of like
a normal default stacking order as much
as you can
alright so currently this has got a Z
index of 1 and the banner has got to Z
index of tube so that's appearing at the
top right however imagine I gave this
rapper a Zed index - lets go duck or
peer to the top find that a rougher
there is alright so what I'm going to do
is give this a z-index first of all of
we'll say zero okay and save it now
nothing's happened and that's because
first of all remember if we give
something I'd I mention or property like
left right or even though set index we
have to position it first of all we have
to give it a position value so what I'm
going to do is give this a position
value of relative
and now you can see the banner is under
the header right and that is because
we've created a new stacking context
right here this wrapper has a Z index of
0 right and it's on the same level okay
one level deep below the body as the nav
so everything within this wrapper has a
Z index of 0 by default map okay even
this banner so even though this banner
has a z-index of 2 it is only in
relation to this wrapper everything in
this wrapper is given as index of 0 and
this now which is on the same level as
that wrapper has a Z index of 1 so this
nav is gonna display above it's going to
call a bull in a stacking order
everything within this wrapper right now
this might be getting a little bit
confusing but what we're doing is we're
giving these different elements a
different stacking context so this now
has a stacking context of 0 so
everything in this wrapper the maximum
stacking order it can have is 0 in
relation to the body tag make sense
ok so for example this ban amount of a
Zed index of 2 we could give this head
index of 3 then that would appear above
the banner this one of I don't know the
content of one sort of appears below the
rest etcetera but they're all in
relation to this wrapper ok so guys you
can see how quickly this can become
confusing so would say just practice a
little bit with it have you have any
questions obviously feel free to comment
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to subscribe share and like and I'll see
you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
