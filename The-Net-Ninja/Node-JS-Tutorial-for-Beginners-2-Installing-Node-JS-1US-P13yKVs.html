second nodejs tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can install
nodejs
on our computer right then so the first
thing we want to do is head over to
node.js or I'll leave the link down
below and you want to download one of
these versions of nodejs to your
computer now there's two to choose from
on the home page there's version four
point four point four or six point two
and the difference is that this four one
on the left is the latest stable version
this one on the right although is the
latest version with all the new features
it may not be stable okay so for most of
you I'm going to suggest this one on the
left so go ahead click that and download
it to your computer or go through the
installation steps don't change anything
it will take about three minutes and
then nodejs will be installed I've
already gone ahead and download this one
just for the fun of it so now that we've
installed node on our computer how do we
actually know that it is installed well
what you want to do is come down here
and search for CMD which is going to
bring up the command prompt and then in
here just write node space hyphen V and
this is going to tell us what version of
node is installed so if you've been
successful in installing node that it's
going to throw back the version that you
can see mine is 6.2 but yours might be
different okay so when I said in a
previous tutorial that we're going to be
using the command line this is what I
meant whenever we want to run a node
application or do something in node
we're going to write a command in this
command line right here but I find this
a little bit cumbersome because I'm
going to be working in at in this text
editor and I don't like constantly
switching between the two although it's
not that hard so what I've done is go
ahead and download a package in item
which has given me this terminal at the
bottom so now I can just write node
commands in here instead of switching to
this thing okay so to do that what you
want to do is go to file then go to
settings and you want to go to install
to search for this terminal now I've
already got it installed and I'm going
to show you what that's called
it's called platform IO how
an IDE - terminal so just search for
this in the install section right here
and there install it on to Adam okay so
now that we've done that you'll notice
we can just write anything we would do
in the other one for node in here
instead so if I put node - V again in
here press ENTER it's going to do the
same thing and tell me I've got version
6.2 installed okay cool
so you'll notice now on the Left I've
got up in the files that I uploaded to
github so I downloaded those and then I
right clicked on here went to add
project folder then navigate it to where
it downloaded those files from github
and open them up into utter so at the
moment we've got this public folder and
the assets and this is all going to be
for that's a do list application we make
later on we're not going to use them
just yet but why I'm going to do is come
to the top folder and go to new file and
I'm going to create a new file called
app J s just to test out node and then
inside here I'm going to say console dot
log and I'm just gonna put a little
message hey ninjas in there like that
and save it so now if I want to run this
application or this file in node what do
we do well come down to the terminal and
I write node space and then the file
name which I want to fire or execute
which is a PS and actually I can just
leave off the JX I can just pull up the
name with the file click enter and
that's going to run this file for you
and you'll see that this is logged down
here to the terminal cool however to do
this you'll notice I am in this
directory in the terminal nodejs
playlist where this file is found so
you'll need to be there as well
wherever the file is found to run it you
have to be there or give the full path
to the file so to change directory if
you're in a different directory in here
you just do CD and to go up a directory
you do that's going to bring me up a
directory you see it's gone to YouTube
sites now now to go back into a
directory that you're currently in like
to choose a folder from the directory
you're currently in you say CD then the
folder name so I could say node - Jas -
playlist and that's going to go back
into this folder okay so make sure
you're in the folder way you're up JSS
and then you can run it with node up
like so okay cool so now we've
successfully installed node and we've
run our first node application even
though it's pretty pants and we're going
to move on to some more advanced stuff
over the next few tutorials so until
then if you have any questions leave
those down below don't forget to share
subscribe and like and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
