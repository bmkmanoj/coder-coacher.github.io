WordPress lesson 20 and in this video
I'm gonna show you how we can create a
front page PHP template Wow alright guys
so this is how the front page currently
looks very good completely off from the
design that we had so in this tutorial
we're going to rectify this and we're
gonna make it look like the original
design now I showed you initially that
the front page was being loaded by this
index dot PHP file and in the last
lesson I showed you all about the
template hierarchy and that the index
dot PHP file was a catch-all so if
WordPress hasn't got any other theme or
template file rather to fall back on for
the front page then it automatically
uses the index dot PHP one
alright that's like a catch-all but what
we're gonna do in this tutorial is
create the front page PHP template files
so that when WordPress loads up the
website the front page is going to look
for that front page PHP file and it's
going to use that to load it alright so
let's do that so right click over here
and go to new file
call this front - page dot PHP and then
what I want to do is first of all just
grab all of this PHP from or code from
the index and then paste it over in it
see the front page alright then we'll
get rid of some stuff that we don't need
so we want the header and we'll keep
those two thieves all the div in the
main round there but we'll get rid of
this loop here because we don't really
need it just yet all the way to that
part right there where we're closing the
main we don't need the sidebar but we're
gonna keep the footer in all right and
then what I want to do is grab all of
this homepage comment content right here
until the end there is and copy that
over here as well like that ok so the
first thing I want to do is sort out the
URL to this banner image because
remember the images folder is not at the
root of the whole website directory it's
at the root of this theme folder so what
we need to do first of all is put the
URL to the theme folder right here now
to do that we have to use one of
WordPress's functions I've already
showed you this once but we'll do it
again right here
and PHP and then we use the echo
function to say the or to print out the
URL and then the function that we're
going to use is called get template
directory URI okay and then we can close
those PHP tags right there and then
we'll put a forward slash so then it
goes into the images folder and looks
for the ballot okay that's perfect so
that's going to go out and grab the
banner image now and then the next thing
I want to do is I'll leave all this by
the way because I don't think the menu
is going to change that much so we don't
need to dynamically control that now
this featured section is where we're
going to bring in the four latest menu
items that we add in the backend of
WordPress right so we've not added any
menu items in the back end just yet so
I'm gonna leave this as is for now and
then when we come to create those and
plan out some content then we'll come
back here and we use that PHP loop to go
out and grab that content and display
them here alright so we'll do that in a
later tutorial not here and then we'll
come down here alright so everything
else is pretty much okay and ready to go
so let's save that up and fire it in a
browser just refresh and now this is
looking a lot better guys okay
little gap up there which we could sort
in the CSS if I inspect this element we
can find out what it is ignore this
stuff over here
okay we're side okay so that is the home
menu h2 and I can copy that and go to my
CSS I'm just going to search for that
now and there it is so now I'm going to
change this to about minus eight because
it needs to scoot up a little bit more
and we'll refresh over here and that's
got rid of the gap cool all right so
that is looking pretty groovy now for
the front page like I said we're going
to revisit these later on so it can
dynamically insert all the content but
apart from that the front page it looks
pretty done and also as we add more
pages they're going to automatically
appear up here alright then guys so if
you have any questions about this
tutorial whatsoever feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise I'll see
you guys in the very
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
