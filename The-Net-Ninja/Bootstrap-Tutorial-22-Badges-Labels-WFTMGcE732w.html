22nd bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at buddy's
harder than guys so this is where we are
so far with this little dummy website I
have taken out a couple of links up in
the header because I'm gonna be working
up here in this tutorial I just wanted
to make a little bit more room at this
screen size so you can see it and so
yeah I want you to let your imagination
go absolutely wild here and just pretend
that we've logged into this website so I
no longer need this login button all
this register button but instead I'm
gonna replace them with an inbox button
and a notifications button ok now what I
need to do first of all is comment these
bad boys are right out like that and I'm
gonna replace them with two more buttons
so what I'll do is save button plus
equals I'm going to give them all the
same classes essentially putting
defaults and then navbar - button and
navbar right - just show me scoot over
to the right and then what I'll do is
I'll just copy and paste this in fact
mm-hmm down below alright now the first
one is gonna be inbox and the second one
is going to be notifications like that
and in fact what I'll do is just scoot
that over like that so we can work down
here and do the same there perfect
alright so now I'm going to use
something of God I've spelled default
wrong alright that's a bit better I'm
gonna use something called a badge here
all right to display little icons next
to the notifications to say how many
notifications you've got you know like
Facebook just has that little circle or
something to save got 5 notifications or
something we're gonna do exactly the
same because after all this is the next
Facebook but before I do that I'm just
gonna give this first inbox one right
here a style of margin left
ten pixels just to space out a little
bit like that
alright and I'll just move this down
here to make it look a bit better so
what we need to do to show that little
icon right here is add a span or some
other element with a class of budge and
this is what a badge is of type it in
first and I'll go through it so class
equals badge and then what we'll do is
give this dude 20 notifications because
it's super popular okay so now if we
take a look at that you can see we've
got a little kind of badge right here to
say that you've got 20 notifications now
I don't particularly like that black
notification there and if we wanted to
we could add a contextual class to this
button to make it look a little bit
different for example we could say
instead of default we could say button
primary okay and now this is gonna look
white instead or we could say button
arrow or something like that they don't
know sorry not error warning it's making
a lot yellow or button danger to make it
look red and we can go through each one
of those contextual classes to make it
look a little bit differently but it's
always gonna be white on the background
now I like to call it this a little bit
differently so what I'm going to do is
just override the style of bootstrap
provides us with and I'm gonna say
background I'm going to set this to a
hex value which is D 9 5 3 4 F and
basically that's the kind of read that
bootstrap uses for the danger button
okay but I want it on the actual badge
itself I've gone ahead and deleted that
button default from here so we'll put
that back in and there we go
so now we've got the notifications right
there looking pretty cool saying we've
got 20 notifications so that's what a
badge is now I want to show you one more
thing which is pretty similar and this
is a label and
I'm going to do a span next to inbox
right here to say if we've got new
messages or not okay I'm not going to
say how many I'm just gonna say if we've
got new messages so the class is gonna
be labeled like that and I'm just gonna
say only capitals in fact new all right
and then what we want to do is give this
a contextual class or say label - then
we'll say danger like oh god we've done
it only capitals label - danger like
that okay so now we get that kind of
square effect to say we've got new
messages and I suppose it's not that
much different from this thing over here
it's just that this has a less rounded
effect on the edges okay so there we go
guys that's how we do labels and
batteries all right if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to pop
those down below otherwise guys I'm
gonna see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
