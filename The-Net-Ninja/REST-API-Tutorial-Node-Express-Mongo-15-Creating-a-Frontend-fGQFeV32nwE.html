15th REST API tutorial and in this video
I want to start to flesh out a front end
for our API okay so this is where we're
up currently we've created our Express
app which is successfully communicating
with MongoDB and we've got all of our
route handlers successfully set up for
this API so now we want to start
interacting with that API from some kind
of front-end now this front-end could be
another mobile app that someone else has
created or another website that someone
else is creating but since we don't have
anyone else - great enough for us we're
going to just do a front-end ourselves
which is going to live on the front of
this application and it's going to run
in the browser okay and we're going to
use react to create that for intent so
I've got node mod index running I've
also got MongoDB running in the
background and that the first thing I
want to do is just come to the index dot
J's file this is the entry file and add
one more piece of middleware and this is
so we can serve static files such as
HTML files CSS or images to the user if
they request them okay for example if
they go to index dot HTML in the browser
then I want to serve that static file to
them so we're going to use middleware
called Express static so we don't need
to require anything else to use this
it's all part of Express right here we
want this to be the first middleware in
the step so I'm going to come above body
parser and I'm going to say app dot use
to you somewhere over there unless it's
called Express dot static and then this
is going to take in a string as a
parameter I'm going to call this public
so what's happening here okay so say for
example a user requests an image called
image JPEG right such as localhost 4,000
files lash image JPEG then the request
is going to come in and it's going to
hit this middleware first of all and
Express that static is going to look to
it and it's going to say hey this is a
static file so I want to serve you this
static file if there's no reason to
carry on through these requests so I'm
going to serve this static file right
here and send it you back and I'm going
to serve it from the public folder so
it's going to look in the public folder
up here for that image JPEG file and
it's going to send it back to the user
saying if they would go to an index dot
HTML file in the browser
if they go to forward slash index dot
HTML they're going to get returned this
index dot HTML file from this public
folder so that's where we're going to
create our front and ok so let's just
create a new folder called public and
then inside here we want to create two
files the first one is going to be
index.html and the second one is going
to be style store CSS so now we've got
those set up let's go into the index
file start to flesh this out I'm just
going to save this file first of all and
I'm just going to type HTML tab that's
going to create a former this is your
nutr it might do something similar in
your text editor so let's just do a test
first of all and make sure this is being
picked up and the middle where it's
working correctly so let's say h1 and
I'm going to call this it means your
goal okay so save that and if now I
request this HTML file so forward slash
index dot HTML then hopefully we should
get this HTML page back yep we do mean
do cool so now let's flush out this
index file so the first thing I want to
do is link to the CSS file which we just
created in the head
so let's come down here say link href
equals and it's forward slash styles
dot CSS well equals stylesheet type
equals text forward slash CSS ok I do
also want to include another CSS file
and that is to the google fonts library
so I've already copied that I'm just
going to paste it at 4th this CSS file
and so we can use this railway font in
this project ok so inside the title
let's just say ninja bro this is going
to be the name of our fictitious little
project and in this will say plus equals
title that's just so we could style it
in the CSS let's give this a bigger
title we'll say a ninja rest api and
then underneath what I want to do is a
little give
with an ID equal to homepage so this is
basically when we create our react
component this is where all the content
for the react component is going to go
inside of okay and in particular it's
going to go inside of a div called
ninjas so I'm going to create another
div right here with an ID equal to
ninjas so all of our react code if you
like when we generate it with reactive
is going to go in there let's just put a
little heading above this I'm going to
say hate one again and say hire a ninja
in or area of technical so that is all
the HTML we're going to create the rest
is going to be driven by JSX in the
react okay so in order for us to use
react then we're going to have to import
a few libraries first of all we're going
to have to import the to react libraries
react and react Dom and second of all
we're going to have to use a library
called Babel because that is going to
turn our JSX code which react to uses
into vanilla JavaScript which the
browser understands okay now there's a
few ways of doing this we can use
something like web pack if we want but
that is a little over the top because
we're just doing a simple one-page
application so what I'm going to do is
just import the script tags in this one
file since we're just using them in this
won't file okay but if you want to learn
more about how to set up react with web
packet we doing a larger project then
definitely check out my react tutorial
series here on YouTube I'll leave the
link to that down below
okay so let's paste these scripts in
just here so you might just want to
pause this and copy these in or you can
go to get home and just get over the
code from my repository and the link to
that down below as well but I'm using a
CDN just to deliver all of these and
this is the CDN right here so you can go
to those websites if you like on that
website rather and get the script right
from there so basically this is babel
first of all which needs to go first
because this is what it's going to
convert our JSX code and this right here
it says up six this is the version
number so if you're using a different
version then just change it to whatever
version you're using so this is babel
domain
file next we'll import in react version
15 and the reactor core library and then
finally again version 15 of react and
this time react Dom okay so the
difference between these is that this is
used to create our react components this
is kind of used to interact and place
those components onto the Dom right so
we need both of those so there's one
more thing I need to do and that is to
put my CSS in this dance dot CSS file so
I'm not going to write all that out from
scratch because that would just waste
everyone's time this is not a CSS
tutorial series so I'm just going to pay
fees in but feel free to just go through
these at your own leisure that all on
the repo so you can just grab them from
that so I'll save this first of all and
then head into Styles dot CSS paste
these in and save that as well so
there's just some basic Styles just to
give it a little more color and padding
and things like that make it look not so
tribe so what I'll do is just preview
this so far in a browser going to go to
this file right here again and this time
I'm going to zoom out because that is
ginormous okay though so we get our
Styles higher ninja in your area so now
all we need to do is create our react
component now and make requests to our
API to retrieve some data back so we're
going to start doing that in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
