third CSS tips and tricks tutorial I've
doing this video I'm going to show you
how to make a neat CSS only tool tip so
you probably know what a tool tip is but
just in case you don't it's something
like this whereby we have an icon or
some kind of text that when we hover
over gives us a little bubble of
sometimes with more information now you
know we find these things on farms which
is why I've got this password field here
it's not just there randomly but you can
generally have them anywhere where a
user it needs more information in this
case we're going to be really specific
about what kind of password the user
needs so I know you can get frameworks
to do tooltips for years but nine times
out of 10 those frameworks are going to
use JavaScript to accomplish this I'm
going to show you how to do this in CSS
relatively simply but before we start
coding I just want to point you to the
direction of this a repo right here on
my github CSS tips and tricks and little
is the link down below so you can grab
the course files for this tutorial on
the third branch CSS on the tooltip and
in this folder right here you're going
to find the end file so this is the end
result so you can download those if you
want okay so as you can see I've gone
ahead and created this index.html file
it's dead simple it's just going to head
here with a title and a link to style
CSS which we're going to take a look at
in a minute right there I've also got
this really simple form with a label
same password and input type of password
and then this spun with a class of
tooltip so this is going to be our tool
tip right here so this at the minute
looks like this on the screen through
our password to label the input field
and then this little question mark which
is a span tag right here so this is
really our tool tip and we're going to
sort all this out in a minute you're
going to notice some base styles here
and that's these dudes that I've
included right here so I'll just run
through these really quickly and a
background color on the body font color
and a font family that simple the form
we're positioning relatively a width of
hundred percent match width of 600
pixels then we see one a margin of 20%
from the top and bottom and also left
and right which is white central in the
page the form label just some fonts
styles and then finally the font import
we give it margin and padding
fontsize a border:0 and core of kind of
like a deep grit okay so that's why we
get these default styles like so okay
then call so now we want to style up
this dude right here the tooltip itself
so let's go into this comment and you'll
remember that it has a class of tooltip
so let's copy that and paste it over
here and what I want to do is just make
this into like a round icon so the first
thing I'll say is position:relative and
the reason I'm saying position:relative
is because we're going to use pseudo
classes later on which you're going to
be positioned absolutely and we want
them positioned absolutely relative to
this element okay so next I want to give
it a slightly deeper background than
this purple right here so I'll say
background RGB 8 and the a is the Alpha
Channel so it's zero zero zero that's
black but then what we're going to do is
signet acetate is 0.3 and the result is
going to be that it gives us a darker
shade of purple than this sort of a say
that now just check it out you're going
to see behind this that dark purple we
can't see much yet because it's got no
putty so let's say planning five pixels
top and bottom 10 pixels left and right
or the radius we're going to say 100% so
that it's a full circle the font size
will increase to about 20 pixels and
then find that little cursor give this a
relative health and what this does is
give the cursor that little question
mark when you hover over it so if I save
now check this out we have that circle
when I hover over you get that little
question mark underneath the cursor you
might just be able to see that on your
screen cool so that's that style now so
now what we want to do is create the
tooltip so that when you hover over it
we see that sort it now inside the
tooltip is some content where do we put
that content well what I'm going to do
is use an attribute on this thing right
here so instead of creating extra markup
for example did another span with a
class of tooltip text or something like
that and then only showing that when you
hover over this dude I want to just keep
it all within this one element right
here so we're not adding any extra
markup
so the rev limiter this is by giving it
a data attribute and the data attribute
name is going to be tooltip so if data
- not salted tooltip okay then we're
going to set this equal to whatever text
that we want to show in the tooltip so
I've already copied to my clipboard what
I want to pop in here so I'm just going
to paste it in so it's that thing right
there passwords must contain three eight
seven and at least two question mark so
we're being a really peculiar how we
want our user to create their password
right here anyway that's the tooltip
text and I'm going to show you a neat
CSS trick in a few minutes as how we can
show this text on the screen okay so we
can grab this set and show it on the
screen I'll show you that in a few
minutes first of all let's jump back to
the style and let's style up the pseudo
classes of listing right here so we're
going to use after and before now this
is not going to be a tutorial on pseudo
classes if you want to know more about
those you're going to see a set for
beginners tutorial series I'll leave the
link down below I talked about those in
depth there but basically by using a
pseudo class such as tooltip double
colon and then after I can target a
position just after this question mark
right here and style it and by doing the
same but saying before I can target just
before the question mark and style right
content okay so it's really cool for
kind of injecting texture content if you
like on to the page so we're not going
to do on listing right here because
that's the style of the tooltip but what
I will do is come down here and take
tooltip again and then this time say
before and then comics is we're going to
also target the after so we'll sorry
tool fit double call one after so we're
targeting both of those things right
there and then we want to give these a
few different base styles now the first
thing you want to do is give them a
position attribute or a position
property of absolute so we're going to
absolutely position both of these things
now what we're going to do is use this
thing right here before to style that
little triangle right there it's just
above this question mark and below the
tooltip and then we're giving the
existing right here after to be the
actual tooltip bubble with the
so what positions both of them
absolutely because we want them to be
above this question mark and we want
them to be in the center so because we
want them to be in the center what I'm
going to say is less 50% then we're
going to start in that central zone
right there okay
so we'll leave that for now we'll come
back to it later but first of all I want
to style this thing there's going to be
the triangle so I'm going to copy that
and paste it down here give ourselves a
bit of room and the first thing I want
to do is say content is empty now we
have to add this on to show this element
this before food or element on the page
then we can style it okay so we've
injected some empty content now we can
style it and I'm going to show you a
trick here to create a little triangle
in CSS and it's to do with borders so
the way to do it is first of all give
this a border width so the border it's
at the top is 10 pixels right 8 pixels
west zero pixels and sorry down zero
pixels and left eight pixels so we've
got ten pixels at the top eight left and
right and zero at the bottom right this
might seem a bit weird at first but this
is going to create a triangle forest
then what I want to do is hit border -
style is going to be solid so it's a
solid border then we want to give it a
border course it's also a border color
and the top border is going to be a DBA
and it's going to be the same color as
listing right here this little circle so
say 0 0 0 and then 0.5 or 0.3 I think it
was so then now that is just going to be
the color of the top part of the border
we want the rest is going to be
transparent the right bottom and left so
we'll say transparent then we'll copy
this because it currently bothered paste
in it or rather tagging it another two
times save that and then now you see we
get this triangle so even though we've
got a border left and right those
borders are transparent the only border
with color is top one and that's
difficult right here so these borders
right here kind of give us that try
Angela effect in conjunction with this
border right here if you just search
google for CSS triangles you will learn
more about that well that's a nice
little trip so we just want to position
it a little better than it is at the
minute first of all I want to bring it
in to the left because it's gone
slightly beyond halfway so I say left or
margin left I'll say about minus eight
pixels say that let's see what it does
yep goes rocket in the middle now I want
to bring it up so I'll say Margy of fact
we'll just say top position is going to
be managed 20 pixels save that and cool
so there is the triangle that's fine so
now we've done that we want to style the
bubble itself so I'm going to grab this
tool tip after dome which is going to be
the bubble come down in it and paste it
in alright so the first thing I want to
do is just give me some content again
this time I'll just say testing testing
one two three and that's just going to
be a tooltip content for the time being
until we inject the actual content okay
the next thing you want to do give us a
background again with our GPA and it's
zero zero zero not point three again
okay
then I'll say top position again at
minus twenty pixels to bring it up just
like we did here now let's just see
what's happening so far I'll save it and
we can see it right there okay doesn't
look great yet but at least it's on a
screen so the next thing we want to do
is say font size is gonna be 14 pixels
because current made quite big so things
out and let's see what that looks like
okay that's a bit better then I want to
bring it to the left and also give it a
wider width I'll say wait give me 300
pixels save that yep now we need to
bring it over to the left so I'll bring
it over by half of each width so that
the middle is roughly there so I'll say
margin left is minus 150 pixels so that
let's check it out okay that's cool so
now we want to give it some padding or
so padding is 14 pixels I also want to
give it a border radius all the way
around of about 10 pixels just to create
that bubble kind of effect and then also
I'm going to say color is DBE which is
light gray so let's say that okay now we
see that bubble is locking better the
only thing we need to do is shift it up
even more so the top here is lined up
with that triangle which is right
because we said top - 20 top - 20 right
but what we want to do is actually
translate this so that the hundred
percent of this width is moved up
because we want this bottom edge to line
up with this right because we don't know
the exact height in pixels what we can
do instead is this we can say transform
and I'm going to say translate Y and Y
is the up-and-down coordinate so I want
to translate it Y up which is a minus or
say minus 100 percent which means minus
one point two percent of its height okay
so let's try that save it and see where
it is on the screen that is looking
better so that is where we want our
tooltip to go all right so first of all
let's inject the actual real content in
listing right here in the tooltip so
instead of this testing testing one two
three
how do we get in the actual content this
thing right here well we can do a really
cool trick in CSS where we can grab an
attribute from an HTML element we do
that by saying attr then you bracket and
then whatever actually you want to grab
ours is to go to attribute called
tooltip so that is going to go out grab
that content right here and it's going
to output it in the content of this
thing so if I save it now you're going
to see it on the screen pretty awesome
right okay so we've styled it up now
what we want to do is make it so that
it's invisible to begin with then when
you hover over this we can see it pretty
simple to do what I'm going to do is
come to this thing right here which
targets both the triangle and the bubble
itself
I'll say opacity is zero there we'll
save that now we're not going to see it
completely see-through then what I want
to do is click on the bottom has a
little comments a hover effect and then
within this I want to target the same
things so I'm going to grab those
place them down there but this time we
want it to be on hover off the tooltip
make sense so tooltip hover before until
tip hover after so when we hover over
the tooltip we want this to show so
we'll set the opacity to be 1 again save
that and if we hover over now now we can
see it pretty cool but it's just kind of
popping in and I think we can make this
a little smooth and make it fade in
instead so let us go up to the top here
and say transition set it to all which
means whatever kind of property in the
CSS it changes I want you to kind of
animate every single little thing it's
going to be in or ease just in general
and then I want the animation to perform
all over not 0.3 seconds so ever save
this now we can check it out in the
browser and now it's fades in and out
looks a lot nicer and you can mess about
with different properties and animating
different things from one state to the
next
I've just done a passage here but you
can do different things like
translations or spinning effects
whatever you want to do but there we go
that is how you create a tooltip using
only CSS if you enjoy these videos
