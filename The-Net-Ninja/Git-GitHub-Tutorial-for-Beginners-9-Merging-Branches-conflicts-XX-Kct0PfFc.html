Nance get and ghetto tutorial and in
this video we're going to start merging
branches and dealing with conflicts okay
then so in the last tutorial what we did
is we created a couple of new branches
to work on some new features and that's
typically what we do if we're working on
new features because we don't want to
mess up the master branch which is going
to be our production code so we made
these new branches and we were happy
with the new features so now we need a
way to take that code and merge it back
into the master branch and that's what
we're going to take a look at in this
tutorial merging these kind of feature
branches and the code we create here
back into the master branch so that when
we publish our code we're publishing
this new feature as well okay so I'm
still in the same repo and what I'm
going to do is just a git branch I can a
to show us the branches you can see
we've got three branches master feature
a or future B and we're currently on
master so let's just check out feature a
and feature B to see what they have
we'll say git checkout and then feature
a and you can see we've got this script
right now feature a okay so that's the
first branch and the other branch git
checkout feature B is going to be this
feature B javascript file both very
similar either way we've finished these
two features now and we're happy with
each one now I want you to imagine that
each feature is being worked on by a
different person at the same time so
myself are working on feature B and
happy with it now so what I want to do
is merge it back into the master branch
right so to do that first of all we have
to be on the branch that we want to
merge into so we want to be on the
master branch because that's what we're
merging into so I'm going to save get
check out mustard okay now what we want
to do is merge that feature a branch
into this one and to do that we just say
git merge and then the name of the
branch that we want to merge in and it's
called feature - a ok so now we see this
message updating flash-forward feature a
dot JavaScript one file changed one
insertion okay so now what we've done is
we've taken that collet from the branch
the feature one branch off each a branch
and we've merged it into this master
branch which was still on and now we can
see that feature a script right there so
cool we've merged that now
and this fast-forward thing basically
means that all were doing is kind of
fast-forwarding up to the cold changes
that we've made in the feature a branch
because in the time between branching
out and merging it back into master
we've not actually made any changes in
the master branch so essentially all we
doing fast-forwarding up to that feature
a change make sense cool so now let's
most the other one so we did the same
thing we said git and we don't do it in
the text editor we do it over here
get merge and then we want to merge
feature - B so let's do that
this time we merge feature B and I can
see free to be over here as well so
that's worked successfully the only
difference is that this time the merge
was made by the recursive strategy and
that's because this time we've not just
fast forwarded to this branch code
because this branch code didn't have
feature eight in it in other words the
master branch has changed in the time
from taking feature be branch out and
merging it back in because we've added
the future a branch to master ok so we
have to use a different strategy to
merge them does it really matter so much
just yet the same effect is here we
still merged the feature B branch into
the master so now master is up-to-date
with both of these two features and it
doesn't matter that we've worked on them
at the same time different people doing
them with both just merge them back in
and everything is absolutely fine okay
but that's not always the case sometimes
you're going to come across what's known
as conflict and I'm going to give you an
example of that now so for example say
this is the current state of our master
branch everything's happy the code is
working perfectly and we want to add in
a new feature a new CSS feature right so
let us check out a new branch to do that
so I'm going to say git checkout - B - C
we want a new branch and also the branch
name which is going to be feature C yep
and terribly original
ok so now what on this feature C branch
but before I start work on this I just
want to go back to the master so I'm
going to say git checkout master now
we're back on the master branch now I
want you to imagine that sub upstart and
you at the company has decided just to
make edits on the master branch
yet those people do exist so what
they've done is they're going to the CSS
file and said you know what I think I'm
going to put a margin of 20 pixels on
this Bobby selector right here okay so
I'm going to save that now and I'm going
to commit it to the master branch so I
said git add just add those to the
staging area then we'll say git commit
and the message is added margin to the
body selector all right cool so we've
made that commit no now in the meantime
I'm working on features C so git
checkout feature I can see I'm working
on this and I don't know about that CSS
change that the other dudes added into
the master branch all the time I'm
working in the CSS file and I add in a
padding property to the selector which
is going to be another 30 pixels right
so I think that now I'm happy with this
new CSS feature which is really cool and
what I want to do is merge this back
into the master so first of all we need
to make it commit to this brunch or set
get us add these changes to the staging
then we'll say git commit and M is going
to be added padding up there that'll do
anyway now I want to merge this so I'm
going to check out the master first of
all because that's what we're managing
to and now I want to merge the feature C
branch into master so what I'm going to
do is say git merge and then the name of
the branch which is feature - see now
check this out boom we have a conflict
right and that's because that upstart
has been editing the body selector in
the master branch while I've been
working on my new feature editing the
same selector right the body selector so
in this case we get a lot of mumbo-jumbo
over here
and we also get an error message over
here and error message basically says
there's a conflict in the Styles dot CSS
file that's nice it tells you which file
it's in there's an automatic merge fail
and it tells us to fix the conflict and
then commit the result so it's asking us
for help because it doesn't really know
what to do with the minute it's a bit
stuck because it knows that someone's
changed this select on the master branch
and someone's change get on this new
feature branch we're trying to merge the
two
together and get doesn't really know
which version we want okay so we have to
help it beside so all we want to do
basically is say to get what we want in
this cult now I've had a you know speak
to this new guide and said okay don't
develop on the master branch again but
what is it you want and he says yeah we
do need that margin there so I'll keep
the margin in I'm going to delete this
little comment thing right here and this
thing right here and also I want to
keeping the pattern so we'll delete that
but leave everything else is saying so
this is basically how this body selector
should look right so now if I save this
what I'm going to do is add this file
I'm going to say git add to the staging
area then just do a git commit now this
time I don't need to write a message
because we're just doing like a kind of
merge commit if you like so I'm going to
just say git commit and then you'll get
this scary screen again you don't need
to do anything except shift in : you'll
see these : down here now then it's the
way you cube enter it's going to exit
out and it's going to do that merge it
for us so now everything is hunky-dory
and I can see that by saying git log all
on one line and now we can see we've got
that merge right here cool and
everything is looking fine so you will
come across different conflicts and
probably the good be more complex than
that but really it's just a case of
communicating with whoever's made the
other changes and decided between you
what the file should look like where the
conflict has occurred right yeah edit it
manually you add them to staging and you
make that commit and it's going to take
care of the rest for you but in a
nutshell that is how we merge branches
and deal with conflicts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
