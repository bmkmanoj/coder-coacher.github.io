we have four different parts here the
first part is your domain so the bit
before the at symbol for example the
boss okay next we have the at symbol
then the second main part is the domain
for example the net ninja or Gmail or
whatever email you use so it will be the
boss at the net ninja then we have the
dot after the domain then the third main
part is the extension so for example
calm or OGG or in our case code so we
also have a fourth optional part which
is another dot and then the extension
again so dot uk' so sometimes the
extension is one word like comma dog and
sometimes is two words like Co dot uk'
this second part of the extension here
number four that is going to be optional
right this is going to be compulsory
because they all have at least one
extension like com or something like
that but this second one is going to be
optional dot something else so the first
part right here your name this can be
any letters numbers dots and all hyphens
so it could be something like Donna dot
Peters at something comm right so we can
have dots in there or Donna - Peters as
something comm the second part this
domain could be any letter number and or
hyphens so it could be at the net ninja
or at the net - ninja okay number three
this third main part of the extension
can be any letters but that's it we
don't have numbers in the extension or
symbols it's just lettuce calm dog net
code at UK and the fourth part over here
is always going to begin with a dot then
any letters so dots then UK or dot then
something else all right so let's try
creating these four different parts plus
the apps and the dot in our regular
expression okay then so let's start to
put together this email regular
expression so let's place a comma after
the last one
the final one is called email and again
we'll just do our forward slashes first
of all then we'll do the caret and we'll
do the dollar sign for the end as well
all right so I've kept up this picture
down here just for reference so we can
refer to it to see what we need for each
different part so the first part over
here your name is any letter numbers
dots and or hyphens so first of all what
we'll do is enclose this in a set of
parentheses just so we know what each
section is and they're going to be
evaluated separately but it's not going
to have any effect on the overall
evaluation of the string okay so any
letter first of all so we'll do a to Zed
and by the way these are all going to be
lowercase I'm not doing case insensitive
stuff right here some lower case letters
then any digits as well zero to nine so
for that we can do buck /d for the digit
metacharacter we can also allow dots now
we can't just do a dot because remember
a dot has a special meaning in reg X it
means any character whatsoever we're not
seeing any character we're saying the
literal dots so we have to escape the
default special behavior by doing a
backslash before it now you can see its
own read meaning we've escaped that
meaning okay so now we've said we're
allowed lowercase letters any digit dots
we also wanted to allow - so it can
place - there as well now what about the
length
well Who am I to say how many characters
long your email address is you might
have the longest name in the world right
so what we could do is just place the
plus sign here and that means it needs
to be one let alone but as many as you
like
alright so we'll keep it simple and do
something like that so there we go that
is the first part of the regular
expression done so now we've sorted this
bit now next up is the @ symbol so let's
place that in that has to come next and
then the second part we're going to
enclose in brackets as well and the
second part is the domain and we've set
here it can be any letters numbers and
or hyphens so this isn't going to be too
dissimilar to the first part so again a
character set any lowercase
a tizzy also will use the digit meta
characters or backslash D that's any
number from 0 to 9 and also any - we
said and again who knows how long this
domain is so I'll do a plus sign right
here which says this must be at least
one character long but as many
characters long as need be alright so
now we have the first two sections of
this email regular expression don't we
have your name and the domain as well as
this @ symbol in between them the next
part remember is the dot for example
Shawn at the net ninja dot and then
we've got the extension to come after
this so let's open up our brackets for
the next section and this extension
right here number 3 can only be letters
all right so nothing else just letters
so by the way this dot I've done it
wrong I fell into the trap it needs to
be escaped remember the dot has a
special meaning so we need to escape
that special meaning because we want the
literal dot so backslash before the dot
all right so this next one character set
just lowercase letters so A to Z and
that's it and again
what about the length well this time I'm
not going to say as long as you want
because of no no extensions are 20
characters long instead we'll say
between 2 and 8 characters because I
think the least is 2 and the most might
be more than a I'm not so sure but we'll
just put in 8 all right so calm would
work - all good work net Co and then
that is the third part done finally we
have the second part of the extension
and remember this second part is
optional so if we take a look at this
again this second part begins with a dot
and then it can be any letters again so
let us open up our parentheses and then
inside first of all the first character
has to be a dot so back slash dot to
escape the normal behavior so that will
match a dot then any letters so a - Zed
for any lowercase letter then the length
of this is going to be again between 2
and 8 characters long I don't think any
of the second part of the extension a
more than a or even a in length
so that will get us dot uk' or whatever
and remember this second part is
optional so it doesn't have to actually
be in the string that we're testing so
to make all of this optional in
parentheses you've seen this before we
can add a question mark on the end so
this question mark makes the character
before it optional but since it's all
enclosed in brackets it's making this
whole thing in brackets before it
optional
okay so we could have a dot code at UK
or we could just have a cow or com
so just to quickly go through this again
we've got the your name bit so something
like Shaun at then the domain so the net
ninja then a dot and then the extension
which could be Co or comm and then
finally the added bit which is optional
dot uk' or something similar all right
so then let's give this a whirl over
here and refresh I'm going to just
inspect this element so we can see
there's a class added to it at any point
so to begin with no class but I'm just
gonna say s invalid already so if we
start to type out now an email it will
only become valid once a valid email
address is entered into this field and
the match to the regular expression is
true okay so Shawn the net ninja dots Co
dots UK and we get a valid class here or
it could be calm that's absolutely fine
as well it's still valid but we can't
end it in a dot that's invalid we can't
end it in something that's ridiculous
like that that's invalid or even numbers
this is invalid but we can do com we
could also add in a - right here and
this is still valid any other symbol and
it's not valid we can't do that here
only hyphens and letters likewise we
could add in a Shawn dot something else
right here and this would still be funny
because we're allowing dots and also
hyphens here but if we add in something
like plus then it's gonna become invalid
all right so there we go
this is a basic regular expression for
an email now just a disclaimer this will
probably not catch every
single email there's a lot of debate for
what is the best regular expression for
an email and I've done a fairly simple
one here it captures a most of them to
be honest in my opinion but it's maybe
not the perfect one and a lot of people
believe it or not argue like mad over
what is the best regular expression for
an email so if you do your research
you'll come across different ways of
doing this this is just one way out of
very very very many but there you have
it now we have all of our different
fields accounted for and we're testing
them against different regular
expressions so now we've done all that I
want to do one more thing in the next
video and that's kind of make this look
a little bit better and give the user
some feedback as to whether their value
is valid or invalid because not every
user is going to right click inspect
element and see if it's valid in the dev
tools over here that's not your average
user so we'll do something like color
the border green or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
