tenth bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
video we're gonna take a look at some of
the bootstrap tank styles it provides us
with Wow then go so in the HTML we've
just got some basic kind of elements
here we've got a div with that fluid
container class then we've got a Roma
right here just one row and then inside
the room we've got six developments each
with this class called
XS 6 so from extra small screens all the
way up we give it at 6 columns in width
that's half the grid then within those
we're going to H 1 then H 2 H 3 all the
way down to H 6 and then just a couple
of paragraph tags as well so let's take
a look at this in a browser and you can
see right here that in a bootstrap is
making me heading smaller as to go down
to h6
and you can see that by going over the
elements and just having a look at these
Styles right here so you see h1 is 36
pixels and that's in this file right
here you hover over that you can see
from the bootstrap CDN okay so that's
what bootstrap is providing us with and
over the h2 it's 30 pixels 84 we could
go through each one of these if you like
but probably not worth your time 18
pixels alright so there the size is that
bootstrap is providing us with now it
also provides us with a default font
family and that is how feta can do so if
we go down here you can see in the body
reel right now we've got font family
Helvetica new if that's not available
just have let's go then Arial then any
old sans-serif font okay so bootstrap is
also providing that through this file
right here again you hover over you can
seats in the bootstrap CDN file so if we
want to override those we just have to
do it in our own CSS that's cool and you
can see that body rule has it there but
if we go over the h4 or the h1 or
whatever H tag we want you can see in
that you can see that the font family is
inherit so all we have to do is change
the body font family and the h1 through
to h6 is going to inherit that as well
okay so as well as the head is
automatically getting these styles we
can also apply classes to things so if
we jump back to the HTML say for example
I want a word to have the same style as
a
each one right I could just say spun
plus equals page one and they give us
those utility classes if you like so if
I just put that around this word right
here and click Save this now should give
me the same styles as a page one should
okay so let's take a look at that in the
browser let's refresh and you can see
now this has the same style as that and
that is true all the way up to h6 so if
I put H in fact h4 for example let's
have a look at that and there refresh
now this gets the h4 styles which is
here so you can see it's a little bit
bigger than the normal text all right so
you can do that all the way through to
h6 also it gives us some other classes
and whatnot so something else can show
you is the lead class I'll cook down to
the second div right here and I'm gonna
give this P and class the lead all right
and then that's going to end at the end
of the P tag right there I'll save it
I'll check this out it blows it now you
can see that this text right here is a
bit bigger and this would normally be
the first kind of paragraph a little
kind of snippet in an article you know
where you get that rough overview of
what the article is going to be about
that's what this is for generally that
kind of thing alright so that's pretty
cool we can apply that class to some
tags anyway so basically what I'm trying
to say you guys is that bootstrap comes
with some kind of styling for text and
he overrides that default browser style
behavior that you get if you didn't have
bootstrap so you just need to be aware
of that if you are gonna you know style
your own taxi you have to override these
elements or rules that bootstrap
provides us with
okay so that's it just a quick lesson on
these classes and stars that it provides
us with you have any questions feel free
to drop a comment down below otherwise
guys I'll see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
