fifth flexbox tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about the flex rep
property Wow gang so what I'm doing is
revert the CSS back to how we had it a
couple of tutorials ago where I've
stripped out the grow and shrink
properties on each of these items the
skill or flex items because this
container still has the display type of
flex and there's still exhibiting that
default behavior of flex items where
they sit next to each other like that in
a row okay so what I want to talk about
in this tutorial is the Flex wrap
property and to do that what I've done
is a bumped up that minimum width to 200
pixels on each one I also want to apply
a flex grow property to each one and
give them all a rate of 1 so they're
going to go equally to fill up the space
available so what happens when we shrink
the page well we know the default
behavior is for the items to shrink like
that but it's going to reach a certain
point whereby the green one starts to go
off the page and to see it we have to
kind of scoot over like that now that is
pretty shot it I would not like to visit
a website where I needed to do that to
see the content so we can kind of tackle
this by using the Flex wrap property and
by the way it's doing this because it's
reaching a point where they can no
longer shrink any further because we've
specified a minimum width of 200 pixels
so when it reaches a point whereby these
guys reach 200 pixels in width they're
going to say no I ain't going to shrink
anymore because you've told me that the
my minimal width is 200 pixels and
that's fair enough
but we still don't want it to go off the
page so that's where flex wrap comes
into play so what we can do is we can
say well I'll tell you what that's fair
enough you don't need to shrink any more
but instead of going off the page like
this what I want you to do is when you
reach your minimum width I want you to
wrap to the next line so an element is
going to go okay
pull down here like that and it's going
to wrap to this next line and take up
all the available space there instead so
let's do that the way we would do it is
go up to the container and we apply the
Flex wrap property to that because
that's the container of these elements
and it's going to control the wrapping
those elements so we'll say flex - rap
and we'll set this equal to rap like
that so now when we shrink it beyond
that 200 pixels minimum width what
they're going to do is say well okay
I'll just wrap to the next line like
that and because of this flex grow
property that each one of these elements
has this property that we wrapped to the
next line or this element rather that we
wrapped down here is going to grow to
all the available space and likewise
when we shrink further and one of these
two elements at the top reach that
minimum width of 200 pixels it's going
to do the same thing on one of them it's
going to wrap to the next line and now
they're all taking up the available
space because of this grow property
right so that is pretty awesome I mean
we've got some nice responsive behavior
there by just adding in this flexwrap
property and not using any media queries
whatsoever that is pretty awesome and I
mean if you can't get excited about that
I don't know what you can't get excited
about but there we go
so that is this flex wrap property and
we can have different values for this
wrap property we can have wrap - reverse
and that is going to do plan of the
opposite what would you expect so at the
minute if we just have wrap then this
green comes down below if we reverse it
it does the opposite thing it goes above
instead so let's have a look so now the
green is at the top and the red and the
blue wrap to the bottom okay and if we
go further then we're going to get the
blue in the middle and the red at the
bottom so it's kind of doing things the
opposite way all right and the other
property which is just no wrap is the
default behavior if we didn't have this
property at all it would be no wrap and
this is the guy that just says hey I'm
not going to wrap here because I'm
pretty lazy just scroll if you want to
see me so we don't want that that's the
default behavior so I prefer just to set
this to wrap like that and then
everything just wraps to the next kind
of rope when you need it - pretty cool
right so there we go guys that is the
flex wrap property if you have any
questions leave them down below
otherwise don't forget to share

you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
