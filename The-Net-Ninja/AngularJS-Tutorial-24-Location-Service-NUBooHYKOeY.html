a 24th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're gonna talk about the
location service Wow okay then gang so
over the last couple of tutorials what
we have done is take a look at
validation or form validation in
angularjs and today that would go ahead
and create this swanky little form right
here which offers some neat feedback to
user when they don't fill it out
correctly like that what we've not done
so far is handled what happens when a
user clicks send so we're going to do
that in this tutorial now in a real
world application what you're probably
going to want to do is grab that data
and I'm gonna fold it to an email inbox
or send it to a database or something
now that's kind of beyond the scope of
this video so I'm not going to do that
here but what I will do is show you the
location service in angularjs which lets
us forward the user when they
successfully complete the form and click
send so a new URL all routes and show a
new view such as the thank you message
or something like that
okay so the first thing we need to do is
create a new view for that success
message and I've already done that I've
got interviews create a new file called
contact - success dot HTML then this is
just a div with a class of content and
then in here a h2 thing thanks a butch
for getting in touch all right so now
what we need to do is handle this kind
of submit event and we know to do that
we use the ng submit directive so we pop
that right up here on the form ng -
submit and we set that equal to a
function which will fire when this is
clicked all right so let's do that let's
set it equal to a function called send
message now obviously nothing's gonna
happen when we click this once it's
filled in because this function doesn't
yet exist and actually no control that
even controls this review yet if we look
in our app yes in the contact rel
there's no controller here controlling
it so what we need to do is set up a
contact controller and then specify that
all right here which we'll do now
controller
controller so we need to go ahead and
create this controller now so that when
this is clicked we can define a function
on this controller called send message
here which kind of handles this events
and sends the user to that success route
okay so let's go ahead and do that let's
go and create our contact controller
right down here at the bottom and by the
way guys this is getting pretty loud to
this file now in a real world
application what you'd probably want to
do is separate this into separate kind
of chunks of JavaScript such as making a
controller directory right here and then
stick all your controllers in there
separately in different JavaScript files
and just remember to link them all up in
the index file I'm just going to pop it
in here for now because it's quicker so
let's make that new controller we'll
save my ninja app dot - controller and
then we'll call this contact controller
and then we needs passing our
dependencies and the function into this
array so the dependencies we're going to
use our scope and location so we're
going to use both of those in this
controller and the location service
right there is what we're going to use
to send the user to a different routes
so we also need to pass these into the
function as well so scope and location
if we can spell them correctly that is
okay cool and then we can open that
function and this is where the magic
will happen so we need to define that
function called send message that we
popped to right here when someone clicks
submit so let's do that on the scope
object dot send message that equals a
function where we're going to use the
location service so to use this location
service all we need to do is say dollar
location dot path use the path method
and then send it to a different route or
a different URL okay so the URL that I
want is going to be contact
- success like that now currently if we
went to this route on this path all
would happen is we'd get redirected to
the homepage I'll put it up there and we
read our right to the home page now why
is that that's because we've not set up
a route for contact - success yeah we've
got the view but that doesn't mean
anything we want to link that route to
that view okay we need to do that right
here so let's just copy this for now and
paste it down here and we'll say when
the URL or the route is contact success
we want to use the contact - success
view and the controller is going to be
the same controller contact controller
okay so now when we visit contact
success we should get that message
Thanks about a bunch of again in touch
so let's just go back to the contact
page now everything should be hooked up
we've got our send message function or
right there and the location service is
using the path method to send us to
contact success let's just put in a
Foley slash right there okay so let's
try filling this in
we'll say crystal and the email can be
crystal at whatever comm blah blah blah
let's click send and now it redirects us
using this location dot path to forward
slash contact success and we get in that
view up there okay so that guy's is the
location service if you have any
questions about it whatsoever feel free
to leave a comment down below otherwise
guys I'll see you in the very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
