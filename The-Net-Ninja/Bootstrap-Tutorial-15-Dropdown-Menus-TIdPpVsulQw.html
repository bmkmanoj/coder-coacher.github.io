15th bootstrap 3 tutorial and in this
lesson we're gonna take a look at drop
down menus alright then so basically
this is gonna be the first time we're
using the JavaScript that bootstrap
comes shipped with ok and then what
we're gonna do is make this little drop
down menu here so it's not fully done
yet but there so far what I've done is
create this empty div okay then in that
got a button and a ul and this is gonna
be the menu this is gonna be the button
that kind of toggles it open and closed
so first thing we need to do well we
don't need to do but I've already done
it is give this a class of BTN and BTN
default that just gives you that kind of
default button styles make it look a bit
better and this arrow right here kind of
lets the user know that this is a menu
otherwise it just looks like a button to
another page right so I've made that
arrow using this empty div right here
and I've used this caret class which
bootstrap kindly provides to us and
makes it look like this little arrow
right here so that's pretty cool so
that's the but and that's what we're
gonna press to kind of toggle the menu
open or close right so there's a few
things we need to do the first thing
that we need to do is give this div
which is surrounding the whole thing a
class okay so we need to group these
together these two things in the same
div and we need to give that Dave a
class and the class we need to give it
is just drop down okay so now that's
done we need to give this a plus and the
class is going to be the drop down - a
toggle because this is gonna be the
toggle button right so that's drop down
toggle and then the class we need to
give to this is drop down menu all right
so drop down to surround the whole thing
drop down toggle on the toggle button
and drop down menu on this bit right
here now there's one more little thing
we need to do and that is add a data
attribute into this button right here
okay so data attribute just like that
data then - then whatever kind of data
you want to add to this element now in
this case when working with the
bootstrap drop-down menus we need to
make this data high
toggle all right and then we equal up to
drop down alright so and now that's good
we can probably save it refresh over
here and now it's hiding all of those by
default they're not show it but when we
click on this button this show and
you've got those nice little hover
effects going on down there which is
pretty cool
click it again and they hide so how
simple was that that is just a few lines
of code I like to do know CSS whatsoever
and it's made a nice little drop-down
menu for me and yeah we can style this
further if we wanted to using our own
styles but if we don't want to do that
then this is just kind of like an
out-of-the-box dead simple nice looking
clean drop-down menu alright so I want
to show you a couple of extra things
that we can do to this drop down menu
and the first thing I want to show you
is the drop down here is now if you look
at this we've got our meats here ham
sausage spicy chicken these my favorite
meats salami and then I'll just put a
couple of token ones into the bottom for
you veggies out there so what I'm gonna
do split these up I want to add some
kind of titles to these two right here
it's a veggie and then I'll meet you for
the top so the way we do that is by
doing an Li and then giving that a class
of drop-down - Heather okay and then we
can port meat it right there like that
I'm just gonna copy this I'm gonna paste
it right down here above the veggie
stuff drop down head of a keep we just
change this to Liddy alright and then we
could save that refresh and a lot what
we've got so this here this is not
selectable this is just a title right
you can see it's a little small it's
great and again we can style it to our
own liking by overriding no stars in our
own CSS if we wanted but out of the box
it gives you those Styles which is
pretty cool all right so we've got the
veggie and the meaty
kind of titles there drop-down headers I
want to show you one more thing and that
is how to disable one of these options
so say for example this is a menu picker
and there you men to choose what you
want for your dinner some dinner party
then it's going to log that but
we run out of for example the sausage
right what we could do is come to the
sausage right here and give this Li tag
a class of disabled a minute disabled
like that and refresh and this time what
you get is a great out sausage and a
little kind of a whatever that so needs
no entry sign or whatever on the sausage
alright so that is how we create a
simple drop-down there are a couple of
other things we can do with them you
