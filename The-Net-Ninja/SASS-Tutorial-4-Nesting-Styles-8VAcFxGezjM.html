fourth sass tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at how we can
create nested Styles are using sass
alright then guys so in the last
tutorial we made some variables right
here and we applied those variables to
these simple rules right here now in
this tutorial I want to take a look at
how we can nest styles and nesting
styles are pretty cool for two reasons
the first reason is that it takes a lot
less time to create of styles and the
second reason is that it keeps all your
stands for particular elements or
sections on your web page together in
one block if you like rather than
spreading them out in different rules
down here so let's take a look at these
nestea styles how do we do them well
what we're going to do is stand up all
of these links within the main
navigation right there so all the
elements we need to style are going to
be within this main ave and we can see
that from the HTML here's the main map
then within it we've go rapper UL li
tags and the anchor tag so we're going
to start all those bad boys up and we
can use nested Styles to do that within
this rule so we do this by going inside
this rule this code block right here and
we can write whatever element within
this element that we want to style right
here as a non selector so I could say
grab the UL tag in the main now just by
writing that and then we can pop our
Styles here and this is pretty much the
same as saying main now ul and doing all
our styles in there but instead of
separating those rules out into
different rules down here then we're
just keeping everything within this main
nav code block so it's pretty cool and
this is what it's going to output this
rule to here in the Styles dot CSS when
it's compiled so anyway let's delete
that and we'll pop our rules in here so
we're just going to give this a width of
100% for now that's all we need to do
with the UL I'm going to save them
alright next thing we want to do is grab
the Li tags and now if we wanted to
because the Li tags are sitting within
the UL we could go in here like this and
we could say Li we could nest it within
the UL and give our styles there but I'm
not going to do that and the
I'm not going to do that is because I
don't like to nest things too deeply and
yeah three levels isn't too deep but if
we have extra elements within this li
attack like a peg and then imagine in
the a we had spun tags that we want to
style then we start to lose track of
these things right here where things are
opening and closing so really I don't
like doing that much where I can get
away with it I prefer to just do them
all within the kind of parent element
the overall parent if you like alright
because these are the only Li tags
within this main now here is the only Li
tags there then this thing right here
may now if that Li is only going to
apply to that this is like the
difference between these two rules I
could say main nav ul oops
ul Li could do some rules in there or I
could do main nav Li do some rules in
there so this one right here is like
this and this one right here is blue if
we Nestea allied within the UM okay so
I'm going to do it this way get rid of
those dudes and then the Li tags we want
to float to the left and we also want to
give them a width of about 14% so you
can like that bluffing with that and
that will do for them so let's save that
and we're going to notice all of these
links now floating left we've lost that
background color and that's because we
floated all of these Li elements to the
left
therefore the height of this ul
container has collapsed all right so to
do that we're going to have to clear
these floats and we're going to do that
shortly I'll show you how we can do that
for now let's stay up those eight X and
again I'm not nesting it within the Li
tag right there for the same reason okay
some of the a tax I want to give this a
color but I'm not going to put the code
right here for it what I'm going to do
is store that hex code in a variable up
here so we're now it's a create variable
to just do a dollar sign and we're going
to call this variable off white and I'm
going to set this equal to hash f8 f9f B
alright cool so now we can just come
down here and say we want the color to
be off
white cool I ran it what else do we want
to do with these a tax we want to give
them a text decoration of Nan to get rid
of that underline style padding we'll
say about 10 pixels or 16 pixels rather
just to spread them out a little bit
we'll display them as block and then
we'll say text align to the center all
right cool
now we're not going to see those egg
tags anymore because we've given them a
clip off-white so they're not showing up
on this white background so what we
really want to do is get that UL height
back so that it's a blue background and
to do that we need to use a clear fix
technique all right we need to clear
these floats now there is a good way we
can do that using SAS and the ampersand
and I'm going to show you that later on
off now I'm just going to do a simple
clear fixed rule so we will come down
here outside of the main nav right and
I'm going to create a rule which says
main nav ul and then I'm going to use an
after pseudo class and I'm going to give
it some content so this is going to
insert some content at the end of the UL
all right and this content is just going
to be blank it's going to be nothing but
it's going to display as block and it's
also going to play both so it's going to
clear all of the Li tags that come
before it this is a nice little clear
fix technique and now you notice we get
the height back on the UL and therefore
it's got a blueish background this now
okay pretty cool so what I also like to
do is comment where my particular styles
ends especially when you're nested
Styles get deep or quite long just so
and know where things end so we can do a
simple comment one line coming like this
and I'll say something like end main nav
okay just to keep on top of things so
I'm going to save this now and I'm going
to show you what this is output like to
the Styles dot CSS you can see now I
split all of those Nestle styles into
different rules main ful may now if Li
main of a then we've got this urn cliff
fix rule etc so that's what it looks
like in the output CSS but writing it
like this is much quicker and more
efficient and it keeps all of those
together where they should be so nice
little technique to use with sass all
right if you have any questions feel
free to leave a comment down below
otherwise guys I'm going to see you in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
