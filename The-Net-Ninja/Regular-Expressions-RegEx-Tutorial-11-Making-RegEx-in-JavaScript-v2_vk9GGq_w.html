working with regex in this online tool
but in reality we want to work with them
in our applications in our JavaScript
files so now how do we create then a
regular expression in JavaScript well
there's a couple of ways we can create
them and I'll show you both the first
way is going to be the way that we're
going to use going forward and it's
probably the more common way to create a
regular expression as well so first of
all head to your validation is and what
we'll do is we'll store our regular
expression in a variable so then we have
access to it later on so let's create a
variable and let's just call this reg
for now and set this equal to a regular
expression now remember when we're
creating a regular expression on this
online tool it's always contained within
these two forward slashes one at the
start and one at the end now
that's how we create them as well in
JavaScript our regular expressions going
between two forward slashes like so okay
so much like a string would be between
quotes like this a regular expression is
between two forward slashes all right so
let's create a little regular expression
in here say we want to match a range
from a to Zed then we can do that then
obviously this regular expression is
going to match anything like a or B or Y
oops I've created some kind of bug thing
there so we don't want that
A or B or Y etc so we also saw when we
use this online tool that we can use
Flags G is the global flag we also had
the I flag which says it's case
insensitive and if you take a look they
come after the final forward slash so we
can do the same thing over here if we
want this to be global then we can just
type AG there after the trailing forward
slash and an I if we want it to be case
insensitive or just I that's entirely up
to you and they don't have to be in any
particular order these flags they come
after though the final forward slash now
it's important when you're creating a
regular expression this way by the way
the semicolon is just to end the the
statement here in Java
script it's not part of the regular
expression but it's important when
you're creating them this way not to put
them inside quotations like so this is
not going to work now it just becomes a
string in JavaScript okay we want a
regular expression and you'll know the
difference because you'll get this funky
color-coordinating in a lot of different
text editors I'm using atom and it has
some good color coding for regular
expressions so right here what we're
doing is creating a regular expression
to match any letter doesn't matter
whether it's uppercase or lowercase
because we have the I flag from A to Z
and it's gonna be a global match as well
meaning we can match more than just one
case okay so that's how we create a
regular expression the first way and
like I said that's going to be the way
that we're creating them going forward
but I also quickly want to show you how
to create them the other way just in
case you come across them in other
people's code or if you prefer to make
them this way so let's go down a couple
of lines and create another variable
I'll just call this reg 2 and set that
equal to our new regular expression and
the other way to do it is by saying new
and then the capital wrench and then a
capital e XP so this is going to create
a new regular expression for us and this
takes two parameters the first parameter
is going to be the actual regular
expression so let's just copy that and
paste it in here so that's the regular
expression itself then the second
parameter is going to be a string of
flags so for example the IEEE flag would
make this case insensitive or the G flag
would make this a global match so if we
do an eye it means that this is going to
be case insensitive right here so
they're the two different ways we can
create regular expressions again I just
prefer this way it's easier on the eye
less characters to write and I think
more people probably use this way than
they do this way down here so it's up to
you but we're going to be using this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
