node.js tutorial and in this video I'm
going to show you how we can create
writable streams or I think Excel in the
last tutorial I showed you how we can
create a readable stream to read data
and visually it looks something like
this we have the data coming in down a
stream filling up a buffer and then when
that buffer was full it would pass on a
chunk of data to us to read and we could
use a listener which was on a data which
would listen out whenever we received
one of these chunks of data and then we
could do something with that we logged
it to the console but typically we'd
want to do something different with it
like send it to the client the browser
or maybe create a new file with it so in
this tutorial we're going to take a look
at how we'd do something with that data
we're going to create a writable stream
so we can send it along that to
somewhere else okay there so I'm in a PS
and this is the code from the last
tutorial where we created a read stream
right here and we read readme text which
is up here then what we did is listen
out for the date event which basically
means whenever we receive a chunk of
data and we've fired a function whenever
that happened with the chunk in the
function we pass it through and then we
log to the console new chunk receive we
also logged the chunk itself but I've
taken that out for now so now what I'm
going to do is create a writable stream
so that we can write this data that we
receive to that write stream and send it
somewhere else so the way we do that is
first of all by coming up here creating
a variable I'm going to call this my
write stream again you can call this
whatever you want I'm going to set that
equal to FS and we use a method on this
module again called create you guessed
it right stream and now we're going to
create a write stream but we need to
tell it where we want to create it to
where's this data going to and for now I
just want to create a write me text file
so I'm going to copy this dude right
here and I'm going to paste it in down
it and instead of readme I'll call it
write me
so now this is going to create a right
stream in which we can write onto and
send data to this path this new file but
how do we actually do that well we're
going to do it every time we receive a
new chunk of data from this read stream
so we're reading this and then every
time we receive a chunk of data it fires
this function and we receive that chunk
of data so then we can now write this
chunk of data to the right stream here
send it to this new location so let's do
that
the way we do that is by using this
variable that we've stored the right
stream in so we'll copy that and paste
it down it and then we use a method on
this called write that's simple to
remember and then what do we want to
write we want to write this chunk of
data so let's pop that in there so now
what we're doing just to go through it
step by step is we're reading this file
by creating a read stream every time we
receive a chunk of data we're firing
this function and we get that chunk of
data logging this to the console then
we're saying okay well the write stream
that I created right here to this path I
want you to go ahead and write to it and
the data I want you to write to it is
this chunk of data we've just received
so if I save this now then you're going
to notice when we run this application
it's going to create that write me text
and it's going to send the data that we
receive to it okay so let's say node app
to run this and we see new chip received
twice so it sent us to chunks and you'll
notice as well the write me text file is
up here and we get all the same lorem
ipsum in this file now that we had in
the read made-up text file so we've
transferred it but if you compare this
to how we did it a few tutorials back
where we looked at the FS read file and
write file ways to do it
the difference is that we're splitting
up this file into chunks of data we're
using a stream and a buffer so that we
receive data more quickly we don't have
to wait until all the data has been
loaded into memory and then write the
file we do it a bit at a time so you can
see the benefit of reading some kind of
data
whether that be an HTML file or
something else and then sending that
data to the user a client this way
because they start to receive the data
quicker by using these streams and in
fact because we do this so often reading
streams then writing streams and sending
data from one place to another there is
actually a way to do this even quicker
than all of this that we've done here in
nodejs and that is by using pipes so
we're going to take a look at pipes in
the next tutorial and then how we can
use this way of dealing with data to
send information to reuse it so until
then if you have any questions feel free
to leave a comment down below otherwise
guys I'm going to see you in a very next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
