eighth Atmos script six tutorial and in
this video we're going to take a look at
some of the improvements to object
literals in es6 Wow alright and dogs so
basically yes six gives us a cleaner way
to define properties and methods on our
objects should you want to use it so
let's talk through an example first of
all I'm going to create a variable which
is going to store an object and this
object is gonna be called ninja set this
equal to a blunt object at the minute
nothing going in there yet we'll come
back to that in a minute then I want to
create two more variables and the first
one is gonna be called name and I'm
going to set this equal to the name of
the ninja which we're going to use in a
second it's gonna be crystal for now
then the second variable is going to be
called the belt and I'm going to set
that equal to and Chloe is going to be
black in this case alright so say we
wanted to add a couple of properties to
this ninja and those two properties were
named and Belt and we wanted them to
equal these values right here which
we've defined above in these variables
well in es5 would do something like this
right we'd say name and then set it
equal to name which is this variable
that would say belts and set it equal to
a belts which is in this variable so
it's going to create these kind of key
value pairs this is the property name
and this is the value of that property
which were grabbing from these of
variables so now if we load something
like this to the console it would look
something like this console dot a lot
then I grab the ninja object dot say a
name if we log that to the console now
it's just gonna go ahead and grab
crystal okay because that's what's
stored in this variable now in es6 we
don't need to explicitly define these
kind of key value pairs we just have to
pass through the the key if you like
which is the name of these variables and
it's gonna go and grab the value for it
so I could just do something like this
instead okay so we've got a name and a
belt like that and now we don't need to
define the value over each one because
it's gonna be implied by grabbing the
value from these variables when it locks
them up okay so now if I do something
like this and then G dot name and log it
to the console it's gonna do exactly
the same thing and I can do the same
with belt ninja belt and it should give
us black pretty cool right so we can
also kind of clean the way up clean away
we define our methods on these objects
as well so let's first of all define a
method the way we would do it on or
rather in es6 i'm going to create a
method called shop and this is just
going to be used to karate chop our
enemies so we're going to set it equal
to a function which is gonna take a
parameter X and that's just gonna be the
number of times that we're going to
karate chop our element so right now
let's log some kind of message to the
console I'm going to say console dot log
and then we're going to use a template
string so we'll use those back tips and
then I'm going to say you chopped the
enemy and then we need to grab that
variable using this little syntax right
here and then pop the X in and same x so
whatever value we pass in here is going
to be output there in this kind of
string and it's gonna lock that to the
console so let's just come down here and
say ninja chop and pass through five as
the parameter of X refresh and he says
you chop the enemy five times cool okay
so how would we improve this using es6
well we don't need all of this stuff
here we don't need a function keyword
and we don't need this little column
right here as well we just define the
name of the function like that and then
the brackets with any kind of parameters
within it so now when I save and refresh
it does exactly the same thing so we can
just meet any up a little bit using this
kind of syntax in es6 okay not exactly
groundbreaking stuff but it's there for
you if you want to use it and it's a
little bit of a time saver so there we
go guys
that is how we can improve object
literal notation if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
