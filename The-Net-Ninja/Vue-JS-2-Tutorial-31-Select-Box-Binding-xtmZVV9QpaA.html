first of UJS tutorial and in this video
we're going to take a look at select box
binding all right there so over the last
couple of tutorials we've been using
some input and check box binding to
create this form right here where we can
add a new blog post now I want to do one
more bit of binding and that is to bind
to select boxes so essentially what we
want is a select box on here now to
choose the author so there might be like
three or four authors and we want to
choose which author is actually writing
this blog post so how do we bind to
select boxes well it's a little bit
different than checkboxes in the
previous tutorial so I'm just going to
dive right in and show you how to do
this now so beneath the check box is
given right here what I'm going to do is
add now a new label and this is going to
be for author and then underneath this
label we're going to have a select box
so as we know a selected box looks
something like this we have a select we
have various different options in here
like this so an option for one offer an
option for angles are also etc now you
might be thinking that what we do here
is say okay well the v-model
for this one is equal to you know name
one and v-model for this one is equal to
name two whoever those and that future
is just going to take care of this add
it to some kind of remodel down here and
yeah it's going to do it for us no
that's not how this works
okay so basically we're just going to
have one option right here and we're
going to attach the v-model directive to
the select box itself because this is
what holds the value property so when an
option is selected right here the Select
box gets the value of that option which
is selected right so we attach the
v-model directive to this select box
therefore whatever is input into that
remodel whatever a variable is
associated with it is going to get that
value
all right so we'll say V - model and set
this equal to blog to author
okay so now we're going to attach this
property on the blog object to this
select box so when we choose an option
whatever the value
in here of the option is going to be
assigned to this property right here
okay so first of all let's add this
author property to the blog object down
here so author is going to be like so
alright then so now we might have say
for example three different authors in
here
right now I mean we might not know which
options or which authors we've got and
we might store them all on some kind of
data object and this is probably the
best way to do this so I'm going to
delete these and instead of hard-coding
anything what we're going to do is loop
through some different authors on a data
object which we're going to be fine and
output some options okay so let's go
down here and do now what I'm going to
do is cook outside of the blog object
right now because we're not going to
store this on the blog it's kind of just
to give us some functionality to kind of
populate those options and what I'm
going to do here is say off this and
this is going to be an array okay and
it's going to hold whichever authors
where you want to output to the form so
let's think of some names
first of all of me as an expert in your
jar and then we'll do the angular
Avenger yeah and then let's do something
to do with your view the view of
indicator get asked well nope Vindicator
okay cool so now we have our authors
right there and what we want to do is
cycle through these authors and output
them as options right here so how are we
going to do this well same again we're
just going to use v4 so if I can attach
the v4 directive right here and I can
say after scheme authors this time
remember it's not belong to authors
because we store it outside of the blog
it's this thing right here so it's just
office okay
and we're going to output the alter each
time around so now what is going to
happen is it's going to output all three
of those authors as options right here
and whichever one we select is going to
be assigned to this property right here
we bound to this select kind of feels
right on the v-model directive so if I
say this now and the view in the browser
we're going to see
this select box right here would be
superior three things in here now I
could select one but again we want to
preview it so now let's add it to the
preview field and this is going to be
relatively simple all we're going to do
is a paragraph tag and today after and
then output to log the author because
we're just story one of them right so if
now I select for example the angular
Avenger we see it right there if I
select the net ninja we see it and we
can change it over and over again
okay so my friends that is how we bind
to select boxes we attach the v-model to
the Select tag itself and we assign it
some kind of property then we can use a
v4 to cycle through any kind of options
to dynamically output our different
authors like that whichever option we
select this gets the value of that
option okay so there we go that's it for
kind of binding to different form fields
in the next tutorial what I'm going to
do now is move on and take a look at
view HTTP so we can start communicating
at some point to some kind of database
okay
so I'll see you in the various tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
