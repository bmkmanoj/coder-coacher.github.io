your ninth CSS flexbox tutorial and in
this video we're gonna talk about flow
and axes Wow okay then doke so I'm back
in the base index file right here in the
root of the folder and as you can see
we've got our Flex container once again
with these three flex elements inside it
one two and three and in the style dot
CSS we're saying that each of these flex
elements has a height of 100 pixels and
a Flex property of zero grow zero shrink
and 100 pixels for the Flex basis so
that's the initial width of you like
okay so so far in this playlist we've
just kind of witnessed the default
behavior of flex items and that is to
stack horizontally beside each other in
what is essentially a rope going across
right but we can kind of override that
default behavior by explicitly saying
look we want these actually to stuck in
a column and the way we do that is by
using the Flex flow property right so
what we'd do is we'd apply the Flex flow
property to the Flex container and that
controls the flow of all the elements
within it or rather all the Flex
elements within it and we can say we
want them to flow in a row like this or
in a column so this is the default
behavior flow in a row going across so
let's go ahead and override it we can
say Flex flow and you can see there's
row that's the default behavior if I put
in column now then now they're going one
on top of the other in a column and the
reason their full width is because these
guys are all block level elements and
they're taking up 100% width of their
parent element by default and this flex
basis no longer controls the initial
width of the elements because they're
not going in a row across anymore this
flex basis now controls the initial
height of these elements because they're
now going in a column downwards
so if we change this for example to 200
you'll see that change just going to pop
that back to 100 for now now then so to
kind of better explain this I want to
show you a quick diagram that I've done
so essentially when we
use flexbox there are two axis there is
a main axis and a cross axis and what we
do when we change the value of flex flow
is we're just changing the direction of
the axis so when flex flow is equal to
Rho then the main axis is going across
in essentially a row right and the
elements always follow the main axis
they line up in the direction of the
main axis so in this case they go across
in a row and the cross axis is
perpendicular always to the main axis so
in this case is going down now when we
change the flex flow property to equal
column what happens is the axis kind of
switch around and the cross axis now
goes across and the main axis goes down
and remember the elements always follow
the flow of the axis the main axis
rather so they're flowing downwards in a
column that's how it works so there are
certain properties when we use flexbox
that only apply to the main axis and
there are certain properties that only
apply to the cross axis and obviously
depending on what we have flex rho set
to then the effect of these properties
is going to seem a little different and
i'm going to demonstrate that now first
of all let's just change this back to
rope like that and then let's set this
to be let's say 200 pixels and then what
I'm going to do is use the justify
content property now this property is
only ever applied to the main axis and
now because we're using flex flow equals
Rho then this justifier content is going
to apply horizontally in a row and we've
seen if we do something like this Center
then it's going to justify this content
all these flex items in the center
likewise we could say something like
flex and and then they're going to go to
the end but the minute we change this
now to column then that's not going to
work they're not going to Center this
way because now they're taking on all
that width and the axis has changed the
axis the main axis rather is now going
down and justified content remember
works on the main axis so in order to
see this in kind of action what we need
to do is go down here and give this a
bigger height we'll say height is 800
pixels and then what we'll do is change
this to 100 pixels and now you can see
that they're justifying down the main
axis flex n so they're all going to the
end if we put sensor here then they're
all going to go to the center like that
and if we put flex starts they're all
going to go to the start so that's how
this works
justified content always works along the
main axis and when we change the flex
flow property for in column 2 Row 1 Row
2 column we're changing the main axis
from across to down or from down to
across and the justifier content is
always working on that main axis yep it
might seem a little bit confusing at
first I was but then as soon as you
start to play with it a little bit more
it does get easier
and the penny starts to drop so I want
to show you one more thing now and that
is to do with this flex flow we've seen
row and column but we can also do
something like column reverse or rail
reverse so let's check out row reverse
first of all so look at the order right
here yeah if we do row reverse then it's
essentially just going to reverse the
order of those and then put them over to
the right okay check that out again if
we just change this to row so the greens
first here now the Reds first on the
left
okay so it kind of switches it now let's
change this to column and then we'll do
column reverse and it switches it again
changes the order and it goes to flex
end okay so it can get a little bit
complicated when you're mixing all these
different properties up but again let's
say it's just practice so what we're
going to do in the next tutorial is take
a look at some of the properties that we
can apply to the cross axis remember
justified content is applied to the main
axis we're going to look at some
properties which we can apply to the
cross axis next so if you have any
