your forty third of UGS tutorial and in
this video we're going to start looking
up our application to five days okay so
our blog is looking something like this
we can list our different blogs on this
page we can search for them and we can
click into them to show more information
about that blog which is really cool
this is all working fine however this is
all kind of fake jacinth data we're
using that JSON placeholder REST API to
serve up this content and ideally we
want to add our own content in this form
store it in a database and then retrieve
that data here and show our own blogs
only so we're going to start to do that
now using a tool called firebase from
Google so you want to go to firebase
Google to have a look at this and you
can stand up for free it essentially
lets us store data in a no sequel
database which means we're storing it as
JavaScript objects in collections rather
than in tables cells that kind of thing
okay so it works really well with
JavaScript so you can click this button
get started for free to sign up and once
you've done that you want to click this
bullet over here go to console to go to
your own console okay
and then once you're in you can add a
new project by clicking this I've
already added one all you need to do is
give it a name something like that and
create it so once you've created that
just click into it and you're going to
be taken to this page with a lot of
different options on the left so we want
to use the database okay so what we're
going to do is store data aim at this
database and this is going to be the
root URL for our database so we're going
to need that later on at the minute
there's nothing in here which is why it
says no but we're going to add some data
into this in a couple of minutes first
thing you need to do though is go to
rules and you need to edit your rules so
that you can actually write data to this
database by the way I apologize have
slowed my internet connection is right
now so at the minute it's probably going
to look something like this so this
means we can read data from the database
but this means we can't write data to
the database for now we want to change
this to which route okay because that
will allow us to add data now to the
database then publish it
however if you put your application into
production then you don't want to go
with these rules because that basically
means anyone can add data to this
database so you want to set up some kind
of authentication rules instead now to
read more about that I suggest you go to
the docs and that's going to explain it
all to you for now we're just going to
keep it like this just so we can easily
add data to the database so let's go
back to the database by clicking on data
and we need this URL right here so I'm
going to copy that and we're going to
use it in the project in a second okay
there so back in our project I've got
the add blog component up which is the
fonts you add in a new blog and right
down here at the bottom of the form we
have this button which fires this post
message when we try to add a blog now as
a minute that is posting content to this
kind of fake REST API URL this endpoint
right here now we no longer want to do
that we want to post instead to the URL
we just grabbed which is our database
I'm going to paste that in here
but we also want to post it not in a
root level but in some kind of
collection so I'm going to call this
collection post Jason and that doesn't
matter that it doesn't exist at the
minute firebase is going to create this
when it gets that first request and it
does already exist after that it's just
going to post through this collection
okay so before we were posting the title
the body and the user ID now we don't
want this user ID anymore that was just
for that sake Jason so we can delete
this now and what we do want are the
categories and the author so I could
have these things right here like that
but to be honest we could just pass in
the whole blog object instead so instead
of this object right here we can just
delete that and type in this blog and
that is going to pass all of this object
here instead which is the same as just
writing it all out in here okay so now
let's get rid of that closing curly
brace we're passing all of this data to
this URL then what we're going to do is
console that log that data right so
let's see if this works I'm going to
save it and go to our application so if
I go to add a new blog we can start to
add something now I'm just going to add
a blog hood off and I've got some lorem
ipsum down here which I'm just reused so
let's copy and paste all this
and add it to the blog content okay
let's call this a ninja's category and
the author is the net ninja okay so the
preview looks cool let's add this blog
and when we've had to get thanks for
adding your post let's inspect the
elements so we can go to the console and
in the console we get this response so
this response has a body right here with
an object and this is some kind of a
unique name for that object okay we can
use this identifier later if we need it
we also have the body text and we have a
status of 200 okay so let's just go to
five days and see what's been added over
here so now you can see is created this
post collection and if we expand this
this is the main property we just saw
right here okay so that's the unique ID
kind of thing if you like of this post
and if we expand it we can see we've got
an author the categories is an array
with just ninjas the content is this and
the title is hold up cool so let's also
add a few more blocks just so we've got
a few that we can display on the blog
page later on so if we go back to the
application I'm going to close this off
for now and if we go to blog we're still
bring it in all that dummy content but
we can keep adding some new blogs so
what I'll do this time is add some type
of cheese blog so I've got some cheese
pizza or right here and just like rub
that stuff and let's go to the app and
say my fave
cheese and add this in all right luckily
we have a cheese category how cool is
that okay this time it's the angular
Avenger let's add that blog cool okay
let's refresh to add some kind of new
blog this time we'll do a space one so
I've got a space hip 'some as well and
let's call this loft into space how
original and paste it in okay wizards as
the closest have got to some kind of
astronaut suppose or maybe even Mario as
well add blog and let's add one more
this is zombie stuff I'm going to clue
what category this is going to go in and
let's say a run for your life
and there we go and I realize this is
completely cheesy so that gives me an
idea I'll pop it in the tube category
and the view of indicator is adding this
post okay cool
so now we've added at four blog posts
and let's just check this data now we
have all these different items in at the
posts category and they've all got their
old data inside them okay so now we're
storing this in our own database and how
simple is that very very simple so now
what we're going to do in the next
tutorial is in this component go out
grab those blogs and display them right
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
