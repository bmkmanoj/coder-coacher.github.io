sixteenth django tutorial and in this
video we're going to construct our
article detail page okay then so now we
have our urls all hooked up so that when
we click on an individual blog title it
takes us to this new URL and that's the
slug right there then it takes that slug
and it returns it to the browser so
that's all handled in the view over here
for article detail so we're receiving
this slug from the URL right here then
we're sending that back to the browser
now instead of that ideally what we'd
like to do is query the database to find
an article based on this slug remember
when we create an article we give it a
slug right here which is the URL so what
we can do is query the database to find
a particular article with that slug and
if it exists we grab it and we send that
back to a template to display that
particular article instead of just
sending back the slug so that's what
we're going to do in this tutorial so
first of all let's comment out this dude
and underneath instead what we'd like to
do is query the database and get an
article so we'll store that in a
variable called article we'll set it
equal to article which is the model
class remember we imported right here
then we say dot objects dot get to get a
particular object and we can pass in a
parameter here to say what we want to
base this find if you like on so we want
to base it on the slug so we'll say well
the slug parameter has to equal the slug
that we get right here so now it's going
to look for this article in the database
return it to us and store it right here
so now we have that we can render a
template and send that data to the
template so let's say return and it's
render to render a template and inside
the first parameter is always request
then it's the template that we want to
render now we've not created this yet
but it's going to be in the Articles
folder right here then we'll call it
article underscore detail dot HTML okay
so the third parameter is the data
we want to send to this particular
template so that is a dictionary and
I'll attach a property called article to
it you can call this whatever you want
we make sense since we're sending an
article down and I'm going to set that
equal to the article that we just
retrieved right here so now we're taking
that sending it to this template so that
we could output it in the browser so
that's our view taken care of now what
we'd like to do is create this template
so new file and call this article
underscore detail dot HTML all right so
the first thing we want to do is extend
the base layout remember the base layout
was this dude over here with the head
and the closing body tag etc all that
stuff we want to inherit from that so we
say curly braces then percentage signs
for our template tags and we want to say
extends and in single quotes base
underscore layout dot HTML so we're
extending from that I remember we need
to add in a block because in this base
layout template we add in the block
right there so we need to specify where
that block is so again template tags
like so and then we'll say block and
call this content which is what is
expected over here content so we can end
this block underneath by saying and
block like so and inside is going to be
the actual content that we want to put
inside that base layout template so the
first thing I'll do is create a div and
this is going to have a class of article
- detail so this will surround the whole
article and it's basically for stylistic
purposes inside that we'll have another
div and this will have a class of
article and again this is for stylistic
purposes then the different things we
want to output in the article are a
title which will be h2 so we'll add that
first of all we'll come back to this in
a second then the body the text of the
article and then finally the
date that it was published which can be
in a pee tag as well so first of all we
want to output the article title so
remember we have access in this template
to the article object that we send down
right here okay so we can access that
right here by doing our double curly
braces tags and then output article dot
title remember we're getting these
properties from the model we have a
title a slug a body and a date so far so
we can output any of those inside the
template so first of all the title then
we'll output article body which is the
text content of the article and then
finally article dot date okay so now
we're out put in all of those three
things in this article details page so
if I save this and go back to this thing
over here and then click on one of these
now we get the title the body and the
date instead of just sending back the
slug which is pointless now we get the
whole article detail page so there we go
that's how we can take the slug from the
URL in the view we can use that to query
the database to find a particular
article send it back to a template and
then in that template output it to the
browser so things are looking pretty
good and in the next video what I'd like
to do is show you how we can go about
uploading media so that we can display
images in articles as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
