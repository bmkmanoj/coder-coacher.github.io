11th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're gonna talk about ng-include
Wow okay then folks just to recap what
we've done so far we've made this
controller called ninja controller we've
added Delta to the scope object in this
controller we've passed that scope
object through into this section right
here which is controlled by the ninja
controller then we've output the data on
that scope object using expressions to
the browser okay so before we talk any
more about controllers or data and what
I introduced you to a concept which is
going to help us organize our HTML file
okay and that concept is a directive
called ng-include now ng-include
can bring in HTML from another file and
then just dump it into your current view
whenever you need it and it's really
useful for two reasons the first reason
is that it can help us break up a
complex HTML page into logical pieces
okay so if you imagine your application
getting bigger and bigger your HTML is
going to get bigger and bigger and it's
going to be useful to break that HTML up
into little pieces and have them as
external files which we can include when
everyone need them ok the other useful
reason is when we repeat in our code so
say for example there's a section on our
website which is going to be repeated
over and over in different places for
example we could have some social media
buttons like YouTube Twitter Pinterest
whatever and those could be repeated in
the header the footer and on some other
pages now instead of writing them over
and over again in the code what we can
do is create an external file called
social icons not HTML and then we can
just use the ng-include directive
whenever we need it in our view to go
out and grab that code bring it back in
and insert it into the review ok so it's
really cool so what I'm going to do is
keep it simple for this tutorial I'm
just going to create a navigation bar
which we're gonna then inject into this
page using ng-include
so the first thing I want to do is right
click over here and create a new file
called header dot HTML right and for
this tutorial I'm going to make use of
those styles that I put on my github
page
so I've already got them in content and
their CSS the Stars dot CSS if you want
to download those I'll leave the link to
that github page so you can go ahead and
get these styles dot CSS file and put it
into your project file as well okay so
it's just going to look a little bit
better over there now to make this
header I'll need a div and ability of
this an ID of menu iPhone a bar then
within that div we just need a title
first of all sword your h1 and this is
going to be called an injured directory
this is going to be the title of our
application or supposed and then under
that we're just going to do a ul and a
couple of Li tags and within these Li
tags will just be a tags you don't need
to link anywhere at the minute we're
going to talk about linking things up
later when we cover routing but for now
we'll just put the text in so there's
something there copy that and paste
another bad boy down here which is going
to be called list ninjas and when we
click this it's going to take us to some
kind of directory when it's going to
click show all the list of ninjas we
have in our data so if we save that now
obviously nothing is going to show up in
the browser but that's because we've not
included this in the index file so
there's two ways we can do this this
directive can be used as an attribute or
a tag and remember when I talked about
directives just said they can be used in
those two ways so I'll show you both
ways now so if we use the tag way we
just need to say ng - include and then
we do a source attribute and then we put
that equal to something here and we have
to get the path of this header dot HTML
so I'm going to copy the project path
and paste it in here now if we save this
and have a look of here nothing has
happened and this is a common mistake
when we use ng include as well as other
things like filters we have to pass
through things like this in quotations
now because I've already used double
quotations there for the source
attribute I have to pass it through in
single quotations like that so that's a
common mistake for beginners so let's do
that first save and now we see this
header in this file that's pretty cool
so it's going out is grabbing this
heading HTML file from here
and it's including it in this page right
here so we can see on the screen all
right so that is the tag way and if we
just inspect this element just right
click inspect so we can see the HTML
then I'll just make this a bit bigger
for you so you can see right here we've
got ng-include equals header HTML so
that's the tag that surrounds now this
menu bar and semantically I don't think
that's great I would rather have a
header tag so what I would probably do
is use header then use ng-include as an
attribute but this time we get rid of
the source attribute instead and we just
say ng-include equals this right here we
still keep it in single quotes within
the double quotes we still need that but
then this time we'll just close off the
header tag now we're using it as an
attribute and it's still going to do the
same thing so when I save it we still
get the same result here but when I
inspect the element now you're going to
see the menu bar is within the header so
to me that's a little bit more semantic
okay so that my friends is how we use
ng-include
if you have any questions whatsoever
feel free to throw a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
