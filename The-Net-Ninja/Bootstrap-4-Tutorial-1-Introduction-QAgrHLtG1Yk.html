first bootstrap 4 tutorial
all right so what is bootstrap bootstrap
was created by the TWiT team a few years
ago now and it is a front-end framework
so basically that means that if we use
bootstrap when we're creating websites
we can make use of a load of cool
features it provides us with such as a
responsive grid system for our layouts
UI elements such as pop-ups and buttons
reusable classes to help style our
content and also we don't need to worry
about browser compatibility so no more
oops
is this going to work in IE or Firefox
nope bootstrap takes care of all of that
forest plus a lot of other things as
well so this is a quick demonstration on
the bootstrap for website there to show
you how we can layout content and use
some of the different UI elements and I
know this is a pretty crappy looking
website it's not going to go down in the
web design Hall of Fame but if you're
showing us the different elements and an
example of how we can lay them out on
the page and the good thing about
bootstrap as well is that it's fully
responsive so as you can see as we hit
different breakpoints going down then we
see different versions or different
layouts of the contents of bootstrap
takes care of all of that forest now in
this tutorial series I'm not going to
creating this one and then a bigger one
from scratch which looks something like
this and again if she's not going to go
down in the web design Hall of Fame but
the point here is to show you the
different classes the different methods
we can use in bootstrap
to get your content up and running
quickly on a website and then you can go
from that so we're going to make
something like this and again this is
going to be fully responsive and we can
achieve all of this you can just hit
female and some of the classes that
bootstrap providers with I don't need to
write any CSS at all to date looking
like this which is a rather cool now I
know I've already created a bootstrap 3
playlist button of this course is going
to focus on bootstrap for which you now
about heading to beta and it promises
are very few breaking changes from our
so I thought this would be a good point
to kind of refresh and create a course
on the new version with all of its
updates which now include embracing
flexbox grid improvements
updating media queries that has now
dropped IE 9 support whoo
switch the sass and it's introduced a
new component called card which replaces
the old panel so we're going to get into
all of this now I'm not going to cover
everything that bootstrap 4 has on offer
because a lot of the syntax is exactly
or extremely similar to bootstrap 3 so
what I'm going to do is focus on the
newer kind of features so what we'll be
covering is setting up with boots up for
look at the bootstrap reboot the new
great point the Flex grid upgrades
Jumbotrons and cards now the navbar
nav bar and finally tooltips as well so
if you're familiar with bootstraps we
already that's awesome just pick up the
videos you need but if you have not
worked with bootstrap watch it all
before then don't worry that's cool
because I'll be working a pace where you
can probably keep up too but I am
assuming that you at least know HTML and
CSS before you start this course if not
check out my other courses take time out
for beginners and CSS for beginners I'll
leave those links down below so a couple
more things I want to show you before we
get started and download bootstrap are
the course files that I use on github
and also the text editor I'm going to be
using so this is where the course files
are held for this playlist it's in a
repo called
bootstrap for playlist I'm gonna leave
this link down below and if you come
here and check out the different
branches you'll see I've got a different
branch for each different lesson so
lesson 8 is going to correspond to the
code at the end of lesson 8 you can just
look in the index file right here and
copy the code ok the text editor I'm
going to be using for this playlist is
awesome this is my favorite text editor
at the minute really cool looks nice as
well Alex free so go ahead and download
that if you want I'm also using a
package in item called item live server
and this enables me to spin up a local
server to run this index file on that
we're going to be working on so go ahead
and download that if you want as well
all you have to do once it's installed
is hit ctrl shift 3 and that's going to
rob a local server on port 3000 ok so I
will do that in this tutorial series as
well so there we go there's your Express
introduction to bootstrap for in the
very next tutorial I'm going to show you
how we can go ahead and download
bootstrap
use it in our projects if you like these
