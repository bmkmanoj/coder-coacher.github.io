sass tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about pseudo-classes
incest Wow already guys so in CSS we use
pseudo Clancy's to add in extra effects
such as hover effects or we can use them
to insert content after much like we did
with this thing right here and they all
look like that we have a little :
and then whatever pseudo class we want
to use so say for example I want to add
a hover effect to these links at the top
what I normally do in CSS is something
like this I'd say okay well they're in
the main mouth then it's in a tag and
then :
and it would be a pseudo class called
Hobbit and then we'd apply a background
of say 3 3 3 to this and if I save that
now and hover over these we should get
that hover effect so we've used the
pseudo plus right here now how do we use
these in SAS well it's pretty similar
but we need to add in one more thing so
up here in the main now section I can't
just do something like this grab that
pseudo class pop it right there because
that's within the egg and then open up
that code block and paste this thing in
as well just grab that and paste it
there now if I save that then this
wouldn't work I'll save it and they'll
probably throw up an error or something
and it's not throwing up an error but we
don't have that hover effect now the
reason is we need to use an ampersand
for this to work we need to say and
hover okay so we say okay we want the a
tag and we want to apply the hover
effect to it now imma save this it
should work so let's try this out cool
alright so that works and that's how we
add pseudo classes to the different
elements and which is pop it in
whichever element we wanted now let's
get rid of this junk that we just enroll
and in a previous tutorial I added in
this clear fix technique where I said
okay well we want the after pseudo class
on the main nav and when you asserted
these three rules just so that it gained
its hide back right so instead of doing
that why don't we incorporate it up here
so let's come into the UL because that's
the element would
and we'll say and if we can find it on
my keyboard right and and then after and
what we want to do is copy these three
rules and paste them in like so so now
we can get rid of that stuff there and
save it and this still should work yeah
we still retain the height of that
navigation but even better we might want
to use this over and over again in
different elements it might not just be
the UL tok ball elsewhere on the
document if we ever need to Claire the
flow would store anything like that so
why not pop this into a mix in which we
can then import whenever we need to use
it so I'm gonna do that I'm going to
just copy all that out and save it and
you should notice now it's lost its
height and then let's go over to the
mixings and create a new mixing so we'll
say at mixing and I'm going to call this
plate fix like so and then inside here
I'm just going to paste all of that so
I'm saying and after and then those
three rules and then this clay fix
technique can be applied to any rule or
any element that we want it to and we
know how we can do that we just have to
say that's include and then clear fix
like so so if I do that now save it then
we should notice it regain that height
cool so that's how we use pseudo classes
in SAS if you have any questions feel
free to leave a comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
