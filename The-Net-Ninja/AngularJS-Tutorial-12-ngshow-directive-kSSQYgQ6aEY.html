12th angularjs tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna talk about ng-show and
ng-hide wow guys so in the last tutorial
we made this header right here and we
included it using ng-include so it shows
over here
however this bit down here is still it's
a bit crappy so before we get started
with the ng-show and ng-hide
i just want to need to lit off a little
bit all I'm going to do is add a divot
here with a class equal to content and
this class is going to be applying
styles to this stuff down here using
this statute right here in our project
folder now remember you can get this
from a github page which I'll leave the
link to down below ok so we've got that
div right there let's enclose all of the
ninja controller with it like so and
that will do save that and now it's
going to log automatically a lot better
incidentally I also added this
placeholder to the input right here so
that people know to search for ninjas
like that
okay so ng-show and ng-hide there are
two directives which are really cool and
we can use them to either show or hide
data dependent on certain conditions
okay so to explain this I'm going to
jump over to our application code here
in the controller and I'm going to add
some new properties to these ninja
objects and it's just going to be a
property called available okay I'm gonna
set this to true or false depending on
whether this ninja is available for work
or not so let's just copy this for now
available true and come down here and
apply it to each one like that remember
your commerce on the end of the previous
property we need to put those in and
click Save so now they're all true but
let's set one of them to false like that
okay so right you it's not available for
work because he's out selling it
somewhere being a lazy sod so now I only
want to show the ninjas on this list who
are available for work and we can use
ng-show to do now so all we need to do
is add this ng-show directive to the
element that we want to show based on a
certain condition so I'll add it to this
li list right here right because each
one of these is an ally so let's say ng
sure
and set that in course or something
now the way this works is whatever this
is equal to if this is true then it will
show the element if ng-show is equal to
false then it won't show the element and
we could demonstrate that by just
putting in true like that and this is
gonna show them all okay if we set this
equal to false then it's not going to
show anything okay so instead of that
let's go into the property in our data
right here and grab that because that's
what we want to check we want to check
whether they are available or not and we
just need to write ninja dots available
okay because we need to use ninja
because that's what we're saying
each item eight is a ninja in the array
okay
so let's save that now and we should see
three of them appear Yoshi Shan and
crystal and that's because Raghu is
false okay if we change another one say
crystal to false then that should
disappear as well okay so that's really
cool and even if we search for value now
nothing comes up okay
only the ninjas that are available for
work shell this is really cool on the
flip side if we put an exclamation mark
in front of that because this right here
currently is going to evaluate to true
okay for ninja available for some things
the things that are true will now turn
to false okay and the things that are
false will now turn to true this kind of
is the negation operator if you like it
reverses what is currently showing so
now instead of those that are available
showing those that are not available
we'll show instead so let's save that
and you can see when you and crystal
show that's all by just putting this
little exclamation mark in front of this
here okay now there's an easier way to
show the people that are not available
and that's by using ng-hide okay so
let's get rid of this and now only the
people that are available I show it
you're actually in short but if we
change these 2mg hide then what we're
going to say is look anything that's
true here hide instead of show so we're
hiding
anything that is available right so
let's save that now and it's gonna hide
the Shawn and Yoshi ninjas and showed
the other two and that's because it's
true for Yoshi and Shawn and it's hiding
anything which evaluates to true okay so
this is really cool I'm going to change
this back to ng shell because obviously
we want to show the people that are
available and not those that are not
available all right so guys that is
ng-show and ng-hide really cool
directives and dead simple to use if you
have any questions feel free to drop a
comment down below otherwise guys I'll
see you in a very nice tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
