view a tutorial and in this video we're
just going to create a simple view at
which we can use to explore the view
x-ray alright so another tutorial we set
up a blanket view application using the
view CLI and it looks something like
this in the browser so this is a load of
dummy content that the view CLI made for
us and it's all being driven by this app
dot view root component so this is the
template right here and we have this
data down here we don't want any of this
junk so what I'm going to do is just
delete most of it I'm going to delete
all of this but I will keep this app ID
right here we're going to put all of our
content within that also we don't need
this message data down here either
finally I just want to strip out all of
these styles because I don't want any of
those so if I save this now then
hopefully this is going to refresh
automatically and we're going to see a
blank canvas over here
okay cool so this is what we're going to
create just a very simple view
application where we're going to have
two sub components and one parent
component and this is going to be some
kind of very simple shop where we're
going to display four or five products
okay so these two sub components they're
both going to display a list of products
the products are going to be the same
but they're going to be styled
differently so I want you to imagine
rather than seeing both of these
components on the same page at the same
time each one is going to be somewhere
different on the website and they're
going to be styled differently okay but
they're using the same data so first of
all let's flush out this parent
component so inside the app first of all
what do we want to do well we want it
nest our other components so I'm just
going to create the tax release first of
all and we'll come back to them later so
we'll call the first one product - view
or rather product - list I still have
one and we'll do another called product
list - like so now it's not creating
these components at the minute but we'll
come back to those later the second
thing you want to do in here is create
some data so I want to create some kind
of array of product now I'm not going to
type this out I'm just going to copy
from a gilt page and paste it right in
here so it's a property called product
and then it's an array and each item in
the array is an object and each object
represents a product
got a name and the prices could be in
like pounds our dollars doesn't really
matter so anyway there's our data now
the next thing I want to do is create
these two things right here these two
components right so I'm going to right
click the source folder and create a new
folder and I'm going to call this
components this is where all of our sub
components will live in this application
so we need two of these I'm going to
create a new file and I'm going to call
this product list one dot view and then
I'm going to create a new one called
product list to W so we have our two
components now we need to flesh them out
and instead of just writing out
everything I'm going to copy this paste
it in front this one will delete this
data we don't really need that and we
don't need the name over here either so
now we want to flush out the listing so
instead of having it gives us an idea of
app what I'm going to do is give this an
ID of product - at least - one and then
inside I want to H - first of all and
this is going to be product list 1 and
by the way if at any point you're
struggling to keep up with this then
feel free to check out my view as - for
beginners playlist where it was through
all of this in great detail I'm just
quickly putting together a view
application here so I'm not going to
spend much time explaining all the
different concepts
so anyway under this h2 I'm going to do
a ul and let's add this you else we're
going to loop through some data using
the Li tag and a V - 4 and that's going
to equal to something later on we don't
have the data within this component yet
to do that but later on we'll do it and
we're going to output our products right
here so I want to copy this now and I
want to paste it inside this dude over
here and instead of it being product
this one I want this to be 2 and he also
wanted this to be 2 down here ok so we
have our two sub components now and
we've saved both of those the next thing
I need to do is actually register and
import those components in this route
component so we can actually do this and
less them here so first of all inside
the script tag I'm going to import them
both so say imports the card product
list one from and then instead of string
dot /to say the current directory then
components and then its forward slash
product list one dot view so importing
this component right here places
semicolon at the end I'm just going to
copy this dude and paste it down below
and change this to two and change this
to two as well so we imported both of
those components now I need to register
them with inside the subject so that we
can use them up here in the template so
to do that I'm going to say components
and this right here is going to be an
array and object sorry and inside here
we can register each individual one so
the first one is product this one so I'm
going to copy that
I'm going to paste it inside there and
then because so when you see this in the
template I want you to use this
component so we'll place that right
there is the value with that the next
one will do is product list - so let's
paste this dude over here down here and
then this is going to be product list -
okay so we've imported both of those
components now registered limit right
here and then when nesting them begin
the template at the top so now that
we've seen this we can probably view
those products over here in a second
now there's no products at the minute we
just see the heat tubes but what we need
to do now is pass down this data this
Product data into each one of these
components now how we're going to do
that well we're going to use V - dying
to do that so we - bind and we're going
to bind to a property called products
that's what we're going to send down and
that's going to be equal to this thing
here this property name products okay so
we're binding this data and we're
passing it down in component one right
there and also this component product
lists so so we'll save that and then we
can go to this product list one
component and we can accept that data
and to do that all we need to do is
define a property down here called crops
so so props
and that's going to be equal to an array
and inside this array we need to say
which data were receiving well we're
receiving is the product status so we
can just place that one element in there
and then a comment at the end cool so
now we can cycle through this products
data right here so I'm going to say V
having four products that's a singular
in products so by doing this what we can
do is output a new ally for every
element that's inside this array of
products
all right and each time we cycle through
and output a new ally the individual
product that we're currently cycling on
is equal to this name right here a
product you can name it's what you want
iconic product it's singular of products
what we're looping through so inside
this Ally I want to output two things
the name and the price remember in the
data we've got the name right here and
the price so I want to output those two
things so I'll put each one in a span
the first one I'm going to give a class
of name is going to be for stylistic
purposes later on and then we're going
to output the product name I'm going to
copy this and paste it down below again
and this time I'll give it a class of
price and what output product price
right that we'll just stick a pound
symbol before that okay so now
outputting this data right here so I
save it you're going to see hopefully
this stuff right here so I'm going to
copy now all of this because we're going
to do exactly the same inside this
component right here
I'm going to output the same data we
still need to receive it
so let's come inside our object over
here and we'll say procs
and in the array it's going to be the
product that we're receiving so if I
save this now then hopefully we're going
to see the products out here as well
just need to place a little comment at
the end save it and now we see the
products in product list two and product
is one cool so like I said I want you to
imagine these they're in ten different
places on your website and that's
displaying the same products but they're
going to display them in a different
style so I'm going to spell both of
these up differently we'll start with
product list two I'm going to put a
scope keyword there so the Styles only
apply to this component now I'm not
going to write all of these styles out
because
just going to Boras and this is not
exactly a CSS course so I'm just going
to copy these from my git repository and
paste them right in here and save this
and let's see that spelled product with
two I just refresh ops we will do it
though yep and let's go to product this
one and again I'm just going to copy
these from a github repository and paste
them right here save that refresh now we
can see product list one and product
list two are styled differently finally
what I want to do is just two little
styles in this so again they're just
coming from my repo and paste them in
there just to give the font family of a
bull two and call it a kind of like a
charcoal gray and it looks a little
nicer cool okay so this is a vanilla
view j/s application we're not using any
of us whatsoever at the minute and
notice all of our data this products
array is stored on this root component
right here this is what we do in a
normal view Jeff's application but what
I want to do in the next tutorial is go
ahead and install view X then create a
centralized store for all of our data
and store this data in that store
instead and we're going to show you how
to do all that in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
