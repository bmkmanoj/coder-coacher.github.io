CSS for beginners less than 53 and this
video is gonna be part 2 of the CSS
website build Wow again so we're just
gonna start off where we left in the
last video and if you remember I showed
you we have this simple HTML file here
and we start to style it with these
styles and that gave us this nicely
styled navbar right here so we're just
going to carry on and crack on with the
rest of the page so the next thing I
want to do is just neaten up this image
here if you look to the very right of it
it's got this very thin white line and
that's the background under here peeping
through because the image is not the
full width so we're just going to make
this image here stretch all the way
across so to do that I want to find it
in my HTML it's this image right here
and it's within the lead banner ID so
we'll copy that come down here and we'll
target it in the CSS and we'll say we
want the image within that bleed ban
active and we're just going to say width
100% and then that scootsie right across
gives it 100% width of this wrapper so
it's taking up all the room and we no
longer have that thin white bar at the
end cool so next thing we want to do is
come down here and style these things up
and to do that we're going to go after
this shop div is everything's within the
shop so we're going to grab that copy it
and paste it down here and the first
thing I want to do is give this a margin
of 30 pixels and then 0 left and right
so I'm just gonna give it this space in
here and at the bottom here so it's away
from both banners the next thing I want
to do is give it a text align property
and we're going to say Center and now
everything scoots into the center there
that's really cool so text align not
only effects text when you've got that
inside you t'v but also images so it
centralizes everything within this
column so that's really cool so the next
thing I want to
do is style up that product name right
here so to do that I'm just gonna give
us some room down there I'm gonna say
shop h2 dot product name because up here
you can see the h2 it's got a class of
problem name so that's what we're
grabbing there and we'll say we want
that have a few styles and the first one
is going to be a font size oops
font size 16 pixels so we just reduced
that in size a little bit and we're
going to give a margin bottom of the
zero because we want it to be right up
against the price when we style that and
that's what we need to do for that the
next thing I'm going to do we grab the
price so that's a span tag and it's got
the class of price and let's display
that first of all as block and then what
that does my friends is because we've
given it a block display type is it's
going to take up the whole row remember
block level elements take up a whole row
and inline elements are stacked side to
side that's why it was static side to
side with this and this initially
because these three are all by default
inline elements so we've give that a
display of block so it's taking up now
the whole row and it's forcing these two
on to the next line which is cool
because we want this to have its own row
so the next thing we want to do is
increase that font size we're going to
say we want it to be a lot larger 58
pixels and then that's going to make it
roughly the same width as this thing
here so it looks nice and neat alright
so the next thing we want to do is grab
this link here and make it into a button
so to do that we're going to say shop
and then it's an a link and it's got a
class add - - - bag and that's this link
right here so let's stir this up and the
first thing we want to do again is to
give it a display of block that's going
to give it the whole rub and force the
Stars onto the next line then we'll give
the color of that beige color again
which is if I can remember properly
eight f7 for 6c I think yep there we go
cool then we'll give it a text transform
property
of uppercase make them all capitals yep
and we're looking at font size twelve
picture let's make it a little bit
smaller that's fine
text decoration I've done because we
want to remove that underline it would
just skew off this you can see it's
currently underlined we don't want that
so we'll just put it on and that takes
away the underlying will give me some
padding we give it 10 pixels top and
bottom left or right I'm going to give
it zero because we're going to make this
a definite width so we don't need to
give it the padding on the left and
right and the next one is going to be a
border and we're going to say two pixels
solid and we're going to say that same
basic color against what was that this
this thing here let's copy and paste
that because I'm being a bit lazy and
pop that there yep and then we'll give
it a width of 210 pixels so if I just
scoot off this a minute you can see
currently it's got that default width of
100% because it's a block level element
because of this yeah so by default is
taking up the full width we don't want
map width we want to give it a definite
width which is gonna be kind of this
size here the same width as this and
this so that's roughly about 210 pixels
but now you can see it's gone off to the
left over here now I don't want that I
wanted to be in the middle so remember
from the margin lesson I showed you that
trick and also in part 1 of this
tutorial where we say margin will give
me 30 pixels top and bottom know what we
do it 20 pixels 20 pixels top and bottom
and then for the left or right we just
ate Auto
and then that scoots in right to the
center okay so that's what we want to do
for that button now it looks nice and
cool I would like a hover effect so
let's put one of those in let's get this
and add a pseudo plus to it now we've
covered pseudo classes remember it's
just a colon that we put after our
selector and the particular serial
classroom for this is the hobbit one
because we're given a hover effect and
we'll just change the color to white and
the background of the button to that
beige color which is 8 f7 460 cool so
let's check this out now
oops that's not working
I didn't put the background property in
that's right okay there we go
cool so there's our button the stars
don't really need styling they're all in
the middle they've got that margin there
this bottom image does have that thin
gap there where the whites poking
through so we're going to get rid of
that as well
now that image is within this div the
footer banner so let's copy that and
give that the rule down here and then
we'll say the image within it is gonna
be a width of 100% and boom there we go
guys that is completely done how long
has that taken me what seven minutes in
this lesson and about ten minutes in the
last lesson so in under 20 minutes I've
styled that with CSS and made a website
the HTML took about five minutes this
took about 20 Atmos or 25 minutes we've
gone ourselves a one-page website that
is how simple it is guys if you have any
questions obviously feel free to comment
down below otherwise take this go out
mess with it make your old website so
