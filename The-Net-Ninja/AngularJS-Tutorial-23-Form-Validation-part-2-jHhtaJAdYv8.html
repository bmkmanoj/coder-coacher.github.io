23rd angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to carry on our
discussion with form and validation part
200 Kanan dudes so in the last tutorial
what we did was use those classes that
angularjs provided us with to offer some
kind of feedback to a user when they
don't enter data into a form correctly
for example if we touch this name field
and then moves away without filling
anything in it's going to go read around
the borders and that's what our way of
saying look this is required but as soon
as we enter something in that's fine it
goes back to normal
likewise with the email if we move out
of it now after we've touched it and
there's nothing there it's red and if we
write an email that's not valid it's
still red but as soon as we do something
that is valid it goes back to normal
okay that's crazy spelling but you get
the point
so I want to take this one step further
this time and offer the users some more
useful feedbacks such as a sentence that
says you must enter a name or a valid
email etc and to do that we're going to
make use of some of the properties that
angular provides us with on this contact
form object okay so for pretty much
every class that it gives us like we
used in the last tutorial things like ng
invalid or ng touch we have a
corresponding property which is a
boolean true or false
so here's some of the properties that
angular provides us with so we have
these classes right ng pristine and
utility touched valid and invalid and
these and the corresponding properties
so when a field has this class ng
pristine and it's not been touched then
this property on that field is going to
be true when the class goes that it's
been replaced by ng dirty this is going
to be false
likewise when pristine is true dirty
will be false when pristine is false
dirty will be true right they're always
opposite to each other those two same
with touched and untouched and valid and
invalid so there are billions that
basically tell us whether a certain
field has been touched
whether it's dirty pristine whether it's
valid etc
and we can use those to kind of
dynamically output or the data which is
what we're going to do now
all right there so just a quick
demonstration first of all I'm just
going to output some of these properties
to the browser so you can see them as we
interact with the form so under the
first input I'm going to do a quick span
tag and then down here I'm going to
write the variable names first of all
something like our pristine and I'm not
referencing that variable this is just
outputting text to the browser at the
minute but within an expression I'm
going to output the value of that
variable I remember these variables are
all stored on the form object and the
input object right so we have to
reference this first of all this is just
regular JavaScript I'm just grabbing
that contact form object like we can do
and then dots name because that's the
field that we want and then after that
we do the property that we want to
output which is pristine okay so that's
the pristine one and we're going to
output the opposite one which is dirty
down here I'll just change this to dirty
and this to dirty and in fact what we're
going to do now is just copy and paste
this a few times I'm going to do it four
more times because we're going to output
four more things and the next one I want
to output is on torch and I'll output
the property name there and then
obviously the opposite one which is
touched and touched and then finally
we're going to have invalid invalid and
then we're going to have valid on the
end and then valid right here like that
okay so I save that now and we can see
when we refresh and we first load up the
form its pristine this is true this
property right here Duty is false
because we've not entered anything yet
so these are opposite ok untouched is
true that's right untouched is false so
again opposite invalid is true because
we've not entered anything yet it's not
valid and valid is false so the
opposites right but as soon as we enter
something like Ohio then watch these
change so pristine becomes false
because now I've entered something into
it dirty is true so that opposite again
untouched is false because it has been
touched touched is true so opposites
again and invalid is false and valid is
true again opposites but they've all
switch now okay so we can use these
properties now output data dynamically
which is what we're going to look so
let's get rid of those I'm going to keep
that spun tag in fact I'll make this a
div like so and then what I'm going to
do is use the directive called ng show
now we've seen that in a few tutorials
back where we can basically check the
value of a boolean and if this is true
then we're going to show it if it's
false then we walk shall we okay so
we'll say ng show only show this element
if something is true and the things that
I want to be true are if it's torched
so we'll say contact form dot name dot
torch so if that's true if we've gone
ahead and touch one of these and rather
we want to conditions to be true we also
want it to be invalid okay so it's been
touched and it's still invalid then
we'll show this element where we're
going to offer feedback saying hey you
need to enter something that is valid
okay so touched and contact for dot a
dot invalid like that so we're going to
show this then then we're going to do a
small tag just going to give you some
styles to make it red so I'll say color
red I'll display a block and then I'll
also do text-align:center and the
feedback message is going to be enter a
valid name okay so now let's give this a
whirl
so by false it's not going to show and
that's because these two properties
touched and invalid the well this is
true but this is false it's not been
touched yet okay so this is only going
to show when both of these are true so
as soon as it's been touched
and then we move away now we get that
feedback message enter a valid name as
soon as we type it in it goes away
pretty cool right so we can do the same
thing for the email I'm going to copy
that and I'm going to paste it right
under here this time we change name to
email and we change it there as well and
we're going to change this to email okay
save that and then when we refresh if we
come to the email and we type something
that's not valid like this move away now
we get that feedback message same with
the name if we move away we get the feed
of a feedback message okay so I want to
show you one more thing and that is how
we can kind of disable this if the form
is not valid because we don't want
people clicking if you've got invalid
fields do it so the way we do that is by
coming here and we're going to use ng -
disabled and this works in a similar way
to ng show we're going to say we want
this button to be disabled if this form
is not valid okay so we'll just get this
contact form again and then we're going
to use the dot invalid property so when
this form is invalid okay then this is
going to be disabled so currently it's
invalid and I can't right-click it now
because it's disabled but if we
right-click somewhere else and inspect
the element then I'll show you what this
does to the element itself you can see
down here input and you can see disabled
equals disabled that's because this form
is not yet valid okay so now what we can
do is attach a style to this so we're
going to use a CSS selector right down
here at the bottom and I'm going to say
input and I'm going to use one of these
attribute selectors and it's going to be
disabled equals disabled and then what
I'll do is set its opacity to not point
forward just to make it fade out a
little bit and then I'm also going to
change the cursor and the cursor is
going to be oops if I can spell it right
see you are so ah there we go and that
the cursor is going to be not allowed
like that I'm going to set this to
important like that okay so if I save
this now when we hover over this it's
going to get that little cursor right
there to say we can't click this but if
we go ahead and fill this in and
everything becomes valid just make an
email address and bloody blood blood now
we can send okay if we delete one of
these now we can't send bloody glass
okay so that is what we can do with
these different properties they're
really flexible and we can kind of give
the user feedback and allow them to do
certain things dependent on how or
whether or not field and the form is
valid okay so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to leave a comment
down below otherwise guys don't forget
to share subscribe and all that jazz and
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
