42nd VJ s tutorial and in this video I
want to talk about route parameters okay
so before we dive into any code I just
want to talk about what route parameters
are so imagine you've got a blog and you
go to a specific blog post right then
the route might look something like this
/blog forward slash 1 2 3 and this 1 2 3
is the unique ID of that one particular
blog you're viewing same goes if you go
to forward slash blog forward slash 500
you will get back a blog page which
looks identical to this one in terms of
structure and layout but we're getting
different content it's a different blog
right so this thing right here that
changes is known as a round parameter
and we kind of tell you jes it's a wrap
parameter by giving it this syntax a
double dollar column and then the name
of that wrap parameter so if we want to
set up a round parameter for one of our
routes it's pretty simple we go to our
routes file and we define a new round
object like this then for the path we
can say forward slash blog forward slash
whatever our route parameter is called
we're going to call it ID because we're
working with blogs and each plug is
going to have a unique ID and then we
say which component we want to load up
for this URL ok
so it's going to be a single blog
component so no matter what number a
user types in here and hits enter in the
address bar of the browser we're going
to still get up this single blog
component but then we want to show
different blogs depending on what the
user types here what number right
because each blog will have a unique ID
so how do we do that
well in this single blog component we
can detect our route parameters and we
can handle it
so if someone comes to 5/3 we could
detect that grab the three then make a
hasty PP request for the correct
resource so we could find a blog post on
a database with the unique ID of 3 and
then load it into this component right
so it's the same component for all
different blogs but we're just loading
in a different blog
depended on what the user types in here
okay then so the first thing I want to
do is add in that route to our router JS
file so comma then let's do another
object and the path is going to be this
time forward slash blog forward slash
then the route parameter name which is
going to be ID okay so the component we
want to load up is going to be the
single blog component and not single
blick single blog and we've not imported
that yet so let's import it so we'll
just copy this paste it down below and
it's going to be called single blog same
over here and we've not actually created
this component yet so let's save this
and go ahead and create this now so any
components giving you file and we'll
call this single blog dot view and in
here we need a template first of all so
how are we going to display this single
block well I want to do a give to
surround it all first of all so I'll say
give and we're going to give this an ID
and this is going to be equal to single
blog so we'll say single - blog and
inside this div we want a title of the
blog so h1 and we're going to
dynamically output stuff in here later
on for now let's just leave it blank and
then underneath an article tag we're
going to output the body of the block
okay so the next thing we need to do is
make our object for this component so
inside this script tag will export
default this object okay and then inside
here we're going to create some data so
first of all we need to say data and
then inside this we need to return an
object so we'll return an object with
our data properties now we're going to
have an ID and I'll come back to this in
a minute so I'll just set it to null for
the time being and then also a blog
object which after we've reached out to
the server and grabbed our data we're
going to store all of the blog
information such as the title
the content in this object right so this
ID right here this is what we want to
grab from the URL so if we go to forward
slash blog forward slash 500 we want
this to be 500 so we need to access that
route parameter and we can do that
pretty easily in the UJS by saying this
dot then dollar sign route and we can do
this because we've got review router
installed and we can then access a
property called params and then the name
of our parameter now we call this ID so
whatever name is there - this color
right so we can say dot ID and that is
going to graph that route parameter from
the URL and it's going to store it in
here so when we come to make a request
now we know which resource to go and get
okay so after we've done the data let us
now do the created lifecycle hook
because what we're going to do is go out
and grab some data and it's always going
to put it in this created life cycle
hope when the component has been created
so to do that we'll say this dot HTTP
we've seen this already this is how we
go on grab some data using the get
method and we want to place in the URL
right here now we're going to use the
JSON placeholder again so the URL for
that I've got on my github repository
and go and grab it it's lesson 42 I'm
going to paste it in right here so we're
going to forward slash posts and then to
get a single post from here what we need
to do is passing the ID of the post for
example 65 right here now we don't want
to hard code it in this string because
then we're just getting one post all at
the time right so instead what we want
to do is tack on this thing right here
that we've grabbed from the URL so we
can just concatenate that I've seen plus
this dot ID okay and that's going to
grab this property right here so now if
we go to file / blog forward slash 200
and this grabs that 200 so it's stored
in a gig this is going to get the
resource forward slash posts forward
slash 200 yeah make sense okay so this
returns a promise which means we can
tack on dot then so when this action
finishes right here
function inside dog then is going to fly
us and inside this function we're going
to get back some data right so we can
pass through the data right here so this
data we can set equal to this thing
right here so we're storing the data we
get back inside this blog object so
we'll say that so first of all I'll say
this blog is equal to data and it's the
body property on the data we get back
that we want and I'll just demonstrate
that now so let me just say console dot
log and then we'll log the data to the
console now before a preview this in a
browser
I just want to tack on my common air
because I totally forgot before so I'll
save this now and if we go to forward
slash blog then forward slash some kind
of ID or say 20 then we should in the
console see this data right here that
we're login so let's have a look in the
console and we see this response right
here and down here I said this top blog
is equal to data body so and this
property right here whatever is in here
I'm setting equal to this right so we're
storing each one of these properties by
the ID title and user ID in this blog
object now so we could access them and
output them right here to the template
so let's do that let's output the title
and the body so I'm going to say double
curly braces and then blog title and
underneath the body so the content so
blog top body and we'll save that and
let's have a look and now we see that
blog right here
okay cool so just a quick one I've
already added these styles right here
this single blog style just dead simple
much width of 960 pixels and imagine of
0 and also that's what's centralizing it
on the page right there cool so this is
really good now if we go to a different
URL each time for example 22 we're going
to get back a different blog all right
so 30 a different blog cool so this is
very good but really a user is not going
to type in with the ID in the address
bar
what they're probably going to do is
look at the blogs right here and click
on one of them and that's going to take
them to a blog right so we need to kind
of baked up functionality into this
application so let's do that so what I'm
going to do is go to our shell blogs
component right here and we need to add
a link in to each blog to go in direct
to that blog right so how are we going
to do this well let's have this around
the h2 so if you click on the h2 then we
go to the blog first thing you want to
do is just get rid of this rainbow
directly right here okay
so let's add on the router link there so
router - link and there we'll put the
closing tag at the end so right about
here and then we want to say 2 equals
somewhere alright so where do we want to
go well we want to go to forward slash
blog and then to forward slash whatever
ID they put in or whatever ID this is
right so to do that we're going to have
to use some data binding because we're
going to dynamically output the ID
remember we store the ID in the blog
right so in each blog right here we have
access to that I'd be property so what
we can say is V - bind to and then this
is going to be a string first of all in
here this first part because just
forward slash blog that kind of
hard-coded right and then what we're
going to do is tack on so let's get rid
of that we're going to tack on the ID
so that's blog - ID so each time we go
around in this for loop without putting
the blog ID okay so if we save that now
and check this out in a browser we can
see now these are linked so if we click
on one of them then we should go to that
page however this is not working there
it is just took a while to load okay
cool so if we click on a different blog
we get that one pretty cool right so now
we have set up our links from this blog
page here to individual blogs using or
wrap parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
