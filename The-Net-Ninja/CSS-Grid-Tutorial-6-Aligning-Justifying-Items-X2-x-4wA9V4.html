sixth CSS grid tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna take a look at
justifying and aligning item okay so
we're back to having six elements right
here inside this Content ID this grid
and each element has a class of one two
three four five six so we can style them
independently and up here you can see
I've got two properties already grid
template columns to define the number of
columns which is going to be three and
each column is going to be the same
width one fraction I've also used the
property grid Auto rows to set the row
height and that's minimax so a minimum
height of 150 pixels and a maximum
height of auto if this content within it
so we've also got a grid gap of 10
pixels and if we take a look at this in
a browser now we can see something like
this so a height of hundred and fifty
pixels for each row and six elements
spanning over three columns and two rows
so I'd like to show you in this tutorial
how we can align these elements to the
different positions inside their block
if you like so imagine each one of these
is a square on the grid or rectangle or
whatever you want to call it
automatically they're taking up the full
space of each rectangle right now what
if we don't want to do that what if we
want to for example align each of these
items to the left of that rectangle
right or the top of that rectangle well
we can do that using a couple of
different properties so the first one
I'm going to show you is to add those
properties to the grid itself the
wrapper element so this thing right here
and this is going to either align or
justify all of the items within it right
rather than just one or two so we can
override them on an element by element
basis and I'm going to show you that in
a second but to begin with let's just
add these properties to control all of
them so we're going to add this to this
content div right here and the way we do
this is by saying aligned
- items well then I'm going to give this
a property of start and if I save this
now take a look what happens they all go
to the top of the row right they no
longer take up the full height of the
row they're going up to the top and
they're taken up just the height of the
content inside it along with the padding
alright so that's how we align items to
the top we can also align them at the
end
by using the end keyword and that's
going to align them at the bottom of
each row all right now by default it's
given the keyword stretch we don't have
to supply this but that is what the
value is
without supplying one to begin with so
if I don't use align items then it's
gonna give it that value anyway so we
can also align items to the left and
right but this time it's not aligned
items its justify items so a line is
opened down justify is left and right so
justify - items and then this time I'll
say start so let's see that this time we
get the content width of the element not
the whole width that stretches across
the whole block and it's at the start of
each column again we can use end save
that and this time there at the end of
each column right and if I combine this
with say starts over here then they're
going to be little squares at the start
of the actual row so at the top but at
the end of each column right that's
pretty cool so this is how we can align
and justify all the items within the
grid but like I said we can do this on
an element by element basis so I'm going
to comment out this stuff right here and
then do it to each element individually
so we'll say element one which has a
class of one and this is going to have
justify - self start like so and if I
take a look at this it just targets this
one element and it justifies it to the
left to the starts remember justify it
is left and right likewise I could type
end and it's going to go to the end of
the column all right so let's also maybe
align it to the end of the row and to do
that we'll say a line - self end like so
and now we get it down here cool right
so now let's move on to number two and
in here I'm going to say a line - self
and it's going to be Center this time so
this time not at the start or the end
but it's going to align it so
chili and we can see now it's gone into
the middle of the room alright and we'll
do the same thing for justify or say
justify - itself and center again this
is going to put the block right in the
center right there cool so let's do one
more number three we'll say three and
this time we'll say a line self is gonna
be--start and also justify self is gonna
be--start as well so let's save that and
check it out this time start at the top
of the rope for a line self and start at
the start of the column for justify self
alright so this is how we take the
content inside each one of these grid
blocks or grid squares if you like and
we can justify it to different portions
of that square so top left top right
bottom right bottom left on the center
or just the top on the bottom whichever
you prefer using these couple of
properties right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
