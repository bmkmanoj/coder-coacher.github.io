tenth Atmos crip six tutorial and in
this video we're gonna take a look at
sets why are they gang so sets are a new
data structure that we can use in es6
and we can use them to store a set of
unique values of whatever type you want
so let's go ahead and create a new set
I'm going to create a variable just call
this names and I'm going to set it equal
to a new set just like that so there's a
bunch of different methods that we can
use on this new type and we're going to
go through these the first one I'm going
to show you is the add method and we use
their add method so basically just add
elements to this set so what I'll do is
grab the name to set like that and I'll
just say add and then we're going to add
something in here so we'll just add a
string and we'll call this short then
because this returns this method the set
itself what we can do is we can chain
these together so I can say dot add
again and add a new name so I'll add Ryu
this time and it can go on and add as
many as you want I'll add another one
and I'll call this crystal okay so now
if we log this to the console I'll say
console dot log get the names set press
save and refresh let's see what we get
so we says here we get a set and in this
set is Shawn Ryu
crystal alright so I said that they can
hold unique values so what if we try to
add a Ryu again let's go to add and say
right press save and refresh and you'll
notice that it's not added it on again
it's taken it out so what sets do is
eliminate duplicates and that's really
useful for when we have an array which
may have some duplicates and we want to
convert that into a set to get rid of
those duplicates all right I'll show you
how we can do that shortly for now I
just want to show you a couple more of
these methods so we'll get rid of this
for now we don't really need it that
final pad and this time I want to show
you the size method so I'll say names
dot size and log this to the console
so log and this should print out the
size of this set so if we refresh you
can see now we get three because there's
three different elements in that set if
we were to delete some of these first of
all and then print out the size and it's
going to change so how do we delete
elements from the set well it's pretty
simple we just say names dots delete and
then we can say whichever name we want
to delete so I'm gonna get rid of
crystal just like that I'm press save
and refresh then and now you can see in
the set crystals no longer there and
names dot size has gone down to two now
this doesn't return the set it returns a
boolean so it's gonna be true if it
really successful II remove something
and false if it doesn't and it can
demonstrate that by logging this to the
console as well so i say console dot log
and get all that stuff in there save it
and refresh and you can see it returns
it true so we don't chain these together
these delete ones much like we did with
the add if I try to do that we're
probably gonna get an error so I'll say
don't delete again and this time I pass
in Shon like so if I save and refresh
this time names doc delete delete is not
a function so we can't do that okay so
we've seen at we've seen delete and I've
seen dots sighs if we want to get rid of
every single element within the set we
can use the dot clear method so we'd say
something like this
names dots clear and we don't need to
pass anything through in here as
parameters because it's just going to
get rid of the whole shebang so if we
save it now refresh then you're gonna
see that the name star size is now zero
and the set has got nothing in it
whatsoever all right I'm not going to
use that now I'm gonna get rid of it I
just wanted to show you guys and the
last one I want to show you is the dot
has method so we can check whether a set
has a certain element and this is gonna
return a boolean which is true if it
finds that value in the set and
fall through it doesn't so let's check
for one of the names I'll say console
dot lot because we're gonna blog this
boolean to the console and I'm gonna say
names dots has and we're gonna check for
right because we've removed crystal
there so we'll check for right save that
and refresh and you can see we get true
because it has Ryu in the set if we
change this to crystal and don't forget
we deleted crystal right here then what
will happen is we'll get false because
no longer is crystal in the set alright
so there the methods I wanted to show
you so we have add delete sighs clear
and has all those five methods right now
I said before that this is a set of a
unique values so one thing I said it was
good for doing is getting rid of
duplicates in an array and I'll show you
how we can do that so what I'm going to
do is create a new variable called
ninjas and I'm just gonna set this equal
to an array and in this array this could
be a bunch of news your soul Shan
crystal Yoshi Ryu and then I'm going to
add some duplicates I'm gonna pop in
Yosh it again and I'm gonna pop in Ryu
again okay so now we have all these
different names in this array and have
duplicates of Yoshi and Ryu so say we
want to get rid of our duplicates in
this array and just imagine that this
arrays much larger you know we've got
hundreds of names instead so it's gonna
be a much more manual task to go through
it and find them ourselves well we could
just turn this into a set and then the
set is going to take care of or
duplicate data for us so what I'm gonna
do is create a new set now I'm gonna say
var refined ninjas equals new set and
I'm going to pass in to this new set
this array so I'm going to say ninjas
like that and if we log now to the
console this set and we say console that
log
and passing refined ninjas if we do that
and save what we are going to see is a
set of ninja names without the
duplicates inside them all right and
then what we can do is we can get this
back into an array by using the spread
operator so we can basically spread now
refined ninjas and then pop that into a
new array so down here what I'm going to
say is ninjas now equals this array
which is going to be the refined ninjas
with the spread operator in front of it
so now when we console that log ninjas
we're going to get that array without
any duplicates so you can see there
we've got the array again and no
duplicates inside it and that's because
we've converted first of all the array
into a set which gets rid of all the
duplicates then we've used the spread
operator to spread the elements of that
set into individual components and we've
entered those into the array ninjas here
which is overriding this one then we've
logged that to the console so now we
have an array of ninjas with no
duplicates all right so there we go guys
that is set in a nutshell if you have
any questions feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise I will see
you in a very nice tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
