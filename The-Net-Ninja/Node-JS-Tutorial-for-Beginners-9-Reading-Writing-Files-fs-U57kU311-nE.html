ninth nodejs tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can read
and write files using the node core
module FS all rather than campus so
we're getting into the cool stuff right
now
we're going to do one of the better
things that no can do for us all the
more exciting things it can do for us
and that is reading and writing files on
our computer so to do this we're going
to need the help of one of nodejs EES
core modules and that module is called
FS so let's go ahead and create a
variable call this FS and set that equal
to a require and then remember when we
require one of nodejs ease core modules
we just pop the name of the module in
there so it's called
FS and this right here is a typical
naming convention when we require
modules we generally set the variable
name equal to the module name okay so
what can this FS module do for us well
it can do quite a lot of different
things but in this tutorial we're just
going to focus on reading and writing
files so let's read a file first and we
need a file to read so I'll create one
in this directory I'll right-click this
node.js playlist and got a new file and
call this doom reboot dot txt so this is
just a simple text file and then in here
I'll say yay you ready okay so let's
save that dude and now we want to go out
and read this file so the way we do this
is by saying FS and then saying read
file sync this is the method that we're
going to use on this FS module that can
go out and read this file and this right
here is node being very explicit in its
methods name this is a synchronous
method meaning that if we had any code
underneath here it's going to go out and
fully read this file before it moves on
to any other code so this is blocking
code we're blocking the flow of the code
until this is complete there is an
asynchronous version of this which I'm
going to look at later on but for now
this one will do so we need to us
through
a couple of parameters here the first
one is going to be the file itself
now this can either be the full path to
the file or because it's in the same
folder as us I'm just going to pop in
read me text and it's going to find it
because it's relative to this file right
here okay so the second parameter I need
to pass through is the character
encoding because we're dealing with
binary data here when we go out and read
a file we're dealing with binary data
which is just zeros and ones and the
character encoding is going to basically
determine what all those zeros and ones
mean and convert them into the letters
that we understand so the encoding in
this case is going to be utf-8 so let's
save that and what we're going to do in
fact is store this in a variable the
results of this operation so it's going
to go out and read the file and store
what it reads in a variable for us and
we'll call this readme and then down
here let's go ahead and load this to the
console so I logged up variable readme
to the console save it and let's fire up
this dude node app and now we see that
text logged to the console so the fs
module has gone out and read this file
synchronously and use this encoding to
store the file contents in this variable
and then we've logged that to the
console pretty cool right so now what I
want to show you is how we can write a
file so what I'm going to do is read
this file first of all store it in this
variable then I'm going to take the
contents of that variable and write it
to a new file over here so let's do that
let's get rid of the console blog for
now and then instead let's use another
method on this FS module and this method
is going to be called write file sync so
again this is a synchronous operation
and we'll look at the asynchronous
version in a minute so in here what we
need to do is say where we want the file
to be written to first of all now I'm
going to say I want this written to
write me txt
and then the second parameter that we
need to pass through is the data we want
to write to this file and that's just
going to be this dude right here read me
the stuff that we read from this file so
let's pass it in as the second parameter
and save that so now when I run this
application node app we're not going to
see anything in the console but we do
see this other file right me create it
now and this concept has been dumped
into it so once more we've gone out and
we've read a file synchronously and
we've stored the contents of that file
in this variable then once that's
complete we've moved on to the next line
because this is synchronous and we've
used a second method on this FS module
and the second method is write file sync
so we're going to write a file now the
name of the file we want to write is
write me text and the contents of that
file that we want to put in is in this
variable readme which we passed as a
second parameter so then it's going to
rub this file and dump the contents of
it in this file right here
pretty cool yay all right so now let's
look at the asynchronous versions of
these methods so all we need to do is
first of all get rid of that variable we
don't need that anymore
and then take away the sync part and now
this is going to be an asynchronous
request or an asynchronous method and
because it's asynchronous we need a
callback function to fire when the
process is complete and that is the
third parameter in this method so we'll
pop a function here and this function
can take two parameters first and error
if there is one if there's a problem
with this method and then second the
data that we retrieve that we read from
the file okay so let's go ahead and in
there let's delete this for now in there
let's log to the console the data that
we retrieve save that and run it again
node app and we still get that contents
so it's still doing the same thing it's
reading the file then it's firing the
function one
it's read the file and we're passing the
data that it's read to the function
which will log into the console but the
better thing about this is that we're
not blocking the code while this is
doing the reading if there is extra code
down here then this would still fire
while it's reading the data and I can
demonstrate that I'll say console dot
log and I'll just put tests in here save
this and run the app again note app and
we see test first and then yeah you read
me even though this is after this so we
start in this but because it's in
asynchronous then we're carrying on
through the code while the file is being
read then once it's fully read we fire
the callback function okay so we can do
the same thing with write file let's do
it inside here because we only want to
write the file once this is fully read
so we'll say FS write file and then we
need to say which file we want to write
to so let's go ahead and delete this for
now we'll start fresh and write it and
the file is going to be alright mate txt
like so and the data we want to write
that file is going to be this thing data
so let's paste that in there as well so
if we save that and note app then we're
going to see this file again or written
right here but this is now non-blocking
code it's asynchronous meaning that
other code down here will fire while
this happens in the background and this
is really good because if you've got
multiple requests on your website and
you're running asynchronous code then
it's going to be much quicker whereas if
you're running synchronous code and
you've got multiple requests it's going
to delay that code because we have to
wait for each request to be carried out
first so this is a much better way of
doing most things all right so that's
how we read and write files in nodejs if
you have any questions feel free to
leave those down below otherwise guys
I'll see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
