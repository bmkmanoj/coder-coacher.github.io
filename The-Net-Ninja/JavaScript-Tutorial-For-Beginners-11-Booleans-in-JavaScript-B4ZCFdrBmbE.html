you're watching JavaScript for beginners
lesson 11 and in this tutorial we're
going to take a look at boolean's
Wow
all right so what is a boolean well a
boolean is a value that either
represents true or false and we use them
in pretty much every programming
language going okay the reason we use
them is to evaluate certain
circumstances for example you may have a
website where a user is required to log
in and they log in using the wrong
password now if we evaluate that
password and it returns false then we'd
say to the user look you need to enter
your password again so we've executed
some code that does that if we evaluate
that password and it returns true then
we're going to execute some different
portion of code which is going to log
the user in okay now we're getting into
the realms of conditional statements
there we're going to cover that over the
next couple of lessons but this is
essentially why we use boolean x' in
javascript and any other programming
language all right so we use them to
check conditions of certain scenarios so
the way we decide and build into a
variable is just the same way as any of
any other value we'd say var and we'll
call it I like meat equals true okay and
then if I called I like meat it's going
to give me this true value and it's
important that you notice that this is
not a string okay if string would be
surrounded by quotations like this and
if I reassign it I like meat equals true
this is not the same as this this is a
keyword it's a boolean and this is a
string okay we're literally passing
through the string the other word true
not this okay so if I do this it's going
to return true within a string not the
keyword not the boolean all right so I
can also reassign it to false if I want
to be a vegetarian and it's going to
return false
all right so we'd use these in for
example an if statement so I could be
checking whether someone likes meat and
if they
do I give them a meat menu if they don't
I give them a vegetarian menu all right
now there's other values that kind of
evaluate to true or false and he's
called truth e or false it and we can
evaluate these expressions to give us an
answer for example I could say 7 is
greater than 5 and this right here is a
comparison operator is the greater side
greater than sir okay and we're going to
cover these more in the next couple of
lessons when we look at if statements
but essentially what I'm saying there is
evaluate whether 7 is greater than 5
which we know to be true so back to the
cancer it's going to return true however
if I say 7 is less than 5 we know that
to be false and it returns false if I
want to say is 7 equal to 7 then oh it
gives us an error and this is because
this right here my friends is the
assignment operator
okay we're saying 7 assign it the value
of 7 and it's already 7 it doesn't make
sense we don't want to do that remember
we'd say something like ba a number or
normal 7 that's what we do to assign a
value to a variable so it doesn't make
sense in this context if we want to
check whether two values are equal we
have to use the double equal sign like
that ok or in some cases treble and
we're going to get into this later but
for now we'll just say double + 7
obviously does equal 7 so that's going
to return true if I put 7 equal to 5
that's going to return false
ok and there's other things we can
evaluate - okay we can evaluate numbers
however if I just write 0 that's going
to return 0 it's not returning true or
false however we can check the true
thing or false e value of certain kind
of elements or values within JavaScript
by using the boolean keyword now that's
a built-in function of JavaScript it's
just boolean with a capital B and then
the parentheses and then we pass through
the expression into this so it could
pass through 7 greater than 5 and in
your code that's going to check whether
that's true or false and we can also
pass in things like 5 or 6 is that true
or false well that's going to return
true because it's a number and same form
- numbers it's still a number so it's
going to return true however
if I passing zero like this example here
then it's going to return false and
that's the only number that is false Oh
minus zero is also false
within JavaScript okay so what else can
we evaluate we can evaluate strings we
could say boolean hello and what's that
going to return that's going to return
back oh that's because I've misspelled
boolean my error
hello that's going to return true
because the string contains something
however if I evaluate an empty string
like this with nothing in it that will
return false so there's many different
truthy and falsy values in JavaScript
it's not just these keywords but
essentially what we're doing with all
these different expressions is we're
evaluating them to get back a true off
or a false value for example I might be
checking whether a certain input on a
farm field on a website has been some
you know some text has been entered into
that if there's been nothing entered
into that and the string is empty it's
going to return false and I'm going to
say to the user a lot going enter
something into this farm field is
required ok so that's what these kind of
things are for and we're going to use
them a lot in this playlist in fact
we're going to use them in the very next
video where we're going to start looking
at if statements so I'll see you guys
then if you have any questions about
this video then feel free to comment
down below I'll answer all of those
questions otherwise please like share

next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
