styling in the last tutorial so I'm just
gonna carry on where we left off and I
said that the forms at the minute are
looking pretty cruddy if I'm honest so
we're gonna start by standing up these
forms a little bit now every form on the
website has a class of sites - form and
we can see that right here somewhere yep
site - form so let's do an overall style
for all of these forms and this style is
gonna be pretty simple it's just gonna
say margin - top is about 60 pixels just
to bring it down a little bit the border
is gonna be 1 pixel solid and it's gonna
be that green color so we'll do 0 0 DB a
zero okay cool and also the padding is
going to be around 20 pixels all the way
around okay so that's looking a bit
better already
the next thing we want to do is style
the inputs and the text areas now
there's no text area on this so let's
just copy this paste it over here in
styles dot CSS so that we can navigate
away from this page and we can log in
and maybe go to add a new article where
there is a text area right there so let
us now style this up
so again site - form and we're gonna
target the input field and site - form
text area okay so we're targeting both
of these things at the same time they're
both going to display as block now that
will move everything so it's online and
that already it looks ten times better
we'll say also that they're all going to
have a margin of 20 pixels at the top
zero to the left to the right zero at
the bottom and zero to the left and
we'll also give each one a padding of
around 10 pixels okay there so that's
looking better already as well now what
I'd like to do is move on to this thing
up here remember we said that this had a
class of highlight I want this to look
slightly different this button or this
link right here so let us go to the
sauce
again and say a dot highlights and we'll
give this a border first of all guess
what color this board is gonna be one
pixel solid yep it's that kind of
blue-green thing so zero zero DB and
then a zero cool the padding is going to
be around 10 pixels awesome and the font
size is going to be if like the font
size is fine we'll keep it as is we're
also gonna say the border radius is
going to be about 4 pixels is that
working
not because it's about border
incorrectly that's fine just to give me
that softer edge and then finally we're
gonna give it the same color as the
border so the color is going to be hash
0 0 DB a 0 awesome so that looks a
little bit more enticing now makes you
want to click it a little bit more so
the next thing I'd like to do is move on
to the help text that is provided by the
forms so to do that I'm going to
navigate to a different page so let me
copy all that jazz so far paste it all
in the styles to update it and over here
what I'd like to do is log out first of
all then we'll go to sign up because I
want to style all of this help text
right now so let's right-click and
inspect these dudes to see the class
there it is help text so let's grab that
and in the sources paste it in give
ourselves a bit of room now this help
text I don't want to do that much to it
to be honest but I also want to style up
the UL inside it so we'll do a little
comment and say help text you well as
well and the only things I'm going to do
inside here is strip out the margin at
the top left alright is auto that should
be 0 at the top auto left and right and
at the bottom we'll say 20 pixels okay
now the color and this is gonna be
slightly darker so BBB which is kind of
like a gray color just to fade it out a
little bit the font size let's go with
that see what one in mm will say not
point 8ms no not point 9
that's fine something like
not quite 9ms will that do we'll just
finally display as block like so that's
a bit better that moves this down to the
next line okay so that is looking a
little bit better so I'm gonna grab all
this copy and paste it into the styles
because what I want to do now is some
kind of error on here so if I try and
sign up with Mario again and it doesn't
really matter what the password is I
suppose because we're gonna get an error
regardless now the user with that
username already exists so I want to
style this a little bit differently so
we can right click this and inspect to
see what the class is somewhere it's
error list right here so let's copy that
dude so dot error list and then the ally
inside it first of all we'll say padding
is ten pixels the list style type is
going to be an on to strip away that
little circle also I'm gonna say the
border is one pixel solid and then we're
going to use a color which hash is FF
five seven two two so it's kind of like
a ready pink color which is like warning
and we get this one down here as well we
can see that okay cool
the color of the text is also going to
be the same so we'll say color and set
that equal to SF five seven two - okay
cool then finally I want to get rid of
the margin to the left and right book
margin top and bottom will keep so also
margin is 10 pixels top and bottom and
then zero left and right okay that will
do for now
the error list itself is going to have a
padding of zero to strip out any space
in so we'll grab that this is the UL and
we'll say padding is gonna be zero that
scoots it along to the edge awesome this
is looking pretty good now and then
finally this submit button down here I
want to stab a little differently as
well so we'll say site - form which is
the class of all forms so this is gonna
grab
on every single form I presume the type
of this is going to be a submit and then
inside we're going to say the background
of this button is gonna be that greeny
call it again
so that's hash zero zero DB a zero we
also want to give this a border of zero
neat color is going to be FFF white and
then the font size is gonna be like 1.2
m just a little bit bigger and then
we'll give this a border - a radius of 4
pixels and then a margin as well of 10
pixels top and bottom zero left and
right so that button is slightly nicer
as well so there we go that should
pretty much do it let's grab all of this
and paste it over here save that and
let's view this in a browser now okay
this is all looking a bit better so
let's log in I'm gonna log in as Yoshi
just for the hell of it and say test one
two three four so login and okay so
that's not right let's just do my own
username Shaun and then test one two
three four
login hopefully this works there we go
so now everything is looking a lot
better than it was before okay so
there's one more lesson I'd like to do
and that is a lesson on the front end
using some JavaScript so that when you
type in a title over here so for example
hello world ideally in a lot of content
management systems it kind of
pre-populates the slug field so this
would be hello - world and it's going to
pre populate that for you based on what
you type in here so I'm going to show
you how we can do something like that in
the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
