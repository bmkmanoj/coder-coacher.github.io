PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 7
and in this video I want to go through
what a basic CSS reset entails
Wow or I think yang so as you can see
him here in the finished HTML and what I
want to do first of all before we start
messing with any CSS reset is that link
up a CSS file to this document now we
don't have one created at the minute but
what I'm gonna do is right clicking this
pane over here I'm gonna create a new
file and I'm going to call it style dot
CSS that's going to be empty as default
now if we jump back over to the index we
need to link to that CSS file in the
head so the way we do that is by using
our link tag and the href is gonna be
style.css just right here and then we
need the rel attribute and then the type
equals text slash CSS all right so
that's linked up right now so if we just
click Save what I'm gonna do is press
this little lightning bolt icon right
here I've got our browser open here and
what this is gonna do is open up a live
preview for me so I'll click that and
now when this loads up as I make changes
in this code or in the style code this
is going to update automatically so I
can see it on the fly which is pretty
cool so as you can see at the minute all
we've got is these basic default browser
Styles bit of padding or margin on the
header tags underlined links that kind
of thing now what I want to do is use a
simple CSS reset to get rid of these
default styles I almost like to do that
even though this is just a one page
simple design I'm still going to use it
because I want to show you guys what I
do for most of my projects so to do that
I'm gonna head over to html5 dr alright
guys so here I am
html5 dr. com forward slash html5 reset
style sheet I'll pop the link to this
page in the description down below and
basically it's a page which just has the
code to a simple CSS
Selman now mainly what I like is this
bit right here which takes away the
padding and margin of all these elements
right here that we get by default in
browsers so that's really cool along
with a couple of other things that are
also pretty good like the two lists down
on for all unordered lists and a couple
of other things I'm not gonna go through
this in any depth because it'd take me a
1 hour to do that you can have a look at
this if you like in your own time but
essentially it just kind of resets those
default browser Styles back to a more
simple baseline so then we can customize
it a lot easier ourselves so what I'm
gonna do is just highlight all of this
and I'm gonna copy it then I'm going to
go back to the code and I'm going to
paste this into our style CSS
all right then guys here we are styles
or CSS and I'm just gonna paste this
code into here on the left now watch
what happens on the right in a minute
when I do this so I'll paste there now
you can see on the right straightaway
everything's kind of jumped up a little
bit that's because all of this padding
and margin has been taken away okay so
it's kind of squashed up and it's
tricked all of those default browser
styles so it's gonna be loads easier now
for us when we go in and start styling
this thing up all right we're not going
to have to conflict with those default
browser styles so that's all I wanted to
show you in this lesson now we're in a
good place to start cracking on with the
CSS I'm making this website look good
which is what we're going to do in the
next tutorial so have you have any
questions about this feel free to
comment down below otherwise guys don't

I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
