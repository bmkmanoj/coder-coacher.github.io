angularjs tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a quick look at pretty
URLs Wow Doge so in this tutorial series
so far we've been using URLs something
like this with that hashtag that's the
kind of way that angular works alright
and this is a major problem to me
because I've got a serious case of
hosting D and I want my links to look
quite clean something like that
now fortunately angular lets us do this
and by the way I'm just gonna
demonstrate that this wouldn't work you
can see can't get home okay so what I'm
gonna do is demonstrate how we can do
this in angularjs okay and the way we're
going to do it is by using the location
provider service that angular provides
us with and they're setting html5 mode
to be true so I'll talk about this a
little bit more in the minute but for
now what I want to do is just change
these I'll change that once at home you
see without the hash and I want to
demonstrate what happens when we go when
we click on this so does it work okay so
I want this to work like that so the way
we do it is by going into the config
method right here and we need to pass
the location provider service through
into this config method so we can use it
in this function to set html5 mode to be
true so let's pass that through as a
dependency first of all just dollar sign
location provider like that and then we
also need to pass it through into the
function itself so that we can use it so
let's put that in there as well and then
once we've done that you just want to
come to the above the route provider
right here and I'm just gonna say
location provider dot html5 mode true
like that okay
and essentially html5 mode is just based
on the html5 history API which basically
allows us to set a URL on the same
domain with JavaScript okay so that's
what we've done right there we've set
html5 mode to be true so that now we can
use these links like
that okay but there's one more thing we
need to do before this works and that is
to go into the index.html and then come
under the head and say base href equals
forward slash and we're just saying this
is the base URL of our application okay
so we need to do this thing first of all
passing the location provider there in
there set html5 known to be true so that
we can use those kind of URLs then go
into our index and do the base tag set
href to be a forward slash like that or
whatever the base of your application is
so now this works and if we change these
to just forward slashes instead of those
hashes and in fact I'm gonna copy this
because I'm going to add one in for the
contact view so let's tighten as well
remember we sell this routes in a
previous tutorial contact like that now
if I go to the root there that's fine
and I click on listening just works
contact works whole works and you can
see now the hash is not in the URL so
that's nice and pretty but it doesn't
end there I'm afraid this is fine if
you're in the application and you're
clicking on links but what if you decide
to just go to a specific URL from the
offset for example you know that the
directory on this web application is
forward slash directory so you just go
there to begin with no not gonna work
and that's because we're actually
requesting this resource okay it's not
being taken care of by angular so it's
saying well actually I can't find this
resource this direct resource it doesn't
exist and that's because we've set these
routes up in angular and angular is not
handling this when you're going there
directly so what we need to do is add in
some rewrite rules into our htaccess
file put that on the root of the server
so that we say look okay if so I'll
write something in like this if there is
a resource name that you go ahead and
grab it
if that's not a resource what I want you
to do is redirect to the index dot HTML
file where the base of that application
is here and then let angular handle this
route okay so that's what we're going to
do now
so I'm not gonna do it here in autumn
using this host right here what I'm
going to do is use one so you can see
right here I've got one server running
and if I go into my www.h array what
I've done is just got all of these files
here and I've dumped them in there in
the root of that directory okay so now
if I go to the localhost
oops from well if I go to localhost
there then you're going to see this
application exactly as it is here but
still if I do something like this
directorate it's not going to find it
because we've not set up that htaccess
file yet so that's what we're going to
do now
now I've already written something like
that right here okay in notepad so I've
said a rewrite engine on then these
things here what it's doing is saying
okay if you go to a URL or pay a new
dress bar and that resource exists on
the server then go and grab it that's
fine if it doesn't exist then what I
want you to do is redirect here to the
index.html file and then angularjs is
going to take care of this route okay so
I'm gonna save this now if I got to save
us I'm gonna save it right here as dot
HT access and I'm going to make sure
that I click this and go to all files
okay so if I save that now get rid of
that this time if I request this URL
it's going to bring it up for me okay
same goes for anything else that's on
our application okay so there we go guys
that is how we get pretty URLs and that
brings me also to the end of this
tutorial series and I hope you've
learned a fair work about angular along
the way there are going to be other
angularjs tutorials coming up in
particular what I want to do is make a
real kind of world application using
firebase now firebase says it offers our
applications our back-end as a service
which means that basically we can use it
to store our data in a real time no SQL
database and sync
without project using their API now they
also provide a library called
angularfire which is designed
specifically if you're using firebase
with angularjs and it makes it really
easy to hook the two together so in this
project what we did was just grab our
data from a Jason final right here in
our project folder but in the next
series what I'm going to be doing is
storing retrieving and updating our data
in a firebase no SQL database okay so we
can make changes change them and it's
going to update on the fly in this
database so that's what we're going to
be doing in the future I'll do a whole
tutorial series on that where we make an
application like it's a do list or
something like that
okay oh by the way and no SQL database
is just a database which stores Jason
making it really easy to use with
JavaScript applications like this okay
so there we go guys I hope you've
enjoyed this tutorial series if you have
any comments whatsoever feel free to
leave those down below otherwise I will
see you in this tutorial and many others
to come I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
