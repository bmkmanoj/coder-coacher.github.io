final WebSocket tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about
broadcasting messages okay so here is
this picture again which you're probably
getting sick of by now but I'm going to
use it to demonstrate how we can
broadcast messages and how that is
completely different to what we've been
doing so far when we've been sending
messages out from the server so in the
last tutorial we emitted a message from
the client when we click the send button
that message is sent some data to the
server which in turn listened out for it
then emitted a message back to every
single clients including the original
client which sent that message in the
first place so that's what we did last
time in this tutorial we needed
broadcasting and the difference is if we
were to emit a message from the client
to the server the server listens to it
if the server their broadcast a message
then what it does is send the message
down every WebSocket to every client
except the original one the one that
sent it the message in the first place
so that's the difference between what
we've been doing and broadcasting
messages so if you remember back to the
first tutorial when I showed you this
chat in its full glory then if I added
some kind of handle a let's say Luigi
and if I started typing a message on the
other chat windows what we'd see is
Luigi is typing a message Luigi is
typing a message but it wouldn't show on
this one originally because we're
broadcasting that message and it makes
sense because if I'm typing a message in
this window I don't need to see Luigi's
typing a message only on every other
single client does it need to show
so that's broadcasting a message and
that's what we're going to do in this
tutorial so the first thing I want to do
is head to the index dot HTML file and I
want to add an area where this message
is going to get output onto the screen
so I'm going to give underneath output
and this is going to have an ID equal to
feedback instead okay so in this feed
but Dave is where that little message
Luigi is typing a message is going to go
so the next thing we want to do is grab
a hold of this thing
okay in the chat yes so we can use it
later when we're out putting that
message so what I'm going to do is just
come down here I'm going to delete that
semicolon add a comma then I'm going to
say feedback is equal to document dot
get element by ID so this fourth option
off it and then we want the ID feedback
which is that D of which of just created
okay so now we've got ahold of that we
can output it later the next thing I
want to do is attach an event listener
to this thing right here this input
field which is the message because the
event that I want to listen for is when
we're typing which is a key press event
so we're going to listen for that key
press event and when that event occurs
then we're going to emit a message to
the server which in turn can broadcast
that message to the rest of the clients
but not this one makes sense so we're
going to listen for that key press event
on this input field right here now that
input field we already have a handle to
it and if this message variable right
here so what we can do is underneath
this event listener add another one this
time it's on the message field then we
add event listener and the listener what
we're listening for is a key press event
okay then when that happens we can fire
a callback function and inside this
function we want to emit an event or a
message to the server make sense
so let us against a socket in mix just
like we did up here before and the
message we want to send this time is a
typing message so it's into the server
someone's tagging okay so we also want
to send some data and the data we want
to send this time is the name of the
person typing or the handle because
we're going to display that on the other
chat windows luigi is type the message
key type of the message etc so we can
send the name by grabbing on to this
handle right here and then sending the
value of that input field okay so now
we're sending this data up to the server
so now we want to react to it in the
server and we want to broadcast that
message to the rest of the clients so
let's go to the index file which is
running on the server and inside this
an action function right here what we're
going to do is create another lift up so
we're going to say socket dots on right
so we're listening for a particular
message and this time is the typing
message which we just created in the
front end and we're going to use a
callback function which takes the data
which in this case is the user name or
the handle right okay so now what we
want to do is not IO dot sake stream it
but what we want to do is broadcast this
message to every other single socket or
clients right so how do we do that
well we can say sockets so that refers
to the individual socket the one that
sent us the message right so we're
saying socket dot broadcast right we're
broadcasting a message and then emit so
now we're emitting it all right so this
is going to emit it to every other
single client but not this original one
makes sense so what we're going to with
it we're going to emit the typing
message and we're also going to send the
data back right which is the user name
or a handle so now we've emitted it or
broadcasted it from the server on the
front end in every other single client
we want to handle that we want to listen
out for that message and handle it so
let's go into here where we say listen
for events and we'll add it in so we'll
say socket which is this one instance of
the web socket in that particular client
dot on and we're listening for the
typing message okay and when we get that
we're going to fire a callback function
which is going to take the data the user
handle bodies and then inside here we
can do something we could output this
user handle to the browser so remember
before we created this thing right here
this variable feedback which gave us a
handle or hold of this div right here
okay so we can say now down here
feedback dots in a HTML and what we're
going to do is set that equal to a
message right so this could be a string
and this is really a pit out then eeehm
that's going to slant it for us oh by
the way don't do this in capitals all
right so in and then what we want to do
is output the data which is the user
name all the handles also plus data
then tack on at the rest of the string
which is going to be is typing a message
dot alright then we'll close off the ear
and we'll also close off the P tag so
now what we're doing is outputting this
HTML and we concatenate in this data
which is the username all handle to that
strings I hate mustering then we're
setting it to the inner HTML of the
feedback beer right so that's going to
happen when we type in some data so let
us now just quickly go to this thing
over here in fact let's just minimize
this completely and if i refresh in each
one type in a name Luigi
then type in a message now we can see in
these other two we get that Luigi is
typing your message
woohoo we have successfully broadcasted
a message okay now there's one more
thing to want to do because if I
complete this message and sick send then
this thing right here still says Luigi
is typing a message and really we want
to sort that out okay so how do we sort
that out well let's just look at this
code now when we click send that's when
we want that message to go Luigi type in
a message because now we've typed the
message and we've sent it so what we can
do is when we're listening for this
chats event that occurs after we've
clicked send what we can do is then set
the inner HTML of the feedback to equal
an empty string or guys makes sense so
that now is going to equal an empty
string like so all right so if I save
this now and if we view it in these
browsers I'm just going to refresh over
here and if we say Luigi is here and if
we can spell it
okay Luigi and then Muriel and then
peach and in here I'll say hey Mario and
then click send and we can see this
Luigi is typing a message then Mario
says hey Luigi and by the way you can
see Mario is typing a message in both of
these and dot dot however you've seen
peach and then peach is the reply and
say bars
I'm right here okay cool so now we see
peachy type in the message click send
and voila so there we go guys we now
have our fully functioning chat
application using a WebSockets so like I
said you can do many more things with
WebSockets
not just create chat rooms so I implore
you to dive deeper so there we go
WebSockets 101 I hope this has been of
some use to you if you do enjoy the
videos please like share and subscribe
and I'm going to see you in the very
next series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
