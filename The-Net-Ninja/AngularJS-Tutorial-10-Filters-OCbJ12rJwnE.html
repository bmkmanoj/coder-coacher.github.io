tenth angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to take a look at
filters okay then guys so in the last
tutorial we went ahead and made this
controller right here and we call that
ninja controller so now this is
controlling with a ninja controller
section on this template right which is
here because we said diff and we apply
this ng-controller directive to it and
we said we want the ninja controller to
control this area then what we did is we
applied this variable this property to
the scope and we gave it this data right
here an array of ninja names so now what
we're doing is we're going through those
ninja names using ng-repeat and without
putting the ninja each time okay so now
I want to talk about filters and filters
essentially just change the display of
how we output data to the user so that
could be the order of the data or we
could prefix the data or do it you know
I'll put it in a particular format like
currency so we're going to go through
those now and to do that I want to make
something slightly more complex data so
I'm gonna delete those things right
there and I still want an array but this
time I want an array of objects and each
object is still going to represent a
ninja so within each object there's
gonna be a name and the first one was
Yoshi right and then there's also going
to be a belt and the belt for Yoshi is
going to be green okay so next one we
called crystal I think so we'll say
crystal and then the belt color is going
to be yellow for her and then after that
we want Ryu and then the belt colorful
Ryu is going to be orange and then
finally we'll have Shawn so name sure
and then the belt color is going to be
alright
tall so now we've got our array of
objects that just click Save and you'll
notice that each one of these objects is
now being output over here and that's
fine because that's what we're doing
each one of these objects still
represent
one ninja and ninja here okay so without
putting the ninja each time we're
cycling through this array and we're
going through each item and what output
in each item okay because each one is a
ninja
so we're outputting the whole object
there each time but we just want the
name so all we need to do is dot
notation ninja dot name because that's
the name of the property that we want
right here name and it's just output in
an angel all right there so let's add in
ink filter so I want to order this
alphabetically so to do that I'm just
gonna add in a filter right here we do a
pipe first to add in a filter and then
we'll say order by that is the filter
name column and then we want to use
single quotation so that we don't escape
out of these ones here and then we're
going to pass through what we want to
order them by now I want to order them
by the name property so what I need to
say is name if I want to order them by
the belt I've got a pass through belt
but this time I want to order it by name
so I'm actually saved now just watch the
order of these over here now it goes
alphabetically okay likewise if I want
to reverse this I can just put a minus
right there click Save and now it's
going to minus the order well reverse
the order of them pretty cool right so
we can add in more than just one filter
if we want and I'm going to do that so
to do additional filters we just need to
put the pipe your front of every filter
okay so the next one oh one is called
filter and I'm going to set this equal
to a search query and I'll explain this
in a second but for now I just want to
go up here and add an oops I forgot I
want to add an input field right your
course text and there was an NG model
directed to this it's an equal search
like that so now we've got an input
field over here and whenever I type
anything in here because we did ngmodel
search it's gonna get where I write and
it's gonna store it in this variable
right here okay then we're going to
reference this search variable here so
say for example I write y ou s in there
then this right here is going to store
the string of y ou s
then we're saying down here filter by
search which is why OS so it's going to
return any name which has a y OS in it
pretty neat right so let's just give
this a whirl I'll say Y and then it
returns all these three because they all
have Y in it oh just Yoshi okay and I
can write Yoshi and he remains there now
if I write s returns everything with an
S in it
SH returns everything with an SH in it
and then if I put an A and it's just
Shawn that remains so that is really
awesome guys we've made a cool little
search functionality here just by
writing a couple lines of code all right
now I'm going to show you one more
filter and that is the currency filter
so to do that I'm gonna head back over
to this controller and I'm gonna add in
another property on each one of these
objects this is gonna be the rate and
this is going to be the hourly rate to
hire this ninja right so the first one
Yoshi is gonna be 50 pounds and we'll
just use a number then the second one is
going to be 30 pounds crystal Ryu
let's do rate is gonna be 10 pounds it's
a really budget one and we need to put
our commas in here some of it works and
then Shawn the last one is going to be
1000 pounds and we need the property
name which is raped okay so if we save
that now and then head back over here we
want to put the rate next to the name so
all I'll do I'll just format this a
little bit so we can see all bring this
down here and I'll say ninja name then a
little - then we're going to use another
expression to output the rates so I'll
say ninja dots rent okay and that's
gonna output the rate so if I save now
we're just gonna get that number right
but I want this to display as a currency
so I'm going to use the currency filter
so I'm gonna put the pipe and then I'm
gonna say currency and notice one thing
here guys
I'm putting these filters up here in the
ng-repeat and I'm putting this filter
right down here and that's because these
filters are concerned with how the Li
tags are displayed the order of them or
which ones show whereas this one right
here is just concerned with how
is displayed you know because we wanted
to display as a currency not just a
number so that's why we add this on the
expression and that's why we add these
ones on to the entry repeat so let me
save this now and you'll notice that
this turns two dollars okay now if you
want something else like pounds all you
need to do is a colon then we do our
single quotations and put in a pound
sign like that press save and now we get
pound swallow alright so that is the
currency filter we've also looked at
this search filter and we've looked at
this order by filter there's also some
more you can check those out on the
angularjs documentation so you can see
right here this filter section we've got
currency date filter jason and limit to
number odd about etc so this will mimic
to just limits the amount of results
that come back so we can put this on the
ng-repeat so can we just want to show
the the first three we could limit to
the first three this one right here it
turns everything in lowercase if you
want to take away the capital letters
etc so you can go here and you can read
about each one right there okay we are
going to be using filters later on in
the playlist also so if you're not quite
understanding this just yet don't worry
because you'll learn by repetition as
well if you have any questions though
for your free to drop those down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the very
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
