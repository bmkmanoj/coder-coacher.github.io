tutorial I mean this video I'm going to
talk about sets and assaulting all right
there so in this tutorial I want to talk
about two different things
sets which are a new data type but
really simple to understand and also
sorting how do we sort out a collection
of data for example a list in two
numeric order or alphabetical and we'll
take a look at that first so I'm already
running the practing interactive shell
over here I'm going to create a new list
first of all I'm going to call this
launched and set it equal to a random
collection of numbers and these don't
need to be in order and it doesn't
matter if there's duplicates either
we're just creating this list so we can
order it using the salted method and
that's how we do it impacted use a
method called sorting and what this does
will sort this list numerically so the
lowest comes first and the highest comes
last
so in this sorted method we pass in an
argument which is the list we want to
solve so now if we press ENTER we get
assaulted list but everything's in order
cool we can do the same thing with lists
of strings so I'm going to create a new
list and this is to be equal to names
and then inside here we're going to do a
series of different names so show
arrived aybe and we'll do some in
capitals we'll call on that form show
there's a name out there called Apple
and Brian and then to finish it off or
just a duplicate of Shawn three okay so
now we have this names list as well and
if we want to solve this we can just say
sorted and then passing it names as the
argument and this time is sorted this
list so notice one thing
Orion is coming before Abe and so it's
Apple even though alphabetically they're
meant to come after it becomes after a
right however in pison capital letters
always come first so it's going to run
through capital letters alphabetically
then after that it's going to run
through non capital letters
alphabetically that's the weight item
salting works
okay now that sort is pretty much
covered and what I talked about sets
which are a new data type and sets are
pretty simple to understand and they're
just a collection of data a bit like
lists but they do not allow
duplicates so let's say for example we
wanted to eliminate the duplicates out
of this list we can do that using a set
so I'm going to type cast this lung sink
into a set matching set and then cutting
numbers into it and this time we get the
same numbers back book it's taken out
all of the duplicates all right and
another thing to bear in mind is that
sets do not preserve order so in this
case they've kind of ordered it in the
right way but when we work with strings
that's not always the case
so I'm going to do the same thing I'm
going to turn this names list into a set
as well so I say set and then it names
and we'll see this time it's removed
that you plug it Shawn you can see Shawn
was there twice now it's there once but
it's also kind of messed up the order
and it's not in alphabetical order it
just not preserved the right order so
just be aware of that when you are using
sets if you need to preserve order all
right then let's go through a another
simple example using sets so I'm going
to create a dictionary and I'll call
this ninjas I'm going to set this equal
to different ninjas with different belt
colors so first of all we'll say Rho is
the be a black belt not black spinnel
back one a black box all right and then
Yoshi is going to be a red belt and then
crystal you look inside crystal is going
to be a black belt as well okay so now
we have this dictionary now we know we
can get the values from this dictionary
things like the black the red and the
black using ninjas dots values we learnt
that in the last lesson and get these
values back but now say we want to make
a set of this we want to remove the
duplicates we can do that using sets and
then ninjas dots of values like so and
now we just get red and black instead of
the duplicates of black so we're going
to use something like this over here in
a minute first of all I'm going to just
exit out of this console and then clear
the screen so we've got a bit of room
okay so now we know how to use sets
let's put it to some kind of use over
here in the code so this is from the
last tutorial when we learn about
dictionaries and what we did is we
cycled through this wire loop ask
user to input a ninja name and ninja
bell and then we assign that data to
this dictionary recreate it okay when
they finished entering in all the data
we call this function into intro which
would output the ninjas and their Dunkel
so we're going to keep listening right
here where the users enter information
into this dictionary but what we're
going to do instead is create a
different function so I'm going to come
it out this stuff up here and then above
it and we're creating a new function and
this function is going to count how many
instances that are of a particular bell
color into the dictionary okay so let's
define this function and I'm going to
call this felt on the score count
instead of taking a dictionary and then
inside this function what we're going to
do is loop through the different bells
and count them right so first of all
what I'm going to do is grab all the
values from this picture because they're
what we're interested in
so I say belts equal to a list we'll do
some typecasting here and then save
dictionary got values okay so we'll grab
it all of those values from this
dictionary things like red blue green
whatever colors the user enters in then
we're creating a list out of those
values and we're going to cycle through
them using a for loop so say for then it
dealt in love that belts in belts and
inside here what we're going to do is
say no equals belt that's the belt list
dot count remember we can count how many
instances that are of a particular
element within a list using this count
method and inside here we need to say
what do we want to look for in this list
what do we want to count well we want to
count the particular belt that were on
at the minute so this can be red black
green whatever we're going to count how
many instances that are of that belt
okay so that's going to be stored in nan
then what we're going to do is print
this to the console over there so we're
going to do a formatted string so first
of all then inside the string we're
going to say there are and then known as
the number of belts are going to be of a
particular color and there's the actual
color of the belt which is this belt
variable right here and then after that
we'll say delts so for example there are
five black belts okay so let's save this
now and down here and what I'm going to
do is call this function belt count
instead of the old one so let's get rid
of that and do belt count instead need
to pass it at the dictionary which is
ninja underscore belts and I'm going to
save it now I'm going to run this in the
console over here I'll say Python
dictionaries dot P one okay
enter a ninja name Sean black belt yep
Yoshi red belt and yep crystal awesome
red belt yep
finally Mario will say blue belt and
that will do okay so now we get back
there are one black belts there are two
red belts there are two red belts there
are one blue Gus now this is okay but we
don't really need to output this twice
and why is it happening well when we
cycled through belts this belts list
contains red in it twice so we're going
to come down here and we're going to
count how many red belts around twice we
don't really need to do this so how can
we avoid this well what we could do is
turn this list right here this belts
list into a set so that we're only
cycling through the set right here okay
instead of cycling through the list
where this duplicates will cycle through
the set so I'm going to tack cast this
into a set and see if this works so save
that and run the same dictionaries file
enter a name Shawn look
yep crystal it's going to read I'll say
yep and Yoshi you're going to be read
well so yeah I'm fine like we'll say
Mario again and blue this time no okay
so this time we get there one black
belts two red belts and there's one blue
belts so now it's not duplicating the
red belt thing because we turned this
right here into a set when we loop
through it so that's one advantage of
sets we can loop through collections of
data without how to repeat where the
duplicates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
