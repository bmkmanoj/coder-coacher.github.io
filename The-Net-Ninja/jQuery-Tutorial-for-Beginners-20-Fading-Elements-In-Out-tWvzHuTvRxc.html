jQuery for beginners lesson 20 and in
this tutorial we're gonna take a look at
fading elements Wow
alright in class so in the last tutorial
I showed you this animate function right
here and we could do some groovy stuff
with it I said that we can pretty much
animate any CSS property we want which
takes a numerical value like this and
number right so if we wanted to we could
get funky and say we want it animate the
opacity alright because this accepts a
numerical value from zero which is
completely transparent to one which is
completely opaque I think I've got the
right way around
okay so zero would be completely fade
this out so if I do not point five
that's gonna take you halfway right and
by the way I've still got this click
event attached to this h2 right here so
when we click this it's gonna fire this
function which is taken this wrapped it
up in the jQuery wrapper so we can use
this animate function and it's going to
animate this h2 to the opacity of 0.5 so
let's save that and give this in
cleanings well I'm going to click this
and sure enough it animates down to semi
transparent States now then Jake where
it gives us some built in methods we can
use instead of doing this which are a
little easier on the eye and a bit
quicker to write they're fade in fade
out and fade too so I'm going to show
you these three methods in this tutorial
I'm gonna start with the fade-out method
so all we need to do is do its anime and
replace it with fade-out and that is it
guys tada that is the fade-out method
dead simple so now if I click on this
over here what's going to happen is the
element it's going to completely fade
out to zero opacity so if I click that
ok completely disappeared and you will
have noticed as well that this content
scooted up after it completely faded out
that's because once it's completely
faded out it's removed from the document
and it occupants no space so it occupies
no space in the document all right I'll
just show you that once more so you can
see and refresh click it completely
fades out then this zooms up all right
so that's the fade-out method now if I
wanted to I could chain to
this win a fade-in method and we've seen
chaining in a previous tutorial remember
we can attach these methods one after
the other if you've missed that tutorial
I'll leave a link to that down below so
you can go and check that out so what
we're saying is first fade out don't
when that's completed fade back in
alright these are the two methods fade
out will fade in so let's save that and
give that a whirl click over here fades
out then fades in pretty cool right now
as well as this we can pass through some
parameters in here we can pass through
the speed so I could say mm and that's
gonna be 2000 milliseconds or 2 seconds
if you like that's gonna be the fade-out
speed or the fade-out time rather and
the fade in time I'm gonna set to you
500 so half a second so it's gonna fade
out slowly then fade in quite quickly
once it's finished fading out so let's
give this a whirl click right there
fades out slowly then boot back in cool
all right so as well as these fade out
and fading functions we've also got the
fade to function so let's delete those
two right there and replace it with fade
2 now this takes two parameters it takes
the first one which is the time taken
I'll just put 1000 so 1 second and then
you specify the opacity you want to fade
it to right so between 0 and 1 and zero
is completely transparent so if I fade
to nor point 2 I'll save this I'll click
over here you can see what happens
it nearly completely fades out but not
quite it's still got that 0.2 opacity
left likewise I could change and another
one to that I'll say fade to again 1000
milliseconds and this time I fade it to
not 0.8 and I'll click over here again
first it's gonna fade to this opacity
then when it's finished it's gonna fade
to this opacity so let's try that fades
out and fades it cool and this leads me
to a cool little effect we can do what
I'm gonna do is just change this to
about 200 milliseconds change this again
200 milliseconds I'm going to lay this
out a little bit differently because
we're changing some things together I'm
gonna copy and paste all of this right
here and I'm gonna come down put a lot
of these and paste them again and again
and scoot this thing up okay cool
now what it's doing is fading out then
in and out than in etc and it's gonna
create this kind of like flashing effect
which looks quite cool almost like a
warning effect right so if I click this
now watch we're gonna win a wheel
I need these like a Sahin it's like a
warning effect right that's pretty cool
so you can use things like this on your
web pages so if you have any questions
about this whatsoever feel free to drop
