final view X tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how we can let our
getters and allow actions to outcome
columns alright and so before I finish
up with this series I want to show you
one more little nifty trick and that is
how we can map our actions and map our
guesses to our different components so
right now in product list 1 this
component we just have this one thing
right here this one getter and we have
this one action call right but imagine
if we had on the store over here we
defined various getters maybe 6 or 7 and
various different actions and mutations
and we wanted to call a lot of them from
here as well now what we could do is we
could go down and we could add each
computed property to return the
particular getter we want and the same
for dispatching the different actions
that we want or what we could do is we
could just map the getters to our
computed properties and map the actions
to our methods which is the easier way
if we've got several different guesses
and several different actions and now
we've only got one get and one action
here but I just want to demonstrate how
we do this if we had more so the first
thing we need to do is import the map
getters and the map actions from view X
so we can say import and then we're
going to import map captions and then
for importing that from view X and again
we need to say import this time is going
to be maps getters from view X as well
ok cool
so now we've imported those we can use
them and the way we do map our actions
on map all of our getters to the
computed properties and methods here is
pretty simple all we need to do is get
rid of that and we can say dot map get
is like so and inside here we can say
which getters we want to map inside an
array so this right here is a spread
operator which basically is going to get
the getters and it's going to spread
them into different computed properties
if you like
okay and this is in the es6 function and
we're going to have to do something in a
minute to make this work
but for now let's just say which getters
we want to map to our computed
properties and there's only one that
we've created and that is sale products
okay so it's going to grab then this
sell product getter right here and it's
going to map it to our computed
properties so that appears here and if
we have several you can just list them
like so your next one and you know next
one down below that okay so this is a
lot easier than just creating all of the
different computed properties to return
the getters that we want
like so we only have one at the minute
so we'll just put that in there okay so
we've mapped those now and we can do the
same thing with the action so instead of
this and said the methods we can say dot
the spread operator map actions and
inside we can also pass through the
array of the different actions that we
want to map to these methods in this
component and again we just have one at
the minute which is reduced price and we
can see that in the store it's this
action down here which is priced so
we're just mapping this one as a minute
to this component however if we had more
again we could just comment separate
them and add them on okay
so it's a really nice way to add our
different guesses and actions through a
component but I did say a minute ago
we're going to need to do something else
so that this works so if we try this as
a minute in a browser then we're
probably going to get an error in the
console you can see this thing right
here it doesn't recognize it that's
because this is es6 functionality and
out-of-the-box it's not supported in
browsers so fortunately we are using
Babel and Babel is a tool which
transpires es6 code into JavaScript that
browsers understand so in order for this
to work all we need to do is install a
babel preset so that people can use that
to transpile this functionality into
javascript that the browser understands
so that we can use this makes sense so
what we want to do is open up our
console and we want to do an install so
say npm install and we're going to
install the Babel
- preset and it's going to be preset
stage - - and we're going to save this
so say double - save - our dev
dependencies hit enter that's going to
install it for you alright so once
actually installed we need to do one
more thing and let's go to this dot
babel RC file and inside here we need to
add a comment after this and we need to
add in the stage - preset that we're
just going to add alt so we'll add the
square bracket notation then it's stage
- - so if we save this now and if we go
to a browser I'm going to refresh then
hopefully this should work no it doesn't
ok so what I actually need to do is come
to the console over here where we're
running the program I'm going to cancel
out of this and then I'm going to run
NPM runs gether again just to rerun this
and retransplant the code and now once
that's rerun we can come over here and
refresh and this should work now cool
now we get no errors so now this has
worked and if we click on this is still
going to reduce the price cool so that
is how we can map getters and how we can
map actions to our components much
easier than creating separate computed
properties and methods for each
different get and action we want to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
