tutorial and in this video we're going
to put some of the things we've learned
together to create a bar tab project all
right there so in this tutorial what I
want to do is bring together some of the
different things we've learnt so far in
this series and create some kind of mini
project and this mini project is going
to be some kind of program that is going
to calculate a bathtub so if you're
working behind the bar you can use this
program if you want to keep tabs on a
particular party of four that's sat down
on table one all right so what we going
to do first of all and you'll notice by
the way I've navigated to the projects
directory over here in the console what
we're going to do is create a new file
in this project director and I'm going
to call this bar underscore tab dottywot
now the way this is going to work is
we're going to store all the
functionality of this time in a class
and then when we have a new party of
four or a party of five coming to the
bar and they're going to start a new tab
we create a new instance of this tab
object all right so first thing that
class tab that is the name of the class
and then the first thing I'm going to do
is create an attribute on the class
level and this is going to be the menu
so this is fixed for every tub the menu
is going to remain the same and guess
what you could do is split off this menu
into a separate module if you want if
it's extensive but I'm going to do a
very simple menu so I'm just going to
keep it as a class level attribute
inside this class so I'll say menu and
it's going to be equal to a dictionary
remember dictionaries look like this
with the curly braces okay so we need
some different properties inside this
dictionary now the keys are going to be
the name of the items on the menu so for
example wine and this is going to equal
to some kind of new metric value which
could be dollars or pounds so that's
fine okay now we need beer and this is
going to be like 3 will also do soft
drink and this is going to be 2 will do
chicken so some kind of food and this
can be 10 what I was doing you need beef
baby and the beef can be a bit more
expensive 15 we'll do the veggie option
and then that can be about 12 and
it can't be put without some kind of
dessert but in this pub all the desserts
are going to be the same price of six ok
cool so now that's a very simple menu so
it out now what we need to do is hook up
some kind of functionality but before we
do that what I'm going to do is create
that enriched function this kind of
constructor function first of all so
that when we create a new instance of
this tab it's going to set up some basic
properties for us so look at these divs
I'm going to say yes and then underscore
underscore init underscore underscore so
this is the initialization function
which takes this self attribute remember
sorry the self parameter and then inside
here we can say self dot total first of
all so this is going to be the running
total of the bill and that's going to
start at zero and then also self dot
items and that's going to be the kind of
a list of items as we add them to the
bill so if they have a Y we can add wine
here beef we can add beef etc so to
begin with this is just an empty list ok
ok so that's the initialization function
salted now what I want to do is add a
function which is going to add an item
to this list right here and also maybe
increase the total so when a user or
someone orders a drink then we can add
an item make sense so to do that I'm
going to create an instance method and
this is going to be called of self desc
ad and it's going to take in itself as a
parameter and also the item which you
want to add so inside here what we're
going to do is say self dot items which
is this property right here and then we
want to add something to this list now
how do we do that well we just say dot
append so this is a method we can use to
add something to a list and then we're
going to append whatever the item is
that we pass in remember we're cutting
an item right here so I can add that
item to the list now ok so what we also
want to do is update the total the
running total this thing right here we
want to add how much that item is so
we'll say self dot total so that refers
to this property right here and then
we'll say plus equal
so I'm going to add to it self menu so
we're referring to this dictionary right
here and then we want to touch in a key
which is giving the item the menu item
they've had so it's beer let's fill a
lot from this key and it's going to
return the value then so if this was
beer then it will return right here
three and it's going to add three to the
total make sense so we're adding that
item to the list and we're also updating
the total right here with the cost of
what they've had okay so that's keeping
track of everything they've had now what
I want to do at the end of the night you
want to print the bill somehow and we
want to work out what they owe so what
I'm going to do is define a new function
down here which is going to be called
also def print underscore build and this
is going to take in self again so it's
an instance function I'm also going to
take in a tax parameter so we can
specify what the tax is and also some
kind of service charges well you know I
get a tip ten percent or something like
that so let me just give myself a little
bit of room aid so the first thing I
want to do inside this function is work
out the tax right so the tax is going to
be equal to attack that we pass in first
of all right so say we put in 10 for 10
percent then we need to convert that
so we'll say tax over 100 and then times
self total okay so say for example we
cut in 10 for 10 percent we're going to
divide that by 100 which will be naught
point 1 then we times in 0.1 by the
total of the bill imagine that was 100
pounds so naught point one times 100
pounds gives us 10 so we're adding on 10
pounds in tax so that's the tax that
we're storing right here yeah
next we'll do the same for the service
so service is going to equal to same
thing against service over 100 and then
that it can be timed by self total again
so same principle we need to just
cutting a percentage for the service
could be 15 divide that by 100 not 0.15
times that by the self total and then
we're going to get the service charge
that we need to add on to the bill as
well okay so after
that we want to work out the total the
running total which is going to be this
thing plus the tax plus the service so
we're going to take total is equal to
self total plus the tap that we just
created right here and then plus the
service that we just calculate it as
well so now we have the overall total
right and we want to print this out to
the screen but I'm going to print it out
in some kind of formatted way so the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
folder right here and this for loop is
going to cycle through the different
items in this items list right so we're
going to output these so we'll say for
item in self items which is the list
right here
okay so recycling through each one of
these and then each time around what I'm
going to do is print something out and
this is going to be a formatted string
so inside this formatting string we're
going to output first of all the item
okay and then what I'm going to do is
output the price of that item so I'll
say next to it a pound symbol first of
all we're going to calculate this in
pounds and then we're going to output
self menu and then whichever item is
inside that menu we want to look up so
I'm outputting the price of that
particular item make sense cool so now
we've done that for each item underneath
that what I want to do is also print out
the total of the whole bill so I'm going
to say print and then in here it's going
to be a formatting string once again and
inside that a string I'm going to output
the total right so I'm going to say in
double quotes first of all the total so
what we can do in here is actually print
out a string in this expression the
curly braces right we don't just have to
output some kind of variable name any
kind of expression which is outputting
here so I'm outputting a string and it's
in double quotes so we don't escape out
of this single problem so I'm saying the
total right here okay and then what I'm
going to do and I'll tell you why I'm
doing that in a minute by the way I'm
going to come back to it and then what
I'm going to do is next to it put a
pound symbol and then do the total
inside here
and that's going to be output now then
what I want to do is output this as two
decimal places so I'm going to do the
colon then dot 2f remember we covered
that in string formatting in a previous
tutorial so now who let me try and print
this out what I'm going to do is come in
here and I'm going to rule the Python
interpreter so we're in the Python
interpreter now and the interactive
shell now what I want to do is import
this bar tab module so I'll say frog and
then it's going to be fast underscore
tab import or you want to import this
class right here tab right so now we've
imported it and what we can do is we can
create a new instance of a tab now so
say for example someone comes in and
sits on table one so we say cable one
new variable equals to a tab and
instance of the tab right so now we have
table 1 and if we can't then we can see
here that table is not defined because
I've forgot the one so Table one is now
a bar tab object right cool
so now what we can do is we can leave
these different methods we can add items
to this tab so what I'm going to do is
add some items I'm going to say Table
one and I'm going to add an item and
this item is going to be equal to one of
these things right here so let's just
add first of all a soft underscore drink
okay so we've added this item now
next let's add the chicken so I'm going
to say table one dot add and the chicken
and then finally what I'll do is I'll
add one more thing which is a desserts
I'll say table one add and it's going to
be the dessert like so and now what I
want to do is work out the total and
print the total print the bill right so
I'm going to call this function now
print built so I'll say table one
doctored print underscore bill and I'm
going to call it function now what we're
going to do is pass in the tax and the
service or the taxis going to be 10%
then also I'm going to say 10% to the
service so now we can see we've got the
bill here we've got the soft drink which
is to the chicken which is 10 pound the
desert which is 6 and the total as well
we could
and the surveys included awesome so one
thing you want to do is format this
slightly better now just watch this
little trick this is why I placed this
expression right here so first of all we
said we can format certain things within
these curly braces using string
formatting and to do that we add in a
column right then the options now what
happens we just add a number right here
and I'm going to do the same thing to
this down here this string we do a colon
after it we can format this and I'm
going to say 20 after it okay so if I
save this now check out what happens I'm
going to cancel out of this and I'm
going to run the file again let me just
clear it first of all I'm going to run
tighten again the interactive shell and
I'm going to import from and it's from
bar underscore tab and I'm importing the
tab right so important this thing again
now again I want to say table will do
Table two equals a new tab
oops I didn't add on the thing over that
so
Table two now is now a new tab object so
let's just add two things will say Table
two dots add we're going to add the wine
first of all and then we'll so table to
add I'll add on the beef all right so
now I have two things on this tab now
let's work out the bill so we'll say
table two dot print underscore bill and
again what I'm going to do is add on ten
from the tax and ten from the service
charge 10% each and this time what it's
done is formatted this so this thing
right here won't even touch we'll all go
up to this line over here where we have
the total and this just looks a little
bit nicer so what this is doing right
here this 20 is saying okay well I want
this to be 20 characters long basically
the precision is about 20 characters so
this over here is going to be 20
characters one two three four five six
seven eight nine zero Mella rule all the
way to 20 and so each one is as long as
each other therefore these are line up
next to each other alright so there we
go those are first very simple project
using classes just to work out the total
of a
