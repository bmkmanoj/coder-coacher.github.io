is CSS a beginners lesson 19 I'm Sean
from the net ninja and today we're going
to talk about pseudo classes that's
coming up ah ok so what exactly is a
pseudo class well there's a question so
essentially if pseudo classes are
special keywords that go after selectors
that's important to go after them
they're like an extension of selectors
and what they do is help us to target
things we wouldn't normally be able to
tag it with normal CSS selectors so
again these things could be things like
special behavioral States on a web page
or advanced structural elements ok so
let's have a look at those two groups in
more detail now they have names those
two groups dynamic and structural and
strictly speaking not all pseudo classes
fit into one of these groups but most of
them do ok so the dynamic group what are
they well they're based on behavior so
for example when someone hovers over a
link on your website does it change
color
that's all controlled by a dynamic
pseudo class and the structural group is
more to do with selecting advanced
structural elements okay things you
wouldn't normally be able to do with a
normal CSS rules for example advanced or
complex parent-child relationships okay
so looking at dynamic pseudo classes a
little more deeply we've already said
that it allows us to style an element in
relation to user actions okay so that
could be things like when you hover over
a link does it change color or delaney
or do anything else to it or whether
when a button is being pressed does the
that button change so when you click
that little thing on your mouse to press
a button a submit button what happens to
that button you know do you give it an
emboss or move it slightly or change the
color that kind of thing or whether a
tip box has been checked on a farm you
know those farms like when you're buying
something online and at the bottom it's
got a little tick box and it says if you
did not wish to not not not not not
which do not not join our mailing list
then do not not not click here ok so
something like that if you have one of
those
checkboxes and you click it you can use
a dynamic pseudo class to make that
checkbox displayed differently okay
that's all there is to it so what's the
other group structural pseudo classes
now like we said they're used to target
more advanced structural elements that
we couldn't normally do with normal CSS
rules okay so say you've got a ul list
then you've got ten Li tags in that UL
list and none of them have classes and
none of them have ID so you can't target
specifically attacks using that the only
way to targets say v tag Li tag or the
7th Alecto would be to use a structural
pseudo class or we could use a
structural pseudo class to target a pair
in element on a HTML document that has
no children because say we don't want to
display that on the web page because
it's got no children as you know there's
no meat to it so that's what structural
pseudo classes are all about so now
we've got that out of the way and we
know what those two groups are all about
we're going to jump into the code and
look at the general syntax of pseudo
classes ah ok gang I'm back here in the
HTML and we're just going to look at the
basic syntax for now I'm not going to go
into too much detail or give specific
examples just the basic syntax okay the
way it works is this you have your
selector and let's just say it's a class
okay so you have your class scopes your
class that would be a normal selector
right whatever the class name is and we
could style it now the way we apply a
pseudo plus to this is by putting first
of all a little colon that there is
saying that a pseudo class is coming up
okay and then we write the pseudo class
keyword so whatever that might be the
keyword goes there
okay so I'll give you a specific example
say for example we want all the egg
types all the links on the web page to
change color when the hovered over now
the way we do that is by putting it in
egg first of all that's how we normally
select all the a tags and then we'd use
a pseudo class so we put our little
colon and then the keyword for this one
is hover now you don't need to remember
this now I'm going to go into more
detail about specific examples in later
videos just showing you how it works now
okay so that's our normal selector
targeting all the elements and then
we've got our color signifying
we're going to use a pseudo class and
then this is our pseudo class keyword
hover and we'll change the color to red
okay so let's save this let's see if
this works we'll open it in a browser so
there's our links and we'll hover over
them and yep
cool guys they work awesome so that's
about it for the general syntax you can
do this with any selector you know you
could do any IDs your main contents when
you hover all with that I want it to
change background color to red it's
going to look stupid but you get the
idea okay so if you have any questions
about these pseudo classes whatsoever
throw a comment down below I'm going to
answer all of those for you as soon as I
can if you enjoy these videos please
like them I'll share them or her
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
