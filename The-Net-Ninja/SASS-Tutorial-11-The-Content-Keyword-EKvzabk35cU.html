eleventh sass tutorial and in this video
we're gonna take a look at the content
keyword Harlan dude so what is the
content keyword well it's quite hard to
explain so I think it's best to go
through an example but in a very small
nutshell the content keyword subs in
styles from your rules and puts those
Styles wherever it finds the content
keyword now like I say that probably
sounds like a lot of gobbledygook so I'm
gonna go through an example and then it
will become click so what I'm gonna do
is make a new mixing and this mixing is
gonna control the media queries and this
is a cool trick we can do with suss
normally when we create media queries
we're creating them all over the show
for elements to change at different
widths and this little trick just kind
of keeps them in one place and then
keeps your little media queries together
with the rules and that's gonna make
sense in a minute so what I'll do is
come down it and make a new mixing which
is going to control these media queries
so I'll say app mixing and I'm just
going to call this mq4 media query and
this is gonna take in a variable I'm
just gonna call that argh and that
stands for arguments all right so inside
this mixing I need to create a media
query so I'll say app media and then
screen and this is just a basic media
query max-width is gonna be whatever we
pass through here this variable so I'll
copy that and I'm going to paste it in
and then in here is what the rules would
be okay and that particular media query
so if we're going to use a media query
on a specific element say for example we
want to change this banner 800 pixels
what we'd do is we'd call this mix in on
the banner element and we pass in 800
pixels right then it's gonna set this
media query for us on that element and
set the max width to 800 pixels then we
can add in our styles inside this media
query but how do we do that because we
don't want to add the specific styles
for this banner in this mixing because
we're going to be calling this mixing
for various different elements not just
this button okay so the way we get
around it is by using the
content keywords at content and then
that's all we need to do for this mixing
because when we call this mixing on the
element that we want to change at a
particular width then we're going to
specify what content we want to pass in
here okay so let's go to our style CSS
I'm just going to save this file first
of all and then we'll head over to
Styles dot CSS and then I think what I
want to change and these Li tags right
here so currently when we get small and
like this the Li tags are going to
shrink together and look a little bit
squashed what I want to do instead is
stack them one on top of another so what
I'll do is I've come to these Li tags
inside the main nav and I'll request
that mixing we just make so to do that
we know we'd have to say include then
the mixing name which is MQ and remember
we pass through a variable which is
going to be the width at which point we
want to change the width of the media
query okay so I'll say 600 pixels so at
600 pixels I'm going to call in this
media query and then remember I said we
have this content keyword right here
well whatever we put within this code
block right here after the include that
goes into this section right here in
this content so it subs it in and that
way we don't have to define it within
this mix in itself we can just define it
on the element and then that is brought
in when we use that mixin so it doesn't
matter what element we're using it on
whatever styles we add to that element
and a particular media query they're
going to be brought in to this content
keyword so that makes it really cool we
don't have to keep right now these media
queries so let's just keep this simple
and say wit 100% that's going to make
them all stack on top of each other so
I'm going to save that and then we'll
come over here and reduce this in width
and hopefully there we go and 600 pixels
we get them stacked on top of each other
like that now fair enough that doesn't
look great but I'm just demonstrating a
point here
we'd probably add more stars so that it
went to some kind of mobile navigation a
drop
or something but I'm just demonstrating
what we can do with this content keyword
and this is a really cool example we can
create a really simple media query
mixing which is dynamic and can insert
your own content from wherever you call
it okay so that's really cool so now
whenever we want to add a media query on
to an element all we have to do is this
little mixing on whichever element we
want to apply it to and it's gonna take
care of all the heavy lifting for us all
right
so we're going to dive a little bit
deeper into this into the next tutorial
where I'm going to introduce the if
keyword and we're going to pass through
some more parameters to this mixin so
any questions so far
ask those down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
