tenth pacer 3 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about wire loops so
then in the last tutorial I showed you
how we could use a for loop to loop
through some kind of data and do
something with each element within that
data now in this video I want to show
you a different kind of loop which is
called a wire loop so let's get rid of
all this junk first of all and a wire
loop basically allows us to cycle
through a certain portion of code while
a specific condition is true so I'm
going to create a couple of variables
first of all and then we'll come back to
the wire loop so for 12 age I'm going to
set equal to 25 and we'll explain these
in a minute and not equal to 0 now we
want to create this while loop now so
how do we do that well we use the
keyword wild and then we put our
expression here what are we evaluating
now I'm going to check whether none is
less than age and for as long as this
condition right here is true this wire
loop is going to cycle through or loop
through a block of code which is going
to be down here okay so this is a one of
them we have the wild keyword then the
condition were checking if the condition
is true it's going to cycle through this
code for as long as this condition is
true now right now if I put a statement
here like print num we're going to get
caught in what is known as an infinite
loop which means basically this loop is
going to keep on cycling around and
never break out because this is always
true right none is always less than 25
so it's going to keep on going around
keep on going around until eventually no
is greater than 25 which is never going
to happen I'll demonstrate let's let me
save it and say Python loops dot Q wide
and you're going to see this 0 output
loads and loads and loads of times and
potentially depending on your code this
could crash your computer right so what
I'm going to do is control C out of this
so it's what I'm going to break out and
up manually and clear the console so
what do we need to do in order for this
not to be a continuous loop well what we
want to do is change not each time
around we go through this loop so we can
say something like norm plus equals 1
and now what that's going to do is each
time around this loop
it's going to add one to the number so
when it number eventually gets to 26
after we've gone through this loop 25
times it's going to be larger than age
therefore this condition here is no
longer going through and this loop is
not going to continue anymore so let's
check that if we again say python loop
stopped py we can see all of these
numbers are output up to 24 but assuming
as number reaches 25 it is no longer
less than age therefore we don't
continue through this loop and therefore
we're not printing anything else out so
that's the basics of what a while loop
does okay so say for example we only
want to print out even numbers where we
could nest if statement in here to check
whether that's an even number so what
I'll do first of all is say if none and
then I'm going to use the modulus too
so what I'm saying is if the number of
divided by two gives us no remainder I'm
going to say is equal to zero then I
want to print out the number because if
you divide a number by two and it's got
no remainder then it has to be an even
number right so then we'll print out the
number and we're just going to indent
this print statement right here we're
not going to indent this because you
want to increase norm
every time around not just if this
condition is true so I'm going to save
that and I'm going to run it again and
this time we should only get even
numbers 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 etc cool so we
can do things like this in a while loop
so we could execute code just on
portions of a certain collection if we
wanted to and so we can also break out
of while loops manually using the break
keyword for example if we don't want to
print anything over 10 we could say
something like this we could say if
we'll do another live statement right
here if no is greater than 10 then what
we're going to do is break and in fact
we want this to be over here not listed
like so and if we save that now and rule
again then we should only go up to 10
which is called because we're breaking
right here when this condition is true
now also I don't want to output this
year
right so what I could do is say well if
the num is zero don't I'll put it so
I've come down here and I say if naught
is equal to zero then what do we want to
do well we don't want to break because
if we break then nothing else is going
to roast gonna break up to look and
nothing is going to print at all and I
can show you that you see nothing prints
at all because we're breaking out of it
from the offset at zero so instead what
we can do is use another keyword called
continue and what continue does is say
well okay what I'm going to do is
continue through the loop what I want
you to stop here for this particular
iteration so far zero we're not going
any further what would you need we'll
just continuing through the loop up here
and going again but again what I need to
do is add one tune up because if I just
go to continue again we're going to get
caught in an infinite loop because even
though equals zero within continued go
back to the top again and we're not
changing number sum is always going to
equal zero right so let me demonstrate
this I'll save it run it again and
although you can't really see anything
printing out it is caught in an infinite
loop because it's not ended we've still
got this blinking cursor right and
that's because you're not printing
anything over here but it's still
cycling through I'm going to cancel out
this process and then what I'm going to
do is add one here so I'm going to say
don't toss equals to one so if it's zero
then we add one to it then we continue
back to the top of the loop to run
through again so if we save this now we
should get what we saw up here but
without the zero so let's try it and we
do two four six eight ten cool
so then we've got my friends that is a
while loop and how we can use a while
loop to cycle through data dependent on
a certain condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
