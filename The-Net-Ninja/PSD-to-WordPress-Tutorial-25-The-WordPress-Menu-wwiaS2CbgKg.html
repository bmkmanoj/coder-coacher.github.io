PSD to WordPress lesson 25 and in this
video I'm gonna walk you through the
WordPress menu system Wow alright then
guys so I've got a head and opened up
this heading up PHP file which is where
the navigation is being loaded in and if
you look down here towards the bottom
this PHP function rat knows where
automatic is happening okay this is a
wordpress function called WP nav menu
and then within this function we're
passing through an array of different
properties and values now you might not
know what that means but essentially
we're just passing through some options
or settings if you like to WordPress so
that we can tell it how we want to
display the menu and which menu we want
to display all right so the first
property we're passing through is this
theme location 1 and we're telling it
that the theme location is primary
basically we're saying to WordPress we
want this menu to show the primary menu
so what WordPress will do is go into the
backend grab that menu then bring it
back and it will display this in a ul
and L I'd list as links with other links
in that menu showing ok now I'm going to
show you what that means in a minute
let's just open up this browser this is
the backend of WordPress I'm gonna go
down to appearance and menus and then
I'm going to go to manage locations at
the top and here you can see that the
theme location here this one is called
primary menu now we don't have a menu
assigned to that primary menu location
right there so by default we've already
if we go to the codes you can see we've
already specified we want the theme
location to be primary all right which
is this one so what WordPress is doing
by default is look in here and it can't
find a menu assigned to it so it says
well ok I can't find a menu so I'm just
going to show every page that the user
publishes in the menu instead
okay so currently we only have one page
and it's showing that there but if I go
to pages if I add a new one we're just
gonna call this some of my tests I'll
publish that then we go over it and
fresh now you're gonna see that link up
there as well okay so it's currently
putting all the pages up there in the
menu now a lot of the times you don't
want to show every page in your
top-level menu okay so what you're gonna
have to do is let me just delete this
first of all test trash what you're
gonna have to do then is go to the menu
section and you're gonna have to specify
here an actual menu to set up the
primary menu okay now I'm just gonna
select this one then you want which is
the one that comes by default in
WordPress and if we go to edit menus now
you can see that this is menu one that's
the menu name right there
okay so you can call it wherever you
want we'll just call this resto and save
the menu then it would go back to manage
locations you can see that this is
updated as well okay so it's still the
same so let's go back and then what we
can do is customize this menu or right
here now currently it's got this home
link in it which I will keep but let's
have a look what all the pages we need
right here we've got all the pages so
it's our story menu reservations news
and reviews okay now what I'm gonna do
is create this one and these three right
here and then the news one I'm gonna do
slightly differently okay so let's go
and make those pages first of all in
WordPress so let's go to pages and we'll
go to add new and I'll do one called
menu and what I've done is just grabbed
some lorem ipsum here from this Lori
Saul it's gangsta lorem ipsum because i
am down with the boys and that kind of
shizzle
alright let's paste it in there and this
could be any old junk for now then I'll
create a new page add new and we'll call
this reservations well pop that in again
publish it and then we'll add a new one
we'll call this our story
case now and I think the last one was
reviews yep we'll add one more and we'll
call this reviews and we'll paste that
in and publish it around there so let's
add those pages in to the navigation so
we'll go down to appearance again and go
to menus and right here we're going to
add these in so you can see we've got
pages here so I'm gonna click reviews
our story reservations and menu and I'm
gonna put that to the menu over here by
clicking this add some anybody ok so now
all these are in the menu and we can
rearrange them however we want ok if I
was to put this one in a little bit like
that
this now becomes a sub menu of this or a
sub list of this list item right here I
don't want that I just want it to be all
one level okay so that is the navigation
except for the news ok so let's save it
for now and just take a look in the
website to see how it's looking if i
refresh now we're gonna see all these
here all right and what I want to do now
is create a new category called news and
the reason I'm going to do that if I go
to publish categories the reason I'm
doing this is so that we can create a
few dummy posts and assign them into the
news category okay so let's put that
there
News this look is going to be news
parent is NaN we don't need a
description and we'll add that category
then we'll go to posts add new whatever
we sell me and I just paste that lorem
ipsum stuff in there
and it's gonna be in the news category
like that okay so we'll publish that and
then we'll do one more I don't know what
else can sell we sell veg this is really
boy nice I'm so sorry
there we go publish that so we've got
two posts now within the news section of
two blog posts which are in the news
category
now when you click on the news link in
the top level menu what I want to happen
is to show a list of all the latest news
items so I can do that in the menu
system I'll go down here to appearance
and then menus again and then what I'm
gonna do is go to categories so you've
got all these options that we can put
into the menu the first one is pages
then we've got posts if there's any
specific posts you want to put in the
top-level menu then there's custom links
normally this is for an external link to
another website or something and then
categories you can see this news item
right here so I'm going to click that
and add that to the menu and then that's
going to be a link to the news page of a
news archive page if you like you saw we
did a tutorial on styling up and
creating the archive dot PHP file so
that's going to take you to the news
category archive page which is going to
show all the posts in the news category
so let's save this menu again and come
out here and refresh hopefully we're
going to see it up here now yeah news
and if I click that it's going to go to
the news category archive right there ok
so it's like clicking this thing right
here perfect and there's only one in
that and I did do two is it because I
didn't assign a second one that someone
look we selvedge yeah that's because I
didn't assign that right there so let's
update that again and refresh and now
you can see both of them they're like
that perfect alright and if we click on
these other links as well it's gonna
take you to the different pages like
that and we've already styled up this
page PHP template so that's why it's
showing like that alright so that is how
we assign our dynamic menu in WordPress
and how we add links to it all right
there so hope that explains how we can
control the menu in WordPress and if you
do have any questions feel free to drop
