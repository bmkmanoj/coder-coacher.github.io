third sass tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about sass variables
Wow okay then dude so before I talk
about any sense whatsoever I just want
to quickly go through what I've already
created in these core files and the
first thing is this index.html file and
this is pretty simple guys you'll notice
two things first of all I've linked up
the reset dot CSS in the head and then
this Styles dot CSS and remember this is
where we're outputting all of us us to
this Styles dot CSS file
okay now this reset dot CSS file is just
some really basic Styles standing the
body some basic element Styles taking
the margin I'm planning off them things
like that and then as well as that we
have this class of wrapper which I've
created which is just kind of
centralizing all the content on the
middle of the page so currently our web
page is looking something like this
rather dashing wouldn't you agree
okay so we're gonna stab this bad boy up
throughout this course and the HTML is
dead simple we've got a header right
here which contains the navigation which
is this dude at the top right here then
we've got this lead banner section which
is all over this junk here and then down
here we've got a section with an ID of
services which is these three icons here
below that we have this section which is
the lessons banner which is going to be
here and then finally we have a project
section which is all this kind of stuff
here
okay so we're just going to keep it
simple to begin with and we're going to
talk about variables in sass now these
are one of the really simple but really
cool features of sass and they make our
life a lot easier the first thing I'm
going to do is get rid of all this junk
right here and we're going to create
some variables so say for example we
have a color that we use a lot on our
webpage right then instead of trying to
remember the hex code for that color all
the time and I'm constantly doing that
I'm searching through previous CSS I've
written to look for that hex code to use
it again instead of that we can just
store that hex code in a variable okay
so I could do
something like this I'm gonna create a
little comment first of all and by the
way we can do this too / comment thing
in sass we don't have to do the slash
and then Asterix and then the Asterix
and the slash to close it we can do a
single line comment in sass using those
two forward slashes okay so I'm going to
create a comment right here called
variables so how do we create these
variables well the only thing we need to
do is just say the variable name and we
proceed that with a dollar sign okay so
all variables are preceded with a dollar
sign and never give our variable a name
so I'm going to create a variable to
store a color in and I'm going to call
this color deep blue and it's gonna be
camelcase alright and then you do a
colon and then you set that to whatever
color you want
now the hex code I want is 0 3 2 F 3 e
alright and then we put a semicolon then
we've got my friends that's a variable
how simple is that
so now we can call upon this variable
when whenever we want to use it so say
for example I want to use this in my
Styles all I need to do is come down
here I'm gonna go after this which has
an ID of main now so I'm going to grab
that copy X I'm extremely lazy put a
hash and then go after that style okay
now I can say background and instead of
putting this thing right here I can just
call this variable which is deep blue
and it's gonna recognize that now in
acid because it's already recognized hey
I've created a variable called deep blue
so I'm gonna help you out and remind you
what it's called as well so that's
really cool so now if I save this you're
going to notice this thing right here
first of all we'll get that compiled
successfully message and now it's output
to the styles this color here in the
background
okay so SAS has recognized that this
variable replaced it with this compiled
that to CSS so in CSS we don't see this
we see this instead and now that's
output to the screen pretty cool right
so as well as storing colors in
variables we can store other things in
them as well such as font sizes so let's
go ahead and do that so what I want to
do is I want to store a font size that
we're going to use over and over
again in a variable and it's gonna be a
font size of any section h1 so things
like that and that okay so let's create
a variable and call this section heading
and let's set that equal to 24 pixels
just like that okay and then if we look
in the HTML every time there is a
section like this we have a h1 beneath
it yeah and if we have another section
there should be a h1 here within this
section so all we need to do to target
in that h1 is say oops
take away that hatch section h1 all
right and then we'll say font size is it
brought to the section heading and
that's going to grab that variable and
replace it with 24 pixels so we'll save
that check out the styles right here and
you'll see now section h1 font size 24
pixels right and that's the target in
this thing right here as well as this
thing right here so now if we want to
change the font size about H one's in
those sections we don't need to change
it wherever there's a rule for it all we
do is come to the variable and change it
right here so to change that to 28 and
that's going to update them all as well
and you'll see that right here okay
pretty cool so I'll change that back to
24 for now and I'm also gonna give this
a color of deep blue okay
so we've used that other variable again
and now we see we have that color right
there so that's really cool that's what
variables are useful we can use
variables to store things in that we're
going to use over and over so that we
don't need to remember those particular
sizes or colors or whatever we want to
store and all we need to do is pop in
the variable name instead okay so we'll
be using more variables as we go along
through this playlist that's just like
an introduction to them if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm gonna see you
in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
