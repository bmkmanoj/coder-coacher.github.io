you're watching CSS to begin its lesson
40 and in this video we're gonna talk
about borders that's coming up
Wow alright so here I am back in the
code guys and the first thing you're
gonna notice is the fact that I've got
all of these different rules here all
these different selectors and they kind
of correspond to these dibs over here
which all have a class of box but they
all have one of these selectors one of
these classes associated with them too
okay so I'll talk about these in a
minute but to begin with I just want to
briefly talk about what the border
property is and how we use the shorthand
and longhand notation to control it so
first of all the border is part of the
box model okay it's the kind of
perimeter of the element just outside of
the padding but before the margin and we
can specify three values for it and that
is the width the style and the color now
the width obviously controls how wide or
how thick the border is the other style
controls whether it's dotted or dashed
and you'll notice that that corresponds
to these here and the color quite
clearly specifies the color so to go
over the longhand way of doing this
first of all the way we control it is by
first of all right in forward and then
we choose a side so top so we do - top
and then - one of the values that are
talked about and we'll start off with
width that's the first one and we'll
save ten pixels
okay so we're saying here guys that we
want to bore the top width to be ten
pixels now the second value was border
top style and there are many different
styles you can see here a multitude of
different keywords we can choose all of
which corresponds to one of these
classes here so I'll go through these in
a second I'm just going to choose solid
for now because that's the most common
one that's just a solid thick line and
then the third property is border - top
- color and we just control the color
here let's just say blue so that there
my friends is a full border top property
using three different properties border
top width border top style border top
color and it's giving it these three
values here now that's pretty
long-winded yeah we'd have to do this in
total 12 times if we had all four sides
start like this
okay so that's another great way to do
it however we can say bought a top and
then we can specify all of the three
values within this one property so the
first set was thickness which was ten
pixels then was the style which was
solid and a final it was the color which
was blue so that is exactly the same as
writing all three out separately alright
first is thickness secondly style and
the third is the color but there's a
quicker way say for example we wanted to
style all sides not just the top we just
read Borden and then we do exactly the
same ten pixels for the thickness solid
for the style and blue for the color and
that is the ultimate shorthand for the
border property dead quick and it's
going to apply the border to all sides
with these three values okay so now
we've seen that I'm gonna delete it I'm
going to go through the different border
styles so same again we'll use the
shorthand and we're going to just say
one pixel for the the width then we're
going to say blue for the color and then
we're going to say dashed for the style
because that's one of the key words here
dashed in fact I'll just show you these
key words if I write border dash style
and it's a great way if you ever forget
to see all of the different key words
here okay that dashed one was the top so
we're gonna go through all of these
different key words so we've done that
one let's just copy and paste this and
then paste it in all of these oops down
here like this then we'll just change
the key words to match up to the class
so that's dotted this is double by the
way guys I very rarely use all of these
different border styles the ones I
mainly use loops of spelt that we're on
what's going on groove the ones I mainly
use are solid occasionally dashed and
occasionally dotted it's good for things
like surrounding voucher codes as if
it's like a cutting something you know
that you cut out but mainly like safe
solid so the here if you want to use
them but I very rarely do anyway so
we've done all these now solid so we'll
save that and save this
and we'll view this in the browser let's
see what they look like
I'll put with chrome alright there we go
guys the the first two here dashed and
dotted they're perfectly fine and the
solid one this is what I saw with one
looks like
however the double groove in set and
outset and ridge they all look the same
don't they and that's because they're
all one pixel thick now these are
speciality borders and they require
larger border width to work properly so
I'm just gonna go back into the code and
let's change this to no that will change
double to four pixels will change groove
to four pixels in sets of four and you
get the pattern we're just gonna change
them all to four pixels these properties
okay so let's view this once more in the
browser don't come with chrome and now
there you go we can see the double one
but I'm going the groove is still not
big enough the insect still not big
enough outset and ridge is still not big
enough so what's going on well let's
just try increasing these even more
let's just put the fourteen inside save
that again now if you in a browser one
last time alright now we can start to
see them you see here this groove is
kind of like a groove it's like a bevel
almost around the body it very sort of
you might have to put your head and your
face right next to the screen to see it
the insert here is just these two lines
that make it look like an inset outset
it's just basically swapping these
colors here and the ridge is a little
bit like the groove but again swapping
the colors around so very sort of
differences between all of those they're
good for things like making picture
frames I suppose online but you do need
to have larger borders to kind of
appreciate those so that about covers it
for the lesson on borders if you have
any questions whatsoever feel free to
comment down below I'll answer all of
those as soon as possible otherwise if
