ninth angular2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about the ng
content directive okay so I know I've
not talked about directives yet but
because this is such a simple directive
to use and because it relates to what
we're doing now when we're talking about
reviews and stuff I thought I throw it
in now rather than later on and we'll
pick up directives again as we go on so
what is this directive I'm talking about
well first of all check this out you see
right here we have this up home tag so
we know that when I'm going to seize
this uphold directive right here this
tag it looks for the up home component
which it finds here the home component
and then it finds this view the home
component HTML and it would places this
thing right here this tag with that
content right there so check this out
what if I put in hell on dirt and
content between these tags well what
would you expect to happen now well if I
save this and check it out in a browser
just gonna press refresh it should load
automatically when you make a change but
sometimes I get impatient and I just
click refresh especially on my computer
which is super slow at the minute anyway
you can see now
nothing works it's not output to the
screen this has basically been deleted
and the reason is because whenever we
get this tag we're replacing it with
this content right here so this content
is over right in this stuff here so what
if I want to be able to nest a HTML or
string or whatever inside this and I
want it to display to the screen well
that is where this ng content directive
kicks in so if I go over to this
component view this home component view
which is getting inserted here if I want
to output the stuff that's within the
tags all I need to do is one simple tag
directive and that is ng - content so
whenever I'm going to sees this this
directive is going to look for the
content within the tags right here the
control of you and it's going to output
it right here in the view so if I save
this dude or right now and wait for this
to refresh
then now you're going to see this
content out put into the view so it's
been output right here like that and
that is a bit like how transclusion
worked in angular 1 if you remember that
if you've ever used it so dead simple
directly to use and and like say we're
going to talk about directives a little
bit more later on I just thought I'd
include this one here because it's kind
of relevant to what we're talking about
so dead quick lesson there but there we
go any questions feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise I'm going
to see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
