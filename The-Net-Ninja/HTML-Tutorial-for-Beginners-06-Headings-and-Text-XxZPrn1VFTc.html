and this is lesson 6 of HTML basics
headings and text so in the last lesson
we kind of went into more detail about
the head and how we put everything in
there for the browser to give it more
information about the web page and then
we went through the body briefly and we
just said that this is everything else
that you want the user to see on the
browser so now what we're going to do is
dive back into the body tag and play
around with text a little bit see how we
can format it in slightly different ways
and show it to the user in different
ways so I'll jump back over to brackets
right so here I am back in brackets and
this is pretty much where we left it
last time I have changed the h1 tag it
announces welcome to my smelly fish shop
because this is what we're selling right
and then the P tag says we sell the
smelly fish on the planet apart from
that everything else is the same so what
we'll do first these will demonstrate
some different H tags now I mentioned
earlier these range all the way from H 1
to H 5 it could be more to be honest
I've never needed to use anything beyond
H 5
you
and a h3 h4 and finally a h5 and the way
this works is as follows the h1 is the
most important heading text so if you
have a site title at the top of your
webpage
you'd use a h1 a subtitle for that maybe
four different sections on your web page
you'd use a h2 and so forth and right
down at the bottom of the stack is Haiti
five one in just a little bit of
attention but it doesn't get much so
that's the least important tag so let's
save this out and have a look in the
browser and remember we can just
right-click in the left hand side on the
file showing Explorer and double click
on file and there we go it looks awfully
like a sight chart a psych test chart so
this was our original text and these are
all the new hate tags and we can see
that the h1 is the most important h2
second and so forth and this H oh we've
not changed the the text of that but it
should say this is a h5 tag and that is
the smallest of all of them it's even
smaller than the P tag now that's how
unimportant this h5 tag is so there are
heading tags now what can we do with
normal text
well I'll jump back into brackets so
here we are back in brackets and to
demonstrate what we can do with normal
text I'm going to copy this P tag and
generally speaking most times that you
do text you're going to put the text if
it's just generic text within a P tag
you can pop text outside of a P tag
however then it becomes a little harder
for you to grab hold of that text in the
CSS file and style it to your liking I
would always recommend putting text
within some kind of tag generally a p1
okay so what we're going to do is keep
the top P tag exactly the same so we can
compare the rest to that and we're going
to embed different tags within the P
tags if you remember I said you can
Nest attacks within tax that's what we
could we're going to do here so I'm
going to nest some different tags within
the rest of the P tags so this first one
will do a small tag copy that and paste
it there and we've just made the word
fish here small so hopefully when we
view this in a browser that's going to
turn the fish word pretty small the next
one up will do mark and essentially what
the mark tag does is highlight the text
it's exactly the same as if you were
studying for an exam and you had a
highlighter and your highlights in some
text in a term on a page this has the
same effect the third one will do will
be the exact and the sub tag stands for
subscript so that's going to make the
text a little bit smaller and push it
down below the normal text line the next
one we'll do is a soap and by the way I
mentioned that brackets has this thing
called code code hinting you've noticed
out just press the S key i've not tapped
a full tag name and it's come up with a
lot of different options for me and i
can just choose the sup tag from here so
it's good if you forget which tag you
want to use or if you forget the name of
the tag and finally what we're gonna do
to demonstrate pre formatted text you
stick the whole sentence within a pre
tag okay so we're gonna save that and
actually i'll do one more thing just to
demonstrate this soap set tag i'm gonna
do ten sort for because what's up stands
for is superscript and that's most
efficient when you're doing things like
10 to the power of four as you've seen
some kind of mathematical equation so
we've got our normal p tag then the
small one then the mark then the
subscript superscript and then the pre
formatted tag so i'm going to save this
out and then we'll open this up back in
a browser
and we can see we've got our first P tag
here nothing's happened to that the
second P tag here if you look closely
you can see that the word fish is ever
so slightly smaller we've got the third
one which was the mark time very like
very much like highlighting effect the
fourth one which is a subscript has
brought the text down below the line and
the fifth one which is a superscript has
brought the text above the line very
much like the mathematical equations
where you see 10 to the power 4 the last
one but it was a pre tag which stands
for pre formatted text and that is kind
of not give the text any browser styles
okay and that's because everything that
we do in the pre tag the browser just
takes that as is and displays it in the
browser to demonstrate that a little bit
more I'm going to jump back into
brackets and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna put a break here after smelliest
so I press the Enter key and it's
brought fish on the planet to the next
line I'm gonna do it exactly the same on
the first P tag where there's no tags
inside just to demonstrate the
difference so the P tag has no pre
formatted text in it and the last P tag
here has a bit of pre formatted text in
it where we've gone into a new line and
that change should show in the browser
so I'll open it up one last time and we
can see that here the last one we did
it's brought the second part of the
sentence on to the next line because I
hit enter and I brought it that way on
the text editor the top one has had no
effect whatsoever so that's what a
preformed a pre pre tag does you can pre
format the text within the text editor
alright so what we've done now is we've
got a few different heading tags and a
few different ways of formatting text
within P tags so I think now we're well
equipped to go into the next lesson and
start fleshing out the website a little
bit more so I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
