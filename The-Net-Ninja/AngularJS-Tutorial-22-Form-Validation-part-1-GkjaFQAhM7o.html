22nd angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about form and
validation part 1 ah ok then dos so for
the next couple of lessons or so I'm
going to talk about form validation and
to do that I wanted to create a form
page some kind of contact page so I've
gone ahead and created a new view in a
v-fold called contact HTML and within
this I'm just going to div here with a
class of content just to style this a
bit better
using these Styles here and then within
that I've got a dead simple form okay
and it's got a name of contact form
using camelcase we're going to use that
probably in the next tutorial and then
we've got a couple of input fields right
here the first one of type text the
second of type email both got
placeholders and they've both got a name
property as well name an email then
we've got a text area for the message
itself a given a placeholder and a name
of message and then finally it just this
input type of submit with a value of sin
so that's a dead simple form nothing
special there and that's all I've done
so now what I want to do is serve up
this view when some visits forward slash
contact so we need to set that route up
right here in our config so let's go and
grab this route and down it and paste it
in again and I want to say when it's
forward slash contact I want the view to
be in the views folder then concept dot
HTML and for the time being we don't
need a controller so let's get rid of
that and we don't need this little comma
here because there's only one property
now in that object so let's save that
and now when we go to forward slash in
contact this should throw up the form
right here and the reason it looks so
nice is because I'm using these Styles
right here which you can download from
the github page the link is down below
ok then so how does form validation work
in angularjs well again at its most
basic level it provides us with a lot of
classes that we can use to interact with
the user to tell it whether a form field
is valid or whether the form itself is
valid or invalid or if they've not typed
in in an email correctly or something
like that ok for example if someone
types in an invalid email we could color
the board
read to say look it's not valid and we
could also maybe supply some text below
to say you need to enter and valid email
so before we dive in and start writing
any code I just want to go through the
classes which we're going to take a look
at in this tutorial ok there so here's
the classes I want to take a look at in
this tutorial and there's three sets of
two essentially
okay so the first two right here in ng
pristine and ng dirty now ng pristine is
a class which is applied to our form or
any input field which has not yet been
used and by that I mean no text has been
entered into it its pristine very clean
okay when we type some kind of text into
that field or the form itself then they
get classes of ng dudes instead so they
take away pristine it's no longer
pristine and they give it ng dirty okay
so now we know that a user has entered
something somewhere on the form or in an
input field okay okay so the next pair I
want to look at is ng untouched and ng
touch and these are similar but we don't
actually have to type anything in for
these to change so what a form first
loads it's been untouched and the input
fields within it have been untouched but
as soon as we click within an input
field and then click away from it and
angularjs considers that field to be
touched so it takes away the untouched
value and it puts on the ng touched
class instead okay we don't need to
actually type into it for it to become
touch so the final pair will look at is
ng valid and ng invite so these again
are applied to both the form element and
input fields so when an input field is
valid ie when we type in a correct email
address then angular will take away the
invalid class which applies by default
when a form first loads and it gives it
a valid class so now we know when a
certain field is valid and if all fields
are valid within that form then it goes
ahead and takes away the invalid class
from our form element and gives it the
valid class so we know that the whole
form is valid as well okay now so before
we start playing around with those
classes and basically what we need to do
is hand over control from HTML 5 to
angular when it comes to service and
validation because html5 has this
inbuilt functionality to validate form
fields for you so in order to do that
all we need to do is pass through in
this attribute right there to the form
called no validate and that's basically
saying look I don't want html5 to
validate this for me because angular is
going to do it all for us
all right so we'll do that and then in
html5 if we wanted to make a set of
field required we would do something
like this right we'd say required now in
angularjs it's very similar except we
just brought em G - required equals true
okay so that's all we're going to do
we're going to make each feel required
now so angular knows that we have to put
something in each one of these I'm also
going to attach a model to each one of
these so that we can store the data
because presumably when we do a
real-world application we're going to do
something with this date till I send it
to a database or some kind of email
address right so let's put a model to
each one of these so ng - model and I'm
going to set the model equal to an
object which is the same for each one of
these so the object is going to be
called contact because I want them all
to be linked and then I'm going to give
each one of these a different property
on that contact object for example the
model for this one is going to be
contact dot name okay and then the model
for this one ng model equals contact dot
email and finally for this one ng model
equals contact dot message just like
that okay so now we're storing each one
of these on a different property on this
object and just to make sure it's worth
let's output oops
to that object right here so I'll just
use an expression to say contact and
I'll put that to the screen now when we
type something in ryu ryu at gmail.com
we're going to get that stuff right at
the top now outputs that so we know now
we're storing this stuff in an object
and we've got access to that okay cool
so let's get rid of that and now what
we'll do is take a look at these
classes so if I right-click and inspect
we're going to see these classes in the
elements tab and let me just zoom in one
more so you can see this and if we
expand this we can see the form first of
all it has that class of ng pristine
which means we've not entered anything
into this form yet whatsoever as soon as
we do this is going to become ng dirty
so we know that form has been entered
into that it's got ng invalid because
currently all these are required and
we've not yet entered anything into them
so that all invalid at the minute so
therefore the form is invalid and if we
expand this we can see the first input
again has got ng pristine we've not yet
typed into it it's all cop it's also got
ng on touch that's because we've not
clicked into it and then clicked away
and it's got ng invalid as well and it's
got required you can see ng invalid
required so it knows it's required same
for this simple field and pretty much
the same for this text area okay so now
if you check out these classes right
here as I go into it and then come away
this changes from ng untouched to ng
touched right there
so we've touched that form field and
angular knows that and therefore we know
that we know that a user has gone into
this field and then come away from it
okay and if I then type something in it
just watch this class right here ng
pristine if I type a Ryu then that is
going to go from ng pristine to ng dirty
right there so now this is a dirty farm
field something's been typed into it
likewise the contact form itself gets
the class of ng dirty and ng pristine is
taken away from it because something has
been written into this contact form okay
so if you take a look at this one as
well now it's ng valid so it was ng
invalid before but now we've written a
name in it angular saying yeah I'm happy
with that name it's valid you can move
on so let's go into the email so if I
type in Ryu there we get that ng dirty
ng where is it ng dirty class right
there we get ng invalid still okay and
that's because it's saying well look
this is
and input type of email so this is not a
valid email angular is doing that work
for us you know there's no out sign in
there everything so it's going to be
invalid still and we could you know kind
of style this class a bit differently
like red border or something so that a
user knows it look this is not yet valid
you need to make this valid until we
write in at whatever comm and now you
can see that this will be ng valid till
now it is valid okay say for the message
as soon as we type something it's going
to become ng dirty and etc etc etc and
it's going to be valid and now we can
let the user send the form all right so
let's style up these classes to make
them look a bit better and give the user
some feedback so what I do what I want
to do is scale these input fields and
the text area so that if a certain field
is not valid it's going to have a red
border so let's go to the stars dot CSS
come down here and say input dot ng
invalid and text area dot ng invalid and
we're going to give these a border of
two pixels solid and red so let's save
that now and if we refresh over here
nothing yet happens input invalid text
area ng invalid and the reason guys is
because I'm an absolute dunce and I've
misspelled border so if we save that now
now you can see they're all red okay but
this is still a little bit pants if we
first come on to this page they're all
going to be read by default because
they're all in violent to begin with
that's not great you know I don't want
these red things shouting out at me when
I first go to a forum but what I do want
is if a user clicks into a forum type
something that's invalid or just moves
on then it becomes red okay so for that
to happen a farm field has to be touched
so it can combine those classes so if an
input field has the class of ng invalid
and also has the class of ng - touch
then we're going to say we want it to be
read say
for this one ng touch like that so this
time if I save and then refresh then
when I click in this is fine to begin
with if I click away then it becomes red
okay then this one becomes red if I
click away but if I type in a name Ryu
this one goes fine it would type in Rey
up here and move on it's still not fine
so I need to write something else so Ryu
at whatever dot-com now it's fine okay
your message lalala now it's fine so
this is the kind of thing we can do with
the classes that angularjs provides us
with on forms and we can provide
feedback to users to say whether a field
is valid or not valid okay so in the
next lesson we're going to take this one
step further and we're going to look at
some of the objects that angular
provides us with to provide even more
feedback and more functionality on these
forms so until then if you've got any
questions feel free to comment down

and like guys and I'll see you in the
very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
