watching CSS for beginners lesson 45 and
today we're going to take a look at the
background shorthand property Wow
alright guys so in the last lesson I
showed you these different background
properties the background color the
background image background repeat'
background position and background size
now I'm going to show you the shorthand
version of this so that we can combine a
few of these properties into one
property and there's many different ways
of doing this I'm going to show you the
way that I like to work and then you can
take from it what you will go off and
research yourself and then kind of adapt
it to your workflow so the way I like to
do this is by specifying the background
image properties within the background
shorthand so I'm going to delete all of
these here
first of all I'll copy this and then
delete all these oops and what we'll do
is just write background for our
property that's it okay and then we're
going to write multiple values within
this one property and the first thing we
want to say is that we want to supply an
image so we'll do that by writing URL
then up parenthesis and then paste our
image in there okay now the next thing
we want to do is say that we don't want
this to repeat so we write no-repeat the
third thing we want to do is specify
that we want this to be in the top
center and then that's all I do in the
background shorthand property
I write the URL first for the background
image I write there no repeat property
or repeat or space depending on what I
want to do with the image I write now
second third I write the the top of the
whichever kind of coordinate I want and
then for the center or whichever other
coordinate I want so that's all there is
to it okay
again you can kind of adapt this to how
you want there are other ways of doing a
shot hunt version and it's all going to
be on the Mozilla website I'll link to
that down here
love so you can read that yourselves
what I would say is that I would always
put your background color property
separately if you have the images and
I'd put it underneath the background
shorthand property and the reason that
is is because first of all if we put
this up here above the background
property then we'd first of all we'd
apply the background color and then
underneath that way we choose this rule
here it's going to override that color
and it will no longer be there this way
we're going to supply the background
image is how we want them and then
underneath we're going to supply a
background color which isn't going to
override this but it still will provide
a background color so I'd always do that
and then the second thing is and always
especially find the background size out
here you can do it in the show hand up
here but it becomes a little bit
confusing and it's a little bit more
limited I think so I know we supply this
separately so if you want to give it a
width of 200 pixels I do that here so
this here these three rules is exactly
the same as right in the six rules that
we did in the previous lesson so let's
just save that and view it in a browser
there we go guys exactly the same so
that's all there is to it that's the
background shot and property use it
