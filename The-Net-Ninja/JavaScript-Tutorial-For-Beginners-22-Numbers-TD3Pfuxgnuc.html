JavaScript for beginners lesson 22 and
in this video we're gonna start working
with numbers Wow okay then so working
with numbers in JavaScript is pretty
easy if you and a story number in a
variable all you need to do is write the
VAR keyword my variable name and set
that equal to whatever number you want
okay that's all there is to it now in
other programming languages we'd have to
specify what type of number we want for
example an integer or a float in
JavaScript we do none of that if you
want a whole number you write a whole
number if you want a decimal number you
write a decimal number that's all there
is to it the most important thing to
remember is that you don't surround your
numbers with quotation marks like this
because that they're my friends turns
that number into a string this is no
longer a number but a string and this is
important because when you try to add
two numbers together it introduces the
whole concept of concatenation
now we're syncing catenation briefly in
one of my earlier tutorials but I'm just
going to quickly go over it again and
show you a few examples so to do that
I'm going to make two variables variable
a and I'm going to set that equal to
five variable B I'm going to set that
equal to five there as well now the
first thing I'm going to do is just add
these numbers together and log it to the
console so console dot log a plus B
right and five plus five that should be
ten okay let's refresh perfect we get
ten now if one of these was a string
let's do the same sort and save that
this time we get 55 now two things is
going on here the first thing that's
going on is concatenation that is it's
squashing the two things together it's
not adding them five plus five is
putting them side-by-side so if this was
say seven it's taken seven and put in
five next to it and I'll refresh to show
you 75 this time the second thing that's
happening is it's taking that number
that result and it's turning that into a
string
this right here is no longer a number
and I can tell that because it's black
in the console and not
whoo before when I did two numbers pay
attention to this courtly blog I'll
refresh now it's blue you might not be
able to see that on the screen so I'm
going to show you another way turn this
back into a string and then underneath
here I'm going to write console dot log
I'm going to say type off a plus B and
then what this is going to do is give me
the data type of the result of this okay
now let's save it and refresh and you
can see that I'm getting a string data
type so that's telling me that this
result here is no longer a number it's a
string so this is really important okay
you need to make sure that when you're
declaring numbers you don't have
quotation marks around them right so
this thing here by the way you don't
need to know now I'll go through type of
later when we've covered all the
different data types I was just showing
you what the result was now another
useful feature that Java Script provides
us with when we're working with numbers
is the math object and I know we've not
talked about objects in general yet
we're going to do that later but I
wanted to introduce this now because
it's really simple and very useful now
they've given this object in JavaScript
so that we can work out different
calculations easier okay now all I have
to do is write the math keyword and then
I can do dot and then it can call any of
the math functions or constants that I
want so for example I could say math
round and pass this in 7.5 and that is
going to round the number 7.5 upwards to
8 if it was 7.3 it would round it down
to 7 7 point 8 up to 8 etc and I'll just
console.log this for you to see let's do
that there save it and you can see we're
getting 8 because we're rounding this up
to eight another method or function that
we have on the math object is flaw and
this is similar to round but for says ok
whatever the number even if it's seven
point nine rounded downwards to the 7
don't round it upward
so let's refresh and this time we get
seven opposite of this is seal which
stands for sealing and this rounds us up
no matter what the number so let's
refresh and then we go eight another one
we have is max where we can pass in
multiple values so we'll pass in seven
four four nine and eight now it's going
to give us back the maximum number so
let's save that and refresh which is
nine yet and the point here is that we
may not know which numbers are being
passed in these may all be kind of
random numbers or numbers entered by
user and we want to solve these okay so
it's not always this simple but the
feature is there for you to use it also
holds constants like pi and i can save
that and it's going to log out pi for me
there we go and it has various other
functions and constants as well if you
want to research that go out there and
google it and there's a lot of websites
which are going to tell you all the
different functions and constants of the
math object so that's about it for this
numbers lesson what we are going to do
in the next lesson is talk about n a n
which stands for not anal but we've seen
it briefly so far but I just want to go
into more detail about that and how we
can use it to check variables out so if
