sixteenth birthday three tutorial and in
this video I'm going to talk about
classes alright so at the start of this
series I said that everything in Python
was an object and there's different
types of objects we've looked at in this
series so far things like lists picture
of strings integers floats etc and these
are all different types of objects and
they all have their own methods and
properties associated with the rope so
first of all how would we find out the
type of a particular object in title
well to explore that I'm just going to
go into the Python shell and then create
a few variables first of all so name is
going to be equal to Shawn and then age
is will be equal to 28 numbers is going
to be equal to a list of numbers okay
that will do so if I wanted to find out
the type of a particular object all I
need to do is type in the type method
and then pass in the variable that I
want to find out the type of and in this
case we see class string okay so it
tells us that type the same for the
others I can say type and then plus in
age and that's integer or type and
passing numbers and that is list so
we're getting the type back here and it
says class before it which basically
means this object is based on the class
of string or the class of integer on the
class of list so when these objects are
based on this class they kind of inherit
all of the properties and methods
governed by that class for example we
have a method on strings upper so we
could say name Cooper
and that gives us the uppercase version
of that string that is a method unique
to this class right here is class Goods
it so what is a Klassen well basically a
class is a group well basically a class
is a blueprint for how an object should
look and it's not an object itself it
only describes how an object should look
and behave then we can create a new
object which is based on a particular
class and that class is going to govern
how the object behaves what methods and
what attributes it has for example say
we want to make a class of ninja to make
some ninja objects
we would describe the different
attributes or functions or methods of a
ninja within that class the attributes
would be named around the height etc
different properties in essence and the
functions or methods would be things
that the means you can do fight talk
will hide all of those kind of things so
we now have many different ninja objects
in a program based on this one single
ninja class and listening to class is
describing how all of these ninja
objects should walk and behavior all
right so then let's go through an
example and create our very own class to
create some custom objects and this
class is going to be a class to create
planning objects so first of all let's
exit out at this dude over here control
Z and then clear it so we've got some
room all right now so how do we create
class well first of all we need a
classic keyword and then we need to give
this class a name which starts with a
capital letter since we're making
planets and ridicolous planets and then
we have our column so underneath here is
where we define the different attributes
and the different methods associated
with this class so that every object we
create based on this class has those
properties and methods so to create
attributes we first need to define and
emits function right and what this emits
function does is basically run when we
create a new instance of this class and
you object based on this class okay so
it's kind of like a constructor method
and we're going to look at this method
in more detail in the next tutorial so
now just follow me
it also takes in this self property
right here is self parameter and this
refers to the instance of the object
we're creating right so we're using this
class to create new objects and when we
create a new object using it this self
refers to that object we're creating
makes sense so then inside this init
function what we can do is attach some
attributes to that instance to self so
I'm going to say self dot name and this
is going to attach a name attribute to
that instance and we're going to set
this equal to pop underneath we'll do
self dot radius imagine this is in
college
or something like that we'll just do it
200 euros self-growth it in like an
expand it there we go is equal to 5.5 in
comparison earth is 9.8 meters per
second so we'll do another one self dot
system so what system is this in well it
can be in the exhaust system and by the
way I'm just feeling this from starwars
not making it hop
ok so that will do anyway so we've
created now a class with this in its
function its kind of constructor
function which takes in the instance
that we're trying to create this new
object called self and it's attaching
properties or attributes to that object
right so now what we can do is create a
new instance of this object so let's do
that let's create one and call it off
this is just a variable name and make it
up we can call it whatever you want you
can call it X if you want I'm going to
call it off I'm absolutely set equal to
a new instance of this class how do we
do that
Albany's look at the class name followed
by parentheses to say we're invoking a
new instance of this class and when we
call it this way basic than what's
running is this function over here
passing in this self this instance we're
creating and attaching these different
attributes so now all of these different
attributes will be accessible on this
variable and we can demonstrate that
let's print a few of them out so first
of all also print and then it's going to
be a farmer destroyed and then first of
all we'll print out the name so we'll
say name is and then it's going to be
post dot name so HOF refers to the
variable and dot name is the attribute
let's close that off as well oops
everything's going wrong cool so now
let's print out the radius also prints
then another formatted string inside and
inside he will say radius is and then
it's gonna be hot dot radius cannot type
at the minute plus cut radius and then
we'll do another print and we'll say f
string and this cat will print out the
system or rather will print out the
gravity and we'll say the gravity is and
it's going to be soft gravity cool so
now I've printed out these three
different properties of this variable
which they all have because we created a
new instance of this class right here
and touch them so let's run this now so
it's Tyson plus you've got py that's the
file name and now we see name is HOF
radius in this number and the gravity is
five point five calls so this is working
we're attaching all of these different
attributes to this variable right here
cool we've created a new instance of
this class and the minute these are all
just properties or attributes what we
can do is attach method to this class as
well so let's do that to do that we call
outside of the init function and we just
defined only method a method that we
want to appear on the instance so I'm
going to call this orbit and again if it
takes in the self parameter which is the
instance we're creating so we have
access to that now inside this function
and what we're going to do is just
return a string here so it's going to be
a formatted string and then inside we're
going to say self name remember we have
access to self now which refers to this
instance so we can get this property
record self name and then after that
we'll say is all the things in the Hoth
system right here so we want to output
this variable so let's copy that and
paste it inside these things so now
we're returning this strings when we
call this function and this function is
now accessible on this variable right
here because we created a new instance
which inherits basically these
properties and functions okay so now
let's print out this function I'm going
to hit print and we're going to print
out tough dots orbit on the calling that
method with the parentheses right so
let's save that now and run this file
again and now we get half ear orbiting
in the hot system unless
because I made this stupid spelling
mistake okay cool so now it should say
Hoth is orbiting in the Hoth system cool
so we've attached methods and also
properties to this class which is cool
but at the minute if we create new
variables for example if we copy this
and let's just call this I don't know
planets X is a new planet then this
planet is also going to get exactly the
same properties and method right now
that's fine but what if we want to
actually passing our own information for
the name the radius the gravity the
system etc in here well we do that using
this inmates function right here and I'm
going to show you how to do that in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
