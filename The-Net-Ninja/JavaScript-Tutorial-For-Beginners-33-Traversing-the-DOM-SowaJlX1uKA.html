JavaScript for beginners are all SM very
free and in this video we're going to
start traversing the Dharma ooh wow
alright then guys so in the last video I
showed you what the document object
model was and we came across a diagram
like this on the Left which is just a
visual representation of those objects
in your document in some kind of tree
format alright that is how the DOM is
represented now
what we can do in JavaScript is a reach
in to the structure and grab any node
that we want to and then change it or
add to it or whatever we want to do to
it in JavaScript so we could reach in if
we wanted to and grab this body node and
then say hey we want to change this we
want to do something to it I'm going to
write a JavaScript kind of script that
would do that
or we could reach in grab the body and
then say hey within this body no I want
to find every h1 node
don't get me nose so we can do that also
we can traverse this Dom structure and
find any node that we want to and then
change it or do whatever we want to do
with it
in the JavaScript so that is exactly
what we're going to do now going to look
at how we reach in and grab these nodes
all right then class so I'm going to
show you three JavaScript methods by
which we can go in and grab nodes or
content and store them in variables okay
so the first one I want to show you is
the get elements by class name so we do
that by calling the method first of all
on the document object because the
document is like the root object it's
like the mother of all objects the
highest in the kind of hierarchical tree
right so we know all elements and all
classes are in the document so we'll
specify document dot get elements by
plus name so remember that's how we
write methods we do a dot right there
after the object and then we call the
method name right so we know how to call
methods we need the parentheses and then
this my friends won't be enough we need
to specify which class we want to grab
and we do that within the parentheses we
passing that parameter right
they're within quotations so let's have
a look on our webpage will right click
this title and see there we go we'll get
the content class right there the div
with a class of content so let's go back
to the console and pass in content as
the class name so we're saying hey in
the document dot go and get every
element by class name and the class name
is content right so let's press ENTER
and it's returned to us now we can see
it's in a red because of these square
brackets and it's returned to us for
different elements and all these
elements have a class of content and if
I hover over this top one we can see on
the left that div right there the second
one is right there the third one's to
fire down to see but if we hover over
now we can see it and the fourth one
will be right at the bottom there okay
so now we can't do anything to this
directly now because we've not stored
this in a variable we just called the
property method right there if we want
to do something to this we have to store
it in a variable first of all and we now
to do that which threaten far or say my
content divs equals and we'll do exactly
the same we'll copy this oops
copy paste it over there and then we're
storing this array in my content div so
if I call that now my content divs
then we get that array so now we can
call properties or methods in this on
this erm object on this variable here
that we've created and one of those
would be another way to get content and
that's the get elements by tag name so
let's take a look at this second one
right here we know that this content div
contains this title so let's have a look
at this title again so that's a h2 so
why don't we say within this content
element we want to grab the h2 element
right well we can do that so we've got
my content dibs
I remember we use the square bracket
notation to specify which one of these
we want because it's an array and we
want this one right here so that's one
because it's that's a zero
one two three
so we want this one because that's where
the title is and then within that we
want to say get elements by tag name and
then the tag name is h2 because this is
h2 that's what we want right and we're
going to store that also in a variable
we'll say var my h2 equals that
alright let's press ENTER and if we call
my h2 now we can see it's brought back
again in an array this h2 even though
there's only one element here it's still
expecting that the may be more because
we're saying get elements by tag name so
if there were two h2s within that
content div it would bring them back in
this array all right so now we could
change the content in that h2 tag
everyone we'd say my h2 and then it's in
an array still so we still have to say
zero-zero position and then we could
call a method on this we could say
something like in a HTML and don't worry
too much about this method yeah I'm
going to show you this later on and
we'll change that we'll say yo ninjas
alright and we'll press ENTER and then
if you look over here it change that
content pretty cool yet so what we've
done is we've gone in to the JavaScript
Dom and we've grabbed which element we
want and we've changed the content and
we've done that via these two methods
right here get elements by plus name
which returns all the nodes in an array
and then get elements by tag name which
returns all nodes in an array also now
there was a quicker way to get this h2
if we look here this h2 has an ID and we
can get element by ID as well so the way
we do that is by saying document got get
elements by let me go get element by ID
and then the ID that we pass it through
is page title because that's that ID
right there so if we call that we can
see now it's going to bring back that h2
exactly the same as here but notice this
it's not in an array now why is that
that's because JavaScript knows there
should only be
one ID on each document their unique so
it's not expecting anymore if you look
here it says get element by ID not
elements like here that is the
difference wherever he says get elements
it's going to bring back an array like
this where it says element is going to
bring back just one so we don't need it
in an array
all right then guys so that is how we
reach in and grab content in the next
video what we're going to do is start
getting this content and doing things
with it we're going to start changing
the content a little more so we're going
to look at things like this in an HTML
method as well as a few other things so
until then if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to drop a comment
down below I'll answer that as soon as
it can otherwise if you enjoy these
videos please share subscribe and like
