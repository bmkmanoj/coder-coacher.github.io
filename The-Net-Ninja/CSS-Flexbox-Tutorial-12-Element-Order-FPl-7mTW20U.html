twelfth flexbox tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about elements
order Wow okay then guys so I mean the
roots index dot HTML file again and I've
just made this section right here with
an ID of blocks within that we've just
got four div tags each with a class of
one two three and four and you've got
like text one two three four as well and
that looks like this in a browser now
I've got it looking like that using
these styles so the blocks section has a
display of flex that makes it a Flex
container meaning every one of these is
now a Flex elements we've give it a
margin of ten pixels all the way around
and then we've said justified content
space between so that we get this space
in between each element then the div
tags themselves have said give a flex
property of zero grow zero shrink and
100 pixels for the Flex basis which is
this initial width right here then a
padding of five pixels top and bottom
just to centralize that text from the
top to the bottom takes the line to the
censor and background of this gray color
right here okay so that's how it looks
currently now I want you to imagine if
we wanted to change the order of these
blocks so that for example the four was
first then the two then the three then
the born and just using things like
floats and positional properties it's
gonna be quite tricky right it's gonna
be quite hard you might have to write a
lot of the bulk CSS which isn't really
needed and probably not the best way to
do it yet it's probably possible but not
a great way to approach it
now flex box is really cool in that we
can change the order of these elements
right here using just one property and
that property is the order property so
currently it's set to zero each one of
them and that's the default value of
each flex elements if we don't you know
explicitly say what the order is so
they're all going to default to zero and
when they all default to the same number
then the web page is going to display
them as the source order so as they're
ordered in the source code themselves
right there one two three four but if we
were to change these then it's going to
order them differently
the way this works is that the lower the
number the first they're gonna come so
the lowest number comes first and the
highest number goes last okay so if we
change this one to a four then that
should go last okay right there if we
change it to a one even it should got
less because all the rest are zero
okay but I'm going to change this to a
three and then what I'll do is change
the two to a two so currently its first
because it's still zero so the others
but this is before these two in the
source order but if I changed this to a
2 then it's going to go there because
these are zero and then this is two so
that comes next and then this is three
the biggest number so that goes last
they never change three to one like that
then the four goes first because that's
the role the lowest number then one is
the next lowest number so that comes
second then two then three okay and we
can also use - numbers as well so if I
put something like minus three on this
instead then that's going to be counted
as lower than zero so that's going to be
coming before this one now right and
that's why sometimes you'll see people
when they've got a lot of ordering going
on and they want to make sure that
something is definitely first in the
order then they'll do something like X
minus 1000 now I don't particularly like
doing something like that because it
can't get out hand if you've got loads
of different ones that you want to come
first as you update so I like to keep
track on them
and but yeah that's why you will see
some times of people doing that so
that's how we order elegance and it's
really cool because we've not had to
change the source order at all in the
source everything is still in the same
order but just in the CSS with one
property we've changed the order of how
they're displayed and we can change the
order to whatever we want
okay then guys so that is how we odd
elements using flexbox and that is also
the last tutorial in this series so if
you have any questions then feel free to
drop those comments down below and we'll
be doing more CSS flexbox stuff in the
future
in particular I'm gonna do a PSD to HTML
responsive site using flexbox so stay
tuned for that one yeah don't forget to
share these videos guys subscribe and
I'll see you in a very next playlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
