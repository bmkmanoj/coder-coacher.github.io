very first lesson over the best we have
tutorial series on YouTube so before you
go any further you need to know a couple
of things HTML and JavaScript we're
going to use them both quite a lot in
this series so we don't know them
check out my beginner series on both the
links are down below third you need to
be unafraid of using the command-line
not proficient in using it just unafraid
I'm going to show you everything we need
to do as we go along it's all very
simple and we're going to be using it
very sparingly - cool so what is react
it is just a JavaScript framework for
creating user interfaces and we can use
it to power a full web application like
a single page web app or we can use it
just for certain parts of a website like
for a search for muscle tip now it's
component based which means that
everything we writing react is just
going to be a component pretty much it's
also very fast thanks to the virtual DOM
and we'll take a look at that later and
it was created by Facebook and in fact
to Facebook use it on a lot of their
website so I said that react was
component based and that means that most
of the things we write in react are
components so we might have a website
and on that website we have a search
component directory component a signup
component etc now we don't write the
HTML for those in the HTML file itself
or most of it we write the HTML in the
JavaScript in these different component
files now that might seem a little weird
at first but it is really good and
really flexible and if that were not
writing in JavaScript we're writing in
JSX which stands for JavaScript and XML
it allows us to combine HTML with
JavaScript ok so we're writing all of
these HTML components in our JavaScript
components then when those components
are required in the browser react it
takes them and inserts them into the Dom
okay so that is just a primer on how
react words we're going to take a deeper
look into all of this as we go along
so here's what we're going to be
learning first of all I'm going to show
you how to install react and set up a
good workflow with web app then we're
going to create a simple to-do
application looking at components props
events and much more there we'll move on
to routing and setting up different
pages on react and then finally I'm
going to introduce you to the create
react app package which can help speed
up creating a react app from scratch
alright so I'm going to be using the
node package manager in this series and
to use that we have to install nodejs on
our computer so if you head over to no
js2 org and download the current version
that's going to install NPM for you as
well
just go through the installation steps
leave everything as is and it's all
going to install fine the second thing
I'm going to use in this series and you
don't have to is CMD R or Commander
however you want to pronounce it and
this is just a command line interface
which is a lot better than the default
Windows one so it looks something like
this I just prefer okay so that's at CMD
er net I'll leave the link down below
third I'm going to use item from a text
editor I really like cotton it's a very
customizable and comes with some cool
packages and it's absolutely free so go
to item 2 IL to use that if you want to
and I'm actually going to show you a
little thing that I'm using in item it
is the theme because a lot of people ask
me what theme I use to get the text
looking like this and the theme is want
dart for UI and atom molokai for syntax
okay cool
so a quick preview of the to-do list
were going to build something like this
where we can add things buy some flowers
okay and we can also delete things so
we're going to build this simple to-do
application as we go through this series
I'm also going to show you how to set up
writing so we can have multiple
different views as well okay so there we
go that's your introduction to react in
the next video I'm going to show you how
you can work along with the course files
that are prepared for this series so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
