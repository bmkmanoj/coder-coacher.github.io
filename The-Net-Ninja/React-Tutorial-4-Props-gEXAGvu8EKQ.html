your fourth react tutorial and in this
video I want to talk about props okay so
as you can see I've already run NPM
start
so that's bundled everything together
using webpack and we can now view it in
a browser I'm at port one two three four
we specified this before as well so
we're going to talk about props in this
tutorial now what are props props are a
way for us to pass data into our
components which we want to display on
the web page so they use it because
normally when we're writing an
application we're not just going to
create components which is just static
HTML because what would be the point we
want to create components which may take
some data and output the dynamic
components if you like so the way we do
that is by using firstly props and also
state which we're going to talk about
later but first of all props so props
just stands for properties and they're
very much like HTML properties much like
you find on HTML tags such as the H ref
prop or the source property so we're
going to create our own custom property
on this component tag right here and
we're going to pass it some data so that
we can then use it within this component
so how do we do it dead simple we just
make up a property name first of all so
I'll call this message and we set that
equal to something that we're going to
pass in to this component now this is
just going to be equal to a string to
begin with so I like cheese which I very
much do so we're passing this string now
into this component and we can reference
it in this component so how do we
reference it well let's create another P
tag here first of all and we're going to
output it right here so first of all
women output in any kind of dynamic data
or variable we use curly braces like
that and we output them inside here
that's how we do it in react and then
what we do is say this to reference this
component first of all and this
component has a property on it called
props okay so this grabs all the
properties available in this
now at the minute it's just this one
message so we say props not message and
that they're my friends is a reference
to this thing here so by writing this
were actually outputting this string
okay
so let's save it and check it out in a
browser so we'll come over it and now
you'll see I like cheese on the browser
cool so let's do something a little more
complex instead of this we'll create a
variable down here and I'm going to call
this my cheese and I'm going to set it
equal to an object so it's gonna have a
name property and we'll give this a name
of camembert I think that spell Crippler
and then we'll give it any smelt factor
and the smell factor is going to be
extremely Punk all right and then
finally we'll give it a price property
and this is going to be at an hour 350
okay cool so now we want to pass this
variable into this property instead of
this thing and we can pass multiple
properties in so instead of deleting
that let's instead plus another one
through and I'm going to call this
cheese this property I'm going to set it
equal to and again when we're
referencing a variable we use these
curly braces okay so let's say my cheese
like that so we don't use these
quotation marks anymore when we were
inputting some kind of variable or
object we use the curly braces then the
name of that variable okay so now we can
access this prop in this component so
I'm going to get rid of these dudes
first of all and I'm going to do a P tag
and then strung and then I'm going to
say cheese name and I'm going to set
this equal to this to reference
component got props to reference or to
grab our properties that are available
to us so now I could reference either
message or cheese and I'm going to say
cheese and then I want a specific
property from the cheese prop which is
the name so I can say cheese name make
sense cool so let's copy that and paste
it down a couple times so we can
reference to each one of these things it
so then
say cheese smell factor and I set that
equal to this drops turkeys smell factor
and then finally we want the cheese
price and that is going to be price here
as well okay so now we've created a
variable which is an object
we've input that here using our custom
property named cheese so then we have
access to this prop within the component
we access it via this dot props then the
property name which is cheese in this
case and then we're cycling through each
of the properties on that object make
sense
okay so let's save that and check it out
in a browser again this time it's all
outputting cheese named camembert cheese
smell factor etc etc cool so that is all
work now so that's how we use props
that's how we import them into a
component like this on the component tag
and that's how we reference them from
within the component so any questions
leave them down below otherwise don't
forget to share subscribe and like and
I'm going to see you in the very next
