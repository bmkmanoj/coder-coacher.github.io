JavaScript for beginners lesson than
five and in this video we're going to
talk about google chrome developer tools
last minute while I think gang so I'm
here in Google Chrome the browser and
this is the page that I showed you
before and I'm going to show you one
more tool before we get started working
on some JavaScript code and that is the
Google developer tools in the Google
Chrome browser so to get the tools open
all you have to do is press f12 and it
brings up a tab like this aren't your
pain on your right-hand side and it
looks quite daunting at first because
there's all these different tabs and
you've got this stuff down here your
code here really not daunted and I'm
only going to show you two of the tabs
or maybe three okay the first one is
this one that it automatically opens in
and it's the elements tab this just
shows you the HTML on your page so you
can expand the different tags to see
what's in them and as you hover over
those elements it kind of shows you and
highlights you on the Left where they
are so that's really cool and then
you've got your script right at the
bottom here if I right click this test
j/s and I go down to open link in
resources panel that's going to bring me
to the resources tab and show me that
script which is right here okay so I can
see which scripts are running and I can
look at them right here in developer
tools the third tab I'm going to show
you and by far the most useful for me
when working with JavaScript is the
console tab and right here I can type in
JavaScript live in the browser so it can
test things out and also it's going to
throw up any errors that my website may
have when it comes to JavaScript okay so
for example I could throw up an alert
let's just do this alert hook and there
we go
comes up alerts up cool don't worry
about this undefined message at the
moment again it shows me errors like I
say so if I do this again and I put
alerts suck this time it comes up with a
read error and says one call syntax
error missing bracket after the argument
list okay so
how it thinks that this is a list so
let's just try doing this alert hello
just one word let's see what he says now
again on current reference error hello
is not defined and that's because I've
not got these quotation marks okay when
you do alert you have to pass in a
string this right here is not a string
because it's not got quotation marks it
thinks I'm referencing a variable called
hello and it can't find that variable
don't worry about these things too much
for now I'm going to show you all this
later I just want to show you that it's
really useful because you can view these
errors right here and if I was to put
this in my code it would show me the
line of the code right here that it's on
and then I could click this and take me
to that line of code which is really
cool
so you can debug using the the console
tools I'm going to show you one more
thing in fact before we go away you can
also do things like that
with particularly and we're going to
cover all this kind of stuff later 7-4
and it's going to return the answers to
you so it's really cool for kind of
testing things out and I'm going to show
you one more thing which is back in the
elements tab and if I go up here this
little kind of angled bracket and then
underscore and click on that then it's
going to pop up this thing right at the
bottom and that can have the console
right here in the elements tab okay so
this is really good because you can see
your HTML up here and you can work with
that via JavaScript down here in the
console I'm going to give an example I'm
going to say document dot get element by
ID and also you get this intellisense
which is really cool and then I'm going
to pass in the ID which is content
because I can see that up here so that's
really good I can look at this and write
it down here and I'm getting this ID
content and it's going to return to me
that div so don't worry about this too
much for now I just wanted to show you
how useful the console tools are when
you're practicing JavaScript so that's
about it for this lesson if you have any
questions about it whatsoever
feel free to throw those down below
answer all of those otherwise if you

guys in the next one when we're going to
start coding up some JavaScript I'll see
