second PSD to responsive website
tutorial and in this video we're just
going to dive in and start slicing up
some images in Photoshop ah okay then
gang so as you can see I've gone ahead
and opened up this PSD template in
Photoshop and I just want to show you
what we're going to be slicing which
images we need to extract from this PSD
file so we can use them in our build so
what you want to do is head down to this
slice tool right here you might need to
right-click and make sure it's slice
tool that's selected right here and not
this one or this one
okay so select that and then what you
want to do to slice something is just
click and then drag around the image
that you want to slice okay just like
that and then that little yellow border
will pop up double click it and you can
give your slicer name your image your
name and it's some specific width and
height properties if you want to tweak
those also so let's get rid of that you
can see I've already made some slices
these little blue boxes right here and
here and here and here and here they're
all the slices are made for this website
so I'm just going to go through each one
by selecting the slice select tool to
show you what the dimensions are what's
called them so if you want to just make
these slices as well we've got this one
for the logo and it's just called logo
and these are the dimensions right here
now we could use just normal text in the
HTML to make this logo but I've not got
the actual am font file for that so I'm
just going to make it any image for now
to save some time next what I've done is
this banner right here
so it's this big and it's called banner
and these are the dimensions so that's
okay these down here they are all called
icon 1 or icon 2 or icon 3 etc and
they're all 96 by 96 pixels so you might
wanna slice those as well
these thumbnails here I'll call snap one
snap two I think
yeah and then snap three and they are
all 380 by 270 then down here we've got
this little quotation mark for the block
wall area and if we double click that
you can see I've called it quotes and
these are the dimensions and then
finally down here if we zoom in in the
footer you can see these little Twitter
icons these little bays Birds I just
sliced one of them we don't need to
slice all three because we're going to
use the same one for every single tweet
and I've caught that sweet and it's 13
by 10 pixels so I've sliced that as well
now if you've opened this PSD file open
in Photoshop is where you might have
noticed some little extra icons down
here now I have removed those for the
sake of this tutorial just to save some
time we've got icons here I'm going to
show you the technique and the same
technique would be used for these things
over here but for quickness
I'm just going to do it on these things
right here and delete those ones okay so
that is it my friends that is the entire
Photoshop file slice these are all the
images we need so what you want to do
when you've done that is go to file and
save for web devices and then what we
need to do now is go through each slice
that we've made by clicking on it make
sure this is selected this icon then we
can click on them so click on the slices
and make sure you choose the right
format for each one now this is a flat
image so we're just going with PNG 8
this is the banner so I've gone with a
JPEG medium quality just to save some
file size you can see the file size down
there
that's why I've not made it high if you
put it on maximum you can see jumps up
to night 1k but medium is 12 K so it
saves a lot of file size and the quality
isn't reduced from that much so I'm just
going to hold down space to drag down
here and then click on this this is a
PNG 8 as well as is this and the other
icons and this is a jpg again medium
quality as are the other snaps you can
see the rolled JPEG medium quality and
then this quotation mark is a PNG is
just a flat image as is this tweet down
here okay PNG 8 so once you've done that
for each slice just got to save and then
what you want to do is select all slices
here because that just means it's going
to say about the images that you've
sliced and not the extra stuff that
Photoshop deems necessary for some
reason and so make sure that I selected
to all slices and then just click Save
you can see I've already done that li
save all of those images there in an
images folder okay you might be looking
at this and thinking well I've not
sliced that that is an extra little icon
that I've created for the mobile design
and we're going to cover that in the
next tutorial so go ahead and click Save
and then we are done guys so in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is we're
going to take this design right
we're going to make a new PSD and we're
going to transfer this to the new PSD to
represent or to create a mobile view so
we've got a kind of starting point on
where we need to get to for mobiles as
well so if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to throw a comment
down below otherwise that guys don't
forget to subscribe share and like and
I'll see you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
