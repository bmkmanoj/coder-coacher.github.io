fifth sass tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about mixings Wow
okay then dude so what the hell is a
mixing well and its most basic form a
mixing is a chunk of reusable CSS or
sass that we can just inject into any
element that we want so say for example
we've got different elements on our page
like a tags buttons or formalin elements
which all use a particular set of Styles
right then instead of applied all of
those Styles to each of those elements
individually what we can do is create a
mix in which creates all of those Styles
or nesting Styles right and then we can
import that mix in into whichever
elements require those Styles so it's a
bit of a time-saver and the cool thing
is we can also pass through variables or
arguments to those mix ins from these
different elements that were styling up
and that's going to possibly change the
output with those mix ins depending on
the element is calling them now that
might sound a little bit complicated now
so don't worry about that we're going to
cover passing variables to mix ins in a
later tutorial for now we're just going
to create a simple mixing right and the
mixing we're going to create is going to
tag it the banners and the content
within them so we've got two banners on
the page so we're going to create a
single mix in which is going to apply to
both of these banners right before I do
anything I want to create one more
variable I want to call this banner
heading and this is going to be a font
size and I want to get rid of that pound
sign down where that's come from and I'm
going to give this a font size of 46
pixels and that's going to be the
heading size for these things right here
when the overlay onto the ballot so
we're going to use that shortly okay so
how do we create a mixin first of all
I'm going to do a little comment to say
mix-ins right here then when we create a
mixing we first of all put the @ symbol
and the keyword mixing then we give our
mixing a name I'm just going to call
this banner because that's what we're
creating the button okay now these
buttons right here are in the HTML and
you can see the first one is right here
the lead bonnet so we're going to apply
the mixing to that
we're also going to apply the mix into
this banner down here which is the
lessons button okay and you can see
we've got some different elements nested
within each one of those so we can
target all those within this mix it so
we want this lead banner first of all to
be a hundred percent in width right we
want it to be the full width of whatever
the browser size is so we'll say width
first of all is 100 percent okay then we
want to give it a position of a relative
so that we can position things relative
to this element and the color of the
text within it is going to be white okay
cool so now what we want to do is target
the elements within the ballot itself
and we have one element with a class of
content and sorry it's Bunner - content
okay and you can see that on both
banners in this lead banner right here
you can see there by the content and
then on this one down here you can see
banner content right there within the
lessons butter cool so we're targeting
that right now and then within here what
we want to do is say position:absolute
and then from the top is going to be 50
pixels and the width is going to be 100
picks a percent like that okay so this
stuff here this is the banner content
and this stuff here this is the banner
constants and now it's going to be
positioned absolutely on to the banners
okay
next thing I want to do is target the
image within the banners and again we're
going to give those a width of 100% like
so and then I also want to target the
spun tags within those banners as well
and the spun tags are actually what
contain the text so if we have a look at
the HTML again you'll see right here we
have the sponge like so yeah and in the
top one we have the sponge like so
okay so we're targeting those elements
right now and the first thing I want to
do is say font size and we're going to
use that variable we create before which
is banner heading cool
then I want to display these tags as
block then I'm going to give them a text
transform property of uppercase if I can
spell it correctly there we go
and I want to give them a font weight of
bold like so all right so just a couple
more things I want to do the first one
is I want to style the title spun tag a
little bit differently so this one here
as a class of title right and the bottom
one down here also has a class of title
yeah so we've got subtitle title I want
to style this one slightly differently
so what I'll say is spun title and then
within that what I want to do is say the
font weight of this is going to be
normal whereas the other one is bold and
the margin bottom is going to be 30
pixels okay
so let's save that right now and you're
not going to see any changes over here
yet and that's because we've just
created this mixing we're not actually
applying this mixing anywhere on the
page yet so how do we do that well let's
go down to our Styles go down to the
bottom so far and remember this one is
the lead banner and this one is the
lessons button right so we need to apply
that mix into both of these so how do we
do that first of all we write our rule
or lead banner and then within that all
we need to say is @include that's how we
bring in a mix in and then we use the
name of the mix in like so so if we save
that now then we're going to see those
Styles applied to the lead banner
it's just grabbing all of the mixing
styles right here all this kind of stuff
yeah and it's grabbing that and dumping
it right here like so so that's why
we're seeing those Styles right there
okay one thing I want to do with this
lead banner which is a little bit
different from the other banner which is
why I'm not putting it in the mixing is
to say text aligned to the right it
looks a bit daft over her face so let's
save that I'm going to see this align
hopefully oops
when we spell it correctly that is to
the right cool that looks better
okay so now we need to apply this mixing
to the other banner down here
so the class for that is a lessons
banner and you guessed it we just need
to say @include banner like so save that
and then we should see those Styles
applied there as well now again I want
to apply a few styles to this banner
which are a bit different from the lead
banner so I'm not going to do these in
the mixing I'm going to do the within
lessons banner and the first thing I
want to do is just grab the Li tags and
then I'm just going to say text
transform uppercase like so the font
size is going to be 20 pixels and the
max width of this is going to be about
500 pixels so that's the maximum width
of each Li tag right so if it gets to
about here or something like that it's
going to drop onto the new line and then
it will give it a margin of 60 pixels
top and bottom zero left and right so
let's save that now and check out this
bad boy that looks a bit better so now
we've got both of our banners styled if
you like and we've done that using these
mixings by including them right there
and defining them up here at the top so
that is how we use mixings
any questions feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise guys I'm
going to see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
