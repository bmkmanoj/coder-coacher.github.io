14th angularjs tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about ng
submit aa whole lightning gang so this
is our application so far it started to
take shape we've got our search
functionality we've got our order by
buttons and we've got these little cross
icons which the elite ninjas from the
list now when I take this one step
further and I want to give the user the
ability to add a new ninja to the list
so the way this is going to work is by
adding a form down here with three input
fields one for the name one for the
hourly rate and one for the belt color
then we're going to have a submit button
which when clicked adds that data to a
new ninja object and puts it in this
list so first of all we need to create
that form so let's do that right under
the UL we'll say farm as normal and we
need three input fields and they're all
going to be of type equal text then
we're going to give each one a
placeholder and the first placeholder
will be name also going to attach an
engine model directory to each one
because we're going to store what we put
in each input field so let's grab this
bad boy and paste it a couple of times
down here now the second one is going to
be the belt color so we'll just put belt
for the placeholder and the first one
the third one is going to be the hourly
rate so we'll just put rate okay now we
need a submit button so input side
equals submit and then the value is
going to be add new ninja okay so let's
save that take a look so when we read
data in here and here and here then we
need to store that in a variable and we
can do that remember by using the ng
model directive we can declare an object
on variable in here and it's going to
add that to the scope object and we can
store it then when we go to pass that
data through into the controller we can
say scope dot whatever and grab that
data okay so we're going to store all
this data on an object called new ninja
so new ninja and then I want to store
the name on the name property of the
cell
Chett so we'll say no lien in journey
likewise under it I want to store this
on new ninja belt and then finally we're
going to store this one on do ninja dot
right ok so now as we add data to each
one of these fields we're storing it on
these properties right here of the new
ninja object that we've created there
and then when we pass it through to the
controller will have access to them cool
so now we need something to happen when
we click this button right here and the
way we do that is by using the ng submit
directive so we'll attach that to the
form element up here we'll say ng submit
and the way this works is as follows
when we click this angular is going to
look for this directive on the form
element and then it's going to fire
whatever we put in here so we want it to
fire a function in the controller so
we'll just say we want to fire off the
add ninja function like that ok and
we'll save it now currently this is it
defined in the controller because we've
not done it yet so nothing will happen
ok so let's go ahead and come into the
controller and say scope dot add ninja
equals a new function like that and then
within here is where we're going to add
all of that data that we've collected to
this array all right so when we're
clicking this is looking for ng submit
finding this function on the scope and
it looks for that in the controller it
finds it here add a ninja and it's going
to fire this stuff here now the way
we're going to add this data to the
array is via the push method in
JavaScript so push just take some data
and it adds it to an array so first of
all we need to get this array so we'll
copy that and we'll right dot push and
then whatever we put in the brackets
there is going to go on to this array so
we need to pass in an object because all
of these things in the array are an
object each ninja is an object so we
need to take this data that we've stored
here and turn that into a ninja object
so let's push a push through an object
so we use the curly bracket
rotation and then the first property on
these objects is the main source a name
is and we want to grab this model right
here new ninja name okay and we do that
by accessing the scope object first of
all because it's all stored on the scope
dot new ninja name make sense right next
we need the belt and again that's on the
scope new ninja let's just delete that
other pasty too soon
scope dot new ninja dot belt then we
want the rate which is on scope again
dot new ninja dot rate and then finally
we want this available property right
here now I'm assuming if we add a new
ninja that they are going to be
available so I'm just going to set this
to true right here so now we've created
our new ninja object right there we've
grabbed the data from these models here
which we took from these input fields
okay and we've added them to this object
which is very much like these objects
and then we're using the push method to
add it to this array okay so there's one
more thing I want to do it's not
absolutely necessary but you see this
rate thing right here I want to turn
that into an integer because right here
it's an integer but when we add it into
a field it's going to be stored as a
string so all I'm going to do is use
pass in that's a JavaScript function to
turn our string into an integer okay
so I'm going to save that right now and
just give this a whirl let's say OB for
the name the belt color is going to be
blue and the rate is going to be 8 so
let's add new ninja and now we get obey
80 pounds and blue belt
pretty awesome right now there's one
more thing I want to do when we add a
new ninja I am one this data to clear
out because then we can add a new ninja
without deleting this stuff again right
so let's come back in here and we need
to add in a little bit more
functionality when this function is
called
so once we've added this
ninja to the array then we want to clear
these things here and all we need to do
to do that is set these variables back
to an empty string right because then
those variables are attached to these
inputs and because it's going to bind to
these inputs right here it's going to
clear out what's inside of them so let's
come down here under the push method and
we'll say scope dot new ninja dot NAB
and instead of a percentage you probably
want to use a dollar sign and we'll set
that equal to an empty string okay
likewise we're going to do the same for
each of the other properties so I'll
paste that a couple of times and I'm
going to change this to belt finally
this one is going to be the Irate and
we'll save that and now when we add one
OB we'll come down here orange for the
color of the belt a tiff and the rates
will click add new ninja it's going to
add it and it's going to clear out these
things right here so now we can add
another one easily so let's say when
dear what a name for a ninja and the
belt is going to be I don't know we'll
say green again and give it a rate of 90
and then I'm just going to add one more
and we'll say this is Gen and the belt
is going to be blue and the rate is
going to be 25 okay
so add ninja so now we're just adding
all of these and we can delete them as
well okay but before I delete any I'll
show you this this still works on all of
them so we can order by name still going
to put them all in alphabetical order or
we can order by belt and it's putting
those in alphabetical order we can still
search for them we can say Shawn or Gen
Obi okay so we can find them that way
and we can still delete these new ones
as well that is pretty awesome right so
there we go guys that is ng submit and
how we interact with the controller
using it we have any questions feel free
to add a comment down below
otherwise guys don't forget to subscribe
share like and all that jazz and I'll
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
