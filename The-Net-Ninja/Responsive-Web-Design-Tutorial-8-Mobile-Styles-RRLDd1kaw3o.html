eighth responsive design tutorial and in
this video we're gonna start making our
mobile styles Wow Harlan guys so this is
where we left off last time we did our
first media query it's 768 pixels and
that was targeting most kind of tablets
and this is how it looked for desktop
and then when we get to that break point
at 768 pixels it looks like this okay so
we're just giving everything a little
bit more space in the navigation down
here these are bigger and more spaced
out here so now what I want to do is
start targeting and smaller devices such
as mobile phones and to do that I've
made another breakpoint down here which
is 480 pixels because I think pretty
much everything still continues to look
alright until 480 pixels let's just get
to around about there and I still think
that this looks alright they're still
just enough room up here and these are
start to look a little bit squashed now
same down here so yeah I think 480
pixels is a good breakpoint to use for
mobile devices or mobile phone devices
devices kind of say the word so yeah
we're going to start making some styles
here and the first thing you want to do
is these things around here I want to
make these full width so there's one on
each row and that's fall going down
these things down here I want to make
these full width as well so there's just
four rows of different information so
we'll do that first so we just need to
copy these two styles which targeting
these and these respectively and paste
them down here and the featured Ally I'm
going to set to about 90% width and I'm
gonna give them a margin of about 20
pixels oops not in capitals I'm gonna
give them a margin in fact I'll give
them a margin of yeah 20 pixels I'll say
and then 5 percent left and right and
that's so they take up the full hundred
percent the nice percent in width then
we've got an additional 5 percent on the
left and 5 percent on the right so
that's 100 percent in total so let's
just zoom down a little bit there we go
so that's what it looks like now for
mobile devices and as it gets smaller it
still looks alright perfect okay so the
lists down
here we'll do something similar I want
to make these about 98% in width and
that looks all right looks nice and
spacious okay cool so there's a couple
more things I want to do the first thing
is these right here now at the minute
you look squashed up and I want to make
them all kind of one after the other
going downward so don't want them left
to right like this because there's just
not enough room so to do that I'm gonna
have to find out the rule which is
currently controlling these and if we go
to these allies we can see that it's
these home menu allies and we have a
different one for the enth child which
are odd so we're just going to override
all of these let's copy that style and
paste it down here and we'll just
override all of them so we'll say float
not because currently they're being
floated left and right okay but we still
don't have 200 somewhere can we have
these little gaps here so we'll say
width it's gonna be 96% all right and
that's a bit more like it but we have
these gaps here and there's not much gap
here so what I'll do is set a margin
property of 30 pixels top and bottom
spread them out a little bit and then
I'll say 2% left and right and I'll just
put an important declaration there just
so it overrides any of your the pseudo
class rules where we're targeting a
child's and things like that okay so now
they're all even and spaced out looks a
lot better for mobiles okay so I want to
do a little trick right here for the
ballot because it's getting a little bit
of squash you can't read this a little
bit especially and even this bits
getting quite small so I want to show
you a little trick and to do that I'll
find out the rule currently control and
it's this image right here so it's main
banner image so what I want to do is
bring that down here and the first thing
I'm gonna do is set the position to be
relative and I've said to relative so
that we can offset it left and right
remember to offset an element on a page
you need to give it a position property
so I'm going to give it position
relative
so that we can do that then I'm going to
set the width of that image to 180 and
percent okay now that's going to make it
bigger which is fine but currently it's
cut off we don't want that we want to
bring this text back to the middle so
this is where we offset it right the
page is 100% in width
yeah we've set the width of the image to
be a hundred eight percent so it's gonna
be finished somewhere around here so we
need to scoot it over to the left a
little bit and I'm gonna scoot it over
by 40% so I'll say left minus 40% so
it's gonna go left 40% because 40 plus
40 is 80 and that makes up the extra 80
so it's going to centralize that image
and bring it back to the middle so what
we've done is we've made it bigger and
we've cut off a little bit of the image
from the left and the right because it's
currently gonna be like this yeah going
behind so then we've offset it with this
left property and brought it back in the
middle so we can see all the text and
the text is a little bit bigger all
right so that's all I'm gonna do for
this tutorial I mean that's the bulk of
it Dom it's good on the car out on
mobile the only thing left really to do
is this navigation here because it's
really squashed but I want to separate
that and do it in a separate lesson
because I'm going to make some
JavaScript we're gonna edit the HTML and
we're gonna make a fully fledged mobile
menu so I'll see you guys in that letter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
