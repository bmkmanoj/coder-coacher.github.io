we did was create this very simple
regular expression to match the word
ninja and we could match this multiple
times if we click down here if we type
again ninja we get it again and again
we're getting three matches that's
because we have the global flag selected
right here if we deselect that then we
just get the first match it comes across
but we do have that selected so we're
matching everything but this is not
really the full power of regular
expressions to look for single words you
can do that that's absolutely fine but
it's not the full power of regular
expressions what we'd like to do is much
patterns all the possibilities of
different things like email addresses
not one specific email address but any
number of email addresses we're looking
for that pattern if you like rather than
the specific word so imagine I wanted to
match something like this ginger as well
as ninja I want them both to be matches
well how would I go about this using a
regular expression well it's just the
first letter here that's changed in both
cases this is n this is G so they're
both in the same position but they're
just two different letters and if I want
to match them both then I can use what's
known as a character set so a character
set is a way too much different
characters in a single position so the
way I'd create that in the regular
expression is by surrounding my
character set in square brackets so like
that then inside the square brackets I'd
like to match either an end in the first
position or a G okay so now we're
getting a match on this as well as much
on ninja so this is not looking for this
and ginger like this the square brackets
means match either an M in the first
position or a G in the first position
okay so now we can match both ginger and
ninja so let's just do a couple more
examples delete that and say I wanted to
make a slightly larger character set so
for example ABC 1 2 3 now if I type any
of these then we're gonna get a match
egg we get a match B we get a match
three we get a match but if I type
something that's not in that character
sets such as e we don't get a match okay
now that could come before I don't know
three zeros now none of these match
because we have to have three zeros
after it this remember is just occupying
one space in the whole regular
expression so even though we've got a
and B down here
we're not matching the whole regular
expression because this is just the
first position so if we did a zero zero
zero that would be fine that's a match
or C zero zero zero or two zero zero
zero
but e000 wouldn't match because E is not
in that character set does that make
sense
cool so I'd like to show you one other
thing in this video and that is how to
create an exclude set so say we want to
match all characters except one or two
different characters in this first
position right so we want to match et
with one map we want to match F but we
don't want to match say L or P well what
we could do is instead of writing out
all the different ones we do want to
match write out the ones we don't want
too much and then anything else will be
included does that make sense so I can
do this by using a caret first of all
and then the letters or characters that
I don't want to match so if I don't want
to match a P then this set right here
this exclude set will match everything
except for a P in that first position so
we see these all match now if I say P
and E is going to match everything
except for P and E in that first
position and we can see now this no
longer matches if we put two we can see
this no longer matches because we're
saying everything except P E and two in
that first position okay so I hope that
makes sense and I hope you can see the
benefits of character sets before we
close out I want to give you this thing
to think about what if we want to match
every single letter in the alphabet
well we could do this a b c d e f g h i
j k l m n o p q r s t and so forth all
the way to Zed and that would work so if
we did
ABCD and then zero zero zero all the way
through to T at the minute zero zero
zero we're gonna get a match but this
right here is a bit long-winded the
character set takes up quite a lot of
room and it's prone to human error
because I'm typing out so many different
keys now fortunately when we're doing it
large character sets like this there is
an easier way to do it and that is using
ranges so I'm going to talk about ranges
