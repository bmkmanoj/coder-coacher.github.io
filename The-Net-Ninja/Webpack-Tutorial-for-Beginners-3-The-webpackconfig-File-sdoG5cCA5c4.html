third webpack tutorial and in this video
I'm going to talk about the webpack dot
config file okay so in the last tutorial
what we did was create two scripts and
then we use webpack to bundle them
together into this bundle j/s using this
command right here web pack then we
define the entry point script 1 and said
where we want to output the bundle ok
now in this file I want to create a web
pack config file which means that we
don't have to write this stuff every
time we just have to write web pack and
that's going to run it for us so all of
this configuration is going to be in a
web pack config file and we can store
all the configuration in it as well so
let's get rid of that first of all and
then what I want to do is right-click
over here and create a new file called
web pack dot config jas so this is just
a JavaScript file which is going to hold
all the configuration for web pack and
the first thing we want to do is say
module dot exports equals an object so
while the configuration is going to go
in this object right here so the first
thing I want to do is define an entry
points and remember the entry point was
the script 1 file and the reason this is
the entry point is because this is the
one requiring or the modules okay so in
this entry file we might have several
different requires it might be requiring
several different modules and bringing
them all into this file so that's why
this is the entry point ok so let's go
to our config file again
and define that entry point the way we
do it is by seeing entry and then
storing this in a string so it's dot
forward slash and then what I'm going to
do is create a source folder in a minute
so I'm going to say source and then
script - 1 is okay so let's save that a
second and I want to create a source
folder so I'll say new folder SRC and
then this is how we typically do it
would keep all of our source files in a
source folder and then we output them
all to a distribution folder when they
don't so the bundle will output to the
distribution folder so we're keeping it
all separate rather than all in one
directory alike
so let's move those scripts to the
source folder like that and in fact I'm
just going to delete this bundle because
we're going to redo it in this tutorial
so let's really know move to trash okay
cool
so there we've defined our entry point
next what we want to do is define our
output point so we'll say define output
point and similarly we need to say
output and then this time it's not a
string it's going to be an object okay
and by the way don't forget that common
air because these are just properties in
an object so in this output property we
want two other properties the first one
is going to be the path that's going to
define the path to the folder we want to
output to so that's going to be a
distribution folder so I'll call it dist
okay that's going to be the name of the
folder and we don't need to create that
folder here it's going to create it for
us automatically when we run web pack so
let's comma and do our second property
which is file name so the file name we
want to output to in this distribution
folder is going to be bundle Jas okay
cool so now we've defined our entry
point and we've defined our output point
much like we did before when we did that
web pack command so let's save this now
and this time we can just say web pack
enter and then that is going to run a
web pack for us and it's going to create
this distribution folder right here you
see and inside there we have that bundle
cool but the index.html file is not
linking to this bundle because now it's
in a different location the distribution
folder so this time let's go to index
dot HTML and say forward slash dist
forward slash bundle so now it's looking
in this folder so now we can save it
again and when it refreshes it still
works
Tempus Fugit okay so now what we've done
is created a web pack config file it's
just a JavaScript file with module that
exports in it and that's going to be an
object with all your config in it in
this tutorial all we've done is defined
our entry point where we're finding the
initial file and we're outputting the
that's it right there okay but we can do
more things in this conflict file which
we're going to do as we go along through
this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
