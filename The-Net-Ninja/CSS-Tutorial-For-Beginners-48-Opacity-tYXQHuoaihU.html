you're watching CSS for beginners lesson
48 and in this video we're gonna talk
about opacity are there so here I am
back in the code as you can see I've
changed it once again I like doing that
I've given it three divs here each with
an idea of circle circle two or the
circle three then have styled those bad
boys right up here they've all got a
width and height of 400 pixels I've
positioned them all absolute you don't
need to worry about what that means yet
I've not covered it we'll do that at a
later date I've given them all a unique
background color a border radius of 200
pixels making them into that circle
shape and I've positioned them from the
top and left by varying amounts now
don't worry about those as well I'll
cover those along with the
position:absolute property so the first
one has a color of yellow second one
pink third one blue and I'm just going
to show you what this looks like in a
browser and it looks something like that
so it's like one of those chalice you
see where things mingle and you've got
percentages all over the place so I've
just made this diagram to show you how
app acity works and we're going to
change the opacity of each of these
different circles in the code so we'll
jump back over and the way this works is
by simply passing the property name or
plastic and they run right away from
zero you can give that if you want
something to be completely transparent
or one and that will be completely
opaque so it'd be solid so if we pass
this a value of zero remember this was
the yellow one then that should be
completely transparent so let's view
this in a browser refresh there and
there we go
completely goes away it's white
underneath so it's showing the white
through the circle it's completely
transparent okay now if we change this
back to one that's completely solid and
save this then it should there we go
come back and that's because it's
completely opaque
completely solid so what if we want
something in between we don't want
something to be completely transparent
but then again we don't want it to be
fully solid either well we can do that
let's go back and have a look we can say
we want an opacity we'll come down here
to the blue circle and we'll say opacity
not 0.7 so that's not quite solid but
it's not gonna be very see-through you
can be able to see through it a little
bit but not much
so let's save that and view in a browser
and now we can see the blue is faded a
little bit and you can start to see the
yellow underneath and the pink
underneath okay so that's pretty cool
and we can do the same with the pink
element let's have a look at that we'll
come up here and say opacity not point
three and then we're saying we want Matt
to be more transparent not fully
transparent but more transparent than
this blue one which is not 0.7 so let's
again save that and view this in a
browser and cool now you can see this is
really faint you can only just see this
through the blue and you can even see
two layers deep this yellow bit right
underneath at the bottom because you've
seen through two layers okay so that's
the opacity property in a nutshell
however there are some kind of hitches
to using this and I'll show you what I
mean if I go back to this code here and
I put some text in here let's call this
hello and we'll do it in circle two as
well hello circle three hello and
they're all gonna be black
by default okay and we'll save this oops
save it and then view in a fatter now we
can see here okay they're not positioned
correctly within those circles but try
not in fact I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll go back here and I'll say
text-align:center
and then we'll copy that for each one
and then view this again
okay now the hellos are positioned
within each element and you can see this
one here is perfectly fine it's got that
value of one the circle for the opacity
so this here is not faded at all now
this one here this blue one has got an
opacity of nine point seven and not only
does it affect the background color it
also affects the text itself so if you
wanted to control just a background
opacity then that's a different property
entirely I mean if you look at this pink
one you can barely see the hello at all
it's right under there at the bottom
okay and this kind of makes it self
evident if I go to opacity one in fact
not point one for this blue one here and
then save that and view it again now you
can see this hello is barely visible at
all okay so how do we combat this well
there is a way and that's by using the
RGB color format with an additional
alpha Channel and we can do that by
coming to our background property here
auntie B and then adding an A onto the
end of it that stands for alpha and
remember alpha channels control the
opacity of an element and then we just
add a third comma here and a fourth
value for the Alpha Channel and we can
do exactly the same it runs from zero to
one and we'll say not point five or even
not point one let's get rid of this
opacity because we don't need this
anymore we're controlling it here so
we'll save that and view this in a
browser refresh and now the background
blue is not point one in opacity but
this here this text still remains very
solid and very viewable okay so that's
how we control the background color now
before we kind of say yeah use this all
the time you do need to be aware that
prior to Internet Explorer 9 so IE eight
and less this isn't fully supported so
you do need to kind of offer some kind
back up options all right I'm not going
to go into that now because that's
beyond the scope of this video but maybe
in the future videos I'll talk about
that so that is the opacity and
background opacity the rgba in a
nutshell if you have any questions about
this feel free to comment down below and
I'll answer all of those otherwise if
