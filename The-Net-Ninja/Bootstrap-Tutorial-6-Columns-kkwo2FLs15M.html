bootstrap 3 lesson 6 and in this video
we're going to talk about columns Wow
alright then so we already know that the
grid in bootstrap is split up into rows
and columns within rows okay so these
are the rows going across here and these
are the columns now we use columns to
specify how much horizontal space we
want a particular element to take up on
a row so for example all these elements
are taking up one column in which these
elements are taking off for this one a
these six this 12 etc so that's why we
use these columns now remember all
columns must be within a row so when we
make a rope first of all within Inc we
have elements and then we apply column
widths to each of those elements the way
we do that is by using bootstrap classes
and this is just an example this is what
the classes look like they all start
with Colt okay then a - then the size
this is just kind of like a substitution
but this size I'll go through in a
minute and then a - again then the
number of rows okay
so the size is the size of the viewport
which you're targeting so whether it's
small screens medium screens large
screens etc and the number is the number
of columns you want the element to span
so these are the sizes if we use XS for
the size then we're saying hey we want
to target all viewports that are less
than 768 pixels in width if we use SM
then that stats are small and we say we
want to target all viewports which are
greater than or equal to 768 pixels all
right if we use MD that's all viewports
that are greater than or equal to 992
pixels and if we use LG that's not a
large that means we're targeting all
screens they're equal to all over 1200
pixels right now the number of columns
can be any integer between 1 and 12
because that's how many columns were
given to play with in bootstrap so
here's a few examples this could be my
class on an element right and it's
called X X s12
so this means I want to target extra
small devices which is this size right
here less than 768 pixels and I'm saying
that this device psy
I want this element to be 12 columns in
which which bursar width which is the
full width of the grid or the full width
of the screen right now this example is
saying in coal MD which is medium sized
screens which is anything that's equal
to or over 992 pixels right at that kind
of Wick viewport I want these elements
of this element to occupy 6 columns in
width which is half of the grid right so
the way we want to approach this is by
thinking about mobile first and going up
with thinking okay how why do a 1 this
element of these elements of mobile and
will apply a class for it then we look
at smaller screens which is just larger
than this and we say okay how wide do we
want our elements to be on smaller
screens how many columns and width we
want for that once you've done that we
look at medium screens and we say okay
for medium screens how why do I want
each elements or how many columns don't
want each element to take up and then
finally large screens okay so that's the
way I would typically approach it going
from small to large
all right there so I've got up a simple
example right here just a simple HTML
page with some Styles and then this code
right here so I've just got a a div
which is containing everything within
1200 pixels first of all so that's going
to be the max width of everything then
I've got a fluid container using this
class then I've just got one row within
that I've got six elements right so you
can see right here and by the way this
full class is just my own class just to
give it a bit of style is such as like
the background color and water so you
can see each of these elements I've got
a class and the class II is Col MD too
so we know that that means that when we
reach a medium-sized screen which is
about 900 and active pixels I want these
to be two columns in width okay
now the six of them so 6 times 2 is 12
so that means that all beyond that one
horizontal strip yeah
so let's view this in a browser this is
what it looks like on mobile because I
said look at mobile first and currently
because they're all block level elements
they take up the full width by default
right so that all currently taking up
the full width and that's because we've
not
each that medium-sized breakpoint yet
remember if I look at the code I'm
saying at the medium-sized viewport then
apply this width of two columns right so
we're not there yet so currently they're
all taking up the full width board if
you look in this top screen top corner
right here it's going to show you the
wick doesn't make this bit bigger and
when it gets to 992 pixels which is run
about now then it's going to do oh no
it's not there it is what work is that
then so yet 992 pixels losing the plot
so when it reaches 992 pixels it's now
giving them each a width of two columns
okay and they're all in that one row now
because two columns times six is twelve
and that's how many columns we have to
play with in the bootstrap grid here so
that's fine but what if we want to
target screens like this size or maybe
even larger screens like that well we
can do and that's what the other classes
are for we can apply multiple bootstrap
column classes to each elements and
that's what I'm going to do right now so
we're saying that medium screens we do
this now I always typically start with
small screens okay so what I'm going to
do is say Col extra small right that's
the smallest screen available and I want
them to be six column width right so
let's just apply that plus to each one
so that basically means when the
viewport is extra small which is less
than 768 pixels if you remember then I
want each element to be six columns in
width so that means there'll be two in a
horizontal strip because 260 is a 12
right these all wrap and they go to the
next line so there'll be three kind of
horizontal strips of two elements and
then what we'll do is we'll say cult
small screens right and at small screens
I want these to be four columns in width
so let's copy that again
and paste it on the other ones right
here and basically what I'm saying here
is when we reach that first break point
which is at 768 pixels anything above
that or equal to it then I want these
div elements right here to take up four
columns in width so then four plus four
plus four is twelve so there'll be three
elements in each strip right and then
these wrap on to the next slide and I'll
be three elements in that strip yeah
makes sense then we've already got the
medium one right here where it's one
sorry two columns for each element and
then we could do another one the large
if we wanted to and say we want each one
to take out one column in width but I
mean we've only got six elements so that
would only take up half the screen I
tell you what we'll do we'll do this and
we'll double up the elements so just do
this and then I'll explain let's just
copy these now paste them down here so
what I'm saying now is when it gets to a
large viewport right then which is
anything 1200 pixels or over by the way
then each element takes up one column in
Wieck okay so this is the kind of
sequence it starts from the beginning
six columns in width then 4 then 2 then
1 as the screen or as the viewport gets
larger right so let's review that now in
this browser right here let's go back to
the beginning because I like to start
with the mobiles and now you can see
because if you look at the code we have
call XS which is extra small six columns
in width that is what is currently
happening right six cons in width is
half of the grid so each one is taking
up half of the grid six columns right so
if we go a little larger when we get to
the first break point which is wor 7 6 8
7 6 8 pixels I think yep there we go now
each element is for comes in width so
there's three in each strip so four four
four is 12 right because that's this
breakpoint right here now when we get to
the next one which is nine nine two
there we go each one is two columns in
width and then when we get to the next
one which is 1200 pixels there we go
each one is one climbing with all right
so that is how we assign widths or
column widths to the elements using it
once to translate the page they're not
sure why that's how we use the bootstrap
column classes to kind of divide our
content within rows okay it might be a
little bit confusing at first but once
you want to play around with this a
little bit it is simple and I've had to
do know CSS whatsoever it guys just plan
a few simple classes to these elements
and then bootstrap is doing all the
heavy lifting for me and it's making
this responsive so you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
