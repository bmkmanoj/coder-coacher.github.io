fifth html5 form styling tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you how to
can style up our select boxes okay so
our form is looking a lot better than
when we first started the final part we
need to do really or rather two parts we
need to do is this select box right here
and this button and then in the next
tutorial we're going to do the
validation bit on this so by default
browsers apply their own little styles
to these select boxes you see this
little arrow right here and this is in
Chrome in Firefox it looks different and
in Internet Explorer it looks different
now we want to strip out those styles
those default styles and make it look
the same across each browser right so
the way we do that is by using the
appearance property on our select box so
if I clear and I say select and then I
say appearance let's set that equal to
null I'm going to save this now and save
it you'll notice nothing happens and
that's because this isn't fully
supported across all browsers so what we
need to do is use a vendor prefixes for
this to work so there's four we need to
use WebKit for Chrome and Safari Moss
for MOT Cilla Firefox go for opera and
MS for Microsoft Internet Explorer so
let's fill those in so what I'm going to
do is copy this dude because I'm super
lazy and then I'm going to do - WebKit -
and then paste in that appearance not
okay so that's the vendor prefix for
WebKit then down here I'm going to do
mutts for Mozilla paste and again then
I'm going to do over opera and then
finally I'm going to do Ms for Internet
Explorer so now if I save this this has
worked it's remove that little arrow and
the padding and any other styles it
might apply to these select boxes by
default so now we can just have free
reign of how they look cool so what I'm
going to do is just enter twice come
down and leave a gap between the rest of
the styles and the first thing I want to
say is display as a block
then I'm going to give it a margin of 30
pixels top and bottom zero or left or
right and I'm going to say padding is
going to be 10 pixels to the top 50
pixels to the right and that's because
we're going to pop an image in there and
then 10 pixels to the bottom 10 pixels
to the left save that now we should see
this start to take shape so we're going
to pop our image our custom image to
show that it's a select box right there
and now that image is in the image
folder
it's called select PNG and you can
barely see is two little grey arrows one
going up and one going down so let's
apply that background image to the
select box will say background:url and
then it's in the images folder then it's
forward slice select PNG we're going to
say no-repeat so it doesn't repeat over
and over we're also going to position it
along the x coordinate 595 percent to
the right so it's going to be all the
way over here but just leave a little
gap and then we're also going to
position it vertically in the center
like so so let's save that and now we
can see that background image right
there
cool we also want to give this a
background color okay so let's say
background color and set that equal to
two to two and we'll also give it a
color the text of white instead of black
so I'll say color is FFF and let's save
that again okay cool this is start to
look a lot better now I also want to
give it those rounded corners and
thicken up the border a little bit so
first of all I'll say border radius is
going to be four pixels and then the
border itself is going to be two pixels
solid and white so let's save that and
take a look okay cool that's looking
nice now finally I want to give it a
whit so it kind of comes out and matches
the end of these so I'll say width is
going to be about two hundred and eighty
pixels save that dude and now it kind of
goes in line with these almost it's not
exact but hey ho there we go so there's
a select box styled pretty nice right so
finally let's just do this button down
here for this input with a type of
submit rather so say input
type equals submit and we're going to
star this dude up
first of all let's give it a background
and this is going to be like a reddish
color and it is B six one one one one
save that make sure it's right okay yeah
there it is cool now we will make it a
little bigger so I'll say padding is
going to be 15 pixels I'm also going to
make it a color of white and then I'm
going to give the font size of around 20
pixels I'm going to set the letter
spacing to not point 1 m/s and then I'm
going to give it a border radius as well
of 4 pixels just to make it more rounded
at the edges as well so 4 pixels or save
that's how it's looking okay looking a
lot better I want to get rid of that
white border though so I'm going to say
border is 0 I'm also going to give it a
box shadow so we get a little shadow
around the edges of this button so it
looks as though it's coming out from the
page just a little bit so I'll say box
shadow and this is really set equal to 1
pixel 3 pixel and 5 pixels and also I'm
going to use RGB a for the color of it
so we can set and it passes it so that's
zero zero zero zero point five so that's
black and then zero point five opacity
at the end so we'll save that
yep that's looking a little nicer now
and finally what I want to do is just
make it the same width of this thing
here so by the way if you don't know
much about box shadow then I'll leave a
link to my CSS for beginners tutorial
series down below I think I'd go over in
that so check it out there and then what
I'm going to do down here is say with
280 pixels
save that and then that lines up as well
cool so this is now looking a lot nicer
nice little form so in the final
tutorial what I'm going to do is show
you a little kind of validation
technique to show the user when a
particular field these two in particular
is valid and they can move on by showing
a little tick and a border around the
input field itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
