your 20th of UGS tutorial and in this
video I want to show you how to create
some components CSS okay then so far
we've created this root component right
here we've also nested this ninjas
component in it which is this thing
right here
now so far we've looked at the templates
and we've also looked at this object in
the script tag as well to control the
functionality of the component but we've
not looked at any kind of styles and
we've got this style tag down here to do
them so Styles work pretty much as you'd
expect them to work in a view j/s if we
want to start something up we just place
a selector for it inside this static tag
so for example if we want to start this
h1 we can just go down here and say h1
and give this a style let's say color
purple and if we save this now and check
it out in a browser then this should
work there we go cool purple awesome so
what if we then want to also style
something in this other component this
ninjas component which is nested inside
the root one well
imagine we had a h1 in this component as
well so let's come down here and give
this a h1 tag and we'll say list of
ninjas okay now before I do anything
else I just want to save this as is and
show you something so I'm going to say
this and try and view this in a browser
now we don't see that title why not well
if I inspect this and go to the console
we're going to see an error and that
error is going to say basically that we
need one root component or one root
element rather you can see right here
component template should contain
exactly one root element so the view GS
is looking at this and having a bit of a
putty because it's got two root elements
right here h1 and a ul and a component
needs just one room element so what we
need to do is enclose this in a div tag
like so to copy that and paste it at the
bottom and then this should work so if
we get rid of this console now we see a
list of ninjas and if i refresh then
we're no longer going to get that error
in the console let's just check it out
cool so no error alright then so
now we have our two h1 store check this
out this is also purple even though in
this component we've not declared that
style so what's happening is it's
picking up this star right here that we
added to the route component so why is
that well if we inspect this all we're
going to see is a style tag added to the
document so when we added a star to the
route component this star tag right here
was added in and it stars all the hitch
ones on the page so it's not targeting a
specific h1 we're not saying only target
this h1 in this component it's targeting
every h1 on the page so what if we want
this h1 here to be a different color
well you might think ok well we'll just
go into this component right here this
ninja star component and we'll say h1
and in here we want this h1 to have a
color of a green so if we save this now
well yeah we get green here but we also
get green here even though in this root
component we've said we want that heat
one to be a purple so what the hell is
going on well again let's just inspect
these elements and let's have a look at
the style tags at the top so like I say
all those style tags in the component do
is output a style tag to the document so
we've got one for the root component and
then one for this component right here
for the ninjas so if we open this up we
see h1 color purple and if we open this
one obviously h1 color green so again
we're not being specific in what h1 we
want to style we're just saying any h1
so this rule right here is on writing
this rule right here because it's below
it in the document therefore it's
coloring every h1 not just this one
green ok so what if we want these styles
to be component specific well we can do
that really easily all we need to do is
come to the star tag right here and if
we say ok we want this h1 color purple
just to apply to this component right
here all we need to do is say scoped on
the StarTAC and that's going to scope
this style right here just to this
component so if we press si over now and
also do the same thing
or this scope and save that come over
here we're going to need to refresh to
see this take effect so if we refresh we
can see now that's purple but I want to
show you how this is working so I'm
going to inspect this element and now
you can see this hate one right here has
this weird attribute data - V - this
number right so the same goes for this
h1 this also has a unique attribute and
notice if data - fee but this time a
different number okay so vgs is now
using these attributes here to style
these different elements so if we look
in the star tags now we can see the h1
is looking for h1 with that data
attribute this is just a normal CSS
selector we can do this to look for
attributes and it's looking for that
matter abusing any h1 with this
attribute color purple so that's what
the Scorpion is doing and the same goes
for this we've got a different attribute
for this one so it's just looking for
those hit ones in that component so when
we spoke Styles basically what happens
is in that component with UGS gives them
all this unique identify this unique
attribute and they're all the same for
that individual component and different
components have different attributes so
then we can use those attributes to
style those elements differently from
the other components and they're not
getting each other's way ok so that's
how we use styles in of UGS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
