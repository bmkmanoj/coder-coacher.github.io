sixth of UGS tutorial and in this video
I want to talk about event modifiers
okay then so in the last tutorial we had
a look at these different events and how
we listen to them using Avion so click
events double click and mousemove events
now there's these little things called
event modifiers in the UJS that allow us
to tack on additional functionality to
these event listeners right so there's a
whole list of these different modifiers
and I'm going to show you where to find
those later on I'm just going to go
through a couple of examples in this
tutorial so for the second is tutorial
let's just imagine that this button
right here where we add a year we only
want to listen for that click event once
the first time so when a user clicks on
it the first time this function fires
but thereafter it doesn't right so we
only want to listen for this event once
we can use a modifier called once to
allow that functionality and then where
we attach a modifier to an event is just
by doing a little dot full stop then say
what modifier we want to use in this
case it's once so now you Juliet is only
going to listen for this event once and
fire this function once so if we save it
now check this out in a browser if we
add a year it works if we try to add in
another year it does not because it's
just listening for that event once the
rest of work but this one only works
once right so that's the once modifier
and that's probably the most simplistic
version or example I can show you so
let's do one more say for example now we
had a link I'm going to create a link
down here and this is going to have
interests attribute equal to 80 TP we
need to be W dot the net ended up put it
okay all right and not just in the net
ninja like that now obviously when we
click on this it's going to take us to
this website right but say for example
for some reason we don't want that to
happen then what we can do is we can
come down here and say movie on and
unclick is equal to a
right instead of going to this URL we
want this function to fire so let's just
call this function click it doesn't
really matter what this is called at the
minute but let's add this function right
here
so click the equals a function and then
instead what we want this to do is alert
a message so we'll just say alert you
clicked me right so what's going to
happen take a minute if we click on this
link well let's take a look if we view
this in a browser and go down here and
click on this link then okay we get that
alert but then it's going to go to the
net ninja web site right we don't want
this to happen so the way we can do that
is by preventing the default behavior of
the link so we can tack on an event
modifier right here called prevent write
that is therefore going to prevent this
default behavior so now if we click on
this we still get the alert click OK now
we're not going to the external web site
pretty awesome right so like I said I'm
going to show you this list of different
modifiers we can use so you can find
that this URL I'm going to leave this
link down below so you can come and
check them out yourself and there's
these different ones here it's good
documentation this so feel free to
really about these right here they're
all pretty simple so there we go that is
event modifiers in the next tutorial I
want to talk about keyboard events so
for example if we have an input field
and we start typing into that input
field how do we react to those different
type of events right and how we can use
modifiers on those events as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
