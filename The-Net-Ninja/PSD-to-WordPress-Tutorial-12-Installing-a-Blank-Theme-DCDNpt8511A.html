WordPress tutorial and in this video
we're going to install a blank theme to
work with Wow okay then guys so we know
to change the theme we go to appearance
and then themes right so right here we
can add a new theme and if we do that
what it's going to do is ask you us in a
minute to upload a new theme right or if
we wanted to we could install any of
these ones that people blow to WordPress
these are themes other people are
designed and you can get premium ones or
free ones more often than not when I get
a PSD from a client then I want to start
my own theme so I want to start with a
blank template all right and to do that
we're going to install a blank theme not
one of these pre-made ones so if you
want to head over to underscores dot me
this is a neat little web tool that
enables you to create a new theme where
gives you a few different options
and it just gives you the bare minimum
that you need to get started okay so
that's what I like to do now all you
need to do is put your theme name in
here and a sites called resto so we'll
put that in if we want we can click
Advanced Options and it's going to give
you different options here I'll put
author nettinger
author URI you can put your website in
there if you want I'll just put HTTP
oops forward slash forward slash the gun
account type dingy topcoat at UK a
description anyway you can satify if you
want which to do which is to do with
sass and whatever you want to fill out
there you can do just keep it simple for
now press generate and this is going to
download your theme package right there
okay simple as so now we've done that
all you want to do is go to here and
click upload theme choose a file and
then this is the thing we just
downloaded it's a zip folder so you
don't need to unzip it you just choose
that and it's going to unzip it for you
when it installs it so click install now
and you can see unpacking installing
theme installed successfully
all right so return to the themes page
and we're going to see resto right here
but at the minute it doesn't have a
thumbnail and we're going to have a look
at that shortly for now if we just click
activate okay there we go now that is
the active theme so you remember what it
looked like before it looks something
like this right here now if I visit the
site it's going to look so much better
all right so this is what I mean by
blank theme it's not styled at all and
yet it's ugly but now we've got a blank
canvas so that we can build upon this
and build the design that we want rather
than play around with other people's
designs and styles we've just got the
bare minimum required to make this theme
okay and I just want you to to see in
the WWWF quarry where our theme has been
installed so this is the root directory
if you go into WP content then themes
you can see now Resco is a folder in
there and these are the three these
three themes right here okay so if we
open this folder these are all the files
that we're going to need to create that
theme so that's what it's downloaded for
us and that what that's what we've
installed into WordPress right so I'm
going to go through all of these
different files later on as we go on
through the course and in fact I'll
probably do a whirlwind tour of them in
a tutorial coming up very soon but first
of all what I want to do in the very
next tutorial is show you how to create
a thumbnail for this thing right here
okay so we'll do that in the next
tutorial if you have any questions about
this one feel free to drop a comment
down below otherwise guys I'll see you
in that next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
