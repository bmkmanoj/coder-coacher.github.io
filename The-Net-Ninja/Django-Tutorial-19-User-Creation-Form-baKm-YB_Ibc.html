19th Django tutorial and in this video
I'm going to introduce you to the user
creation form that comes packed with
Django alright then so now we have this
account's app set up and we also have
this signup page right here the next
step is to show the users some kind of
form so they can actually sign up to the
website now I guess what we could do is
create this HTML form from scratch in
the template and then handle all the
authentication on the server ourselves
but we really don't need it
like I said Django cool shipped with a
lot of user earth stuff that we can use
to help us out and one of those things
is a user creation form and the cool
thing about using this form that jungle
provides is that it comes with form
hints on the front end and it also
includes validation to check whether a
username already exists or if a password
is to Shore etcetera and we'll see all
this later when we see the form in
action for now let us use this user
creation form so over here in the views
file the first thing we need to do is
import this form then when we've
imported it we can create a new instance
of that form over here in the signup
review and then send that instance of
the form down to the template so we can
output it to the screen makes sense so
the way we import it is by saying from
django contrib dot off dot forms and
then we import user creation form so no
space there now we can use this thing
inside the view so I'll create a new
variable called form and set that equal
to user creation form and we'll invoke
that to create a new instance of this
form so now we have that instant stored
inside this variable we can send that
variable that form down to the template
remember the third parameter over here
is a dictionary of data we can send down
so the property name is going to be
called form but you can call this
whatever you want and that will be equal
to the farm variable we just created
right here so an instance of the form
which we're now sending down
to the template so inside the template
now what we can do is output that form
instead of hard-coding all the different
input fields ourself what we still need
is a form tag and we'll give the class
of site - form this is purely for
stylistic purposes later on when we
style the website the action and the
method we'll talk about a little bit
later on in the video for now let's just
output this form that we send down to
the template by doing our double curly
braces - output data then it's just
formed the name of the property that we
sent down okay so now we output all of
those different form fields that comes
baked into jangles authentication system
what we do still need is an input field
to submit the form a submit button
so we'll say input and the type is going
to be submit the name we don't really
need for now and the value will be sign
up okay so now we have this input field
as well we can save that and through all
this in a browser so that was a very
little work that we needed to do but now
we have this form output to the browser
just like that and we have these hints
here and we have the different fields
and yet it doesn't look great but that's
purely because we've not used any kind
of good CSS on this yet so let us just
inspect this over here this form and
have a look in dev tools I'm just going
to zoom in so we can see this a little
bit better okay and if we inspect the
form itself then we can see right here
it has an action of index dot HTML and a
method of post so first of all what does
this method of post mean well if you're
not too sure on different types of
requests in basic terms we have various
the two most common are post and get now
a get request is used to receive data
from a service so for example when you
type in a URL in the address bar and
press Enter that is a get request
because you're receiving a HTML file
from the server likewise we can use get
requests in Ajax to request information
on the fly like JSON when we use a post
request what we're typically doing
is sending data to the server and then
creating something a new record on the
server and that's the difference okay
now a get request and a post request can
both go to the same URL so for example
we can send a get request to forward
slash accounts forward slash sign up to
receive this page and we can also send a
post request to this URL to send data to
the server so in both cases whether it's
a get request or a post request in
Django's case it's going to fire up this
function so obviously if it's a post
request we want to do something
different we don't want to just send
back a new form to the browser we want
to handle that data that centers and do
something different now we're not going
to do that in this tutorial we'll do it
in the next tutorial but I just wanted
you to understand that because what we
do need to do in this tutorial is say
this action right here is going to be
equal to forward slash accounts forward
slash signup which is the same URL as
this thing right here so this is for the
get request and this is for the post
request so this action attribute is
saying okay when you click Submit over
here where do you want me to submit the
data to which URL we're saying submit it
to this URL so on the server this
function fires and it's going to receive
that data and we can detect whether this
is a post request or a get request and
then we act differently dependent on
that we'll take a look at that in the
next tutorial so I just wanted to
explain what these things mean right
here but for now what we've done is
we've created a new instance of this
user creation form and sent it down to
the signup template right here so that
we can output it to the browser and we
have that right there and this is going
to come baked with all of that kind of
authentication for us in the next
tutorial what we'll do is try receiving
the data that a user inputs into this
form inside this view right here detect
that it's a post request and do
something with that data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
