38th PGs tutorial and in this video we
are going to take a look at mix ins okay
then so what is a mixing well if you've
ever used sass before you may be
familiar with the concept it's basically
a chunk of code that we can reuse over
and over and over in different places so
a few tutorials that we created this
computed property right here called
filtered blogs and we use that computed
property to filter through this blog's
array right here to only show certain
blogs dependent on a search term right
now say we wanted this kind of
functionality in not just this component
but in a various other components as
well in our application then what we'd
be doing is we'd be using this code in
each component right now that seems like
a waste of time
ideally what we'd like to do is kind of
externalize this bit of code put it into
what's known as a mixin and then import
that mixing into each component that
needs it that functionality ok so that's
what we're going to do so first of all
let's create another component with a
right-click and go to new file and I'm
going to call this list blogs dot view
okay so this is going to be very similar
to the show blocks except this time it's
just going to list them by the title and
not this little bit of article stuff
here okay so we'll call this list blog
titles okay so if I save this and import
it into the app top view we'll just copy
this this is the route component so list
blogs and also lift blogs we need to
register it locally so we'll say listen
- blogs and this is list the blogs okay
so now we can Nestle up here which we'll
do underneath show blogs so list
- blogs okay so now if I save this for
view this in a browser and at the top we
have all blog articles this is show
blogs and then beneath that we have the
lift blogs titles component which just
lifts by the title and we
the searchbar in both right now I know
these are on the same page at the minute
but just imagine you have them on
different pages different sections of
your website and we'll see how we can do
that later on but just imagine you've
got these two different components and
they're both using this kind of filtered
blogs computed property because they're
both using it here right in a search
term if I type insult it's going to
filter those if I type in its source
here it's going to filter those ones so
they're both using that code so now
let's try and externalize that code
let's take the code out of both of those
components so we don't have to write it
twice and externalize it in a separate
file called a mixin file okay where I'm
going to keep some mixes so to do that
what I'll do first of all is create a
new folder in the source folder I'm
going to call this mix-ins and any mix
things I'll do are storing here you
don't have to do that and just like to
do that to keep it organized okay so now
we've done that I'm going to create a
new file and this is going to be called
search mix it is a JavaScript file okay
and this mixing is basically going to be
the computed property now what we're
going to be doing here is exporting an
object so to do that we need to say
export defaults and then this is just an
object and what we can do is export now
our computed properties so we do this by
saying computed looks like reward in the
component itself which is an object and
then we can put our computed properties
here so now let us go into the list
vlogs or rather show blogs where we have
this computed property defined I'm going
to cut it from that completely right and
then save it so we no longer have it in
the show box and I'm going to come to
this mixing and paste it right in there
and save that now we'll go to list box
and I'm going to take it out of here as
well because we're going to use this
mixing in both of them okay so how do we
use a mixing it well first of all we
need to import the file right here so
we'll say import and we want to import
the search mixing right so I'll say
search mix it and it's going to be frog
and then it's dot dot to go up a level
because we need to come out of the
components file folder then into the
mix-ins folder
then in /search mixing now we don't need
the J S on the end it knows it's a
JavaScript file
okay so we've imported that now and
let's also import it into the show blogs
for a file as well
so what pasted it right there now we
need to register this mixing on this
component we need to add it in so how do
we do that well pretty simply all I need
to do is come down here and I'm going to
say mix-ins and this is going to be an
array and we need to pop in which ever
mixing in this array we want to use in
this component so the mixing I want is
this thing right here search mixin so
I'm going to copy that dude and paste it
all right down here okay I'm just going
to do the one for now I'll leave your
blocks for now and we'll view this in a
browser okay so now we have lists blog
titles right here it's giving a computed
property for us and this is for list
blocks right so now this is working okay
so that works now let's import it to
this one so we'll go to show blocks and
again we've already imported it there so
let's just register the mixing by going
down to the bottom and putting in the
mixing this property this isn't a race
and we're going to pop that in save it
and now let's review this in a browser
and now the top one works as well okay
so that is what mixings are for we can
use mixings
to kind of externalise popular pieces of
code or pieces of code you're going to
be using again and again and then we can
just import them into whichever
components that we need them in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
