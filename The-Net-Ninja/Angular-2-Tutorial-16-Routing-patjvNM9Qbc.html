16th and get a2 tutorial and in this
video we're going to talk about routing
all right so currently if we type in a
different URL into our address bar such
as ford slash whole motto slash direct
without forward slash whatever you want
then we're always going to get the same
view in our browser what I was going to
get that default app component view with
the home component view and Vedic into
it and it's not going to change and
that's because no routing has been set
up in our application so ideally what we
want is if a user goes to just follow
slash then they get the home view and if
they go to follow slash directory then
get the directory review rendered in the
browser so that's what we're going to do
in this tutorial and to do it we're
going to have to take two steps first of
all we're going to create a routes file
and we're going to define all of our
routes within that file then we're going
to export them so that they can be
loaded into the main TF file where the
application is bootstrapped and then the
second step is to tell angular where to
load in our components of views when a
specific route is requested for example
if I go to Ford's large directory then
how does angular know where to load in
the directory view we need to tell you
that explicitly so we're going to do
that as well ok then so we're going to
set up two routes one for the home page
which is just full of slash and then one
for the directory which is going to be
forward slash directory now the whole
page has already got a view this home
component right here but we're going to
need a view and a component for the
directory so we're going to have to
generate one of those now you've seen me
generate a component in the past by
scene ng generate oops if I just click
down there
ng generates components I love the name
of the component but quickly and just
say GC and then the name of the
component this is like a shop core so
I'm going to call this one a directory
make sure you're in the ninja directory
and folder there press ENTER and then
this is going to spin up a new component
for us and a folder for it right there
as well there we go ok cool so now we've
got this directory
and it's got a view and a tech script
file and we're just going to delete this
spec TS file because we're not going to
use them
okay cool so now we've got that view
sorted and that component so what we
need to do is set up our routing using
those two steps
so the first step like I say was to
create a route file and we're going to
do this in the app folder so I'm going
to right click and I'm going to go to
new file I'm going to call this routes
dot sorry I'm going to call this app
route dot es ok so now we can specify
all of our routes in this file now to do
that I'm going to store them in an array
and this array is going to be a constant
so I'll say pulsed and the name of this
array is going to be app underscore
routes
this is capitals because it's a constant
and I'm going to set this equal to an
array and India rate is where we're
going to define these routes and each
route is going to be an object just like
that the first property of this object
is going to be the path and this is what
the URL is going to be so forward slash
whatever so the first one is going to be
directorate meaning the user goes to
forward slash directory and then the
second parameter is going to be the
component that loads in when a user goes
to this so the component we want to load
in when a user goes to forward slash
directory is the directory component so
if we open that up you can see it's
called directory component right there
so we'll copy that and paste it right in
there and that's fine okay so the second
one is going to be another object and
the path this time is going to be empty
which means basically they're just going
to go to forward slash okay the root
level and then the component is going to
be the whole component which is right
here so we open up that file you can see
it's called whole component reddit cool
okay so they're the only two wraps we're
going to set up in this tutorial but
right here we're using the directory
component and the home component so we
have to import those at the top of this
file so we now to do that we just say
import
and then in the curly braces what we
want to import we want to import the
directory component and that is going to
be from and then it's going to be dot
forward slash now we're currently in the
app folder so it's dot forward slash to
say the current folder then it's in the
directory folder then its forward slash
director it dot component and that's
going to grab this thing right here this
file okay so that's why we're exporting
from cool so let's copy that dude and do
the same thing for the home component
just change this to hole and this to
home as well and then finally this one
as well okay cool
home component so now we've imported
both of those as well but this isn't
enough all we've done is stored our
routes in an array what we need to do is
export those routes so that we can use
them in the main TS file where we're
going to pass them to the bootstrap
method this thing here okay so what
we'll do is come down here we'll say
export and this is going to be another
constant and it's going to be the app
route provider that we're going to call
it and this is going to be equal to an
array as well and in this array is just
going to be one method it's going to be
to provide routes method and then we're
going to pass in our route okay so this
is going to provide our ramps to angular
to use in the bootstrap method so again
we need to import this right here so
let's not provide routes this provide
router sorry okay so we need to import
this now so we'll say import provide
router from and then it's going to be
this time angular
and /or router okay cool
so now we've set up this routes file and
if you have more routes all you do is
just carry on making them or right here
but we're just going to sell those to
for now so we've created those routes
and we're exporting this constant right
here which is providing our routes to
bootstrap okay so now what we need to do
is load those routes up in the main TS
file when the application starts
otherwise they won't work so let's go to
this file
mein Gott es and the first thing that we
need to do is import this thing right
here that we just exported because we're
going to use it so let's come under here
we'll say import and we're going to
import this thing right here we just
pasted it and it's going to be from and
it's /up and it's up routes okay
I remember we don't need to put dot TS
right there it automatically works that
out for us so we can use this now in
this file and what we're going to do is
pass it through as an argument in this
bootstrap method now when this bootstrap
method is called we can pass it a second
argument here which is an array and we
can kind of put our dependencies or
services or whatever we want in here
that it's going to use when the
application loads so what we're going to
do is load in this thing right here so
we'll copy that again and paste it right
down here and now we can use those
routes in this application they're going
to get loaded up so that's the first
step taken care of we've provided our
routes in the routes file right here and
we've loaded them up when the
application starts in this bootstrap
method so now angular knows what routes
to expect and what to load in when a
certain route is requested okay but it
still doesn't know where to load those
components or views into the application
when a ramp is requested where's it
going to view where is it going to load
them okay so right now if we go into the
app component view which is the default
view which loads up right now in this
section right here we're just loading in
the home component right all the time
now we don't want to do that instead we
want to dynamically load in whatever
route or component has been requested so
I'm going to copy this dude out for now
I'll comment it out rather and then
underneath I'm going to use a different
directive and this directive is called
router
- outlet and this tells angular that we
want to load in the route of the
component that we have requested or
right here okay so now it's not always
going to load in the home component it's
going to load in whatever component
we've requested via the route so I'll
save that we need to do one more thing
so this thing right here is a directive
I remember if we use a directive we have
to tell the component itself that we're
going to use that directive right here
so what we need to do is import it and
then specify it right here to say look
you're going to expect this router
outlet so all we need to do is come up
here and we're going to say import and
then the thing we want to import is
called router on the Capitol's and then
underscore directives and that is going
to be from at angular forward slash
router and this is a bunch of directives
that includes this router outlet one we
just used okay so angular will recognize
that now so again we just need to paste
this thing down here as well let's just
put a semicolon there and paste it here
and now we can use that router outlet in
this view right here okay so now that's
all set up so that whenever we request a
certain route it's going to expect it
but there currently is a little error so
let's just have a look what that is okay
and that's just a comma that it expects
I have a feeling I know what this is
it's that thing right there I put a
semicolon I shouldn't do that because
it's in an array so that should be fine
now so we're coming over here and
refresh okay cool so this is now loading
in the home view
okay because this thing is loaded on the
whole and if we go to forward slash
directory then it should take us to the
direct review which says something like
directory works cool there it is a
directory works so now we have set up
routing we have the whole and we have
the directory so any questions leave
those down below otherwise I'm going to
see you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
