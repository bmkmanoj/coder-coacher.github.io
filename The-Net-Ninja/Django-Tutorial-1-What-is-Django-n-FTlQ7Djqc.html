best django tutorial series in the
entire universe so first things first
what is django exactly well it's a web
application framework built with Python
and a framework is basically a
collection of modules pre-written codes
help with a particular task and in
Django's case that task is building a
web app so rather than creating a full
web application from absolute scratch
ourselves using Python trying to
reinvent the wheel we can instead
harness the power of the Django
framework to help us out with things
like user authentication templating
routing and much much more so basically
my friends
Django allows us to easily create
dynamic web apps using Python now
imagine this scenario we have our client
the browser over here and we want to
make a request in this browser to a
particular profile page on a website so
we go to my app comm forward slash
profile now this website is being
powered by Django on the server so over
here on the server is where Django is
going to do all of its magic and really
help us out so Django receives this
request right here looks at it and says
okay well I know that you need to now
communicate with database to grab
information for this profile so I'll
help you do that
Django helps us with this then it
retrieves that data and says right what
do you want to do with it you want to
stick it into a hast email template no
problem I'll help with that as well
so it does that and sends that to the
browser so it helps with all of this
kind of service and magic over here and
really makes creating a web application
really simple all right then so
throughout this series we'll be using
Django to create this blog from the
ground up and along the way we're going
to learn about a lot of different things
such as user authentication to implement
some kind of login sign up system we'll
take a look at jangle farms as well lost
loads of all the different things such
as routing the jungle o RM templating
and tons more so another good reason to
use Django is because the jungle
documentation is really really good a
second turn on whenever you want to
search for for example forms it's gonna
have some
thing to do with that on the
documentation in fact loads to do with
that so you can just click on whatever
you like and it's going to give you
loads of different examples and many
tutorials almost okay so I would highly
employ you to check this out if you do
get stuck on something I'll leave the
link down below now as always I'll be
giving you all of the course files for
this series you can find them on my
github repo jungle playlist the link is
gonna be down below and I've done a
different branch for each different
lesson so if you want to see the code
for lesson 5 for example you need to
select the lesson 5 brunch and you can
find all the code inside here alright so
just a couple more things I am going to
be using item for this series it's a
really cool free text editor so I
implore you to download that as well you
can find it at item I hope I'm also
going to be using CMD R or Commander and
that is a console emulator for Windows
you don't have to use this I did because
I think it's quite cool but if you
prefer to use the default windows want
on the Mac one that's absolutely fine as
well now because Django uses Python you
will need Python installed on your
computer before you start this series
and I'd probably advise you to learn a
little bit about the Python basics
before you start this series as well so
if you want to do that you want to check
out my Python 3 tutorial for beginners
series I'm going to leave the link down
below that shows you how to install
Python along with a lot of the basics of
Python as well and that is going to give
you a good base work for the rest of
this series right here so now we've got
that out of the way let's crack on and
start creating this blog with jungle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
