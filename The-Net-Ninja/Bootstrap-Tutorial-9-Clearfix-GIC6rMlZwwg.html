net but we've got three tutorial and in
this video we're going to take a look at
how we can clay grid elements Wow all
right there so I've got a dead simple
HTML file open right here and basically
we've just got this container which is
fluid and then we've got one roll that's
all there is just one rub here and then
within that row we've got six div
elements and each one of those div
elements has a class of call XS six so
basically I'm saying starting from the
very small the extra small screen give
each one of these elements six columns
in width which is half of the grid and
that's going to extend up all the way to
large screens so it's always going to be
six columns in width all right so let's
take a look at this in a browser and
there here you go so we've got six
columns in widths it comes in width but
then something weird is happening right
here so instead of going over to the
left side again it's kind of hanging
around on the right where I don't want
it to be and that is because of this
height difference right here you see
this first held element has a slot
slightly larger height than this second
one right so essentially all of these
will be a floated left all of these
elements and when it gets to this third
one right here it's been floated left
and the furthest left it can go is here
because of this little crappy bit
jointing out if i zoom in a little bit
you're going to be able to see that
better you can see here we've got a
little bit that comes down all right so
what we essentially need to do is get
this third element so hey look I want to
clear the floats from here and start
again all right and it's going to be the
same with this element down here you can
see it does exactly the same thing again
all right so basically every odd element
so third fifth etc we're going to have
to clear the floats now we can use the
bootstrap let me just go to normal view
here we can use the bootstrap inbuilt
classes to do this which is a clear fix
class so we'll just do that first of all
so basically and we want to come down
here and we want to pop a clay fix right
here because this is the third element
so we'll do div plus and the class that
bootstrap give us gives us it's just to
clear fix all lower case like that okay
so it's just an empty div so if I save
that now and view this in a browser
again you can see now that this has gone
way over to the right but we're getting
the same thing happening right
here again we've got that difference in
height between the third and fourth
elements so when this is being floated
left the fifth one the furthest left it
can go is right here until it hits that
okay so we need to clear the float again
so let's go back to the code and just
copy this and put it under the fourth
one just before the fifth element and
save again
so let's view again this time it goes to
normal now this is fine we can use a
bootstraps play fix class whenever we
want to however if you've got a big grid
you've got a few different heights in
each different column then it's going to
be a bit laborious you're going to have
to go over and repeat itself over and
over now I don't like doing that it's
also injecting kind of HTML which isn't
really semantic into your document so
I'm not a massive fan of doing that yeah
occasionally if you need to as a last
resort I would use something like this
which is pretty cool
thought I mean I prefer to do things
another way so what I'm going to show
you now is something that's not
bootstraps kind of inbuilt method of
doing something but just something I'd
like to do I'd use CSS so I'm going to
come right up here to the style tag that
I've got and all I'm going to do is grab
each one of these thumbs like that okay
so I'll just say thumb and what we want
is a enth child so I've not kind of a
going to end child or anything like that
in this series I have going to CSS
playlist I'll leave a link to that down
below in particular there's a end child
video in there so you can check that out
under what it is it's just basically a
pseudo class so we can select a specific
child of its parent elements so
basically if I say I want the second div
right here then I can just say enter
child two because that is the second
child yeah one two of this parent but I
don't just want the second one I want
the third one I also want the fifth one
essentially I want every odd one yeah so
I can do at the child odd just like that
and it's going to grab every odd child
in that kind of list of elements and
apply these rules to them so the rule we
want is just to clear both just like
that okay so now instead of doing all
those clear fixes down here in the code
I just got one CSS rule which is going
to do it all for me so if I open this up
in a browser I can refresh you can
see right here it's absolutely fine now
we've got one two three four five six
all right perfect
so that is the bootstrap clear fix class
yep use it if you want to and a massive
fan of injecting code when it's not
necessary into the HTML but it's there
if we need it any questions feel free to
drop those down below otherwise guys
I'll see you in the next tutorial where
we're going to take a look at so empathy
in built textiles that bootstrap comes
with I'll see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
