watching responsive design lesson two
and in this video I'm just going to show
you a quick example of a responsive site
in action Wow alright then guys so I've
scoured the internet for quite a while
now and I came across what is quite
possibly here the best responsive web
site on the planet it is the net ninja
kata UK and yes it is my web site and
I'm going to use this website to show
you how a responsive site looks on
different device widths okay so how you
see it here is how it looks on a desktop
forward but if I right click and go to
inspect and by the way I mean Google
here this is a google chrome developer
tools now I've done that I have access
to these little tools right here
currently it's selected on the blue one
here which is the desktop icon I mean
and I've seen the desktop view but if I
then click this little mobile icon it's
going to show me a different view which
is in a device and the device currently
viewed is an iPad array so it's going to
show me here what it was like in an iPad
and this little circle right here you
can see this represents the finger on
the iPad so if I kind of scoot up that's
like the the finger just swiping up
alright so that's pretty cool and this
toggle button here just lets me see you
in one skip mode as well as portrait so
that's cool and we can select different
devices here so I could select iPhone
five and see the same thing alright so
that's how it looks like on that's what
it looks like rather on a different
device bought this list right here is
exhaustive it doesn't have every device
listed so what I tend to do is go to
this desktop icon again and then if I
want to see a specific width say I've
got a device which is 1000 pixels in
width you see that number right there
that number is the current weight of
this viewport here this little section
right so I can drag this along until
that number goes down to 1000 pixels
which is around about there something
like that does it have to be exact and I
can see what it looks like on a device
of that weight all right so that's
pretty cool I use this all the time when
I'm checking responsive design so I want
to show you just a couple of things
first thing is if you watch as I make
this smaller you're going to see at
certain point the website kind of clicks
and a different design shows so if you
look at companies
one two three four five yeah in a minute
the website is going to click finish
your fall and the design is going to be
slightly different just watch this
okay there it is right there that there
my friends is a breakpoint in the CSS
and that is controlled by a media query
which we're going to talk about later
but essentially we use breakpoints on
media queries to control how the content
looks at different device widths okay so
I'm saying right here if you check out
the width I'm saying at about one
thousand two hundred and sixty pixels
right I want you to show four I want you
to move this down a little bit and
various other things just so it adapts
to these screen sizes better okay so
you'll notice there's a few breakpoints
that was the first one there's the
second there's the third and there's the
fourth finally there's the fifth okay so
there's a few breakpoints going on here
which are being used to display the
content differently on different size
devices the second thing I want to show
you is the HTML now the HTML stays
exactly the same
if you check as I'm doing this he stays
exactly the same
no matter what the screen size is all
right so that's what I was saying before
in the last tutorial I said it's
important to plan in advance what device
is your websites gonna be viewed on
because then you can plan your HTML
accordingly alright so while I've done
exchanged the CSS to display these heads
to meld differently at different widths
all right I've seen some people some
developers what they will do is have a
separate set of HTML for desktop then a
separate set for say tablets and mobiles
that is bonkers never do that because a
you're taking up far too much time doing
it you know twice as long and secondly
it's going to give every SEO agent
that's a search engine optimization
agent in the whole universe nightmares
for the rest of their life because
you've duplicated the content and that
is a really bad thing in the eyes of
Google search engines and SEO agents so
don't do that
alright you want to keep you all HTML
all the same yeah you might have one or
two little things that are different and
certain elements that show on mobiles
but not desktop but for the most part
you want to keep your haste about
consistent across all devices and then
just use
CSS and breakpoints and other tools to
control the layout or the visual aspect
of it right here okay so that is an
example a quick example of a responsive
website in action the whole picture
sheds a little bit more light on why we
need to do this and how we're going to
do it in the next tutorial we're going
to start looking at the method in which
we can approach this and how we start to
make a website responsive so if you like
