seventh JavaScript and the Dom tutorial
and in this video I'm going to go
through Dom traversal from parents a
child and vice versa alright then so now
you know what nodes are and what they do
in this tutorial I want to focus on how
we can traverse from one node to another
node in the Dom so say for example I
have in my javascript file a reference
to this element node right here the book
list now from there if I wanted to I
could grab a reference to its parent
node using a property or its children
nodes so I'm going to show you how we
can do this now over in the text editor
the first thing I want to do is grab a
reference to this book list over here so
I'm going to create a new constant call
this book list and set it equal to
document dot query selector and inside
we want to pass in the book list okay so
now we have a reference to this element
and I want to traverse from there to its
parent elements first of all and there's
two different properties we can use to
do this I'm going to log both of them to
the console so I'll say console that log
and then inside I'm going to output the
parent node is and then after that
comment and were going to output the
parent node and the way we do this is we
grab the node first of all that we want
to find a parent of which is book list
and then we say tada parent node very
surprising okay so this is going to go
out and grab a reference to the parent
node of this element right here so if we
look in the console we can see that the
parent node is this div element with an
ID of wrapper and inside the element
tabs we can confirm that there's the
book list and there is the div with an
ID of wrapper that is the direct parent
of this dude right here all right so we
can also use a slightly different
property to output this and they're both
going to do pretty much exactly the same
thing so parent element instead of
parent node that is it so I'm going to
output this to the console as well and
then if we go over to the console we can
see we get it output twice so about 99
times out of 100 these two things are
going to do exactly the same thing and
return the same element now if we wanted
to we could kind of
knees together and go one up again so I
will do that I'm just gonna say dot
parent element again and what that's
gonna do is first of all find the parent
element of the book list there then find
the parent element of that and we're
grabbing a reference to that so this
time we can see that we grab the body
alright so we've gone to levels up first
to the rapper then to the body so that's
how we can traverse upwards through the
Dom using these two different properties
now let's have a look at how the
controversy downwards to children and
the behavior of this is slightly
different so what I'd like to do is
first of all log to the console all the
node children
so we'll say console block and we're
gonna log book list and then what would
the log is child nodes like so all right
so if we save this now we can see in the
console that we get this collection
right here and it's got text then h2
then text then ul then text now what is
this text off right here well if we take
a look we can see in here that we get
this kind of arrow which represents a
line break okay so whenever we get all
the child nodes it's going to return the
line breaks as well so when we have an
element first of all we have a library
to go to the next line then we have the
element node itself then a line break
then the alignment node that's what
these things are right here they're line
breaks so normally we don't really want
to grab that let's do with so we can
also get the child elements and the way
we do that is by just saying children
instead so if we save this then we can
see this time we just get the element
children and not all those text nodes as
well all right so there we've got my
friends there are some different ways we
can grab hold of the parent nodes and
the children node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
