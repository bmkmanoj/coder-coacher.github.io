in three tutorial where we're going to
take a look at how to install Python on
your computer all right there so I guess
the first thing we need to do is install
pipes in our computer so we can use it
now since I'm running Windows I'm going
to show you how to install it on windows
but if you're running on a Mac or you're
using Linux then what I'm going to do is
leave two links down below each link is
going to be a guide as to how to install
on each operating system either way it's
pretty simple I'm going to crack on with
how to install on Windows now first of
all you might not need to install Python
at all it might already be installed on
Windows so to check if you've got it
installed open up your command prompt
I'm using Commander type cleanup Tyson
then - capital v if you get this message
Python is not recognized then we need to
install it if you get a version number
back then you've got it installed okay
so for those of us who do need to
install it what you want to do is head
to python.org and then hover over
downloads and you'll see two versions
here package 3.6 and 2.7 now since this
course is all about 3.6 we're going to
download this one so click on that to
download it I've already downloaded it
it's right here on my desktop so I'm
going to double click that now to really
install it and before you click install
now what I want you to do is make sure
you've got this checkbox ticked right at
the bottom add Tyson 3.6 to path what
that is going to do is edit your path
environment variable so that you can run
Tyson from anywhere on your computer in
the command line rather than just
running it from the directory that it's
installed it ok so once you've got that
check install now and just walk through
the installation steps
all right setup was successful and not
that a distrust is or anything but let's
just check it was installed correctly so
again I'm going to type in this time
Tyson - V again and we get three point
six point one buck called so now it's
installed if you still get the same
message first of all try clicking off
this console and restarting it and type
in Python V again sometimes you need to
do that sometimes you don't
so before we start writing any piping
code I mention
in the last tutorial at Tyson was a
high-level language and that meant that
in abstracted away from machine code
which meant it was easy to read and
write programs so computers don't
automatically understand Python code the
code has to be passed through a Python
interpreter so what is this interpreter
basically it's a shell which a Python
code is going to get pumped through in
order to execute and that could add
because writing code in the shell itself
or running a whole Python file through
the shell so now if I say Python right
here what this is going to do is start
the interactive Python shell and I can
type Python code here now and it's going
to run through the Python interpreter
and execute so let me just make this a
little bit bigger first of all now if I
type something like 1 plus 2 that's a
valid Python statement I'm going to get
3 back you know 3 plus 5 I'm going to
get 8 bucks so now we can run Python
code in this shell and a way to know
that you're in the shell is these 3
little arrows right here ok so when we
take pison in the command line then it's
going to run paces 3.6 for us in the
shell and we can see that by these 3 lot
lines so we can practice python here
it's really good to practice all the
basics and we're going to be doing that
for the first few lessons of this series
but what we can also do is run whole
Python files through the interpreter as
well so first of all to exit this
interactive shell we can say ctrl Z and
then enter so now we're back out of the
shell and if we wanted to run a whole
file say we have a file within the shan
directory okay if we want to run that
file through the python interpreter we
can say pison first of all then the file
name and it's going to have a py
extension for pison so if we click enter
obviously it's not going to run anything
at the minute because this doesn't exist
but if it did if we click enter it's
going to run that python file for us now
and any feedback that was coming out
from that file will get here into the
console so there we go now we have
Python installed our computer in the
various lesson we're going to start
playing around with Python and we're
by looking at numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
