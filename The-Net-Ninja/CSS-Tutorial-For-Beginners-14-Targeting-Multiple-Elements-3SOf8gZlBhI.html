beginners lesson 14 and in this video
we're going to take a look at targeting
multiple elements in CSS alright so I'm
back here in the HTML file that we've
got I've stripped out all the CSS again
from this CSS file here and I've also
added just a couple more tags I've got
these Li tags here I've got this a tag
here and we still got the spans and the
peas now to demonstrate this lesson I
want you to think of this example this
scenario okay
you did a website for a client and this
client is really particularly says to
you hey you know what I want all the
text on my website to be the same now
what does this mean to you well it means
that you're going to have to come into
your CSS and you're going to have to
make a rule for your P tags span tags a
tags and Li tags and possibly more if
you've got different variations in your
HTML and your going to have style them
all the same okay so how would we
normally do this well we do our
selective's like this first of all P
tags and it says to you know what I want
everything colored red and I'm not just
United fan why not and I want everything
to be a font size of 14 pixels and I
want it to be a font weight of bold and
I want it to be a font family of aerial
everything on the website has to be
Arial and you know what it probably said
more but we'll stick to these four for
now now what would you do you'd have to
do this rule for every single thing so
I'll copy this paste paste paste the
thick we've got four different things
the next one is span so we're doing
identical rules for the span and the P
tag we do one for the a and we'll do one
for the Li tags okay so that should
solve it let's just take a look in the
browser and make sure they should all be
identical open this up in Google Chrome
and yeah they're all identical okay
the role red drop bold and they're all
Arial they're all the same font size so
we've got the job perfect however this
is really not a good use of your time
you've had to copy and paste
it may be that there's more toys here
that you need to style and you could
have double this amount here and then if
you want something changing not only
you're going to have to change it once
up here for the P tag you'll have to
change it for each different rule you've
done so it's going to take a long time
secondly it's going to increase the size
of your CSS file and that's bad for two
reasons the first reason is that when
you upload this to the website it's
going to take longer for the browser to
load that CSS file because it's going to
be a larger size and secondly it's going
to be harder when you come to update
things and you scrolling through it
because it's going to be much more
bigger it's going to be much longer so
this isn't the ideal way to do it if you
want everything the same the best way to
do it is this it is to target multiple
elements within one rule and that's
really easy okay all you need to do is
write one rule with all your properties
of values in it and then you can write
multiple selectors on one line now the
way we do this is by separating the
selectors with a comma so we put a
comment after the P and we also wants
puns we do a space to separate them then
a comma and then we want 8:08 X and then
we want Li tags so this here now is
targeting all of these within one CSS
rule there's four selectors separated by
comment commerce and by the way the last
one here doesn't have a comet is only a
comma when you've got another selector
and preceding it not preceding it the
opposite of that I've got that right
anyway yeah you only want a comma when
you've got another selector coming after
it so let's save this again and view
this in a browser just to make sure it's
work and yet exactly the same so I think
you'll agree that this is a much more
time efficient way of doing things
much simpler way of doing things and
it's going to reduce your CSS file size
so yeah great all around obviously if
you have any questions about this
whatsoever feel free to comment below
I'll answer all of those as soon as the
can if you like these videos if you
