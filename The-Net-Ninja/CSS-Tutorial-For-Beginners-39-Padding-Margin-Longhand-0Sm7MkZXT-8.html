yo what the hell is going on guys you're
watching CSS beginners lesson 39 and in
this video we're gonna talk about
padding and margin Akane but this time
the long hand method that's coming up
Wow
alright so in the last two videos we've
talked about padding and margin and we
mainly discovered that we could write
these within one property that's padding
and margin that was the shorthand
property now I neglected to tell you
about the longhand versions of those
properties and that's where we specify
just one particular side of the element
to apply margin or padding to and the
reason I forgot was because I very
rarely use it I normally use the
shorthand okay but I thought I'd do a
quick video to just explain what the
longhand version is so if you guys want
to do that then you can so in the last
couple of videos we talked about the
shorthand version and that was the if we
say margin and then we apply for values
one pixel to pixel three pixels four
pixels right and that would apply one
pixel margin to the top two pixels to
the right three pixels down below and
four pixels to the left
save the padding now if we wanted to
control for example just the top we
could do the longtime version for the
top which would be simply margin - top
ten pixels and we could do the same for
left margin - left
temp 20 pixels let's say for the right
margin right five pixels to save for the
bond margin bottom two pixels now after
all for you so it kind of defeats the
point you know if I was doing all four I
just do that shorthand notation where I
write four values within the margin
property however you can do this if you
like and it's exactly the same for
padding we do the same padding - top
oops
top padding - bottom padding - right
padding - left all the same okay so why
would we ever use it use it well like
say I very rarely use this but a couple
of scenarios in which our would would be
if I just wanted to apply a Margy into
one side I couldn't care less about the
margin on the other three sides I didn't
want them to have one and I just wanted
a margin top to be 10 pixels oops
ten pixels right so that's one way that
I choose it the other and more common
way would be to override pre-existing
margin on one side and to do that let's
give an example okay so these pluses
here box we've applied this border of
one pixel yeah but say we give this
another class and we'll say we'll call
this one small this second one so now
it's got a class of box and a class of
small say I wanted to override the divs
with a class of small so they've got a
different padding okay let's just give
all boxes padding of 20 pixels and all
sides
yes so anything with a class of box it's
got padding of 20 pixels now let's do
another selector let's take small and
will override that and we'll say padding
left I want to be 5 pixels okay so now
every element with a class of box is
having this padding 20 pixels applied to
the top right bottom and left but any
class that has small and saying well
override any pre-existing padding you've
got for the left with 5 pixels yeah so
the top the right and the bottom can
remain whatever they were previously but
the padding left has to be 5 pixels so
that's the more common example of when
I'd use these longhand versions so that
about covers it for this lesson it's
been really quick and if you have any
questions about it feel free to comment
down below and I'll answer all of those
as soon as possible otherwise if you
enjoy these videos please subscribe like
or share them and I'll see you guys in
the next one where we're going to take a
look at the border property I'll see you
guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
