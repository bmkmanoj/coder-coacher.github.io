third responsive design tutorial and in
this video I just want to introduce you
to the viewport Wow all right so what is
if you poor well essentially a viewport
is the size of the window you're viewing
your website on and on desktops that
size easy to see it's just the size of
your browser right and that can be the
full size of the screen or you can
shrink your browser the portion of that
browser that you're viewing the website
is in is essentially the viewport on
your desktop or mobile however it's not
so obvious for example a mobile screen
could be about 360 pixels in width but
that doesn't necessarily mean that the
viewport on the browser that you use on
that mobile is going to be 360 pixels in
width even though it seems that way like
the browser takes up the full width of
the the mobile screen it's not always
the case okay now most mobile browsers
by default have a viewport of over 800
pixels so that static and responsive
websites that were originally intended
for desktop can be viewed in full on
mobile devices all right so this has the
effect of then kind of squashing the
desktop content to fit on to the 360
pixel screen and then that's why if it
can seems really small when you're
viewing on responsive websites right so
for example Mobile Safari and that's the
browser on iPhone has a viewport about
980 pixels in width so this is the
viewport there right but the mobile
device is only about 320 pixels in width
right so if we want to view all of the
content in this viewport in this mobile
Safari app then what we have to do or
what the app does is squash all of that
content it doesn't cut any off it just
squashes it all onto the mobile device
so that everything is really small so in
order to get around this we kind of have
to override it using the meta viewport
tag I'm going to talk about that later
but for now I just want to show you an
example of this thing in action all
right guys so I'm on vennett ninja code
at UK and what I've done is just a
right-click and go to inspect element
I've got up this kind of device for you
here this is on Google Chrome Canary if
you
downloading go along with me and do the
same thing you can see at the top I've
selected iPhone 5 so this is displaying
an iPhone 5 view and you can see that
this is very much like the desktop view
if I just clicked to this tab this is a
desktop view it made it a little smaller
but this is roughly look 1252 pixels in
width okay and we're essentially getting
that view on the mobile device you can
see it's pretty much the same yet not
quite but pretty much let's just do this
a little bit more it's around about that
view there where this drops onto two
lines this looks the same as this right
except that this is tiny this is all
really small and if you're viewing this
on a mobile it won't be much good
because the links will be too small to
click or the text too small to read so
it's not a great experience on mobile so
that's what it's pretty much done the
mobile by default it's taken this
content right here so the viewport must
be I don't know 1,100 pixels in width or
something like that and it's taken it
and it squashed it into the dimensions
of the mobile phone which of these
dimensions right here at the top okay so
that is the default behavior of the
viewport on the mobile phone now no
matter what responsive CSS I've done if
we don't override that default behavior
right here of the phone to give it a
smaller viewport then it's going to look
like this now if you can see on this tab
this is what it should look like on
mobile everything is much bigger it's
laid up differently you scroll from top
to bottom and it's more accessible for
people on mobile you've got a drop down
navigation as well and the way we've
achieved this is by overriding that
default viewport so that it is now the
device width and the way we've done that
is by using the meta tag viewport if I
scoot back over to this one you can see
here I've commented that if you put a
meta tag out so it's not having an
effect we're not overriding the viewport
so we're still getting a relatively wide
view port which is squashing everything
up onto the mobile device width however
on this one right here I've got that
viewport uncommented and what I'm saying
is give this content the width of device
width now we're going to talk about this
a little bit
or in the next lesson where we start
cutting apart HTML but I just wanted to
show you an example of this viewport in
action so this is the default viewport
for a mobile phone where it's quite wide
and then it squishes the content down
and this is an example where I've
specified a specific width for the
viewport using this meta tag so that our
responsive CSS can change the design for
this kind of width
okay so we've reduced the viewports of
this width right here so now every
finished nor squashed up or anything
like that
and we've designed it so that it's
really accessible form of our users okay
so that is the viewport in action in the
next lesson we're just going to go in
and we're going to talk about this tag a
little bit more on how it can control it
so I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
