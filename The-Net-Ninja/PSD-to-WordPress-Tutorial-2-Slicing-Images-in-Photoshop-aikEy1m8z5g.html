PSD to WordPress for lesson 2 and in
this video we're going to start slicing
images in the PSD Wow alright then guys
so as you can see I've got this PSD open
that we downloaded in Photoshop what I'm
going to do is just start slicing the
images that we need so the slice tool is
right here right I just want to select
this one right here and then I'm just
going to start going around for
different images we're going to use so
that is going to be the logo just going
to call it logo right there and I just
double click that by the way to do that
the next thing is going to be the banner
this thing right here call it banner
then we're going to use this thing as an
image right here I could do this as CSS
but for the sake of this playlist I'm
going to use it as an image so I'll just
grub that right there I'll do and I'll
call that I don't know a menu head zoom
back out then I want to come down here
we can do all this in CSS let's have a
look these stars let's grab these stars
if I will just grab one does not
correctly let's have a look it's a
little bit off that will do
I'm will call a star this is you map
again what else have we got this gallery
right here I'm not going to do that I'm
going to switch that off I'm not going
to make it for this tutorial series
because the old idea of this guy's is to
show you how to create an a wordpress
theme you know I'm not going to go into
any kind of cool jQuery things with a
gallery or anything like that that's for
later tutorial series this is all about
WordPress and to be honest we don't need
that thing right here this thing here
these little images right here we will
grab because these are going to be the
links to the different blog posts that
we do so we'll have like a different
blog post for each recipe all over so
let's just call this from one
I'm going to do the same for this what
dimensions of a 230 I'll come one by 200
I'm just going to make them all the same
size it makes it a little bit easier
later on when we're kind of styling this
up so two three by 200 not do and thumb
two and thumb three 230 by 200 yep thumb
three and then finally thumb four to
thirty by 200 all right cool and I think
there's one right image we need to do
which is down here in the footer it's
just this logo right here because the
top one was black this one is white so
we'll just call this white logo like
that make sure I've got it all in within
that box okay cut a little bit off that
should do just like that I'll just check
the top one as well yeah
I've caught that off a little bit as
well so I'm going to get the slice
select tool just so I can get that one
and make it correct just like that
perfect all right there so that is all
the images I think that we need let's
just have one more check we've got the
logo at the top we've got the butter
we've got this little thing right here
we've got all of these four images we've
got a star and we've got this logo right
down at the bottom the rest we can do in
CSS which is really cool so what I'm
going to do now is just go to file and
then save for web and devices now what I
tend to normally do is select each
individual image and choose whether it's
going to be a PNG or a JPEG now this one
right here is going to be a PNG because
it's like just two colors so I'm going
to say P and g8 and that should reduce
the file size down here this was a JPEG
let's have a look you see is 2.8 and now
we're reducing it to 1.2 so it's just
going to reduce the loading times and no
it's not by much but if you do this on
every kind of image that you have then
it does add up this next one I'm going
to leave as a JPEG because
kind of like a photo that's a kind of
rule of thumb I use if it's a photo then
I leave it as a JPEG it was a logo or
something with just a few flat colors
I'll use a PNG I am going to however
change this from maximum to probably
like high something like that because
there's not much difference in quality
but it does again reduce the file size
all right so next one the menu I'll
change this to PNG again that will do
and then what we've got we've got these
images down here so each one of these
I'll just make high in quality just to
reduce the file sizes and you can see
it's not really reducing the quality of
the images that much but it does reduce
the the lower you know the the file size
again then we've got the star I'll use a
PNG for that and then finally we've got
this logo right down at the bottom which
is going to be a PNG again and hey
presto we're done so all we need to do
now is say save and then I'm just saving
this on a desktop all you want to do is
come down here and say slices all user
slices and that's just going to save up
slices that you've done if you don't do
that then it's going to say about a lot
of other slices that Photoshop deems
necessary to save as well which are
completely useless do the height of your
wish I'm not going to do that I'm just
going to click Save now and that's going
to save all of my slices on the desktop
so I'll just take a look at that it's
going to create folder called images and
then we've got all those images right
there so we're going to use these in a
theme already so that's it for this
lesson
in the next lesson what we're going to
do is start creating the HTML for this
design and so yeah don't forget to
subscribe share and like I'll see you in
that very next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
