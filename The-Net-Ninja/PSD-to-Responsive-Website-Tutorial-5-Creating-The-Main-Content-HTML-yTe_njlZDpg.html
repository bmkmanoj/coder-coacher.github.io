PSD to responsive website tutorial and
in this video we're gonna make the rest
of the HTML content Wow alright then go
so this is what we left off last time
you can see we've already done the HTML
outline the head and a bit of the body
that's the header at the top of this
section and then the banner so what
we're gonna do in this lesson is carry
on and do the rest of the content down
here and hopefully try and finish
everything else so to speed things along
what I've done is pre-written all the
code so I'm gonna start copy and paste
in over jumps to the left and I'm just
gonna talk you through it rather than
you watch me write out everything so the
first thing I want to do is copy over
in fact what I'll do I'll write this bit
it's called the main tag this is a html5
tag and I'm gonna give this a class of
wrapper and this just means it's the
main content of the website basically
okay so within that what I'm going to do
is copy and paste over this first
section so I'll talk you through this in
a second I'll make it fullscreen for now
so you can see here we've got that
wrapper and then within that we've got a
section tag and that is a html5 element
which basically just means there's a
distinct section within this and I've
given it an ID of selling points that's
these things right here okay because I
imagine negative with the selling points
of the business or the website so you've
got four of those in each one there's an
image there's a title and there's a
little blurb as well so what I've done
is I've laid these out within a ul and
given each one of these icons and text
kind of pairs a list item so each one of
those is a list item then you've got the
image at the top and conceits in the
images folder that icon one that icon
two three four etc then we've got the
title you can see is this thing right
here polenta's and then we've got the P
tag right there which is this little bit
underneath so don't know for each one of
these right here and I've used the same
text there's no needing me changing the
text to match up exactly because we're
concentrating on the design not the
content itself so that's that section
done the next thing we'd need to do is
this section right here and don't worry
about this line we're going to control
that via CSS later so the next section
is our latest works and I've already
written the code for that was
so let's copy and paste it over again
just grab that paste it in right here so
okay so we've got a title our lady's
work then we've got these three
thumbnails and a little bit about it
we've got the title there's some tags
and a paint onto each one again so again
I've laid this out in a ul and some Li
so each one of these bits here
represents an li tag okay so if I make
this fullscreen again you can see the
section again because it's a distinct
section on our website I've got an idea
of latest work then it's gonna hate to
saying our latest work which is this
thing right here then we've got an li
tag where we've got 3 Li tags within the
UL and each one of them have the image
which is one of these things at the top
then it has a h3 which is this thing
that it has a P with a class of tags
right there and that's gonna be these
the very faint so you might not be able
to see them but if i zoom in a little
bit you're gonna be able to see those
there you can see business card of
graphics on there the tags and put them
in there like that so we can start them
differently using this class then we've
got another P tag which is going to
represent this little bit of blurb
underneath as well so we have got three
of those four one two and then the third
one over there let's zoom back out here
all right and the next section we want
to do is this quote right here at the
bottom so ideally what we'd use is a
block quote because that's a ready-made
HTML tag for this kind of thing so oh by
the way you can see right here this main
has a class of wrapper just to keep
everything in a central comment I forgot
to mention that so back to the next
section which is this block wall or this
quote section right here what I'm gonna
do is pop that outside the main tag
right because it's no longer really any
main content this is really the main
content here on the page so what I'm
gonna do now is copy over this quote
code I've done and you can see it's just
a div tag with an ID of quote then
within that we've got a block quote like
that okay and the reason I've done an
extra div here is so that we can style
this background right here and then this
block quote we can style a little bit
differently in the center if we need to
okay so after that
we have got this footer so I'll copy
over the footer that I've done we're
going to use the footer tag which is a
html5 element just more semantics and
then I make this full width so you can
see properly so you can see we've got
the footer tag there then within the
footer we've got this div with a class
of wrapper again to keep everything
central because if we look at the footer
right here you can still see that it has
a central column it doesn't go right to
the sides it's still within the central
column right here so that's why we're
using the wrapper then if you look we've
got these four sections right here okay
so what I've done to represent these
sections is a ul for each one so that's
EUL this is in ul this is a URL and this
is a ul and then the sections within
those emails you see like this bit this
bit this bit this bit of this this this
or this this this they're represented by
Li tax okay so in the first Li tag I've
got a hedge for because they're styled
differently these are like mini titles
you can see there let me zoom in see at
the top they have these little titles
get InTouch
twitter popular posts and about to us so
they are the hate for tax at the first
li okay then underneath that I've just
copied out all this text and then the
address in each different Li tag as well
each different life you address then the
second ul you can see I've got the H for
popular posts sorry if the second ul is
this one here Twitter okay
and then what I've done is given each Li
tag one of these a class of TW which
stands for tweet or Twitter or what if
you want to call it and the reason I'm
giving that class is so that we can
style it up like this and give it that
icon of the bird on the left so just
copied and pasted the tweaks in those Li
tags then the next one is a hate for
again for popular posts then I've just
pop made three of the same one I think
it's the top one here and duplicated it
like that in different Li tags and what
I've done is just made a little beer be
our target right there within each Li
for the date you can see there's a date
underneath each one so that comes after
the BR tag then finally if we move along
to the right you can see there's a
little about what section on the right
so that's the last ul and they're going
to hate for saying about us
we've just got to Li text to represent
each one of these little paragraphs
right here so copied and pasted that in
there alright so underneath that little
section we've got this line and then if
we go over to the left you can see
there's a little copyright message right
there so what I've done is just create
within the photo again a div with an
idea of copyright then I've done the
little code for the copyright symbol so
that's going to produce this little C
here it was zoom in you'll be able to
see that better
see that little copyright symbol that's
going to produce it there so it's an
ampersand then copy then a semicolon
then I've just written out the same here
over here oh yeah I've just changed the
date so then have ended the wrapper div
which is there and then it closed out
the footer as well okay
so that is pretty much it for the HTML
the reason I have kind of moved quite
swiftly in this tutorial is because I've
already done a PSD to HTML CSS tutorial
series on the past and I don't really
want to focus too much on writing HTML
code you know you should already be
quite comfortable with that but I think
want to outline how I've done it so you
can see I've done all the HTML first and
the idea is that the HTML is not going
to change for the desktop to the mobile
so if we look at these details you can
see let me zoom out a little bit this
content the HTML F dot is gonna
represent all this content but it's also
gonna represent in the same way all of
this content so what we need to do is
write our CSS and media queries to
change the display of that HTML for
mobiles and for different sized devices
in between okay so you can see that's
why I've written all my HTML first
regardless of what CSS or what devices
we're going to be building on I've
written it in such a way that is going
to be able to adapt to whatever via the
CSS okay so and I'll move quickly if you
want to kind of just pause and look at
yourself feel free or maybe just pop
back to the PSD to HTML playlist that I
did where I go a little bit more slowly
if you want to learn more about how to
construct a HTML page if you have any
questions whatsoever feel free to leave
