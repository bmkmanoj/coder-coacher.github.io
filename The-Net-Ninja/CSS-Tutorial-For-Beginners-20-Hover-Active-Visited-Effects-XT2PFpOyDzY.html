CSS beginners lesson 20 and in this
lesson we're going to take a look at the
hover visited and active pseudo classes
that's coming up Wow okay so just a
quick recap first of all we said that
pseudo classes are an extension to
normal CSS they come after the normal
CSS selectors and we use them to target
more specific things okay and they split
up into two groups generally speaking
that is the behavioral group which is to
do with user interactivity on your web
page and the structural group which is
to target kind of advanced structural
elements now the syntax is here you have
your normal selector then your colon and
then the keyword of your pseudo class
then your declaration okay then so now
we've covered that I want to jump into
the code and play around with a few of
these behavioral pseudo classes Wow all
right guys here I am back in the HTML
and I'm going to teach you probably
three of the most popular behavioral
pseudo classes okay and they're all
stupid links we're going to look at what
happens when a link is hovered over by
your mouse when it's clicked in its
active state and when it's been visited
okay so the first one we'll look at is
the hover effect so first of all to look
at our link we're going to select all of
the link tags the a tags
okay so that's how a link selector and
then we're going to add our first pseudo
class which is the hover pseudo-class so
we do our Kolob then the hover keyword
that's the keyword hover okay
so we're seeing here we want to stay all
these egg tags when the hovered in this
way so I'm going to give them a color of
red okay so when you hover over a link
it's short term red now the second one
we're going to do is the active State
okay and then the active State is when
you click on the link itself when you
click down on your button on your mouse
for that moment before you go to the new
web page that link is active so we're
going to change the color of it for that
moment okay so the way we do that is by
applying our pseudo class to the a tag
again and the keyword this time is
active self-explanatory really simple
guys and we're going to color it Orange
okay and then the third one we're going
to do is the visited pseudo class or SEM
again targeting all the A's and the
keyword is visited now the way this
works is if you have a link on your web
page and say by default is called blue
or you stand it blue initially if it
user clicks on that link they have now
visited that link so if they come back
to the page that link will now display
differently okay
so we'll give this a color of purple so
that's it really simple we've got three
keywords here hover active and visited
they're probably going to be the ones
you use most when it comes to links and
yeah all really simple so when it's
hovered over it turns red when it's
active it's orange and when it's visited
it's purple so let's view this in a
browser now save that and open this up
in chrome okay so here's our links now
I've already used I have wholly
demonstrated this which is why this is
purple okay so initially it's a blue
then you hover over it turns red okay
then you click it oops click it you can
see it's orange okay and then after that
when you visited it it goes purple okay
then so that about covers it
you've got your three keywords here
hover active and visited really popular
ons dead simple we just apply the pseudo
class keywords after the colon and we've
styled those three events all right so
that about covers it for this lesson if
you have any questions whatsoever about
these pseudo classes these three ones
here feel free to drop a comment below
and I'll try my best to answer that as
soon as possible otherwise if you enjoy
these videos please subscribe like share
them and I'll see you guys in the next
video where we're going to look at some
more pseudo classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
