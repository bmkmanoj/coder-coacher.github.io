29th nodejs tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about query strings
alright and so what is a query string
exactly well it's just additional data
added onto a HTTP request in the form of
name value pairs and we often see this
with patron ation of blogs of some kind
where we say we want to see all the blog
posts for example from the news category
so this is the URL here for slash blog
forward slash news and then we've got
this query string right here which
starts with the question mark and we're
saying that the page is equal to 2 so
the second page of news items in the
blog right so this name value pair page
equals 2 is what is attached to this get
request so the way we construct a query
string is just by tacking on a question
mark after the initial URL and then add
in our name value pairs separated by
ampersands if there's more than one of
them
so we could make a request like this
mysite.com forward slash contact then
the start of the query string has the
question mark then we've got a name
value pairs person equals ryu then we
add another name value pair by first
same ampersand so and the department or
depth equals marketing and we can do as
many of those attach to each other as we
want by just adding on these ampersands
after each one but we always begin it
with a question mark like that ok so say
we make a request like that we pass on
this additional information and which we
want to use and what we need to do is
pass that request and pull out this data
so that we can use it within our
application code so let's look at an
example
all right there so let's imagine that
when we go to the contact URL that we've
set up a route for in previous tutorials
we could send along some extra data in
the form of a query string such as the
person we want to contact or the
department we want to contact right so
say for example we do something like
this I'm just going to come to a browser
so forward slash contact and then we
create a query string where we saying
Department equals MA
kitten and person equals joke so we've
seen here okay with sending along this
extra information we want to contact the
marketing department and Joe okay so how
do we handle that well in nodejs when we
use Express the request object does all
of this passing for us so it makes it
really simple to access this data so all
we have to do is use the query property
on this request object so for example
what I could do right here oops not on
this one on contact I could say
console.log and then request query okay
so this is an inbuilt property when we
use Express that we can access and it's
going to access what data is on the
query string so if I save this now and
I'm going to run it by saying no daman
app Jas now if I go to this right here
and press Enter so I'm passing along
this query string where depth equals
marketing and personal cost Joe so if I
click enter now then we're going to see
right here this object is logged down
here to the console so Department is
marketing and person is Joe
so Express has done all that for us is
passed this data and it's given us
access to it on this query property of
the request object so it's really easy
for us now to access this query string
data so see we want to do something else
with this data we want to pass it into
the view well we already know from
previous tutorials that we can pass data
to the view by just adding in an object
here in the render method so I could
pass through this query data right here
in the render method so let's cut that
from here and in fact let's just to
leave that altogether and pass it
through as an object right here so I'll
say the query string that's going to be
the name of my property in this object
and I'm going to paste that in and it's
going to be equal to with the request
query
okay so we're passing in any data that
we add into the query string through now
to the contact view okay so let's go to
the con
view and you're going to notice down
here I've added in a form I'm going to
go through that in a second but to begin
with let's just output that query data
in this view so let's come down here at
a P tag and we know how to output data
using ejs templates we covered that in a
previous tutorial it's the open angle
bracket percentage equals and then just
whatever the name of the object is or
value is that we want to help port now
we set along this object right here and
the property name is query string so now
I'm just going to output like a query
string object yeah and dot DEP T because
that's the department value on this
query string remember when we output
this to the console right here we had
two properties the department and the
person so I'm going to output the
department property okay makes sense so
let's close that off right now save it
I'm going to restart the server over
here just by saying RS and then go to a
browser and refresh this and now you can
see we've output this marketing value
right here because we accessed the
department property on the query string
object right there the DES property
there okay and we could do it with the
other one person if we wanted to I'll
just type in there person save it and
I'm going to come and restart the server
RS and hit refresh over here and this
time the person is output which is Joe
alright so let us now take a look at
this form a more useful kind of way to
use these query strings so I've deleted
that initial P tagger just popped in
right there and I'm going to uncomment
this form and this is just a really
simple form you can see it's got an ID
of contact form then we've got a label
for each input type so the four is equal
to whom and that matches up to the who
input type of text right so that's here
we wanna contact then we've got a label
for the department which Department and
this is the input for it then we've got
a label for the email your email and
and import for as well and then finally
the submit ball we're not going to look
at submitting this farm in this tutorial
just kind of pre-populating this form
with the data we can get from the query
string okay
so let's save this and say for example
we go to this URL with this query string
right here so we're passing along the
Department we want to contact and the
person we want to contact right so say
we go there let's just restart server to
catch those changes and refresh okay so
we've got this fall now if we add in
this query string right here with
whatever information for the Department
and the person I want it to pre populate
these form fields so that the user
doesn't have to do it okay so how can I
do that well I can access that data from
the query string in this template right
here so all I need to do is come to the
input fields right here and then set a
value equal to that data I remember it's
on the query string object but before we
do that we need to use our ejs tags
which is an open angle bracket
percentage equals then it's the q:s
object which we pass through dots and
this first one is who the name of whom
you want to contact so that is person so
let's close off those ejs tags as well
and do the same thing down here and sets
the value instead of a veil okay so
let's do the same thing here and this
time value is the EPT Department so
let's save that restart the server and
come to a browser and this time when we
refresh it's going to grab that data and
pre populate the farm for us because we
set this data equal to the value of
these form fields right pretty cool so
now if we change this data I'm going to
change this to Rio I'm going to change
the department to IT like so press Enter
this time we get Ryu IT so it's
pre-populating all those for your tours
and just imagine we had say a team page
on our website where it's the team of
all the people in the company and they
might have say and
one of each person say ten people and
when you click on the icon it goes to
the contact us page and it prepopulates
these fields for words based on who
we've clicked because you pass through a
query string as well pretty cool right
so that is query strings and how we
access the data from them in the next
tutorial we're going to be looking at
post data so submitting this form and
how we can handle that in nodejs but for
now if you've got any questions feel
free to ask those down below otherwise
