have this area at the top where we will
be declaring all of our variables now I
always like to declare my variables at
the top you don't need to but I think it
makes it clearer that way and I know
where to find them if I ever need to
change them in the future so like I said
variables are declared using CSS custom
properties and they look like regular
CSS properties like margin of font
family except in front of them they have
the double dash right and you can see
them change color in my editor now that
says that this is a custom property of
variable now like normal CSS properties
we have to declare our variables our
custom properties inside a selector so
all of these things here the body or
this thing these are selectors and these
CSS properties are declared inside those
selectors the same is true for variables
so I can't just make a variable at the
top and call this you know my var and
then set it to something this is not
going to work it has to be declared
inside a selector so for example we
could say body and then declared the
variable inside here and that means that
everything inside the body tag inside
this document would have access to that
variable okay now if this was header for
example and we declared our variables
inside this selector then all the
elements inside the header right here
would have access to that variable so
they can be scoped now what I like to do
to give access to my variables inside
the whole document so that any element
can use them is use the route
pseudo-class so that is :
and then routes and this refers to 99
times out of 100 the HTML tag the root
element inside your document so now if
we declare our variables here it means
that those variables can be used inside
the entire document so any other
selector essentially can use those
variables okay does that make sense
cool so I'd like to declare two
variables inside this root selector the
first variable is going to be the theme
color and the theme color is this blue
right here for the banner and also these
h2
right here so I'm gonna have one
variable which controls the color of
those and another variable which
controls the color of the links on the
page so these things which is a brown
and yellow color horrible color don't
know why I've used it but hey ho and
these things at the top as well they use
that color as well so we'll declare
those two variables inside this root
selector so remember double - first of
all then the name of our variable the
first one is going to be called theme -
color you can call it whatever you want
and it's going to be set equal to a hex
code now that hex code is gonna equal
this color and this color so let's find
it in the document first of all so the
banner right here that is the big blue
thing on the page so let's grab that and
paste it up here and save it now if we
want to use this variable inside another
selector for example this thing down
here this banner we want it to be that
color right all we need to do instead of
applying the hex code there is say hey
we want to use this variable for the
color right here so the way we say we
want to use it is by saying var then in
parentheses the name of the custom
property of the variable now it's double
- don't forget that then theme - color
in our case so let's save that and
refresh over here hopefully it shouldn't
change and it doesn't because we're
still using this blue color but instead
of directly adding that hex right here
which is referencing the variable theme
color which is that hex code okay so
another thing that uses that color is
these h2s
right here so let's find those in the
CSS and change it so it uses the
variable like this so if we go down we
can see spot h2 is using that hex code
as well let's delete that and use var
and then - - theme - color and if we
save this should also not do anything it
shouldn't change because we're still
using that color again but we're using
it via the variable okay make sense all
right so the next thing I wanted to
create a variable for was the links on
the page so these here and also the nav
links so let's create a variable at the
top inside the root
select it again and this time we'll call
it link - color and that color is going
to be equal to that Brown a horrible
color which is inside the navigation at
the top so let's grab that from there
and paste it at the top right here now
I'm just gonna save it and refresh over
here because now even though we've
declared this variable we're not using
it down here yet we've stripped it so I
just want to show you that if we refresh
that color is currently stripped right
here we're not applying a color to it
yet but once we've added the variable
reference right here var then in
parentheses double dash and then it was
link color save that when we refresh now
we get that brown a yellow back awesome
so let's do the same thing for these
links down here if we scroll down they
should be inside the content somewhere
all the spots content egg this is the
one so let's delete that hex from there
and instead use var then double - link -
color save that and if we refresh
hopefully nothing changes because it's
still using that color via the variable
alright awesome so that's cool we've
declared our variables and we've used
them but we've not really saved any time
yet the power of variables comes when we
want to change the colors on the margin
or the different properties on the page
so if I want to change the theme color
now instead of changing that theme color
in two different places and it might be
ten different places on a larger website
I can just change it in one place inside
the very bold declaration right here so
I could say instead of using this color
blue I'm going to use pink and if we
save that now and refresh you can see
update in both of these two places
because they're still both just
referencing this theme color variable we
don't need to change it down there and
we just change it here right so when
they reference it it's updating with
pink awesome let's do the same for the
link color so let's say instead of this
brown the color will use hash 333 which
is like a charcoal gray refresh over
here and hopefully they should update
the links all over the page as well
awesome so that is the power of CSS
variables it makes it much easier going
forward when you're updating your web
site so there we go that's how we
declare them and how we use them inside
the document in the next tutorial what
I'll be doing is going over some of the
things that CSS variables can do some of
the benefits of it over things like sass
and less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
