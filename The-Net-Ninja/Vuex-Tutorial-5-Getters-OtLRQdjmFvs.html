UX tutorial and in this video we're
going to talk about Gettys all right
there so to explain the concept of
getters I want to just run through a
quick example so say we have some kind
of super sale week on this awesome shop
website over here and we want to display
our prices differently maybe even slash
them in half so instead of 40 pounds is
20 pounds etc so I suppose what we could
do is come down here and create a new
computed property which is going to
change the data in some way shape or
form and output it differently makes
sense so let's do that first of all I'm
in product list to it the minute let's
go into product list 1 and create a new
computed property and this right here is
going to be called sale products ok so
sale products like so and inside this
computed property what do we want to do
well first of all I want to create a new
set of data which is going to be half of
the current data now I don't want to
edit the data directly so what I'm going
to do is create a new variable first of
all inside here called sales to products
and I'm going to set this equal to this
dot store alright dot state dot products
so accessing the data first of all then
what we're going to do is use the map
method on those and what that's going to
do is take this original products array
right here and it's going to map it to a
new array and perform some kind of
functionality on the data as it maps it
through so we can slice the prices by
half each iteration round as we cycle
through the products make sense ok so
this point you'll wreck it takes a
callback function now I'm going to use
an es6 fat arrow function to do this so
to do that I'm going to say product
first of all that's the single product
we get each time around as we map
through this array okay so it's going to
refer to the individual product item
each time around we use the fat arrow
and then we have the function so inside
here we need to return something right
we need to return a new value which is
going to be mapped to the new array so
we're returning an object because
remember each of these
notes is an object in this array right
every product is an object which has a
name attribute and also a price
attribute so we need to return an object
each time around which we're going to
output in this new array so each object
is going to have a name property and
it's also going to have a price property
okay so the main first of all well
currently the name is something like
this shiny star red shells etc so what I
want to do is add asterisks on each side
of the names so I'm going to set the
name equal to string double asterisks
and then we're going to concatenate the
products name so whatever the current
product name is we're accessing that
product there remember then we want to
output the name and then we want to
output as well
two more asterisks on the other side of
it okay so these are just like flashy
bobs to say look this item is on sale
cool so that's the name salted now for
the price we want to output half of the
price so we're going to say the new
price is the product price the current
price that is on this product being
passed through then we want to divide it
by two okay so that is the new object
we're going to output to this array for
each product so now we've returned that
and we have that new array stored right
here in sale products so what we're
going to do now is return this array so
we'll return sale products like so okay
so now what we can do is cycle through
sale products right here instead of the
normal products and then we're going to
output the new sale product name and the
new sale product price so let's do that
will cycle through sale products like so
save it now if we come over here we can
see the new price is now half of what it
was you can see 10 over here instead of
20 and these Asterix are on either side
of the product name cool so we have this
computed property for sale products but
we don't just want to show it in one
section of the website we can't have
inconsistency where we're saying one
thing is 20 pounds here and 40 pounds
somewhere else on the website that's
just not professional right so what we
need to do
add this to the other component as well
so I'm going to grab it all and I'm
going to go to product list two and I'm
going to add it in right here and as
well we're going to cycle through sale
products here so if I save this now we
should see the sale products output
there as well as here cool so this is
alright works well imagine this scenario
imagine we have maybe ten different
components and we had this computed
property on all of those ten different
components and then one day the manager
of the company comes to you and says
actually you know what half price is too
much I want you to change it to 75% off
and also get rid of those asterisks and
just make it red or something set right
so essentially what you're then going to
have to do is go through each different
component to each one of these computed
properties and you're going to have to
update the whole damn thing each time
around okay so that's ten times doing
the work not exactly the most efficient
way to do things so instead what we can
do is we can store this kind of
calculation right here as a getter on
the store then we just have one place
where this is written we're keeping our
code dry and we're not repeating
ourselves one central place where this
manipulation is stored as a getter on
the store then we can access that getter
and output it wherever we need it okay
so I'm going to copy this code right
here and what I'm going to do in fact
I'll just copy this stuff right here and
what I'll do is head to my store GS and
this is where we define our getters so
outside of the states I'm going to put a
little comment and then I'm going to say
getters and this is an object in inside
here we can have as many Gators as we
want so I want to create a guess it
called sales products like so okay now
this is going to be a function and again
we can use a fat arrow function because
it takes a parameter first of all called
state so we'll take that parameter we'll
use the flat arrow and then start the
function okay so inside here we can
paste that code so what we're doing here
is we're saying okay a new variable
called sale products is equal to this
store dot state dot product now first of
all we don't need to do this store store
anymore
what
in the store and we get the state as a
parameter so we can delete this stuff
right here so we're just saying okay we
take the state's top products which is
this data our mapping them to this new
array right here using this information
and we're returning that okay so now we
just have this cold on the storm so now
we have it here we can delete it in the
other two components so let's delete it
right here first of all and also we'll
save that let's delete it in the other
one right here so notice I'm keeping the
actual computed property name sale
product right there I'm also keeping it
in this one because we're still going to
use it to access this get it we've just
defined on the store right so first of
all let's save that now then if we want
to access this getter what do we need to
do well inside this computed property
really simple all we need to do is say
return then we're going to say this dot
store dots Guetta's dots sale products
like so okay and I'm going to do exactly
the same thing for the other component
so this is incredibly spotless save that
and in product list - let's do the same
thing we'll save that and now we can
still see that data being output so
instead of defining the computed
property code here and potentially
having to change it many many times to
keep on top of your application we've
just defined it once in the store as a
getter and you can see getters or think
of getters as kind of like computed
properties for your store that the same
kind of thing they just get the data and
compute new data based on it if you like
and then we can receive that getter we
can use it in our different components
over here we can say this dot stored up
getters or sale products to use it to
get that data and then it's going to be
output as sale products in the template
right here okay so that is guesses they
essentially get the data from our store
and then pass it back to our components
when we need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
