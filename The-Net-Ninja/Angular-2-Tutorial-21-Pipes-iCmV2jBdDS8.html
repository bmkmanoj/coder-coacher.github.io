21st angular2 tutorial and in this video
we're going to talk about pipes all
right there so right now we are using ng
4 to loop through our array of ninjas
which is defined here on the component
class we lived in $3 an output in each
times a ninja belt and the ninja name so
we're going to start using some pipes on
these now what are pipes pipes just
affect how our data is output to the
screen for example if we have something
which is output like this one upper case
then the rest lower case we could change
that to all upper case and yeah we could
use CSS or the logic but if we want to
just use a pipe to do that we come it
can also use a pipe to slice up a string
I'm going to show you both of these
right now
so we use a pipe using this little
symbol here which looks like a pipe
which i think is why they're called
pipes so we pop that after the data
which were outputting so without putting
the ninja name here then I've used this
little pipe symbol to say hey we're
going to use a pipe now which means I'm
gonna change how this data is output to
the browser and the pipe I want to use
here is called uppercase that's how
simple it is that is a built-in pipe in
angular 2 so now this is going to turn
whatever is output here to uppercase so
I've just saved that and I'm gonna head
over and refresh in the browser and
voila
there we go it's all output as uppercase
or right there pretty cool right now
another thing we can do is we can slice
a string if we want to so for example
this belt right here this color this is
black red or purple now if we wanted to
we could slice that and by slice I mean
we could take some of the letters off
and this is a pipe which takes a
parameter so a parameter is just a
little bit of extra data that we're
gonna pass to the pipe to say what
exactly we want to do with it so again
we use the pipe symbol and then this
pipe is called slice this is going to
slice up some lettuce and we use a
parameter by putting a colon and this
parameter takes in
number and I'm going to say what so that
means I want you to go forward one kind
of position in the string and slice that
first letter off so let's save this now
and check it out in the browser and now
you can see the first letter both each
of these colors right here black red and
purple the first letter of each one has
been sliced off using this slice pipe
right here now this slice pipe can
actually take two parameters we can
provide a start point and an end point
so the way we provide super amateurs is
just then by doing another color and
then saying I want to end the slice at 3
so we're going to slice off the first
letter then we're going to go forward to
the third position and then we're going
to slice the rest off as well so if I
save this now and check it out in a
browser then now we see a really short
color blah and because they've been
sliced from the start and from the third
position always okay so we can also kind
of chain these pipes together so say for
example I want to do something in
uppercase first of all and then I want
to slice it as well well what I can do
is I can just grab this I'm gonna get
rid of you from there for now and I'm
going to pop it right next to this one
so first of all it's gonna do everything
in uppercase then it's gonna slice this
data right here as well
so if I save it and check it out in a
browser and by the way this is called
chaining the pipes together and now
that's updated these ninja names right
here to be uppercase and sliced now the
order that the minute here doesn't
really matter but when you use some
pipes for example if we're using a
custom pipe that we might make the order
does matter sometimes because it does
the first one first of all and it then
it does the second one okay
so just pay attention to that when
you're doing it now one thing that's not
included in angular 2 that was included
in the first version of angular is the
filter pipe if we want one of those
we're gonna have to make a custom pipe
ourselves so that's exactly what I'm
going to show you in a variants do so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
