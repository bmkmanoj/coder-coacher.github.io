jQuery for beginners less than eighteen
and in this video we're going to talk
about the jQuery invent object Wow or
are they gang so we've been looking at
events and we've been write things like
this in the code first of all we've
grabbed an element from the document
above we restored that element in a
variable like this then we've said on
click or whichever other event we want
to bind to this element then we pass
through a callback function which fires
and does something when this event
occurs right now that jQuery passes
through an event object to your callback
function right here if you want it to
and we can use that event object to
gather information about that particular
event such as for example the position
on the screen where that event happened
or maybe the type of event that occurred
all right
plus a few other things which we'll take
a look at in this tutorial and the good
thing is is that this event object that
jQuery passes to us is completely
cross-browser consistent across all
browsers
unlike vanilla JavaScript which
sometimes has some inconsistencies
especially when dealing with all the
browser's so let's take a look at this
event object and some of the things that
it can tell us now if we were going to
pass through the event object to this
function the first thing we need to do
is specify that here we need to pass
through the event object and we can name
it whatever we want okay we can name it
events we can name it EVT we can even
name it sausage all right whatever you
want to call it I call it e because it's
simple and it stands for event then once
we've passed that event object through
to the function we can call upon it here
and find out things about that event so
let's do a little example I'm going to
go out and graph every element on the
page and to do that we know we've got
the universal selector from CSS which is
that little star so that's going to grab
every element on the page if you don't
know about the universal selector feel
free to check out my CSS the beginners
course or the video in that course on
the universal selector I'll leave that
video in the description down below so
go check that up so we're going to grab
every element with that universal
selector we're going to bind a click
event to every element source a on then
click and then we'll do our callback for
right here and then within the
parentheses of that function I'm going
to pass through e which is our event
object alright then so the first thing
I'm going to do is find out the type of
event that's occurred right so I'm going
to log that to the console so we can see
it down here when we do something so
what I'll do is say console dot log I'm
gonna pass through the event object and
if I click dot now it's going to show me
all the different properties methods or
information that we have on this event
right so the first thing I want to do is
find out the type so I'm going to press
type and then what I'll do is in fact as
a string flew here as well I'll say the
event type is then concatenate the two
together alright the next thing I'm
going to do is come down here and I'm
going to stay say e dot stop propagation
and that's a method and what that is
going to do is stop this event bubbling
orbit or the events or say for example i
clicked this element right here you have
this egg tag now I'm clicking this and
it's going to tell me the type of that
event on this a tag and then if I don't
do this it's going to do the same thing
for your lights out because essentially
I'm also clicking the oh my tag I'm also
clicking the UL and the nav and the
wrapper so that event is bubbling up
through the different elements so I'm
stopping that bubbling right there so
it's just going to tell me the type of
the first event yeah at the first
element so let's save that refresh over
here and I click a few things so I click
this plants the event type is click I'll
click over here the events app is click
it just says a 2 there okay the next
thing I want to do is in fact do it
above this I'm going to log to the
console console dot log the target
element right so I'll say e target just
like that and I'll press save if i
refresh again what this does you'll see
if I click it brings back the target
that is the element that I've clicked ok
or rather the
by which this event is fired up so if I
click over here I'll bring back the
block quo if I click down here I'll
bring back the map etc so it's telling
us two things the target and the event
type what else have we got well we can
do the ex corde and it will say console
dot log x-coordinate of the event is
we'll concatenate e dot page X all right
save that refresh and let's click
something and now we get 203 for the
x-coordinate if I click over here it
goes to 9 7 8 now the x-coordinate is
the coordinate going from left to right
so the further I go to the right the
bigger it is for the left the smaller it
is starts out with 0 over here that's 2
but yeah that's measured in pixels all
right so we can also do the y-coordinate
I'll copy this and change this to Y and
change this to Y as well and refresh now
if I click somewhere the x-coordinate is
7 5 1 and the y coordinate is 867 same
again right at the top is going to be 0
well 2 and then the further down you go
is gonna be larger okay so the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates would be useful if you had
some kind of interactive game or
something and you want to know where the
users clicked if they've clicked on
certain object of certain objects on a
picture for example okay now there's a
few different other things we can find
out from the event I'm not going to go
through them all now but what I will do
is leave you a link to the jQuery event
page down below which is going to show
you all the different properties we can
gather from the event so you can go
ahead and check that out in your own
time so if you have any questions about
this whatsoever feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise guys don't
forget to subscribe share like and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
