nodejs tutorial and in this video we're
going to go ahead and create our very
own server
alright then going so in the last
tutorial I explained how a client can
make a request to a server and how a
server can respond to that request so in
this tutorial what we're going to do is
go ahead and make our very own server in
nodejs
and then we're going to go in a browser
and make a request to that server and
then deal with that request in node.js
as well alright so how the hell do we
make a server that well it is actually
pretty simple
we need to use one of nodejs use core
module so it comes shipped with and that
module is the HTTP module so let's go
ahead and store that in a variable
called HTTP and set it equal to require
then the module name which is HTTP ok
cool
so now we can use a method that is given
to us on this module to create our
server and I always store it in a
variable our server just so we can
reference it later on you don't have to
you can do it another way if you like
this is the way I do it and I set that
equal to HTTP the module then the method
that we can use is called create server
and then we go guys we have created his
server now there is more to it than this
because if we make a request to the
server then currently it's not going to
be able to do anything we're not doing
anything in the code here of the minute
so we need a way to deal with those
requests and to do that we pass a
function through here and this function
takes two parameters a request object
and a response object so the way this
works is whenever we send a request to
the server then this function is going
to fight it and in this function we're
going to take two parameters a request
object and a response object now the
request object comes loaded with details
about the request that has been made and
the response object is something we can
use to send a response back to the
client okay
so we're going to do that in this
tutorial now before we start sending our
response and just want
to take a minute to talk about how we do
that and headers okay then so when we
make a request to a server and when we
respond then as well as responding with
some data or information we also respond
with headers and on the request we can
send request headers and you can think
of headers as extra information about
the request or the response much like in
HTML page you have a head section rank
which tells the browser a little bit
more about the HTML document but it's
not actually shown on the browser that's
a bit like the headers in the response
and the requests so the kind of things
we can put in this header the content
type
so the browser knows what to expect
whether that's going to be plain text or
HTML or JSON because it's going to deal
with each one in a different way for
example it renders haitch tml on a page
in a browser it doesn't do that with
plain text so we need to say the content
type we're telling the browser about the
content ok this is all in the headers we
can also put a status in the response
hate our headers and that is something
like 200 which means everything was ok
our 404 if the page can be found so
we're going to go ahead and create these
response headers first of all and then
we're going to serve up some information
ok so the way we write the response
headers is by saying response that's
this object pass through the response
object dot right head ok and then in
here first of all the first parameter is
going to be the status and that's going
to be 200 then we're going to pass
through an object and him in here I'm
going to do the content type so content
type pay attention to the capital
letters there and the value of this
content type like say can be something
like HTML or plain text or Jason I'm
going to do a plain text for now so we
need to pass through text forward slash
plate ok so that's so the browser knows
what to do with the content so now we've
set up our response headers that'll do
and the next thing I want to do is
actually end this
response and send it to the browser and
to do that we can use a method called
end on the response object so response
top end and then in these parentheses we
can send back some information or data
so I've said I'm going to send back
plain text so that's what I'll do I'll
just send that hey ninjas okay so now
we're sending about the headers and the
response body itself cool so if I was to
make a request
now by going to my local Hulk's but this
still wouldn't work and that's because
we've not specified a port number to
listen to if you remember in the last
tutorial I said that we can set up no GS
to listen to a particular port for
requests so we need to do that first of
all before we send any requests
otherwise it's not going to be listening
for them so let's come under here and
say server that's this variable we
created up here and then we can use a
method called listen and in here first
of all we're going to say the port
number we want to listen to I'm just
going to use 3000 okay and then we're
also going to put in the IP address
which is 127.0.0.1 this is just the
localhost because this is going to be a
local server well running everything
locally okay so now it's listing to that
port on this IP address so when we get a
request to this pole then it's going to
respond it's going to fire this function
okay now it's always a good idea as well
when we're listening to a port just to
log a little message down here so that
we know we're listening to it so I'm
going to say console dot log and I'll
say your Doakes
now listening to for 3000 oops yep
that's right sorry cool all right then
so that is all of the server setup and
if I now run this in know by saying node
up then it's going to start and you can
see we say your dogs now listening to
port 3000 then i'm going to come to my
browser and i've already typed in the IP
address one two seven zero zero one now
I'm going to put in the port number 3000
okay and if we go there we
his response Haemon jizz the text okay
this might look really small so let's
zoom in a little bit now you can see it
hey ninjas so that's this text that we
send right here and if you open up the
network tab you can right-click on the
page go to inspect that's going to bring
up the developer tools then go to the
network tab and if we go to refresh here
we can see the requests and this one
right here if I click on it there's the
response
hey ninjas and if we go to headers you
can see the headers that we've set 200
for the status code which is here and
then the content type is text forward
slash plain okay so they're the houses
and they're the preview now it doesn't
matter what URL we put in here as long
as it's on three thousand port it can be
anything we've not kind of specified
Doug we're dealing with a particular URL
or request any request which is sent to
this port on this IP is going to be
dealt with in the same way so if I right
/hey then I'm still going to get the
same response Avaya /hey hello if I can
spell then we're still going to get the
same response so in a real world
application we need a way to kind of
distinguish between what we're
requesting and we're going to look at
that in later tutorials but I think for
now that is how we set up a server on
notice one more thing which I'm going to
show you is adding in a little statement
here before I do that I'm going to
cancel out this process because it's
still listening to port 3000 I need to
cancel up here so ctrl C then up here
what I'm going to say is console.log and
then I'm going to log something above
the request that was made so I'll say
request was made and then I'm going to
concatenate the request URL so this is a
property we can access on the request
object which says the URL of the request
so if I save that now and rerun this
node up so we're listening to port
again then if i refresh over here you
can see now we log to the console every
time a request was made we says request
was made and you can see the URL the
request was made from hey hello if we
change it to like API then you can see
that logs out API is the URL all right
so anyway this is how we create a server
we're going to look at routing and doing
all that kind of fancy stuff in later
tutorials for now if you have any
questions feel free to leave those down
below otherwise guys I'm going to see
you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
