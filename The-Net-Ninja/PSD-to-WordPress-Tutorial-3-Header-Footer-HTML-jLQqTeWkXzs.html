watching PSD to WordPress a lesson 3 and
in this video we're going to start
coding up the header and footer HTML Wow
alright guys so before we get started I
just want to make one change to
something I did last lesson we saved all
these images in the last lesson and I
accidentally named one of these from one
twice this should be thumb 4 so I'm just
gonna rename that to thumb - 4 and here
presto we have all of them from 1
through 2004 alright now the next thing
I've done is created this empty folder
right here called PSD to WP and that's
on my desktop I'm just going to drag
this images folder into that right there
ok so we can close that down and now
what I've done is I've opened brackets
and I've opened up this folder in
brackets right now ok all I did was go
to file open folder and then choose this
PSD - WP folder on the desktop and it's
given me that right there I've also got
now the PSD file opened on the right and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
is start coding up the index.html file
and in particular just focus on the
header section and the footer section
down here alright so what I want to do
first is go to view and then go to show
and then go to slices it's currently
ticked which means it's showing all the
slices now don't want them to show
because I want to see the PSD on its own
so I'm going to click that and it's
going to hide all of those little slices
at it alright so first thing I need to
do over here is right clicking this
little pain and say new file we're going
to call this index.html and then we'll
do our doctype declaration at the top
this is just saying that hey look this
is a HTML file we need that at the top
of all HTML files and then we're going
to do our HTML tags within that we need
a head tag and then a title tag within
that this is just going to be the title
at the top of the browser tab and the
website is called resto so let's just
put in resto
oops down here we need to do our body
tag and then the first thing I want to
do in the body tag is this header
section right here now html5 has a tag
called header so we're just going to use
that because it's quite semantic and
then within that the first thing I want
to do is create a div with a class of
wrapper now I've talked about this in
some of my previous tutorials and
essentially all this class is going to
do is keep all of the content within
this central column okay you can see
it's about 1200 pixels wide from here to
here right so this wrapper is going to
have a max width of 1200 pixels and
we're going to position it centrally so
it's always got that central column in
the middle right so that's what this is
going to do and I'll go through it a
little bit more when I write up the CSS
but for now I want to do a h1 and this
h1 is going to represent this logo right
here so we're going to give it a class
of logo like that and then what we'll do
is we'll write in Bristol now you might
be thinking well this is an image so why
aren't we putting an image tag in there
and the reason guys is that we're going
to do that the background image in the
CSS and the reason I want to do that is
for screen readers because if a screen
reader comes onto your website and they
see an image they wouldn't see the image
yet I'd see the alt tag but I did see
this text all right so this is kind of
like a back up for screen readers now
for desktop users we're going to hide
this text and we're going to replace it
with a background image of this thing
right here so it works for both screen
readers and desktop users so this is the
way I like to do it all right the next
thing we need to do is create that nav
and again this is html5 element and it's
just semantic we can use it to create
navigations and all nav elements require
or expect rather some kind of heading
right so I'm going to do h2 and I'm
going to say main navigation and again
this is for the benefit of screen
readers so that they know that this here
is the main navigation of the website
we're going to hide this in the CSS
because it's not on the design all right
so let's create that you well tag right
here and we need a few allies each with
an anchor tag in them we don't need to
worry about the links for now because
we'll sort all that out when we come to
do the wordpress side of things I'm
going to copy this and paste it in just
a few times how many links we've got
five so I'll do five there and then the
first one is our story just going to
move this a little bit over there so we
can see easily our story menu
reservations news and reviews alright so
that there my friends is the header
complete so what I'm going to do is just
create a comment here and this is going
to be start homepage content just so we
know later on and then I'm going to do
another comment that says end homepage
content and this is going to be more
useful tools when we're transferring
next to a wordpress theme just so we
know where the home page content starts
and where it ends and we're going to put
all that in the middle there in the next
lesson
so now I just want to move on to the
footer which is down here at the bottom
and essentially this footage just has
four columns in it so we're just going
to use four UL tags to do those but
before we do that I again want to create
that div with a class of wrapper just to
keep all the content central within this
column yeah from here to here so we've
done that and then we need to create our
UL tax and then some Li tags the first
one is this address thing over here so
I'll just copy that
New York restaurants then another Ally
give up a type then it's three nine two
six once I say I'm more Road yeah okay
sounds nice
and then New York NY one zero zero one
four and finally the number which is
seven one eight seven four nine one
seven one four I can barely read that
they're so small I'm going to zoom in a
little bit all right that's better
okay so that's the first column what I'm
going to do is just copy this now and
paste it again for the second column
I'll just change this to France and then
the address is 68 rue de la ku Rong
that's my best French accent and then
the God knows what this number is seven
five zero zero two Paris
and finally another have got the zetz
there by the way let's just make that
what it should be
finally the number which is 0-2 okay
they have dots in there numbers 9 4.2
3.6 9.5 6 this looks more like an IP
address but hey ho that's what they want
that's what they shall get then the
third column is going to be all these
links right here so we need these anchor
tags in this time so a href equals
nothing for the time being
block same again down here and again
will sort all of these links out later
on when we come to do the WordPress
menus there's no point in putting them
in now if we're just going to change
them later I'm all about saving time and
generally being lazy when it comes to
coding things up but you know don't do
what you don't need to and then finally
we've got this link at the bottom choose
contact perfect
right we've got one more ul and this
first Ally is going to have this image
right in it here so we'll just put the
image tag in there given a source of
images because in the images folder and
then forward slash it's white logo if I
remember correctly perfect alright so
we'll give this an alt attribute just to
be nice and we'll call it logo then we
just need two more things
the second Ally tag is going to be for
this copyright message here and when you
want to get this copyright message all
you need to do is the little cold for in
the HTML which starts with ampersand
then copy not compy copy and then the
semicolon now you won't believe the
amount of times I struggled to try and
find out how to do this when I first
died web designer and a lot of the time
I just left it up because I didn't know
how to do it but there is the secret
guys you no longer have to search for it
that's what we do all rights reserved
let's change that to 2015 since that's
where we are now and then the final Li
tag is going to be for that oh no we
don't do that we won't do that that's
just a link to the website where we got
this template for but if I was making
this for a client then I would have put
that on at the bottom because it just
looks a little unprofessional so that is
the header and the footer sorted all
right guys
by the way I've just made that comment
about here if you do a website it is
nice to give them credit maybe just put
the link somewhere less noticeable maybe
just a little bit down here separate
from the rest because it is nice to give
people credit if they're designing a PSD
for you then you want to give them
credit shortly because they've gone out
of the way to help you and you're using
it for free so hey let's give them some
credit right so anyway that's the footer
and the header sorted in the next lesson
what we're going to do is all of this
juicy stuff in the middle which is these
things right here and all this stuff
right there alright so don't forget to
subscribe share and like guys and I'll
see you in a very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
