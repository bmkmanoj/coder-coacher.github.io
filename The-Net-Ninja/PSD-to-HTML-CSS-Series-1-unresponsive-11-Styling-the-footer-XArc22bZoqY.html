PSD to HTML and CSS series 1 lesson 11
and in this video we're gonna style over
the footer Wow so this is gonna be the
last lesson in this tutorial series
we're going to focus on the footer right
here and we need to do a few things we
need to float these list items to the
left to float this map to the right and
replace these things with little icons
all right but the first thing I want to
do is grab hold of this h2 and style it
the same as this h2 right here and also
apply a border to the top of this
section just like it now I could go here
and write out the real separately if I
wanted to but to save time what I can do
is just combine my selectors with the
ones up here so where we've got clients
here that applies a border and a padding
top I can just say comma and then the
name of this section which is contact
and then that's going to apply the
padding at the top and then likewise I
can come down here and say contact h2
and that's gonna style hitch to exactly
the same as up here cool all right next
thing I want to do is style this list
right here so to do that I need to grab
hold of the UL tag which has an idea of
contact methods so we'll say contact
method I'm going to float this to the
left alright next thing I want to do is
grab hold of the Li tags within that so
I'll copy this we're gonna give these a
list style type not a color of that gray
color again which is 888 and a line
height up around 30 pixels just Pat them
out a little bit and then we're gonna
style you remember before each list item
there was one of those little icons like
a little telephone little envelope and
there's something else down here yeah
we're going to do that but we're not
going to apply padding to the
element right here and applied
background image I'm going to show you a
different way of doing that and that's
using the before pseudo class so what I
want to do is come down here and say
concept methods Li then a pseudo class
that's with a semicolon eeeh and then we
stay before and what this is going to do
is insert some content before each Li
attack alright so we can style that
element before each one so we're going
to say it's gonna have some empty
content like that and then we're going
to display as block and what we're doing
here essentially guys is saying look
before each alive
I want to go before that and place some
kind of empty placeholder thing there so
I can style it so that's what we're
doing right we're just standing this
empty placeholder that we've put in
before each Li we're giving it a display
a block so that we can control those
width and height properties over the
block alright so what we're gonna say is
give it a width of 4 pixels and a height
of 40 pixels and then we're gonna float
this to the left so that it's before the
Li tag itself and then we're gonna give
it a margin right of 10 pixels and we're
gonna give it a background of a URL and
then it's gonna be that picture sprite
that we saved in one of the first
tutorials with all the little icons on
so we know that's in the images folder
forward slash and it's this one right
here logo sprite so now you can see
we've got those logos right there we
just need to alter the background
position of those so that each Li tag
has the right one associated with it
right
so you'll notice one thing these now
look like a set of stairs they go from
left to right as well as top to bottom
now we want to get rid of that we want
them to be fairly straight going down so
to do that what we need to do is come up
to this selector right here and every Li
tag needs to clear left
so we'll just clear it left there and
that's because this thing right here was
floating to the left so every Li tag we
need to clear this float so it goes
directly under again otherwise it's just
gonna screw up to the left of it and
that's what was happening before
alright then so now what I want to do is
give this a no repeat property just so
we don't get that extra bit coming down
below at the bottom and then we need to
give each of these allies or each of
these rather a different background
positions so that we show the different
icons all right now I've already worked
out the position of these icons so I'm
just going to paste them in I've copied
them before and I'll paste them now so
I'm gonna place them down here and you
can see what I've done is say contact
methods Li and the child one which is
this one before
okay so we're targeting this a little
bit before the other eye tag and then
I'm giving it a different background
position so that it moves that sprite
and it's minus 1/5 1/3
sorry horizontally so it's going all the
way to the right of that image and it's
finding this sprite image right there
and it's do the same for the second
child and the third child give it a
different background position so that
we've got the right icon for each
different and I tagged okay it made
sense all right then so now we've done
that we need to move this over to the
right with lots to the right and to do
that it's the only image within the
contact methods section so we'll say
contact
I'm not contact method sorry just the
the contact section contact image and
then we'll float that to the right all
right then so finally we need to just
style these babies up right here almost
make some space for ourselves and the
first thing I need to do is grab hold of
this map which has an idea of social nav
right there so let's grab that copy and
paste down here and what I want to do is
play the floats because we've got these
two floats going on the map and the the
URL right here so we need to clear those
they both and it's gonna scoot right
down to the bottom and then I'll spell
the Li text separately so down here a
lie we're gonna give these a
list-style-type
or non just to get rid of those little
dots and we're gonna flop each one left
and we're going to give each one a width
of 40 pixels that's the width of one of
those little icons like these things
here and a height of 30 pixels I'm gonna
give it a background of that same image
so that's in the images folder forward
slash and then it should be just what is
it logo - sprite the PNG no-repeat we've
forgotten our colon right here okay cool
now it's worked and then we want to
indent this text way off over here so
that it doesn't show over the images
source a text indent - ten thousand
pixels cool and then the same as we did
up here for those a light X we're going
to do the same down here we're going to
skew over the background position of
each one in order now the first one is
Facebook so we don't need to move that
one but we need to move the subsequent
three ones here at these all right so
let's do that let's say social Knapp Li
and child and then - because we're going
to move this second one right here and
then we're going to give that a
background position of minus 40 pixels
and then 0 top and bottom so now you can
see the Twitter one is second I'm just
going to copy this all right and then
I'm going to change this to the third
child and this to the fourth child and
then third child I'm going to scoot over
80 pixels that becomes Pinterest which
is the third one yet and the fourth one
120 pixels and it now becomes LinkedIn
which is right here awesome
okay so I want
do one more thing well two more things
first of all and you'll notice when we
hover over these we don't get that
little hand pointer okay now these are
linked so we should be getting that hand
pointer you can see here there's little
eight tags so we should be getting it
and the reason is because the a tags are
not occupying all of the space of the Li
type so we can do that we can target
those eight tags by saying social mouth
Hey and then what we're gonna do is
display those display block and then
we'll stay with 100% and height 100%
just like that and now when we hover
over them you can see we get that little
hunk icon also now one more thing I want
to do I want to move this whole list
upwards a little bit so it's more in
line with the bottom with this map
alright so to do that I'm gonna go back
up to this social now right here and I'm
going to give it a position of relative
so that we can move it upwards we'll say
the top position is gonna be about minus
40 pixels and that moves upwards forty
pixels in respect to its original
position which was here so now you can
see kind of lines up more with the
bottom of that map alright then so now
it is guys finished product just like
that and like I've been saying
throughout this course that maybe parts
of this design that I've made in the CSS
and the HTML that are slightly different
from the PSD for this tutorial series I
didn't really care about the
nitty-gritty bit like that because I
have not got a client at the end or a
designer saying well you know these
things to be pixel perfect or the colors
need to be spot-on I'm just showing you
the process here guys so when you're
doing things for clients yourself you're
gonna want to take a little bit more
care and get the color spot on the
margin spot on the font size the font
families all that stuff yeah I just
offer a tutorial series this would be
enough so you'll notice that this isn't
a responsive website if I make the
screen smaller it's not going to respond
with that and it's not gonna look great
on mobiles but this is an introductory
tutorial series all right for beginners
what I'm going to do in the future is
make a whole kind of load of these
different series and we're going to have
one which is responsive one booster
one on skeleton one on foundation one to
WordPress etc there's gonna be loads
more coming up guys so stay tuned for
those and I'll show you how to do all
that responsive stuff then otherwise if
you have any questions about this
whatsoever feel free to drop a comment
down below I'll answer all your
questions otherwise guys if you enjoy

I'll see you in the next tutorial series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
