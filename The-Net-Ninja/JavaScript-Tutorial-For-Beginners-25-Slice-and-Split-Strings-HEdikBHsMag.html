JavaScript for beginners lesson 25 and
in this video we're going to start
splitting and slicing strings Wow
alright guys so in the last lesson I
talked about strings and I said that
there are many different methods built
into JavaScript that we can call on
strings and by methods remember I mean
functions so there's many different
functions built into JavaScript that we
can use on strings which is really cool
and I'm going to show you two in this
video to other in my opinion better ones
and the first one is the slice method so
first of all let's just declare a string
bard STR which stands for string right
hello world and that there is our oops
not Wordle world that is our string so
if we call STR now we get hello world
now say we want to slice that string
into a different string say for example
I want to slice it right here after the
Yi and right here before the R so we've
got low we'll now don't ask me why I'd
want to do that in this case I don't
know but you have may have a JavaScript
program where you want to slice a string
into a particular segment so this is
going to do that for you first of all
we're going to declare STR to a new
variable and we're going to say that
equals STR which is this first string
and then we get a caller function on the
string and to do that we need to put a
period or a full stop and then say the
function name and it is slice okay
remember every function that we call or
method that we call needs this kind of a
parenthesis after it okay that calls the
method now if the method requires
variables that we have to pass in to
this method then you'd put them in here
and in this case it does it requires two
well actually it requires one but you
can put two it and I'll show you both so
say we want to slice it from this L
right here what we do is we specify
which character in the string we want to
slice it from so it's zero based
JavaScript remember so characters start
at position zero so this is position
zero this H is one and then L is two so
we're going to start a position to write
so we want to go right up to this our or
just before it so position two three
four five six is the space seven eight
nine is the are so we say we want to end
it nine and that's going to cut it just
before the are there all right so we
don't need that space let's put a
semicolon at the end and return that if
we call STR two we can see now we have
lower really cool all right now I said
you could pass just one variable or
argument as there otherwise known into
this function and it's the first one the
starting point so let's do that let's
make var STR three a third string and
let's set that equal to STR which is the
initial one we defined up here dot slice
and then we'll just put two men and see
what happens let's call STR three and
this time we get low world which
basically says that they've cut from
here position two and you've gone right
to the end and that's what happens if
you don't specify a second value where
you want to end the string it cuts it
off at the end alright so that is slice
my friends the next thing I want to show
you is split and split is a function
which takes a string and it splits that
string up into different pockets and
puts those pockets in an array now I
know we've not covered arrays we're
going to do that in the next lesson I
just wanted to show you this now it's
kind of like a gentle introduction to
arrays so let's define a new variable
we'll call these tags and you know like
if you create a post online a word press
or something and it asks you for tags in
one of those form fields it says
sometimes separate your tags by a
comment right so that's what we do and
then maybe in the JavaScript we've
grabbed all those tags in a variable and
it looks something like this say we do
it a blog on me so these would be the
tags meat ham salami pork beef chicken
yeah chicken okay there are tags so if
we call that we get the string back
which is all the tags now oops
of myself pork it says proc but that
doesn't matter right if we want to split
now this
a string so that each one of these meats
is defined in its own little pocket in
an array then we can do that we'd say
var tags array we're just defining a new
variable there that's all and we'll say
tags dot split and we need to specify at
what point we want to split this string
or what character and we'll say common
and that those same whenever you see a
comma I want you to split this string so
every time there's a comma make a new
pocket and put the next thing in the
pocket does that make sense
it'll make more sense when I press ENTER
and I call tags a red now they're my
friends you're going to see an array and
I know you've not seen this before but
like I say we'll cover this in the next
lesson but basically what's happened is
when we've said split on this tags
variable it split this variable the
string into an array and each position
in this array each pocket is being
defined by this thing here because
whatever there's a comma in the string
it's splitting this string and putting
whatever was before it in a new pocket
in this array makes sense yeah it will
make even more sense when you know more
about arrays and that's what we're going
to cover in the next lesson if you want
to learn more by strings you can head
over to this Mozilla guide here the
developer guide I'll put the link in the
description down below and if you scroll
down this page you can see all these
different methods that are on the string
and you can go through those and try a
few of them out there's a really cool
little website so yeah if you have any
questions on anything I've done in here
feel free to comment down below
otherwise guys I'll see you in the next
video we're going to look at arrays
