second hate email five on styling
tutorial and in this video we're going
to take a look at those radio buttons
okay so as you can see these radio
buttons right here look pretty good at
the minute they just look really generic
not customized at all now we can't
actually change the styling of these
default radio buttons right here but we
can do something so that it changes the
appearance of them we're going to hide
these radio buttons and add in our own
buttons instead our own image review
light to show whether a field is checked
or not checked okay
so the way we're going to do that is by
making these invisible by setting the
opacity to zero and then bring it in our
own images instead from this image
folder right here so let's go down here
under radio boxes and first of all let's
say input and then type equals radio so
this is just an attribute select if you
like but in the attribute within square
brackets and saying whatever we have an
input of type radio apply these styles
to them okay so it's going to grab these
two things right here so like I said
first of all we want to make it
invisible
so say opacity is going to be 0 and then
the width is also going to be 0 just to
clear up that space and we'll also give
it a margin of 0 as well so if I save
that now you're not going to see those
kind of really or buttons so now if we
click one of these we don't know which
one is selected or not so we need a way
to show the user which one is selected
now we can use a pseudo class called
checked to show which one is selected
and I'm going to show you that in a
minute but first of all what I want to
do is style up the labels right there so
I'll say label and the first one is
going to be 4 equals male so that's this
label right here and then we also want
to grab the other one so we'll say it
label again and then attribute selector
4 equals female which is the second
label I'm going to start both of those
up so the first thing now that I want to
do is say margin bottom is going to be
10 pixels just to kind of space them out
a little bit like this on the screen if
this works I'll save it okay then I want
to say display:inline-block save that
and now we get that margin okay cool so
padding less is going to be set to about
twenty six pixels and I'm going to do
that because we want to apply our own
images right here so that gives it room
if you like
so after that I want to say background
it's going to be a URL and then it's
going to be in our images folder right
here and it's going to be the czechs
image right here you can see right there
we have the radio buttons and the check
boxes so we're going to use this image
sprite to style these different things
right here so that's the image we want
source a image forward slash and its
inputs not inputs are each X dot PNG
okay cool
and we also want to say no-repeat so we
also want to give a background position
so I'll say background position and to
begin with I'm just going to set it to
not nor for X&amp;amp;Y I'm going to show you
what this looks like at the minute so
now they look like the actual selected
and imagery now we don't want that by
default we want to show the unselected
imagery so we're just going to have to
change the background position so it
shows a different area of this sprite
and that is going to be minus 32 pixels
for the y-coordinate okay so if I save
that now we can see now we have those
little circles instead now they're a
little bit cut off at the bottom so I'm
going to change the line height of those
labels I'll say line height is going to
be 24 pixels and I'm also going to say
cursor is going to be the pointer so we
get that little hand when we go over a
label so now you can see that little
hand oh that's not work because I've not
spelt it correctly first okay save that
now we get that little hand when we
hover over them and you can see the full
circle now as well so still when we
click them
nothing happens we don't know which one
is checked so what I want to do is check
for the checked version of this input
field and we can use that we can do that
using a pseudo class called checked so
what I'm going to say is input
checked plus label and I'll explain this
in a minute four equals mail okay so
what I'm saying here is when an input is
in its checked State then I want you to
find the adjacent label in which case
it's going to be for mail at the minute
so when this one is checked
get the mail next to it and also do the
same for female so I'm going to copy
that dude and paste it right here inside
female so when an input is checked if we
have an adjacent selector which matches
to these right here a label for male or
female then I want to star laws
differently okay so what I want to do is
set the background position to zero zero
right I'm also going to say color of the
text is going to be C e1o 100 which is
like a red color okay so let's save this
now if we check something the color of
this is changing that's absolutely fine
this is not working but ground position
so let's save that again and now we can
see that background position changes
okay so now it looks like it's selected
and that is just using our own custom
imagery so again just to go over this
what we've done first of all we've
hidden the original inputs those little
circles and we've done that by setting
the opacity to zero width to zero and
margin to zero so now they're hidden but
then when we did that if we selected one
of these we didn't know which thing was
checked or not so what we did first of
all is we stand Able's
and we gave them a background image of
that checks right here and we positioned
it so that the background image showed
this empty circle like an empty checkbox
right then we use the pseudo class
checked on the input fields so whenever
it input field is checked and it has an
adjacent selector of may
all right we grab this selector right
here and we change the background
position of it to 0-0 which then shows
the checked version of that image so
that is how we style up radio buttons
any questions leave those down below
otherwise I'm going to see you it in a
very next tutorial but we're going to
move on to these and do something
similar for the checkboxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
