watching jQuery for beginners lesson six
and in this video I want to introduce to
you some jQuery filters Wow okay then
class so as you can see I've got the
HTML page at the top right here again
and the empty script up J's file at the
bottom okay so in this lesson I want to
introduce you to some filters so what
our filters well filters can be used to
refine selectors to make them more
specific and they are very very much
like CSS pseudo classes so say for
example I want to select all the P tags
on this page with jQuery we could then
use a filter to say hey actually I just
want the P tags that are going to be the
first child within that parent element
all right
that's what filters are all about all
about refining those selectors to get
the exact elements that you require
so I've done a few examples of filters
down here so I'm going to show you these
now and the first example I want to show
you is the first and last and by the way
before we start filters always start
with a colon like that much like
pseudo-classes in that respect they're
exactly the same and in many other
respects also so first almost what does
this mean well it's pretty
self-explanatory but I'll just don't
come into this studio so what I'm saying
here is that hey go to the header find a
nav and then the Allies within that nav
and then get me the first one that you
find then give it a border of two pixels
solid red and the same goes for the last
li that you find in the header now Li
unless so let's talk to the header first
of all in the HTML we can see this is
the header there and then within there
we've got the nav and then we've got all
these allies these five allies here so
the first one it comes across is this so
I'm saying give that a border of red and
the last one it comes across is this one
give that a border of red also so you
can see if we skew up on this side at
the minute there's no borders right here
but if we save now here now you can see
the first one and the last ones have the
border of red cool so that is first and
last now this shouldn't be confused with
first child and last child and you may
be familiar with those for our
CSS because the if you try to do this
and think they're the same then you
could get some results that are going to
throw you off and I'll explain why
they're different in a second first of
all I'm just going to comment this back
out so it doesn't interfere with
anything and then we'll look at this one
here so this is the first child and like
a shower and currently you'll see I'm
saying go to the Content ID find the UL
which is first not first child not yet
and give that a border of red and same
goes for the last ul in the contact
section so let's go down to the contact
section and find that okay so you can
see here this is the first ul within the
context section and this is the last
year well within the contact section
yeah so we've got the contact methods
and their social map so if we save this
let's scoot down here these are the two
lists this is the contact methods the
first one and this is the last one the
social now so hopefully both of those
should have a border of red when I click
Save yet which they do and this board is
collapsed but don't worry about that the
fact is is grab both of those elements
as specified and it's giving them a red
border now if I change this to first -
child
oops not in capitals first - child and
then the one below is the last - child
this should be different so you might
save this now you're not see the borders
disappear and that guy's is because they
are not the first children or the last
children if we take a look at this
section here you can see the first child
is a h2 not a ul yep this is the first
ul within that section which is why just
first on its own works but it is not the
first child within the section likewise
this one right here is not the last
child because we have this pig tag
underneath so let's delete that and will
delete this h2 as well temporarily we'll
save this and now this is work save this
as well refresh here now we get the
border at the bottom one the top one
hasn't worked why is that all that's
because we've not deleted that h2 so
save that again
save down here and refresh now we get
that border on the top one as well so
now their first child and let's chat so
I hope that makes sense
alright let's comment this out so it
doesn't interfere with anything else and
now I move on to the next one which is
even and this pretty much does what it
says on the tin
this grabs all the even elements that
you want so I'm saying here let's
uncomment it hey go into the header find
the nav then all the allies and then get
me the even ones so let's go up to the
head at once again we can see there's
five of those Li tags let's save this
and see which one's it gives a border of
blue Scoob up to the top now you can see
if this one this one and this one and
you might be thinking well that's one
that's three and that's five they are
not even but remember javascript is
zero-based this is actually 0 this is 2
and this is 4 ok 0 1 2 3 4 so these are
the even ones all right so let's comment
that out again and this time we'll find
the odd ones right here ok let's save
this and this time you can see it's
highlighting the odd ones it's giving
them a border of yellow all right then
so what else have we got well we can use
the knot filter and this is a little bit
more advanced so let's uncomment this
right here and what I'm saying here guys
it was that's wrong there we go what I'm
saying here guys is that hey don't give
me the sections all the sections so
we've got three of them we've got this
one here the points of sale we've got
this one here the clients and then
finally we've got this one oops this one
here the contact section so it's one two
and then another one underneath there
and I'm saying get me all the sections
that do not match this statement right
here this selector so we can pass
through another selector and I said that
don't have an ID of contact
and notice that I'm wrapping this in
single quotes that's because I don't
want to use double quotes otherwise this
will be escaped for example if I put a
double quote in here now all this stuff
is escaped because it's reading this as
the string that we're passing in alright
so it has to be a single part when
you're using not so now hopefully it
will grab every section except this one
here the contact one and give it a
border of green so let's save that and
now you can see the top two have a
border of green but the bottom one which
is the contact section does not pretty
cool yeah so that is a really powerful
filter that we can use so let's just
comment that again make sure it doesn't
interfere with anything else so the next
one is the less than filter now less
than can be used on elements where
you've got a lot of them for example
list items so for this one I've again
gone after a navigation this time of
social mouth and I've said go after the
social navigate me that then get the
allies within it and then return any Li
that is less than the index of 3 all
right so remember it's zero base this is
zero one two and three so the ones less
than are these three right here so what
I'm saying is get those three and give
it a border of blue so let's save this
and see if it does it it's these things
around here save and yet those three
have a border of blue
okay let's comment that out and go to
the greater one okay so same principle
greater than it's just GT instead of LT
and I'm saying this time get all the
allies which have an index greater than
two now remember it's zero one two the
only one that has an index greater than
two is this less one right here so
hopefully just the last one here it will
have a border of blue save that and yep
there we go all right pretty cool
comment that out and let's move on to
the next one - it's quite a lot of you
all right so attribute filters this is
where it starts to get a little bit more
advanced again and you probably know
these from CSS we can do the same things
in CSS we want to say let's delete this
comment
you want to say go after oops what for
dummy it's not right there you go
alright go after all the diffs on the
page okay we've got quite a few of those
so get every div which has a class now
it doesn't matter what class that is all
right just as long as it's got a class
get that and give it a border of pink so
let's save this and now you can see all
the divs now have a border of pink who
got this div here this one here the one
going around the top this one for the
main content etc so there's quite a few
different divs on the page now this here
is called an attribute filter alright so
basically what I'm saying is you can put
any attribute within this square bracket
okay so it doesn't have to be a class we
could say alt instead now get me any
deal with an alt now that's not very
likely because we don't give alt
attributes to divs typically but if I
change this to image now every image
with an alt attribute should have a
border of pink so let's save this again
and this time you can see all the images
because I've given them all all types
you can see if we come down to some
images you can see the vulgar alt tags
alright so pretty much every image on
this page now has a border of pink
pretty cool yet so that can be used to
target elements which have an attribute
associated with them and it doesn't
matter what that attribute value is
equal to now if we want to get more
specific we can do let's just comment
this out we could say we want that
attribute to have a specific and value
all right so let's delete this comment
and what I'm saying here guys is get all
the images with an alt attribute equal
to quote okay so exactly the same as
this syntax here except we've put an
equal sign in and we're giving it the
value of what that attribute should be
equal to all right now we can see if we
scroll down here we've got an image
right here with an alt attribute equal
to quote so it should give that element
a border of purple so let's save this
and this time you can see that one
there has a border of purple and none of
the other images do right so that was
quite a lengthy tutorial and guys if I
wanted to go through even more filters
this would probably last about an hour
this tutorial so I'm not going to go
through any more what I am going to do
is point you in the direction of the
jQuery website which is going to give
you a full list of different selectors
and filters we can use okay so this is
that jQuery page and you can see we've
got all the different selectors and
filters that we can use here and all we
have to do is click on one of them for
example this disabled selector and it's
going to give you an in-depth kind of
overview of what this does plus a neat
little example or right here alright so
all you want to do is go to a PID query
to call forward slash category forward
slash selectors and leave this link in
the description below so you can go out
and check that out on your own and if
you have any questions about this lesson
