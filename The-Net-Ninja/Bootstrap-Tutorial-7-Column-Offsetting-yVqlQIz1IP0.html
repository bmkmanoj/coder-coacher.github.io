seventh bootstrap 3 tutorial and we're
going to take a look at column offset
Wow I think guys so basically by now you
should be pretty comfortable with what a
container is what a row is and what a
column is and why they use basically now
in this tutorial I want to talk about
another topic which is called offsetting
and basically we take a look at this
scenario I want you to imagine that this
is two elements that were placed on the
grid and this grid is behind it we see
those gray bars those gray columns they
represent the columns as 12 of those so
we're saying for smaller devices like
this I want those elements to be twelve
columns in width right the full width of
the screen now if we wanted to have a
gap on each side like this example right
here
then we can use what's called offset in
to offset the elements by two columns
from the left right but we have to do
more than just that we have to also make
the width of this element even smaller
because if we just offset it by two
columns then it'll go way off onto the
side of the screen and it carry on for
an extra two columns over here right no
we have to reduce the width of the
element as well to be whatever width we
want it to be so this currently is now
eight columns in weight okay so we've
offset it by two then we've made the
width to eight so that there's two left
on the right so now the central is
sitting so I'm going to jump into the
code and show you an example all right
then go so where I am in the code and
it's basically the same as last time
we've got this container right here
which is a fluid one then we've got one
rope and then within the row we've got
these three elements right and I've
given them each a class of call XS 12
which is saying look extra small screens
to begin with I want these to be twelve
columns in width
each one of them right so they're going
to be full width of the V Pole and then
when it gets to medium size screen as we
get larger I want them to take up four
columns in width so four plus four plus
four means that they're going to be one
two three after one and each other in
one line okay so let's just have a quick
review of this in a browser what it was
like so this is on smaller screens where
the twelve columns in width and as we
get towards the medium screen which is
992 pixels yep
there is brakes and it goes to three in
a row like that alright so what I want
is to offset the first one right here
for smaller screens so let's dive back
into the code the way we do offsets is
by adding a bootstrap class and it's
pretty similar to the way we control the
width of the columns so all we do is say
Col extra small - offset and then I how
many columns we want to offset it by now
I'm going to do two alright so what I'm
saying is look for extra small screens
right I want you to offset this element
by two columns right now if we view this
in a browser
I've saved out let's just open it and
refresh now you can see the offset of
two columns but like I mentioned earlier
all it's done is moved it right off to
the screen here and it's probably gonna
go behind here like that and if that
would get this little scroll bar so we
can scroll across and see that okay so
not only do we need to add this offset
we also need to reduce the size of this
element now there's two columns of width
here that it's been upset and we want
two columns in width over here which
doesn't occupy well which the element
does not occupy okay so there's equal
space on both sides so what we need to
do is reduce the width of this to eight
because then eight plus two plus two is
twelve right so let's go back to the
code and reduce the width of that
element to eight columns for extra small
screens and go back and take a look okay
cool now we've got eight columns of
width in the middle then we've got a two
column offset on the right and then two
columns of space left
that's right on the left and then two
columns of space left on the right all
right so this is fine until we get to
that break point where we change the
column width at ninety two pixels and
then this kinda looks like a piece of
junk right so we've still got our two
column offset right here which means
that this one no longer fits on the end
over here because there's not enough
room so it's going down to the next line
now we don't want that to happen what we
want to do is reduce or take away this
offset when it gets to a medium screen
now we have to do that explicitly in the
code it doesn't just go away
by default when it gets to the next
breakpoint you have to take
get away explicitly all right so what we
do is go here and say Cole we have a new
class cult MD for medium screens offset
zero so what we're saying here is that
look when it gets to a medium screen I
want you to reduce the offset back to
zero all right so let's save this bad
boy take a look in the viewport again
and now it looks fine so for smaller
screens less than and your negative
pixels we've got this offset and we've
made this eight columns in width so
we've got this gap on the right and then
when it gets to that medium screen size
what we're doing is taking away that
offset completely so that they're all
still in one line all right so that is
offset guys if you have any questions
whatsoever about it feel free to leave a
comment down below otherwise I'll see
you in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
