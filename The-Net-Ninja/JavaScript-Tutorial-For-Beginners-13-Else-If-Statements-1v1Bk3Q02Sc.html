JavaScript for beginners lesson 13 and
in this video we're gonna talk about
else if statements wow horror they go so
in the last lesson you saw me talk
through and introduce if statements and
it was just a simple if statement that
checked whether a certain condition was
true if it was then it outputs something
to the browser over here if it wasn't
true then it fall back on the else
statement which would output a different
text to the browser so what if you want
to check for multiple different
conditions well you can use what's
called an else if statement and that
tags along on the back of an if
statement and I'll show you what I mean
by this what I'm going to do is declare
a variable call my oops my age I'm gonna
put that equal to 29 and then what I'm
going to do is write a simple if
statement to say if my age is over 30
then I'll document dot right so we go
right out to this document over here you
are over 30 okay so it's gonna check my
age if we solve the 30 it's gonna write
this out now in the past in the previous
lesson we were all else and then we did
a catch-all else here so if you didn't
equate to that if that was false then
we'd do an alternative buckle now what
if I want to check multiple different
conditions like this so well I can do
that by writing else if and then we can
put a different condition in here so I
could now say my age is over 20 and I'll
copy this over here and I'll paste it
within here and I'll just change that to
20 so this time I'm saying it's over 20
so if it's not over 30 but it's over 20
I can write you are over 20 to the
document and likewise I can do another
else if and this time I'll say if my age
is over 10 do another code block
and then paste this in again and I'll
change this to ten and this time I'm
checking if the age is over ten I'll
write this out and then finally we'll
just do it else not Nelson just to catch
everything else and we'll paste this in
once more to say you are not over ten
okay so the way this works is this we
start at the top and my age is assessed
in two over thirty then we write up this
if it's not over thirty we skip this and
we go to the next one
say else if my age is over twenty if we
saw me 20 then it writes out this one it
was not over 20 then it skips it and
goes down to this next else if then we
evaluate my age to be over ten if that's
true then it writes out this to the
document you are over ten if it's not
then it skips it again and this is the
final catch-all and because none of
these are true then we can write out and
safely assume that you are not over ten
all right makes sense so I'm gonna save
this now and we refresh over here and he
says you are over 20 which is right
because I'm 29 so my age is not over 30
but it gets down here my age is over 20
so then it writes out this but if I
change this to say 19 see yeah you are
over 10 so it's coming down to this one
if I put 9 in I can save and refresh you
are not over 10 and the final it let's
put 49 in because that's always 30
refresh you were over 30 perfect
so my friends that is what an else--if
statement is if you have any questions
whatsoever feel free to comment down
below I'm going to answer all of those
as soon as I can
