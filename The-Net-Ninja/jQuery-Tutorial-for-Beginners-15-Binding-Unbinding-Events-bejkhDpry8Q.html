jQuery for beginners lesson 15 and in
this video I want to talk about invent
binding Wow okay then going so as I've
already talked about in my JavaScript
for beginners playlist which by the way
I'll leave a link to down below in the
description events are at the heart of
any modern web application if you want
to click a button on a web page and
that's an even you must scroll down the
web page a little bit and that is also
an event you want to hover over an
element that is also an event pretty
much anything you do guys on a web site
is an event and we can--we jquery up to
listen to those events and then perform
certain actions when things happen on
that website for example I ever bought
another web site yet I can wire up
jQuery to listen to the click event of
that button so that when someone clicks
it the content expands right that is
jQuery why haven't got that event
listening out for it and when it happens
performing some function to react to it
okay now in vanilla JavaScript it's
always been a little bit tricky to
handle these events in any kind of
consistent manner at least across all
browsers and even though bonnet browsers
how to some degree standardize the whole
way they handle events it's still not
perfect especially if you want your
website to be backwards compatible
support all the browsers like IE 8 or
even IE 7 okay and a lot of clients guys
do want now so enter jQuery jQuery to
the rescue once again making event
handling extremely easy to do and it
also offers us a way to react to them
consistently and smoothly with the same
effects over all browsers so guys you no
longer have to worry about cross-browser
issues when it comes to binding events
and at the heart of it guys is just two
very very very simple methods on which
binds and events and matched elements
and off which unbinds events from
matched elements alright then so let's
do a little example what I want to do is
bind some events to these three Li tags
right here the points of sale so that
when someone clicks one of them will
make it highlight or change the
background of
to say to the user look you selected
this one yeah let's do that
so there's two steps to doing this first
of all we need to grab these Li tags and
store them in a variable and then we
need to bind a click event to those Li
tags and have a function called to react
to that click event when it happens all
right so let's do that first of all
we'll grab these allowed tags and store
them in a variable so they're in this
points of sale section right there so
we'll use jQuery to store these say var
my allies equals and then oops jQuery
and then it's the points of sale section
and Li tags within it so that my friends
has taken all of those Li tags one two
three and stored them in this variable
now all we need to do is call this on
method on this so we can say my allies
on and then we can attach an event each
one of these allies and that's going to
attach it to all three because remember
this returns an array of eight
those jQuery objects all right returning
all of those Li tags so we need to pass
through at least two parameters to this
method the first one is the event type
now I want to attach a click event to
the LI textbook this could be click load
hover submit scroll resize etc all right
there's tons of events so what I'll do
in fact is leave a link down below to a
website which is going to show you terms
of different events that you can play
around with in your own time we'll do a
click event now I'll do a comma and the
second parameter we need to pass through
is the callback function and this is the
function that is good fire when sort of
clicks one of these three things here
right when this event happens so if I
would have pre defined my function up
here does something like this function
my function and then fill that all that
blah blah blah then I could just go in
here and say my function call that
function up there and then fire that
when sort of clicks these all right but
I've not done that so what
do is just write the fiction out in here
itself
so we'll say and this can be
an anonymous function you don't have to
name it and we'll come down here and
we'll set up all the magic so what I'm
saying here is get the allies when
someone clicks one of these hell eyes
fire this function okay so what I want
to do is put a background color to
whichever Ally they click now we know we
can use this keyword to refer to
whatever object is currently in context
now if I click this this event is firing
and this keyword right here will refer
to which ever element I click so I could
use this to refer to the Li tag which
has been clicked yet now what I need to
do is wrap this up in the jQuery wrapper
like this because remember when you wrap
something up in the jQuery wrapper it
gives us access to those jQuery methods
and properties so now I can use the dot
CSS jQuery method on it and change the
CSS and I'm not going to do guys is give
this a background of pink that's all I'm
gonna do like that and if i refresh over
here and click one of these now we can
see that pink background when I click
them cool alright then but I want to
make a slight alteration to this what I
want is so that when saw it clicks one
of these they can no longer highlight
another all right so they can only
select one so for example let me refresh
again and click this one now if I was to
click this I don't want it to highlight
if I was to click this I don't want it
to hide them so to do that what we need
to do is unbind the event once it's
happened once right because we've
clicked it wants to begin with then we
unbind it so that it can't be done again
so to do this we need to use this off
method so when someone clicks it first
of all will change the background of
whichever element they click then under
here will unbind the event from all of
these alight acts so to do that all we
need to say is my alive dot off
and then specify which event we want to
turn off which is the click event or
right there
so I save that refresh over here click
one and now the others don't work cool
because we've found that event I'll do
one more I click this one now if I click
these it doesn't work awesome so that
guys is the on and off methods if you
have any questions about this whatsoever
