28 paisa 3 tutorial and in this video
I'm going to show you how to create a
thing lorem ipsum generator ok then so
now we know how to read and write files
using Python in this tutorial I want to
bring those two features together and I
want to create some kind of random lorem
ipsum generator so to begin with I've
already created this Epsom underscore
gen p/y file nothing in there just yet
that's in the project folder I've also
created in there an Epsom duct text file
which is some vanilla lorem ipsum I've
created another file which is blank core
ninja underscore Epsom so how is this
going to work well first of all what
we're going to do is read from this
Epsom text file this is some vanilla
lorem ipsum so we're going to read all
that first of all then we're going to
separate this into a list and each word
is going to be skinned in this list as
an element then what we're going to do
is run this list through some kind of
map function whereby we're going to
associate each word with a ninja words
as well and output that to a new list so
we're going to have some randomly
injected ninja themed words within this
text and we're going to then write that
text to this file right here so let's
just add them first thing I want to do
it create some ninja words now I'm not
going to write all these up from scratch
because that much is for you and me so
I've already copied and pasted these
from my github repository so there's 14
words in here in total and this list is
called ninja words so the next thing I
want to do is open the ipsum text files
or to read it so to do that I'm going to
say with and then open then the file we
want to open is it some txt and I'll say
us and it's going to be Epson from the
score original right that's the original
Epson file so we've opened that now what
I want to do is read the items read the
words so I'm going to say items this is
what this list of words is going to be
called and I'm going to set it equal to
X sub 1 to score original there's no
reference to the file and then dot read
we're going to read it and then once
we've read that we're going to get a
string and we're going to split that's
true
we use a method called split and that's
going to put each word as an element
into a list so this now is going to be a
list of words right cool so now what we
want to do is cycle through those words
and somehow associate each word with a
random ninja word right so how are we
going to do this well first of all we
need to know how many paragraphs we want
to output and we're going to ask the
user to define up so before we even open
the file what I'm going to say is
paragraphs and set that equal to int
because we're going to typecast whatever
the user input here and then it's going
to be input I'm going to ask the user to
enter harmony paragraphs of Ninja Tune
they want so string and we'll say how
many paragraphs of ninja exit okay so
they're going to enter say four so then
that's turned into an integer and then
that's drawing paragraph so we want four
paragraphs so each time around through
one of these paragraphs we want to
associate these item with these words
with some ninja words as well to mix it
up so what I'm going to do is construct
a for loop to loop through each
paragraph so I'll say for and in we're
going to use a range which we've learned
about already and this range is going to
be power graphs so say they enter three
this paragraph variable is going to be
three and then we're going to say for n
in range of three so that's from zero to
three make sense so then what we want to
do is say ninja underscore text this
would be equal to list we create a new
list remember based on this list what
we're going to use is the map function
inside here because what we want to do
is somehow kind of linearize our current
list so let's call this function that
we're going to use ninja rise so that's
the function we're going to pass each
item through I'm going to pass items
this list of items from this lorem ipsum
we read through into this map function
so each of these items is going to pass
through this ninja rise function and
output a new list here right so what we
need to do then is create this function
called linearised so okay what I'm going
to say is def and then ninja rise
and this is going to take in a word each
time around right so every time we're
looping through this items list we're
going to pass in each word through into
this mini Erised function right that's
what the map function does right here
so in this linearized search of what do
we want to do well what we want to do is
attach one of these ninja words to
whatever word was passed in okay so it's
going to be almost like a double-barrel
thing now we want each ninja word to be
random we want to randomly select one so
to do that I'm going to employ the help
of a module so I'm going to say from
random and then I want to import Rand
int so what this is going to do is allow
me to grab a random integer between two
numbers say between 1 and 10 and then we
can use that to grab an index out of
this list make sense
so the way we do this is by first of all
create a variable I'm going to call this
a random underscore pods for position
and this equal to be equal to R and in
so this is a function then we're going
to say we want a random integer from
zero because we start off on 0 on using
indexes and then we want to up to the
length of this list minus 1 I'll explain
this in a minute so it's really length
for the length and it's ninja underscore
words minus 1 so Y minus 1 well there's
14 words in this list but if we go to
the last one this is index 13 not 14
because it starts at 0 right so we want
to get the length which is 14 then minus
1 because we don't want to use an index
14 which doesn't exist the highest is
index 13 that's why we minus a 1 so
that's what we're getting a random in
between 0 and 13 in this case and we're
storing it in this variable so now what
we can do is we can leave this random
position to grab one of these words and
random word each time around so we're
going to return something here because
we're passed in a word we want to return
a string as well so we're going to
return and it should be a formatted
string so s first and then we're going
to output the word that we receive in so
the original lorem ipsum word then I
want to output as well a ninja word and
run do
word so I'm going to say ninja
underscore words and then use the square
bracket notation to say the index of one
of these things in here I'm going to cut
in the random underscore
pause variable so that could be anything
from 0 to 13 so we're giving it a random
word and place it next to the lara mix
and word that was passed in then we're
returning the two together in a string
right and we're doing that for each item
in this lorem ipsum list so now it's
going to get all jumbled up with ninja
words and vanilla lorem ipsum words and
that list is going to be stored in this
ninja underscore text right so now we
have this list of words what we want to
do now is write this to the new file
ninja ittsan
so how are we going to do that well what
we want to say is we want to open this
on a file so I'm going to say we're open
and then the file I want to open is
called ninja underscore exim txt and
we're going to say as a nopales it's erm
and underscore oops the bracket needs to
close over here so it's been called
gipson underscore ninja so that's our
reference to this new file then what
we're going to do is write to this so we
can say Epsom underscore ninja dots
right now the cat just writes this list
of words each of these elements in this
list it's just a word what we want to do
instead is join all those words together
in some kind of string so the way we do
that is by placing an empty string first
of all or rather a space in the string
this is going to be the connector what
connects all the words together and we
want them to be connected with a space
so there's a space between each
collection of words make sense so we
want to join that then with the list
which is ninja underscore text then what
we're going to do is + on a little bit
more so we're concatenated on a little
bit more to the string here and this is
just going to be a couple of libraries
so like slice n backslash n right that's
how we do the libraries so now then if
we save this if we run the file I'm
going to go to Python and it's called in
fact we need to
into the projects directory first of all
I mean the lessons one call a source a
CD or the level then CD projects then
I'm going to say paint them and this
file is called excerpt on the Scourge l
dot py let's run this how many
paragraphs of ninja tips and view one
okay let's say three and we get an error
the stupidly right here we've opened it
as read on it and we're trying to write
so remember we need to cut in this a
attribute here parameter right here to
say we want to write to this file or
amend to it now we're going to use a not
W because what we're doing is recycling
through this for each paragraph right so
once we've added one paragraph we then
don't want to overwrite it with a new
primer paragraph we want to amend a new
paragraph
okay make sense so let's save this again
a write once more and how to progress
three so now there's no error and if we
take a look in ninja Epson we should see
three paragraphs of rondo ninja themed
lorem ipsum there we go so just to run
through this one more time what are we
doing well first of all what asking to
use a handli paragraph they want and
we're converting that to an integer
which is stored in these paragraphs
variable right here then we're opening
this exome text weekly in the vanilla
long exome and we're reading that text
and we're splitting up that string that
we get back into a list so this list is
going to be a list of those individual
words inside that text so then what
we're going to do is we're going to use
a for loop to cycle through how many
paragraphs we have requested sort of
this three or cycle through these three
times each time around what we're doing
is the same this variable ninja text is
going to be equal to a list then we're
going to map the current items right
here the items which are the original
list of words we're going to pass each
of those items into this linearized
function which is getting a random
integer between 0 and 30 min this case
to select a random ninja word then we're
placing that ninja word next to the
original word we passed in the original
vanilla lorem ipsum word placing those
two together in a string and we're
returning that string so those return
strings are then stored in this
right here then what we're doing is
opening this ninja episode text file we
say we want to amend to that file
each time around so we can write to it
we refer to that as Apes and ninja that
we said want to write to it and we want
to join everything together inside this
ninja text list so every set of words
inside this list right here we're
joining together and the connector is
going to be this space so in between
each set of words there's going to be a
space they won't add it on these line
breaks at the end of all of that
paragraph so the next paragraph is a
couple of lines down okay so we're
cycling through that and doing that for
as many times as we requested then we
get this ninja tip some are right over
here so there we go that's how we create
a random item generator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
