and final of UGS tutorial and in this
video we're going to continue hooking up
our application at to you at firebase so
then in the last tutorial we took this
add blog component and we hooked it up
to our firebase database therefore when
we start to add content here and then
click Add it's going to send it to our
own database or rather than that fake
arrest API endpoint so that's all cool
store in our old blogs now however when
we go to blog we're still listing all of
that dummy content from the fake arrest
API we don't want to do that and
likewise when we click into one of them
we're getting that dummy content as well
again we don't want to do that we want
to link these two components up now to
our firebase database so we can retrieve
our own posts and show them okay
so then in the last tutorial we change
the endpoint to this thing right here
we're going to post it to this
collection that's when we add a new blog
we're also going to retrieve a from this
collection right here so let's just copy
this URL we're going to use exactly the
same one in our show logs components so
show blog's component is the one that
lists all of our blogs so if we go down
here to the bottom currently we're using
this JSON placeholder thing right here
we don't want to do that we want to grab
our posts from our 5x in the post
collection so we're going to use it with
that URL also this is still returning a
promise so we can check on a.net then
we're going to call that function with
the data we've retrieved we no longer
want to do this thing where I start
slicing stuff up instead we just want to
want this to the console to see what it
is giving us so let us now come over and
open the console to see exactly what is
being returned to us I'm just going to
give this a quick refresh as well so
we're going to click on Seoul now we can
see we're getting this response from
firebase and there's a lot of different
stuff in here headers body text status
mmm we're not interested in all of that
all we need is this stuff in the body
and you can see these four objects are
in the body okay and in each object we
have four different properties also
categories content and title then what
we're going to output to the screen
however there's one little problem here
in the last tutorial off
rather a few tutorials back when we
added links to each individual blog
right here remember we added this router
link we tacked on this ID right here so
that when we go to the single blog
component we can grab this route
parameter this ID and we can use it to
query the database to get the exact post
we want using that baby now this ID
property existed on that fake Jason we
grabbed but it does not exist in our
data from firebase we don't have an ID
property right here however what we do
have is this unique key so each one of
these objects which refers to a blog
post has this unique key kind of
associated with it so I guess what we
could do is somehow use this so I'd like
to pop an ID property in here when we
retrieve the data and that ID is going
to be this thing right here so when we
add it onto the link right there we're
just adding on this string this unique
string this key onto the link so that
when we go to the single component we
can grab that string that unique ID and
we can query firebase to go and grab it
make sense cool that's what we're going
to do then so first things first we want
to pass this stuff so we just get the
body back okay we want to pass that we
want to get some JSON data just to get
the body so how are we going to do that
well it's pretty simple all we need to
do is come down here and we can say data
jason and that is a function okay not
sejoon Jason okay that is a function and
bear with me here I'm just going to log
this to the console as well so you know
what I'm going to do so if we try to
love this then what we are in fact going
to get back is this right here it is a
promise we're not getting that JSON data
back to us so this right here is an
asynchronous task meaning it's going to
take some time to complete therefore we
cannot just use data Jason we have to
wait until that task is done then it's
going to return us some data so this
right here is returning to us this
promise object right so that means we
can use at some point the dot then when
it's completed to fire some kind of
function and actually get that data so
check this out this is what we're going
to do we're going to reach
this we're going to return data Jason so
what that is going to do in effect is
make this whole thing return this okay
so therefore since we're returning this
and that is a promise we get access to
that promise interface and we can tack
on a dot then method and inside this
method this is the callback function
which is going to fire when this thing
has completed so when it has completed
its going to find this callback function
and passes the actual data that we want
the JSON data so now in this function we
can access that data and I'll show you
by logging it to the console so console
that log and the data again so if we
save this and check it out now if we
refresh just to get a clean console we
can see now this Jason data awesome so
what is this this is one object right
one object and inside we have all of
these four objects so it's four of our
blog posts within one global kind of
object okay so what we really want to do
now since we want to add on the ID
property right here yep we want to cycle
through these objects within this object
and in each case what we want to do is
add on in the ID property which is equal
to kind of like this key right here of
the object itself make sense how are we
going to do that
pretty simply again and we can achieve
this in about three or four lines of
code so what we're going to need to do
is use a four in loop to cycle through
those objects and I'll explain that in a
second first of all what I will do is
create a variable and this is going to
be called blogs array and this is going
to be a temporary array to store the new
blog in with the ID property so we've
got that empty array now and now what we
want to do is cycle through those
objects so I'll say for and then inside
let key in Dayton so what is this going
to do well this key thing right here is
going to refer to this thing right here
okay so this for loop is going to cycle
through this object right here this kind
of block this parent object we like so a
cycle through the mote and for each time
it cycles through it's going to give us
access to the key
which is listing and logs those to the
console now so you can see what they are
until that log the key in each cycle
through so if I save that now check this
out you can see all of these are logged
to the console so they're the keys it
gives us access to so we're grabbing
that each come around for each one and
also the data right here is just the
overall parent object each time it's not
this object each time it's this overall
object okay so say for instance I wanted
to access the object each time around
well what I could do is the data and
then in square brackets the key this is
a bit like a Rea notation but we're
using it in an object this time so we're
saying okay well in the global kind of
parent object that you're giving us back
then I want you to pass the key in
whatever the key is so with this one
this one this one this one and that's
going to give me access to the actual
object each time around so if I save
this now and view in the browser we're
going to see those four objects output
to the console okay one two three four
and each object now is referring to a
blog post so what we can do now is in
each time we cycle through and get this
object add on that egg D property so let
us do that I'm just going to delete this
console that log message and instead
what I'm going to do is say data and
then key so whatever object we are
currently on essentially and then add on
a property called ID and that is going
to equal to the key remember this unique
kind of string thing right so okay
they're not here but the Dehlia these
unique kind of keys right here that is
going to be the ID and we're going to
attach that to each blog object right so
we've done that now and then what we
want to do is push this object to this
temporary array this temporary Bloggs
array so we'll say Bloggs array and then
dot push and then we're going to push on
the object so data key right make sense
so now let us look instead the blog's
array down here to see what we've got
so let's save that and refresh in fact
we don't need to refresh so now we have
this array this is
slugs array that will log into the
console and if we open that up we have
these individual objects inside and now
these objects have an ID awesome so now
when we're out putting that ID okay it's
going to grab that property and attach
it to this URL so when we go to that URL
we can grab that ID and query the
database to get the exact posse one okay
so now we have those blogs in this
temporary array but this blogs array
right hook up here is still empty right
and this is the stuff that's being
output up here so we need to populate
this now so all we need to really say is
this top blogs she's referring to this
property right here
remember this refers to the instance of
this component and then it dots blogs is
this property right here so we're going
to set that equal to you've guessed it
listing right here blogs array
makes sense so now we're taking
everything we've just kind of created
and pushed in here and we're assigning
it to this data here so now when we
cycle through them then we can output
that gate here now there is going to be
just one issue and I'm going to show you
that in a minute if we've using a
browser now I'm going to refresh and
we're probably going to get an error yet
Darius and if you didn't know what was
going on this mind kind of stumped you
for a little while because it's talking
about slicing stuffing remember we took
that sliced or file and is no slicing
going on here so what is it
well actually it's this thing right here
this snippet thing because we're slicing
something which doesn't actually exist
we're same blog body now in our content
it's actually blog content blogged up
body was the the property when we use
that JSON data that fake JSON data
before but now it's blog content instead
so let's just replace this with content
and now this should work so if we
refresh to go clean console hopefully
fingers crossed no errors awesome so
let's see do we get these yep we get
each individual now blog post being
output there and if I hover over one of
these I don't know whether you're going
to be able to see this but in fact if I
inspect the element then we should see
that the link is going to include that
you
I D right there yeah unique ID is in the
URL so when we go now to the single blog
component that is the route parameter
we're going to grab to use and query the
database to grab that single blog and
we're going to do that now so then in
the single blog component this is where
we're grabbing that route parameter
right here okay so we're still grabbing
it we don't need to change that we're
grabbing that unique key and we just
need to change this URL right here so
remember this time we go in to firebase
forward slash post Jason so let's grab
that from here like so and if we add
this in here as well then we're going to
the same collection right here but you
see this thing Jason we don't want that
there now instead we want it at the end
because we're attaching this ID thing
right here so we'll say plus at the end
and then attack on this Datsun Jason now
that's fine because we're getting the
unique ID that's one single blog post
right so same again returns a promise
fire this function returns the data
again what we want to do is pass the
body so we want JSON data so we're going
to say return and it's data
Jason that returns a promise remember so
therefore let's just get rid of this
stuff
we can tack on dot then which finds
another callback function and inside
here we actually get the JSON data so
we'll save data and inside of this we
can say this blog which is listing right
here this object at the minute this
empty object and we're going to set that
equal to whatever data we get back okay
so that's just going to be a single blog
that's going to populate this thing
right here and then in the template
without put in a blog title the blog
body which doesn't exist remember we
want blog contents so let's save this
now and let's just see if it's work so
if I now refresh and this time I'm going
to click on one of my blogs holdall and
hopefully it's not worked let's just
inspect the element and find out why
okay so the data is not coming through
and I think that's because yep I've
missed off this /r right here so I
needed that forward slash because it's
posts then forward slash then the actual
ID so I've a saved this dude now now it
should work if i refresh now we can see
that blog right there and just go
refresh you'll get a clean console and
yeah it all works
let's just go back to the blog and make
sure this is all fine now so my fav T's
click on that whoop I'm getting my
fifties and lost in space yet these are
all working so now we're able to output
our own data click into that data and
view more about it just a couple of
things and I just want to add on a
couple more properties out here in the
template because remember we have access
also to the author and the categories so
why not output them I'm going to say P
and I'll say author first of all and
that is going to be the blog author
so we'll say blog Lots Arthur and then
underneath that let output the
categories put those in a ul and then
inside that net li and remember we need
to use v4 because categories is in a
rate so 3 - 4 is equal to it's going to
be a category in blog categories that's
the property name and outside here we
will just output the category like some
so let's save that and check it out your
browser once more now we get the author
and the categories and if we go back and
check a different one lost in space
awesome offer and categories so there we
go we are made our own simple blog using
view J's and firebase and unfortunately
now this is the end of the series this
could have gone on forever but I thought
44 tutorials is enough for now
in the future I am going to be doing a
view X which is going to help us with
state management and our data and maybe
even build a project from scratch using
vue.js so I hope this has been on some
benefits here if you do like these
tutorials please my friends don't forget
to share them subscribe and like the
videos it really helps a lot I'm going
to see you in the very next tutorial
