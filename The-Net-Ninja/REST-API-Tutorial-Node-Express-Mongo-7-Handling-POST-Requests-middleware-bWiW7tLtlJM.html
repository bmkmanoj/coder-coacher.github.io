REST API tutorial and in this video I
want to talk about potion quests and
body parts all random some now we're in
a position where we've created our four
basic route handlers one for get
requests what's a post will support and
one for delete requests in this video I
want to focus on the post request so
someone is going to be making a post
request when they want to add data okay
they want to send new data to the server
to add it to the database in our example
they're going to be sending that data to
forward slash API /ik ninjas and
hopefully they're going to be sending
that data in JSON format and that JSON
object is going to represent a new ninja
they want to add to the database but how
do we attach this data to this post
request
well they attach it to what's known as
the request audit so say for example
you're using jQuery to send a post
request in this ajax method provided by
jQuery we specified a method of the
request which is post the endpoint which
is forward slash API forward slash
Inge's and then the data which we want
to attach to the body so jQuery is going
to take this and say okay and make it a
post request to this URL and the data
I'm attaching to the body is this object
right here with a name property and a
rent property so that's how we simply
make a potion question send some data
using jQuery but I want to be able to
visualize this a little bit more so I'm
going to show you how to do this impulse
map so in postman we're going to
simulate a post request and send some
data in the body of the request so first
of all we want to make sure that this is
set to post we're going to the correct
route which is /font API forward slash
ninjas then down here if we click on
body we can add in some data in the body
which we want to send to the server we
want to click this row so we can send
some raw JSON data also click this drop
down to say we want to send JSON data so
I've already copied a psalm jason from
this thing right here i'm just going to
copy this and paste it into here so now
we're sending this json object to the
server and if we click send just going
to send that along
and yeah we're not really getting
anything back to say that it's
successfully received that data or we
get back is this response right here to
say the type of request is made is a
post request but we have sent that data
now to the server in the body of the
request okay so at the minute in this
post handler right here all we're doing
is saying okay send this response which
is this object which we saw in postman
but we want to for example send back the
data which we received or we want to
take that data we want to store in the
database how do we access this data in
the body within this handler right here
well unfortunately no GS and expression
don't give us that kind of functionality
out of the box but we can install body
parser to do that for us and body parser
is what's known as a middleware so
before we install that I just want to
talk a little bit about what made aware
is first of all okay so this is the
current setup we have our Express app
over here on the right we have our
request coming in it hits the express up
the express up looks at the type of
request hands it off to the correct
route Handler and that does something
with the request and then it sends a
response out okay so this code right
here is fired between the requests
coming in and the response going out so
any code which is fired between these
two points is known as middleware okay
so in essence these round handlers right
here these are middle where they're just
code which is executed between these two
points between the request coming in and
the response going out and we use this
middle weather by seeing app that use
then the middleware we want to use okay
so if we added more middleware to this
kind of cycle we just say app don't use
then what as a middleware so the request
will come in hit this middleware this
was fighting cold then it would move on
this way some cold moves on this five
some code and then it sends back the
response so we've used three different
middlewares here so what if we want to
use the body parser well we use it at
the top right here we take up that used
in the body parser so when the request
comes in the body parser is going to
basically look
the body of the request is going to take
it it's going to pass it and attach it
to the request object and remember in
these route handlers we get access to
that request object so by the time that
request object goes to the route handler
we have access to that data from the
body because listing has attached it to
the request object for us okay so we can
say request up body and it gives us that
data and order here is very important
because if this was after here if we
used it after this in the code then
we're not going to have that data
available to us it's going to hit this
route handler and the body pastor is not
putting to much it yet we're not going
to have access to that body data so this
needs to go first in the cycle so what
we're going to do now is install body
parser so make sure you're in the
correct directory then say npm install
body - parser and then we're going to
save it to our dependencies cool so once
that's installed we can now use it in
our application now the first thing we
want to do is go to index yes and there
require it at the top up here so I'm
going to say Const body
tarter and set that equal to require and
then it's body
- parser so now we can use that in this
file so I said that order with
importance we need to go above this
middleware right here which is for our
route because we need access by this
point so I'm going to say up here app
got used and then we're going to use
this thing right here the body parser
which we just required now body parsing
can pass different types of body for us
we want to accept JSON data so we're
going to say dot jason then that's going
to pass that json data for us attach it
to the request objects on the by the
time we reach the wrap handler it's
going to have access to it cool so
that's all there is to it right here now
when we go to our route we can say in
this post handler right here request
body to access whatever was sent to us
so let's log this to the console I'm
going to say console log then open up my
parenthesis and close them off right
here
shows that now so now when we make a
request hopefully it's going to log the
request body to the console right here
okay so let's say no advanced index just
to fire this up come to postman and
we're going to send this request again
so click send then if we go to the
console you can see now we get this
logged to the console pretty cool so
let's also try one more thing let's try
sending this object back to the client
right here so we can see in the response
so how do we do that
well all we need to do is edit this
object that we're singing back so we'll
keep this post property on right here so
we know what type of requests we're
making then down here I'm going to send
out the name and that was request body
and then it was the name property right
here you can see name and rank for the
two properties we sent so we can say
don't name to access just the name
profit I'm going to also send back the
runt which was request body dot rank
save that and now if we make a request
again we get those back in the response
pretty cool right so now we have
successfully access the body of the post
request inside this route handler so now
what we can do is take that body and we
can send it to the database but first of
all what we need to do is actually
connect a MongoDB into this application
so we're going to address that in the
very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
