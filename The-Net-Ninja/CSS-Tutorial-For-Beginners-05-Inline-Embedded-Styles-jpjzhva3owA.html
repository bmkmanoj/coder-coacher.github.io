yo ninjas what the hell is up my name's
Shawn from the net ninja and this is yes
that's beginners lesson five embedded
and inline styling Wow so there's three
ways to add CSS to your document and the
first way is by inline styling and that
is not enough putting BC in there that y
UK that is York because I can't stand
inline styling second way embedded style
sheets again York don't like it third
way external stylesheets cowabunga don't
ask me why I put Cowabunga Avenue close
the first movement pops into my head and
in my head it means it's great
so inline styling right the reasons I
don't like it is because it's
time-consuming to style multiple
elements okay if you have a ton of
different elements on your HTML document
and you want to style all those so
you've got I don't know 50 P tags and
you want to give them all the same style
you have to go into each P tag
individually and style them so it's
going to take you forever just to make
one page and the second reason is tricky
to manage an update say for example
you've done all those Styles on those P
tags and then you want to change the
color lo behold you have to go through
all of them again and change the styles
thirdly it's messy it makes your hast
email look terrible if you're putting
inline Styles all over the place it's
going to look disgusting
now there is a reason to use inline
styling and it's a very specific reason
okay if you have a tag that has a very
specialized purpose I don't know maybe
it's some kind of warning message and
you want this tag to override any of the
styles then feel free in this one case
you could use a specialized in line rule
on that tag and I'll show you that later
okay the second way of doing it embedded
styling again it's time consuming to
apply global styles if you have various
pages and you want to style P tags on
each of those pages the same you have to
go into each page and embed an internal
style sheet on each of those pages so
very time-consuming hard to maintain an
update if you want to change anything
again
have to go into all of those pages
separately and/or date your inline
embedded stylesheet
the reason I like these and I say like
loosely I don't really like them but
they do have their uses and that's
because they're good for making specific
page styles so if you have one page that
is radically different from the rest and
you have very unique styles on this page
then feel free you can embed an internal
style sheet on this page to overwrite
kind of global external style sheets now
I'm not going to go into external style
sheets now that's for the next video so
what I'm going to do now is jump back
into the code and we're going to have a
look at inline and embedded styling Wow
okay so here I am back in brackets and
we're in the same HTML document as last
time now I'm going to add some inline
styling first of all and this is how you
do it
say I want to style this header element
here what I want to do is add a style
attribute and we don't want if you don't
know what attributes are then you best
check out my HTML basics course I'll pop
a link to that video down below where I
discuss attributes then come back here
so we're going to add a style attribute
this is where we control the CSS all
within this one attribute if we're doing
inline styling and the same as when we
added
properties and values in our declaration
in rules in the last video we're going
to have we're going to add properties
and values within this style attribute
okay so say I want to make this header
position absolute exactly the same way
we've got our property here with the
colon then our value of the property
here with a semicolon and then we can
just stack these side-by-side so I can
add another one I can say top:0 left:0
with 100% okay and again don't pay
attention to what I'm doing here to
these properties and values I'm just
showing you how to add inline styles via
this style tab okay so that's how we do
them now I mentioned that it's hard to
update and it's hard to add styles to
everything let's take this for an
example I'm going to copy this P tag I'm
going to paste it well
I don't know five six times and I want
to start these all the same way now I'm
going to have to go into this let's say
style font size 10 pixels okay now I
want to do that for each one each P tag
so I'm going to have to get this copy it
go here paste paste paste now that's
going to get boring really quickly and
this is just what seven or eight tags if
you have 20 tags on your page and you
have 20 pages just imagine how lot of
thought is going to take I would not
want to be in your shoes so there's
better ways to do this okay and one
slightly better way is by using an
embedded style sheet so I'm going to
delete all these right now so they don't
conflict and then what we do to embed a
style sheet we go into the head tag and
we open our style tag here brackets
automatically closes it for me
and then within these two style tags we
add our rules of CSS rules just as we
did in the previous movie in an external
style sheet exactly the same so I could
just say here P and then do my
declaration between the curly braces
font size 10 pixels and now instead of
writing it multiple times in each tag
that's going to grab all of these P tags
and this one here as well on the page
and it's going to give them all a font
size of 10 pixels so you can imagine how
much easier that is to update than
inline styling okay now again there is a
problem with this imagine we had a few
pages and I've already made one more
here this contact page and it's very
simple but again I've got a simple P tag
here and in fact I'm going to copy and
paste this a few times okay now we've
got two pages so we want exactly the
same styles on both pages now this style
sheet here is not going to affect the
contact piece here because we've not got
this style embedded in the head so what
we have to do is copy that's getting the
index copy this style tag and everything
in it go to the contact page and paste
it
to our head again and now that works
however if you have 20 pages you're
going to have to do this on every page
so again pretty time-consuming and
imagine this half way down the line
you're making a website for a client and
then you show him your first version
where all the fonts read and then he
says hey you know what I've changed your
mind I want the font blue that is going
to be a shot in the foot because you're
going to have to go through each page
and you're going to have to change the
color here if it was color red you're
going to have to go into each page and
change the color to blue and that's just
one property change imagine if you
wanted to change a whole lot of things
on each page you're going to have to go
in and style every page change rules in
every embedded stylesheet okay and
that's why I don't like them I prefer to
have an external stylesheet and then we
link into every page and then we just
have to change it once and it updates
all the pages and I'm going to tell you
about that in the next episode the next
movie alright so I did say they have
their uses and yes they do and I'll
cover this embedded style sheet useful
imagine just on the index page we have
this welcome message okay and we're
going to give this a class of welcome
okay and we just have this Welcome
message here now if this was only on
this page then there is no need to style
this in an external style sheet that is
going to be global globally accessible
from every page because it's only going
to affect this one page so we could just
style it here in this one page in this
embedded style sheet so what we do is
put the class of the period remember
that start to class and then we'd go
welcome and then we take font size 10
pixels color red because we want the
welcome text to be read and that's a
good example of when to use an embedded
style sheet a good example of when to
use an inline style is something similar
and instead of having this here we could
just do we could just go here and have
other style equals font size 10 pixels
color
red and that will do the same trick okay
so there they do have the uses and very
occasionally you use them sparingly
otherwise it can be really difficult to
update okay so that about covers it for
into embedded and inline styling if you
have any questions don't forget to
comment below and answer all of those as
soon as I can subscribe to these videos
if you like them and I'll see you guys
in the next video where we're going to
be covering external stylesheets
