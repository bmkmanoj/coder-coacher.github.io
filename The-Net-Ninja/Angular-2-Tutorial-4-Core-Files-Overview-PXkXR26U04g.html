fourth angular 2 tutorial and in this
video I'm going to give you a quick
overview of the core files that were
created in our base project ok then so a
couple of tutorials but we went ahead
and created a new project using the
angular CLI and it created this
directory right here this is the name of
the project and all these folders and
files within it and like I say this
looks like a lot of files and folders
for an empty project but you don't need
to worry about most of them so just to
quickly go through it this first one
right here this config folder this just
hold hold some configuration for your
environments and other things you're not
really going to need to touch that at
all in this tutorial series this next
one this dist folder stands for
distribution this is where our
distributed code is going to be stored
and I'll explain that in a minute but we
don't need to go in there and edit
anything directly ever and this ete
folder has some config for typescript
and other things we don't need to go in
there this node modules folder holds all
of the modules that are installed for
angular to work so we don't need to go
in there either this public folder is
where we're going to store any assets
that we want to use such as style sheets
or images we can pop those in there and
this source folder is where we're going
to be working for most of the time and
it's got this app form inside it as well
as these other files as well I'm going
to come back to this folder in a minute
and this temp folder is to do with when
we're converting typescript into
JavaScript etc then we have a few of the
files down here such as package.json etc
we don't need to worry about any of this
the only thing we really need to worry
about is this source folder right here
this is where we're going to make all of
our application code and if we want to
dump any files any public files we can
pop them in this public folder as well
so since we're writing with typescript
in angular 2 and browsers don't
understand typescript they older they
only understand JavaScript what we need
to do is have a way of converting this
typescript that we write into JavaScript
now fortunately angular takes care of
all of that for us
but that is what that distribution
folder is for we write all of our
application code in this source folder
right here on it's all in typescript
then when we build it it is output in
JavaScript it's converted to JavaScript
compiled and its output in this
distribution folder right here okay so
we don't need to directly touch this
angular takes care of all the heavy
lifting for us converts what we write in
the source folder into JavaScript
outputs it here so that browsers can
understand it okay so let's just have a
quick look inside this source folder
first of all we've got this index dot
HTML file and by the way if none of this
makes much sense at the minute don't
worry I'm only quickly going through
each of the different parts of this
folder structure right now and we're
going to look into the different
components and sections in more detail
as we go back so anyway this index dot
HTML file this is the root index file
which fires when we load up the
application and we've got some
bog-standard stuff in the head you can
see up here and down here we have got a
app root tag right here and you'll
notice that is not a hate Gmail tag that
is a directive tag and we're going to
talk about more in detail about those
later then down here we've got this
script right here which is importing the
system config that's a file and it's
also importing this main TS file and
notice there's no TS extension on the
end there and when we import something
which is a tech script file we don't
need to put dot t-- s on the end it
automatically recognizes that it's going
to look for a typescript file ok so when
it imports this main typescript file
that's right here so if we're clicking
here you can see it's just important a
few different things like so don't worry
about those in a minute and then what
it's doing is calling this function
right here bootstrap and it's
bootstrapping our application which
basically means it's setting it all up
so that it works and we're going to look
at that a little bit later on as well ok
so now then in the app folder this is
where all of our different components
that we create for our website or
different sections of our website at
different states different pages that's
all that kind of code is going to live
now at the minute there's just one
component and for each component you'll
see it's got component TS file
component spec TS component HTML and
component CSS and that's all for the app
component okay so we've got all those
four files just for that one component
component now in this tutorial series
we're not going to look at this file
right here dot spec this is to do with
testing I'm just going to delete that
for now get it other way and we're going
to be focusing on these three or rather
these two the HTML and the types cripple
so for example we could have a component
for our navigation and we'd have a nav
component es navin ponent or HTML and
now that component dot CSS if we want as
well alright and that component is going
to control the functionality and the
view of that part of the website of that
component right and in each component we
have a class which is the name of that
component then we have some code within
the class which I'm going to go through
later on by the way this is the title
which is output onto the page when we
run it when we used ng serve before that
is what came out so we have that class
in each component we have a decorator
which is one of these things right here
and signified by this @ symbol and we
import anything within that we need in
this component there at the top and
again don't worry too much this is a
really quick overview so that is what
the component kind of cold looks like
how we kind of interact with that
component view etc it's all done here
then this is the view for that one
component as well now right now should
the h1 tag and we'll output in that
title which is in this thing right here
okay so we're sharing that data between
this class in the component type script
file and we can share that data right
here and we'll output it ok so there you
go that is your very quick overview of
the core files in this blank project we
are going to go into more detail in each
section of those different areas as we
move through this tutorial series and
we're going to start by taking a look at
components in the very next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
