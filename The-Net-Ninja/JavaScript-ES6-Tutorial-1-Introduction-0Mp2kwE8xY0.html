very first atma script six tutorial ah
so what the hell is ever script well
there is a little bit of confusion among
some developers as to what it is but
basically Eggman script is just the
result of Microsoft and Netscape banging
their heads together many many moons ago
to try and come up with a standard for
their scripting languages which they
were using so Microsoft was using what's
known as a script and Netscape we're
using JavaScript so every script is just
a standard for scripting languages so
when you're writing JavaScript you're
actually just writing an implementation
of atmos crypt and the version you're
probably writing in at the minute is
atma script 5 which is the version that
is currently supported in all browsers
so ACMA script 6 is just the latest
standardized version of es atma script
and includes tons of new features which
we are going to dive into in this
playlist that we're going to explore all
of those later but as of yet it's not
fully supported in all browsers so this
is the current state of supporting
browsers and you can see there's quite a
lot of red blocks flowing around and
they're the instances in which a set
feature is not supported in whichever
browser it corresponds to or polyfill or
server etc so this isn't exactly ideal I
mean if you were going to use this in a
live project then you're probably going
to want to use something called a
transpiler which will essentially take
your es6 code and transpile it into es5
so that it works in browsers now one
transpiler you could use is a Babel or
Babel don't know how to pronounce it so
I'll leave the link to this website down
below you can come and check this out
I'm not going to use this in this course
I'm just going to use Google Chrome
Canary now this is a kind of development
browser for Google where they test out
loads of new features it's not entirely
stable all the time and it sometimes
does crash but I always use it for
developing in because it does contain
all the kind of latest features so you
get a sneak preview of those and it's
got good support for es6 you can see my
current browser here which is canary
and supports a lot of these es6 features
so that's what I'm going to be using in
this playlist so we'll leave this link
double or you can go ahead and download
that if you want or you can learn more
about Babylon Babel that's up to you for
simplicity I think this would be the
easiest way to start learning so yeah go
ahead and download that I am also going
to be using brackets as my text editor I
thought I'd tell you guys here that
because a lot of people always ask me
which text editor I'm using so it's
brackets for this tutorial playlist it's
free and it's pretty cool so yeah go
ahead and download that I'll leave the
link down below one final thing guys
this is not going to be an extensive
JavaScript tutorial playlist I'm not
going to go into all the core JavaScript
essentials this is just going to be the
new features available in es6 so you
probably should know some JavaScript to
begin with before you kind of dive into
this playlist if you don't know any
JavaScript then I've got a course up
here called JavaScript for beginners so
I'll leave the link to that down below
so you can go ahead check that out first
and then come back to this so otherwise
guys I hope you enjoy this playlist and
I'll see you in a very next tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
