tutorial and in this video we're going
to talk about how we can use computed
properties with view X alright so in the
last tutorial we created this central
store using view X and right now this
store is just sitting around doing
nothing
yeah we've exported it but we're not
importing it anywhere and what we need
to do to use this central store in our
application is to import this first of
all into our main J's file and say that
we want to use this store within this
view instance remember this view
instance is controlling pretty much
everything in our application it's
taking over this ID in the HTML template
and it's replacing it with all of our
view component code right so we need to
say that within this view instance we
want to use our data store and to do
that first of all we need to import that
store into this file so I'm going to say
import and then we're importing the
store that we exported remember we call
it store right here so we're importing
that from and then it's doctor 5/2 say
current directory first of all then it's
the store folder then it's stored up yes
we don't need to say doctor UI phas
though ok cool so we've imported that
now now we need to say we want to use it
so I'm going to come underneath here and
say store is store ok
so we're seeing right here that the data
store we want to use is store which is
this thing we've just imported and now
we can use it in this application and we
can reach out and grab data from the
store in our different components which
is what we're going to do now so if we
go to our first component product this
one we want to grab that data from
listing first of all we no longer need
to receive any data as a prop and in
fact if we go to our root component app
top view we no longer need to pass down
any data here as props either so we'll
remove those as well because what
accessing all the data now from the
store so if we go back to our product
list one we're no longer receiving any
data as a prop this time we want to
reach out to the central store and get
data
that now the way we do that is not in
the data function right here we do it in
a computed property because we're not
defining the data on this component we
use the computed property to compute it
if you like to reach out and get it so
what I'm going to do is just actually
delete this data fan out so instead I
want to create a computed property so
I'll say computed first of all kind of
spell note so computed as that is an
object and inside this object if we just
scoot it up a little bit okay inside
this object I want to create a computed
property called products so products it
matches up to you what we're using it oh
right here okay so in here we need to
return a value so where it says
something first of all and now we're
going to reach out to the store and to
do that we can say this which refers to
this component first of all and I can
say dots dollar sign store and we can do
that because we've installed view X and
we've used it in our application so we
can say now we want to access the store
and on the store we want to access the
state property remember in this store we
created this thing right here State
right so we're accessing the state and
we want to access the products property
on the state which is this thing right
here make sense
so now we're grabbing those products and
we're retaining those in this computed
property so when we refer to products
now we're actually refer to referring to
the data that's on the store called
product make sense cool so now if we
save this and view in the browser we
should see the products in product list
one awesome so we're now successfully
receiving that data from the store and
outputting them right here let's do the
same thing for our other component I'm
just going to copy this dude so that I
paste it I don't want to write it all
out again
and again we can delete the props thing
right there and the data so let's delete
that and paste this in instead so again
we're making a computed property called
products and getting the same data from
the store I have a save this now
hopefully we should get down here and
product list too as well voila we do
okay
so congratulations you've created your
first store using view X and we've
accessed data from it so the good thing
now is that if we want to access data we
don't need to mess around with props to
access that data we can just use a
computed property to reach out to our
store and grab that data now this might
seem a bit like overkill for a project
as small as this because we've only got
two components and one set of data seems
like a lot of work just for this little
application now fair enough I agree with
you and in a case like this where you're
making an application this small you
probably don't need to use view X what
view X gets really good when you're
making much larger applications with
lots of components which share data and
need to compute communicate with each
other so we don't have all of that props
handed down from component to component
and event firing back up okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
