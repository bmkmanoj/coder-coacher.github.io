fifth CSS grid tutorial and in this
video I'm gonna show you how to nest
grids within one another
alright then so at the minute you can
see I've got this content right here
which is the grid wrapper and inside
I've got six divs and I've said up here
grid template columns repeat three 1fr
so I should end up with three columns
each with one fraction all the same
width and it looks something like this
so we have our three columns and two
rows because the six elements now in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can nest another grid inside for example
an element inside this grid so say for
example inside this fourth element we
want to nest another grid so we have
maybe four boxes inside this display
this grid so let's do that it's very
simple to do this inside here instead of
four what I will do instead is give this
a class of nested so we can style it in
a second so class equals a nested and
then inside here I'm going to do four P
tags so P and then inside that one I'll
just copy this dude right here and paste
it again
another three times and then we'll say
number two for this one number three for
this one and number four for this one so
if I save it the minute then we're just
gonna see these four P tags right here
now we don't want this
what we want is these to be one two
three four as some kind of grid right so
this is really simple to do first of all
we want to take this div right here and
we need to display it as grid because
this is essentially the wrapper for
gridding these items right so up here
let's say nested and then we're going to
display this as grid so display said
that's a grid and then the first thing
we need to do is define our columns
right now I'd like two columns so one
two so there's two rows of two elements
so to do that I'm going to say grid -
template - columns then it's going to be
one fr one Fr so each column is going to
be one fraction and the same width then
what I'm going to do is define a grid
gap so a grid - gap of 10 pixels and
this basically means
that there's gonna be a little gap
between each element right here and
we're going to be able to see that gap
if I place a border around each element
which I'll do now I'll say nested and
then the PTO's within that nested div
border one pixel solid and it's going to
be white
FFF and then I'm also going to give each
element a padding of 20 pixels and a
margin of 0 will strip away the default
margin it comes with a P tag so now we
can see these four P elements right here
and they were in a grid like former all
right and that's just because we've
created a grid wrapper out of this
element so now inside these grid items
can be placed in two columns which we've
defined right here pretty awesome right
so that's so simple it is to nest a grid
within another item now I want to show
you one more property in this video and
it's not really to do with nested grids
but it didn't fit into a video on its
own so I'm going to throw it in here
because this is quite short anyway and
I'm going to show you the Spanky word
for the grid column property so we saw
that grid - column before we could use
say for example start this at 1 and end
at 3 right or end of 4 rather so if I
save this now then what's going to
happen is it's going to start at the
first column line go to the second third
and fourth right at the end and take up
the full space from 1 to 4 right we saw
that in the last video now another way
to do this is by using the span keyword
instead so we want it to start at 1 so
all we can do is say spun and then three
columns so now by default it's already
starting at column one right because
it's the fourth element right here and
it's going down to a new row so always
say now is we want to span this across
three columns we don't need to say the
start and the end we're just taking the
default start position and saying span
three columns from here so let me save
this and view in a browser and we get
exactly the same thing its spanning
three columns in width so there we go
there's how we nest grids and how we use
this span keyword as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
