22nd of UGS tutorial and in this video I
want to introduce you to props ok then
so if you're coming from a reactive
background then you probably already
know what props are basically they're a
way for us to transfer data from a
parent component to a child component in
this case we have our root component at
the top which is the parent component
and we could pass data down in the form
of a prop to this child component they
had a component ok for example in the
last tutorial we defined this property
title on the head of component then we
output it into template instead what we
could do is define that title as a
property on this root component and then
Pat it down as a prop to this header
component and still output it in the
same way now I'm guessing you're sitting
there thinking Wireless and we're going
to want to do that that sounds
ridiculous and a waste of time why not
just to find it on this header component
as we have already done and that's fine
however imagine this case scenario
you've got a website with five pages on
each of these pages you want to output a
list of ninjas right now the structure
of these ninjas the look of them and the
style of them are all going to be the
same however the data the actual ninjas
that were outputting are different in
each page now you might be thinking we
need five different components therefore
one for each different page which is
going to output these ninjas wrong
instead we just create one component
this ninja component like we've already
created and that is going to do all the
heavy lifting for us and output those
ninjas for us so how do we output
different data at each different time we
use this component well we passed down
the list of ninjas the data as a prop to
this ninja component every time we need
it so we're nesting this component in
each one of these five different parent
components to five different pages and
each time we nest it were passing down a
prop with that data so different data
can be passed down each time but we're
still using the same ninja component to
receive that data each time and output
it to the template make sense okay so
let's have a go at these props so right
now we're in this ninjas component right
here we created in the last tutorial and
we're defining our ninjas in
component right here so instead let's
cut that and define it on the root
component the parent component in the
data right here so let's save that now
there's two steps to passing and
receiving props and they are just then
passing them and receiving them so
imagine the parent component has a hand
and it's reaching out with the prop and
it's going to drop it into this
component now we have to reach out with
a hand from this component to receive it
otherwise it drops on the floor and we
can't use it so those two steps we have
to do we have to pass it and receive it
so how did we receive it first of all
well dead simply in this object we can
just set the props and then this is an
array and we can say in this array which
props we want to receive now we want to
receive the ninjas props without putting
ninjas here so that has to be the name
of the prop that we're receiving ninjas
okay because once we receive this we can
just use it in the template just like
the word as if the D paired data was
defined down here okay so it's called
ninjas let's put a comment after that
and save it and we want to pass this now
to this component so this is how we
receive it let's go on patting them so
the way we pass it is by coming up here
to where the component is nested and we
pass on a prop in this tag so we give
this proper name now the name it's
looking for if ninjas we said in
listening just component we're looking
for this crop so it has to be the same
name ninjas and that's going to equal to
this data down here ninjas so if we
place ninjas in here is this going to
work well let's save it and find out if
we refresh over here no this is not
working and that's because we're not
actually passing down this data right
here we're passing down a string ninjas
and I can demonstrate that if I hop here
to throw a peacock then output ninjas
we're going to see this string right
here ninjas and if I change this to one
two three you're going to see this
update ninjas one two three so if this
doing
passing down as a prop and not this
array so how do we push down the array
instead well remember if we want an
attribute to be dynamic then we have to
use V bind so we can say 3 - bind and
it's going to buying through this ninjas
attribute and then this is going to be
dynamic it's going to look at this
property down here and say ok I want to
pass this down not just the string this
is reviews V bind to make this dynamic
ok so let's save that now and check this
out
this time we see this big array output
where that p-tech was less you leave
that because we don't need anymore and
now these things work they're being
passed down and being used in the
template cool so like I said before once
we receive a prop here we can use it
within this component in the same way as
if it was defined down here in the data
like this right and you can see that
from when we output it here in the
template we're just using ninjas now we
can also access it from the methods in
the same way so we could say for example
methods and this is an object and inside
here we'll have a function called test
and within this we could say this dot
ninjas and we could access this prop the
same way as if it was defined here by
just saying this ninjas ok so that is
all the same as well so I'm just going
to save that now I want to show you one
more thing and that is validation so say
for example when we receive this problem
we want to make sure that it is in fact
an array and not string right because
we're circling through that array and a
string won't work well we can add this
or validation on to this prop right here
so instead now of this being an array
this is an object then inside this
object rename first of all which prop we
want to receive and it's called ninjas
right then this is an object and here in
here we can do our validation so we can
say type and this is going to be an
array okay now if this ninjas properties
passed down towards is not an array and
it's a string then this is going to fail
ok
so for example if I say
we're actually passing down an array but
I'm saying here I want the time to be
stirring if I save this now check this
out we're going to get an error in the
console
I just inspect and then go to console
we're going to see some kind of error
over here and valid prop type check
failed expected string got array so this
is failing and we get an error okay so
this is really good for developments so
we can make sure that this is in fact
there red and if we can also say
required is true therefore this will
fail if we do not pass it down this prop
because we're now saying that ninjas is
required okay so then we go guys that is
props in a nutshell we end up using them
much more as we go along through this
