fourth bootstrap 3 lesson and in this
video we're going to talk about
containers ah ori then go so we know
that to use the twelve column grid
system that comes with bootstrap we need
to write our code how bootstrap wants us
to and we need to use the CSS classes it
provides and we also need to understand
three core concepts of the bootstrap
grid system and there are containers
rows and columns so we're going to look
at containers in this tutorial so as
I've said earlier containers are what
surrounds all of your rows and columns
now if you want to use the grid system
of bootstraps you typically start with a
container and you put all your grid
elements within it and that's all the
rows and the columns now you can also
add other content into containers to not
just grid elements at entire your choice
and you also don't have to put elements
within containers as well so typically
what I would do is just use containers
what I'm going to do the grid system or
although elements I want to put in it
alright so there's two types of
containers that comes with a bootstrap
the first one is fixed and the second
one is fluid so I've done an example of
both here to demonstrate the difference
so you can see if I just make this a
little bigger and zoom in okay so I've
got two gives right there what were the
class of container which is a bootstrap
built in CSS class that we use in and
the second one right here as a class of
container - fluid so this is the fixed
container and this is the fluid
container now the difference between
them is that the fixed one responds to
media queries and at different media
queries it's given a fixed width in
pixels whereas the fluid one just
responds to the viewport width and it's
always a hundred percent of its parent
element now I've got a parent album here
which is surrounded the whole thing at
its max width of twelve hundred pixels
which is why this fluid container isn't
any bigger but if this was taken away
and let's just put another one in there
you'll see the fluid container now goes
all the way to the edges okay except for
this little bit of pattern here so what
I'll do is pop that back in yeah I've
done that right now
oops margin:0 there we go that's the one
all right then so let's just see what
happens to these containers as we shrink
the screen so you can see the top one
when it got to that breakpoint which is
round about here you can see it's a
fixed width to the minute if we
right-click and inspect the element
container this container this is my
style that I gave to the other
containers to give it a background color
and this one right here this is the
fixed width that bootstrap is giving it
currently 1170 pixels but as we get to a
breakpoint you can see that now the
width is 970 pixels okay and that's a
fixed width where is this one here if we
inspect that container fluid this one
does not have a set width is taken up
100% of the container in element so
let's go a little bit a bit further so
the next breakpoint and this time again
if we inspect this element the container
you can see that this time it's got a
fixed width of 750 pixels and that's at
this breakpoint 768 pixels so all the
time this is given a fixed width and
this is just fluid in that it's always
responding to the width of its parent
element in this case it's just a
viewport okay so as we get to mobile
screens then they become a little
similar okay so if we inspect the
element now container if we look the
inner CSS it doesn't have any fixed
width anymore and that means it's going
to take a 100% of the parent element the
same as the fluid container as well okay
so when it gets to mobile screens they
paved quite the same but for all other
widths the container class has a fixed
width applied to it at different break
points on the fluid container which has
a class of
10 - fluid just responds to the width of
its parent element in the viewport okay
so if we look a just a couple of points
just outline that has a fixed width
which changes at certain breakpoints and
it has a built-in padding of 15 pixels
all the way around we can see that every
hover over the element well I say all
the way around it's just left and right
so it never goes up to the screen edge
and the the content within it and this
one right here and has a fluid width
which stretches to 100% of its parent
element and it has built-in padding of
15 pixels again I say all the way around
of course I just mean left and right you
can see the little green strips on there
that's the 15 pixels of padding now for
the rest of this playlist I'm going to
focus mainly on these fluid containers
because I consider them I think they've
got a much more responsive feel about
them so like I say not every single bit
of content in your website has to go
inside a container but if you want to
make use of the grid system which
bootstrap provides us with the rows and
columns that we have to use must go
inside the container and we're going to
take a look at rows in the very next
tutorial
