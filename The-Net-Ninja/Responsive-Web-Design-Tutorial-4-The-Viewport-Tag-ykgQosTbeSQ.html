your fourth responsive design tutorial
and in this video we're going to take a
look at the viewport meta tag Wow
alright then so in the last lesson I
showed you that the default viewport
width of browsers on a lot of mobile
devices is quite wide it's wider than
the device itself for example about 980
pixels okay but the device itself is
only what about 320 or 400 pixels wide
so when we view a website in a mobile
browser which has a large viewport that
viewport takes all the content at that
width say nanogen 8 pixels and squashes
it into this width right here 320 pixels
which is why we get this effect this
kind of squashed web site okay that is
the default behavior of mobile browsers
and their viewport width now we also saw
that if we override the viewport width
by using this meta viewport tag then we
can say to the mobile look we want the
viewport to be this weak so everything
isn't squashed okay and we set the
viewport width equal to the device width
itself so that's what we're going to
take a look at today
all right then guys so as you can see
I've gone ahead and made a simple index
dot HTML file right here in brackets
that's the editor I'm using and it's
just a HTML tag with a head and a body
then we've got this H one right here and
we're going to put the viewport meta tag
right up there in the head ok so the
first thing we need to do is say meta
remember a meta tag is just a way of
adding additional information to a web
page such as the description or keywords
or in this case information about the
viewport alright so the name of this
meta tag equals viewport and then we're
going to specify a few different
properties on values if you like within
the content attribute like that ok so
all the different values go within here
the content and the first thing I want
to do is provide a width of the viewport
that I want this web page to be viewed
in ok so I'm going to override the
default width of those mobile browsers
so content equals width
that's the property name and then we say
equals and what we could do here is put
a static value like 320 pixels something
like that and that would make the
viewport 320 pixels wide however that
would be fine on a device which is 320
pixels wide but not fine on a device
which is like 480 pixels wide so they're
going to differ
so we need to weigh to make the viewport
the width of the device that it's being
viewed on and we can do that we can just
set wick equal to device - width and
then no matter what the width of the
device is when it comes across this
viewport meta tag it's going to set the
viewport equal to that device so if the
device is 320 pixels so on the viewport
width if the device is 480 pixels wide
so will be the viewport width all right
so that's pretty cool now that's almost
all we need to do but I'm going to go
through just a couple more things I'm
going to put a comma because we're going
to do another value right here and this
next value is going to be initial scale
now you don't really need to do this
because most mobile browsers come with a
initial scale of 1 anyway okay but I'm
just going to set it equal to 1 and
basically that's like the zoom level so
1 is no zoom at all ok if you wanted it
twice as big you could set it to that
serve like a 100% zoom right or you
could go to below 0 whatever you want to
do oops sorry below 1 okay I'm going to
set it equal to 1 and then show you
another couple of things we can say
maximum scale and also minimum scale so
maximum scale equals 1 so that basically
means that I'm not allowing a user ever
to zoom in all right now I don't like
doing things like that
I just typically like leaving this at
the most okay normally I don't even put
this in sometimes I just leave it like
that okay because this is the thing I
want to control so that is the viewport
meta tag and it's important that we put
this in the head of
all of our projects that we're making
responsive so that we can override that
default viewport width on a browser so
that everything isn't squashed and that
way when we go to change our CSS and
adapt it for mobile it's going to look
correct when we view it all right so if
you have any questions whatsoever feel
