here and this is tutorial number 51 and
in this tutorial we're going to take a
look at styling forms and by styling
forms I'm not talking about different
forms of styling no no I am talking
about how to style our form elements
because we have not done that yet and
that is something we're going to have to
look at over the course of the next few
tutorials so what I've got here is a
form and I've actually populated my form
or given my form a whole bunch of
elements before we started but don't
worry they're not like extreme it's not
going to be extremely difficult for you
guys to understand it's basically just a
whole bunch of labels with some input
types of text so it wouldn't take you
guys long to copy but it's also not
going to take I'll also provide a link
where you guys can just download the
code or something so let's go ahead and
actually take a look at this and you can
see I've started a paragraph tag and
then I've had my label for first name
then I've also put in my input type of
text for my first name and I ended that
paragraph off and basically you can copy
that code and paste it down a few times
for each of these fields over here so
we've got one for last name email city
address line 1 and address line 2
they're pretty much all the same just
with unique names and unique IDs for
each one ok so that's pretty much the
end result in the browser but what we
really need to do now is style this so
that all these input elements actually
appear nice and in line or nice and
lined up next to each other
right now seeing them like in this
little wave kind of pattern looks kind
of untidy and ugly in my opinion so
we're going to fix that with some
styling rules now I've got some labels
in this field set over here this
personal info field set but we also have
another field set at the bottom here
with hobbies that also has labels for
the check boxes and I don't want to
accidentally style any of these labels
for the check boxes because as you can
see the check boxes all seem to look
just fine so we're going to go back over
to our notepad plus plus over here and
I'm going to grab this field set that
had or that has the legend of personal
info and I'm just going to give this a
class so class of a personal underscore
info and we might as well just go copy
that now save this go over to CSS and
select that class now I don't actually
want to select this class but what I do
want to select is all the labels inside
of the field set with this class and to
do that we can go ahead now and just
leave a space over here and type in the
word label and that's going to select
all the label elements inside of this
personal info class okay and what we're
going to do here is just give each one
of those labels are fixed width and I'm
also going to float them to the left so
float left and I'll give it a width of
100 100 pixels okay and what this should
do is make all of these labels the same
width so when I click refresh you can
see all of our labels now have the same
width which means that all of these
input text boxes over here all appear in
line so
you know they're all nice and lined up
it looks a lot more tidy and something
else we could do here is just give this
a margin or even a line our text to the
right now I prefer having my text
aligned to the left I think this looks
good just the way it is but some people
like to go text-align:right and I'll
show you what effect this gives you but
it basically means that all of the
labels appear next to our elements and
then you've got a wide open space over
here which I I prefer to have it
actually aligned to the left and then
you don't have that wide open space but
if you're ever going to align your your
labels to the right like this you might
want to just give yourself a margin as
well so margin right and we might just
give that a margin of 10 pixels just to
add that extra little bit of space so
when I click refresh we now have that
space over there okay but like I said hi
I prefer having my text aligned on the
left it just for me in my opinion looks
better that way
and something else we could do here is
maybe just go over to our CSS file and
select all of our field sets and just
make them a little bit thinner as it
were because right now if we take a look
at this our field sets take up the
entire width of the browser but our data
inside of here I'd say isn't even wider
than 300 pixels 320 pixels so we might
as well go over to our field sets and
then just give these a width of 320
pixels
and that should make the actual field
sets just a lot smaller and in fact it
could probably be even smaller than that
so let's make it 300 and you know that
probably looks a lot better now just you
know just so that we don't have any of
that like really unnecessary space all
along the side okay and obviously you
would put this these field sets or this
form inside of another element that you
could use to Center it in the middle of
the page or something like that but I
have already made a tutorial on that so
if you guys want to learn how to do that
look back to the previous tutorials and
you will see how to Center parts of your
webpage okay something else we could do
if we really decided or deemed it
necessary is to give our field sets some
background color so background color and
we could get a like a very light blue
color so I've got I've got this file
over here or this color over here i hack
she had to pause and just go over to
photoshop and select any color and when
we go over to Firefox now and click
refresh we have this really light blue
background and that can probably help
you guys just to create a different look
between the background of the normal
website and the background of your form
and obviously something else we could do
that might improve this a little bit
more is to actually make our header or
our field set legend bolded so we can
grab all of the legends inside of our
field set by typing field set legend
like that and then we can go ahead and
just say font-weight:bold and that
should bold the the actual characters so
it definitely looks a little bit better
bolded although it is kind of weird
having half of it appear on the white
and half of it appear on the blue so
maybe changing the background color
wasn't such a great idea after all and
we can go ahead and maybe actually get
rid of that background color then and
actually see what this looks like a part
it's pretty can it look so much better
yeah okay so that's all I have for you
