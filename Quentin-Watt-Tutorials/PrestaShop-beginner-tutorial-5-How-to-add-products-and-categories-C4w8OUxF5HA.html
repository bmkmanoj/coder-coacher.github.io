here and this is PrestaShop tutorial
number five and in this video I am going
to show you guys how to add products and
also how to add categories in PrestaShop
so I'm pretty sure this is the tutorial
most of you guys have been waiting for
so let's actually just get started and
jump right into it because gonna take a
little bit of a while or a little while
so yeah let's go over to catalog so
you'll notice I'm already logged into
PrestaShop and if I click on catalog
we've got products and we've got
categories that's where I add products
and categories and the first thing I
want to do is add a category so that
when we create our product later we have
a category to add it to so let's go
categories and right now you can see
we've got a woman category set up here
by default and this is the default
PrestaShop category so whenever you've
installed PrestaShop for the first time
it's going to be there and we can take a
look at what that category page looks
like by clicking on the woman link over
here and that takes us to the woman
category page and you can see we've got
a category title displaying over there
which is women then we've got our
category description displaying over
here which just some information about
the category and then we have a
background image which is our category
image and that display is over here so I
just wanted you guys to see where all of
these options or images display etc
because we're going to have to fill all
of this in now and I just want you to
know where it's going to appear when you
fill it in so let's go over to add new
category which is the button above my
head and I click on that and we can give
our category a name so I'm going to name
this category men because we have a
category for women already displayed
I'll leave that yes if you set it to no
it just means that viewers or people
viewing your site cannot see it in the
front end so let's leave that as yet as
yes
parent category we'll leave at home and
that just means that this is not a
subcategory of anything it is just like
one of the top-level categories or well
home is the most top-level but we can't
go any higher than that so yeah leave
that at that description like you guys
saw that is just some information that
appears underneath the title so let's
just say this is the men's clothing
category and now we have our category
set up we can choose a category image so
I'm going to say add file and I've got
this men image over here just so that
people know that when the man category
so that's their major title meta
description and meta keywords those are
all there for SEO purposes search engine
optimization it helps Google find your
site or it helps being find your site so
yeah you can get an SEO expert to follow
all this information in that would
probably be best but if you don't have
an SEO expert then just fill in
information that is kind of like related
to the product things that you think
people might search for when they're
searching for your category of your
product so let's say men's clothing and
you can maybe fill in like your area
where your shop is or something as well
made the description I'm just going to
say men's clothing made the keywords
I'll just say men and clothing okay and
you separate each one of those tags with
a comma just in case you didn't know SEO
friendly URL this will almost always be
the same as your category name except
it'll be all small letters and I think
that's perfect just leave it as it is
don't change a thing
and then we have group access now group
access is who gets to see your product
so a customer is someone who has an
account with your shop and is already
signed in so if you leave only that box
tick then only people who have an
account with you can see the product
otherwise if all of them are tech then
everyone can see the product and I think
that's the best way to go about things
or everyone can see the category I keep
saying product but I mean I mean
category let's go ahead and say save
okay so now we've got our category set
up we can also set up a subcategory just
to organize this a little more neatly
here you'll see that woman has a
subcategory of tops and dresses so for
men let's go ahead and click on that and
add a category over here and that's
going to automatically make the parent
men a category or the parent category
min and that's exactly what we want so
now let's just give this a name I'll
give it a name of hoodies title or
description let's say this is a category
for hoodies image we can go ahead and
add all of the stuff in I don't really
have an image or I made a title or
whatever but I showed you guys what
information goes in here so let's just
hit save so we can save some time and
now we've got our subcategory over here
and that is a subcategory of men so now
that we've set that up correctly let's
go ahead and take a look at how to add a
product so let's go over to the products
tab or products menu item over here and
we can take a look at all of our
products in a list and edit them if we
need to with the edit button above my
head or that was my phone that went off
but I'm not going to read it or we could
add a new product also the button right
at the top above my head let's say add
new and we get to choose like what type
of product do we want to add I'm going
to leave this at a standard product you
could also pack existing products
together or you could make a
downloadable product or a virtual
product but I'm just going to leave it
at standard name let's give it a name of
a green hoodie because the image is
going to be me wearing a green hoodie
that's all reference code now
you guys can fill codes in here that
like make sense to you and codes that
you would use in your shop but for me
I'm just going to say one two three four
five six just because I don't really
have a system that I'm working with then
let's say enabled so people can see it
in the front-end visibility everywhere
so everyone can find it otherwise if you
choose one of these other options just
means that the products going to be
harder to find options it's available
for order so we'll leave that ticked
show price we want the price to be shown
online only is basically like let's say
you had an online shop and then you have
a physical store somewhere else and the
product is in both the physical store
and the online shop
well I'm popular today I'm going to
leave that but yeah if the product isn't
available in both stores then then
you'll not tick this box but if it's
available online only then you will tick
the box so I don't have a physical store
so I'll leave that online only
conditions we'll leave that at NU but we
could choose used or refurbished a short
description this is a green hoodie long
description this is a green hoodie with
a white label whatever more information
you want to put in there it's up to you
add a tag you can go ahead and add tags
if you need to I'm going to leave a
blank so let's hit save and stay and
that is now our information fold in and
saved but there's still a few other
things we need to take care of like a
price so let's hit price over here and
obviously this is going to be different
wherever you are in the world but I'm
just going to say no tax speak I don't
really want to go through all the
trouble of setting up taxes and stuff
with you guys you guys can kind of you
know with tax applies to every you are
and then just set it up as is pre-tax
wholesale price um I say 300 bucks
pre-tax
300 bucks the same again again 300 and
300
so basically text is not applying which
is why I live no text over there let's
say save and stay and after you've
clicked that just make sure that all of
your content or all of your numbers are
in there correctly because if you feel
something in incorrectly then it goes
back to zero and you have a product
displaying in the front end of your
store that says zero as the price and
that's not cool so let's go SEO now and
SEO like I said made the title and made
a description these are for search
engines to find your product and you
would probably want to get a SEO expert
to fold these in otherwise you can just
put some information and that relates to
the product so I'm just going to say
green hoodie and green hoodie cool hit
save and stay the next option is
associations this is where we get to
choose the category I'm just going to
say it must be under the main category
and it must be under the hoodies
category and we'll leave it at home as
well just so it'll display on the
homepage default category will change to
hoodies so that the default category is
hoodies accessories we don't have
anything for this hoodie as an accessory
manufacturer I'll show you guys how to
set and manufacture up in the next video
but once you have manufacturers set up
you can choose one of them and it's
going to show their logo in the front
end and also their name so let's hit
save and stay that's just if you want to
show that kind of information to a
client shipping I'm going to show you
guys how to set shipping up in a future
video but then you can basically set up
a carrier as one of the options and if
you want that carrier to be available
for certain products go ahead and click
it and hit add and goes over to this
little box over here package dimensions
you can follow all that in
just that the courier has some
information as well as a price so you
can give the price to your customer
who's buying it always you can leave it
at zero if it's going to be free
shipping let's hit save and stay
combinations this is something we will
talk about in the next video but that
just allows you to make it so that you
use you can choose between a medium
large extra-large or choose between
green blue red whatever color is etc
quantities I'm going to well first we've
got this little check box over here that
we can tick if you want to use the
advanced management system I think that
costs extra so I'm not going to use it
yeah it's basically if you're a kind of
a big store and you need to keep track
of stuff then this will help a lot then
available quantities we can choose like
okay I want to specify and available
quantities amount manually and then you
can fill in the quantity of like how
many products do you have in stock so
let's say I have 15 of these hoodies in
stock I'll go ahead and fill that in
when out of stock do you want to deny
people from ordering do you want to
allow orders and then just you know go
get stock when when they order or do you
want to use a default option so you can
always set the default option in
preferences which is the which something
I explained in the previous video so
yeah I can do that minimum quantity this
is where we get to decide like how many
products a customer can order at once or
what's the minimum so if we leave that
at one it means they can order one at a
time or we can up this to like five and
then they have to order five they cannot
order less than that but yeah I'll just
leave it at one and then we get to
decide like do we want certain text to
be displayed when the product is in
stock so do you want to say like oh the
product is in stock or backordering like
if you're going to be dealing with back
ordering and stuff you want to certain
text to apply there as well
you can fall something in for each one
of those or you can leave a blank and
press the shop has I think a default
option that displays once you're done
hit save and stay then images this is
where we set the image for our product
so I'm going to say add a file I'm going
to hit the picture of me and open that
up so that's me in a green hoodie which
is why the product is called green
hoodie make sure you hit this upload
files button and that's going to upload
the image so that it's over here and
once the image displays over there you
can save and stay if you have more than
one image by the way then you can drag
and drop them so hit this button drag
and drop and that basically allows you
to choose like which one's going to be
your first image or not
that's just which how the images display
in the gallery over here so you can see
that like the first image will be here
second will be there and so on
and then cover just lets you decide if
that image is going to be the cover
image then features this is something
I'm going to talk about in the next
video
customization also actually I don't even
think we're going to talk about this
really it basically just allows you to
add extra fields most of us are probably
not going to use that so I'm not going
to cover this attachments if you are
using a downloadable product you can
attach a file so go ahead and hit add
file it'll appear over here once you've
added it and then you can click on that
file say add and if it appears over
there then it means once someone's paid
for this product they'll download
whatever file is in this box but yeah I
don't have anything there because it's
not a downloadable product so let's just
leave it as it is and suppliers is
basically like we can set up a supplier
and show it in the front-end just if you
guys want to share that information it's
available so yeah now that we've set all
of that up let's go to the front end of
the store I'm going to go to the home
page and then when I scroll down to new
arrivals that is
that product I just added and yeah I can
add it to the cart or I can do whatever
I want because this is now a working
product and that is all I have for you
guys in this video so don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like and share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
