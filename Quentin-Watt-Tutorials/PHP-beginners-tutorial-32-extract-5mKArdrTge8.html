here and welcome to tutorial number 32
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to extract variables from
an array using the extract function okay
so let's start off by making an array
I'm going to make one called ice cream
because everybody loves ice cream and
I'm going to set that equal to array
well I guess lactose intolerant people
don't like ice cream but hey okay so
we'll start off by it's going to be an
associative array so let's make the
first key good and some good ice cream
would be vanilla so let's go ahead and
type that in over here okay but then
let's go ahead and say better and I
guess some better ice cream could be a
like caramel ice cream and then the best
ice cream so let's go ahead here and
make a key of the best and that can
represent chocolates because of course
chocolate ice cream is just the best
okay so now we have our array with the
keys good better and best those are keys
and then our values will be vanilla
caramel chocolate okay now if I go ahead
and I use this function called extract
and it only takes one argument which is
the array that we want to extract the
data from so let's go ahead and just
type in ice cream okay what we've done
with this function now is create three
new variables we didn't have to type
them in ourselves they're already made
so we can actually go ahead now and use
these variables and I'm going to go
ahead and just echo them out
so the first variable that we actually
made is called good because this was our
first key so good now holds the value of
vanilla so what we've done then is
extracted the data out of this array and
we've made all of our array keys the
variable names and then those variables
are holding the values of the array
element value okay so good will
obviously be holding vanilla so let's go
ahead and we'll echo out good but we're
going to append on a few things over
here so so we'll say good is good
of course and what that is actually
going to mean is vanilla is good then
I'm just going to make sure I leave a
space here and then we'll say variable
better and will append on some more text
over here is better comma and space
append on the next thing which is going
to be best and append on the string is
best so now when we save this and go
over to Firefox and click refresh you
can see we've got vanilla is good
caramel is better and chocolate is best
so if you guys ever have an array or a
so an associative array and you want to
use those things as variables then you
can go ahead and just extract them with
the extract function and of course echo
them out in a sentence like are just
that now or you could probably get
creative and find a hundred other ways
to use them but for now that was a short
tutorial
on how to use the extract function so

really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
