here and welcome to tutorial number 4 in
my my sequel series and in this video I
just want to show you guys a few more
things that you can add to your queries
that'll add a little bit more extra
power when it comes to running your
query so go over to your query runner
place thing and let's type in the
following query let's select everything
from our users table so I've been users
over here and we already know that if I
run this query it's going to select
everything from our users table but I
just want to run this query so we can
see the results right and one thing
you'll notice is that there are 15
values within this table at the moment
so that's because I only put 15 values
in here or 15 entries but one thing we
might want to do is set a limit to how
many results we receive because let's
say this table was extremely extremely
full and they were like 2,000 entries or
2,000 users and our database is going to
take a really long time for our query to
fetch 2,000 people
so basically that query time is going to
be pushed up a little bit so instead of
selecting 2,000 people let's come back
here and learn how to set a limit so
setting a limit is as simple as typing
the word limit and then setting a value
for that limit so if I set the limit
through to or if I set the limit to 10
and click go that is going to select
only 10 results so now we're missing
results 11 3 to 15 but obviously it does
shorten the time of our query especially
if this is a long or a really big
database especially if they were like
2000 users setting a limit just helps
keep that query time down right so now
that we've learned about limits
something else I want to show you guys
is something called offset but let's
play around with this live a little bit
so I want to bring that down to 5
and that is essentially going to select
the first five users and yeah you guys
probably already knew that but yeah just
play around with limiting options but
the reason why I set the limits to five
is because I want to now set an offset
value in here and an offset value is
nice for pagination in fact limiting and
offsets go really well with pagination
because let's say you wanted to only
show the user five results and then give
them a second page where they could see
the next five results obviously the
first five results it's okay to just
select everything from users and limit
by five and that selects the first five
results but for page two when you want
to show the next five results you need a
set an offset and you need to set that
offset equal to whatever has already
been shown to the user so in this case
right now I'm just going to set an
offset of zero and setting an offset of
zero is exactly the same as just running
that query right just running a query
that selects everything in limited by
five so this isn't really going to look
much different to the previous result
but there we go we have users one
through to five but if I come back over
to this query place and I set the offset
equal to five
this is going to skip the first five
results and then select the next five
results so we should have users six
through to ten so let's click go and
yeah that's exactly what we got right
we've got user six through to ten
because we skipped the first five
results with the offset value set over
here so now that we know how to do that
obviously it's quite easy to select the
last five results or numbers 11 3 to 15
by just setting an offset value of 10
over here and that's going to skip the
first 10 results and this will select 5
results starting from the tenth one or
starting from the eleventh one actually
let's click go and there we go we have
users 11 through to 15 so yeah you can
play around with that
and in fact there's actually a shortcut
so instead of typing the word offset you
can actually just remove that completely
and then add in a comma over here but
what this comma means is that this is
our limit and this is our offset I don't
know who created this the shortcut but
yeah it's kind of confusing because
you're specifying the word limit but
this value actually sets our limits so
let's limit it to five results and this
value actually sets our offset so let's
have an offset of two and what that
means is we're going to skip the first
two results and then show the next five
results coming after that so let's click
go and yeah we've skipped users one and
two and now we are selecting everything
from user number three to user number
seven
so everybody from sibiu to Jackie Chan
and I'd encourage you to run this query
a couple of times so yeah and encourage
you to just play around with this and
practice this a little bit because the
more of these queries you play around
with and the more queries you run
obviously the better it is that you will
understand them so yeah just play around
of them a bit and yeah you'll get the
picture right so something else I want
to talk to you guys about other than
limiting and offset is actually the
order by class or the order by value so
let's limit this by 10 but instead of
working with an offset I'm going to set
an order by value so let's say order by
and when you do this you actually have
to set a field that you want to order
the spy so you can order it by user
name/password or any one of these fields
so I'm going to order by the ID and I
think by default this is going to order
them in an ascending order which is
literally going to show us the exact
same thing we've been looking at so
order by an ID
you have an error okay I think order by
actually comes before limits and that
was my error so let's copy this and dry
again and there we go right we have
select everything from users we've
ordered them by the ID and we've limited
it to ten results now by default it
would order them in a sending order
so a sending order is starting from the
lowest number going up and that is one
through to ten but I can completely
change the order of this by ordering by
ID but setting the value to descending
and so that should completely switch the
order of my results that if click go and
now you can see that I've actually
selected the results from the back of my
table so I've started with number
fifteen and we've gone down to number
six right or user ID six so if you ever
want to search from the back of the
table then yeah that's basically how you
do it right you set an order by and you
find the value that you want to order it
by and then set that to descending and
that can be really useful especially if
you're not working with the ID let's say
you wanted to order by the users first
name in a descending order we should now
have everybody who has a name starting
from Z or you know from the end of the
alphabet backwards so let's go here and
yeah you can see we've ordered this by
our first name so that's this column
starting with SS our rqm yeah so
basically we're going backwards Danielle
for bet so it's worth mentioning at this
point that the IDS are all out of order
and that's because we're not ordering by
the ID anymore and this is the first
time we have an order by ID we're
actually going off by the people's names
over here so yeah that is how you use
the limit order and offset their values
in my sequel and that is all I have for
you guys
in this video but before I end the video
of so just before I end off this
tutorial I want to send a huge thanks to
my sponsors at dev Mountain dev Mountain
is a coding bootcamp that will teach you
everything you need to know to become a
web developer within 12 weeks so if you
guys are looking at becoming a web
developer a UX designer or an iOS
developer I know that sometimes teaching
yourself how to code is a little bit
time-consuming and maybe a little bit
difficult but if you go over to a
bootcamp like dev Mountain then you can
speed up that process a little bit and
become a web developer or an iOS
developer even sooner than you expected
the link to their website is in the
video description below so go ahead and
take a look at their website and if you
do contact them make sure to tell them
that Quintin sent you I do want to send
a special thanks to all of these guys
over here so these guys contribute $5 or
more on patreon every month which goes a
long way to helping me make more videos
more often so if you guys want to see
some more videos and you like the videos
that I create it is worth considering
becoming a patron and that is all I have
for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave comment like and share this video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys in the next
