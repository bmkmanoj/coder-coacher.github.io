here and welcome to tutorial number 48
and in this tutorial we are still
talking about retrieving data from forms
so quite a long topic but now I'm going
to show you guys how to retrieve data
from a select list ok so right now I've
got the code from the previous tutorial
still here I haven't cleared it out yet
so let's go get rid of that but keep the
submit button but I want to forget about
that and then I'll go ahead and clear
out the PHP on this side so just go
ahead and delete all of that keep the
PHP tags though because we're probably
still going to work with them and now we
just need to throw in some select lists
over here so I'll just put one in okay
and we could probably just say yeah
we'll reuse something from the previous
tutorial so what is your favorite food
and they can select from a list of their
favorite foods okay so we'll have a
select list yeah
select and let's enable multiple and we
need to give this a name and I'm going
to give this a name of food okay and now
we can end off our select list ending
select okay but this select list is
actually going to be able to allow the
users to select multiple options okay
so that's why we've put in this option
of multiple and I don't have any options
and yeah so I can't really show you what
it's going to look like but basically
whenever you're going to allow the users
to select multiple options that are
going to have the same name like this
you need to go ahead and use the square
brackets
so if you
I can remember my tutorial on checkboxes
and allowing the user to tick multiple
checkboxes then this is pretty much just
like that we're going to put these
square brackets in here and that means
that we basically have an array inside
of our dollar underscore post array okay
so an array within an array quite
exciting okay
and now we'll go ahead and add in some
options here so option and any option
and we're probably gonna have to put in
like three of these things so all four
of them I can't remember what foods I
used last time but I definitely think it
was steak and salad and I think
hamburgers and macaroni I think it was
macaroni so if I'm right then let me
know in the comments but I'm pretty sure
I'm right I haven't gone back to check
okay so now I just want to give each of
these options a value so we'll give this
a value of steak and the next one can
have a value of salad because that is a
salad and the next one a value of
hamburgers so quantity is job this
giving them all values hamburger and the
last one can have a value of macaroni
equals macaroni okay cool so now we've
got all of this set up let's go ahead
and take a look at that in the browser
so need to change this to tutorial 48
okay
and that's pretty much what it looks
like quite idiots actually so what is
your favorite food and the user can
maybe select one or two or lots of them
if they would like and then click Submit
but we don't have any PHP code on this
side to actually
handle our data just yet and if we want
to make this look a little bit better we
could probably just add in a break tag
over there
and now our select list appears
underneath just like that and you can
probably add in a break tag over here as
well break cool and that's just going to
make the button up here underneath okay
so now let's go ahead and write the code
that is going to handle any data that we
submit through to there so the way we're
going to do that is using a for loop
okay or a for each loop because we're
going to loop through this array food
okay so what I'm going to do here is
let's make our array called food and
we're going to set that equal to dollar
underscore post doll underscore post
food okay and that is because whenever
you select a whole bunch of stuff in
here
then we're making an array within our
array of dollar underscore post okay so
this food variable should now contain an
array of all the answers or all of the
options that the user selected in the
Select list so now we can go ahead and
say for each and we just need to get the
syntax for this for each loop right okay
so for each and it's going to take a
value of an array so we can place our
food array in here seeing as we just
created it up there for each food as
value
and now we can go ahead and do something
with that so let's echo out the value so
echo out value and then I'm just going
to append on a break tag and I forgot my
little HTML enclose eating's okay cool
so now let's go ahead and save this and
go back to our browser over here so
click refresh and we'll select steak
hamburgers and macaroni click Submit and
now we've echoed out steak hamburgers
and macaroni okay so that is really cool
and that is pretty much how to handle
the Select list because it works exactly
the same way as the multiple checkboxes
just whenever you're going to send
through multiple values include these
square brackets and it means you can
make an array out of any values that are
going to be sent through so they can all
have the same name which in this case
they're all inheriting the name food all
these options inherit the name food from
the Select list but they all have
different values which we've given them
over here and whenever you echo the
value variable out or the value variable
out you're actually echoing out this
name so steak salad hamburgers etc okay
and yeah that's pretty much all I have
