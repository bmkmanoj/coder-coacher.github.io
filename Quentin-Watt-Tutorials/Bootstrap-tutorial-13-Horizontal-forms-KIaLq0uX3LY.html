here and welcome to tutorial number 13
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to create inline forms and
horizontal forms so the first thing that
you guys are going to notice is that
I've already got a lot of code over here
and this is actually the form from the
previous tutorial so if you guys haven't
watched tutorial number 12 you need to
go back and watch that and then you can
come back and watch tutorial number 13
and you will be good to go but yeah
we've got this form over here
and it is exactly the same as it was in
tutorial number 12 except what I did do
is I change this heading to to say in
line form instead of a horizontal form
so if I come back to my browser and I
just refresh as to what the code looks
like now then this is our form and this
is what it looks like now and we want to
inline it to this position that you guys
actually just saw a moment ago so to do
that is actually really really really
easy I can't honey I cannot even stress
to you how easy that is now that we have
this form already set up because all I
need to do is go over to my form tag
over here and add a class so I'm going
to give this a class of form
- inline and I'm going to hit save and
bam there we go our work is complete so
if I come back over to the browser over
here and I hit refresh would you look at
that we have an inline form so email
address password everything's all next
to each other and I guess ideally this
would not be a file upload button if
this was going to be like a login form
where we needed an email address and a
password what we might have over here is
a check box that says remember me so
yeah this is just how I set the form up
I know it's not
though having a file upload here kind of
means nothing but if you guys ever want
to change that obviously I'm sure you
can do that okay so that is our in line
form done now let's show you how to make
a horizontal form and this is going to
be slightly more complicated because
we're going to have to change up some of
the code over here and give some of this
some extra classes so the first thing I
want to do is I'm just going to change
this heading to horizontal form I'm also
going to change my forms class to read
form horizontal instead of form in line
because that is a class that we're going
to need to create a horizontal form and
the next thing we've got to do is go
over to each one of our labels and we're
going to have to add a class as well so
I'm going to go ahead and add in this
class attribute and the first thing I
want to do is add a column size of Col
sm2 so that means that on a small device
or anything bigger than a small device
this column or this label is going to
take up two columns okay and we're also
going to give it a class of control -
label so that is our class setup for the
label I can go ahead and copy that and
paste it on every one of these labels ok
the submit button doesn't have a label
and then the next thing we can do is go
over to each one of these input elements
and we're actually going to have to
surround that in a div so I'm going to
create all my spacing and I'm going to
create my div now and I'm going to give
this div a class of Col SM and remember
bootstrap has 12 columns so if our label
is going to take up two columns I can go
ahead and set my div which holds this
input element to take up ten columns and
that's just going to take up all the
rest of the space remaining okay
and then if I go ahead and end the stiv
off that is our horizontal form complete
for this row now let's go ahead and
continue just setting up the rest of
these rows so I'm actually going to just
copy paste so copy and we'll paste that
and I'm going to tap that in and thank
goodness that sublime can end off my
tags quite quickly and again this is
probably going to be boring for you guys
just watching me format all the code
real quick but there we go we're done so
let's go ahead and hit save and if I
come back over to the browser and hit
refresh you can see that now I've got my
email address set up I've got a password
button setup etc but what I haven't done
is fixed the submit button so if I
really want to line that up with
everything else then I could go ahead
and give this a class as well just
ending div but then I'm going to either
have to push it to columns so call ASM
push - I think I believe that is the
code let's go ahead and hit save and
refresh and there we go we now have my
submit button lined up with all the rest
of the content just like that and that
is how you create a horizontal form so
