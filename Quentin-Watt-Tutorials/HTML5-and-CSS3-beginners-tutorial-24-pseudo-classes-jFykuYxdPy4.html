here and welcome to tutorial number 24
and in this tutorial I am going to talk
to you guys about pseudo classes in CSS
and if you guys are wondering if the
text or something looks different it is
actually I've changed a little bit
basically I started recording my screen
at a higher resolution so I could try
and have the videos available in 720p
and then the text was actually really
small it was like that so I decided just
to zoom in a little bit and as you can
see it kind of makes things look a
little bit more bold than they would
actually normally be okay so that's just
why the writing would look different
okay so let's talk about pseudo glasses
and a pseudo class in CSS is basically
just there to give you guys a little bit
more control over your styling okay this
it like they are all built into CSS so
you can't go ahead and make your own
pseudo class but you can choose from a
bunch of pre-made pseudo classes that I
am going to show you guys and I probably
won't show you all of them so you can go
ahead and actually Google some of it and
see if you can find out if there's
anything that you need that is going to
be useful over there okay and one of the
first pseudo classes that I want to show
you guys is called first letter so let's
go ahead and actually make a few
paragraphs here I'm going to go ahead
and actually just type that out once
then I'm going to put my cursor in front
of the paragraph tags push ctrl D and
that duplicates it so I'm going to make
four paragraphs and I'm actually
stealing this idea from my original
tutorial on pseudo classes so I'm going
to type the word u and then only and
then I'm going to get the next paragraph
to say live
and the last paragraph is going to save
once so Yolo and now we can go ahead and
actually style the first letter of every
single one of these paragraphs using a
pseudo class and then we'll be able to
make the actual word Yolo stand out so
let's go ahead and do that and the way
you use a pseudo class is basically by
selecting whichever element you want to
change so in this case it's going to be
the P element and then you have to
append on or add on a little bit of
extra information which is the pseudo
class that you are choosing to use so
like I said there is one called first
letter so you're going to append on this
colon and then you're going to type
first letter and in fact it should be
hyphenated just like that so the first
letter of every single one of our
paragraphs that's basically what that
pseudo class is selecting and now we can
go ahead and just maybe change the color
of that to let's go ahead and change it
to blue and we'll make the font weight
bolded so font-weight:bold and we'll
change the font size to something quite
big so let's just change the font size
to maybe 20 pixels okay
so now when I go ahead and save this and
whoops EE you can see I've been on
YouTube I'll go ahead and save that and
just run this in Firefox you can see I
now have you only live once print it out
and
ready just go in and zoom in to make
that look a little bit the same size as
the rest of the text
okay so that is the first letter
pseudo-class we also have something
called the first line pseudo class so if
I go back over to a notepad plus plus
and let's just take all of that out over
here and add in a new paragraph and
we're going to have to make it quite
long so we'll just say the quick red fox
jumped over the lazy Brown dogs back
back not bagged and I think I'm going to
have to just duplicate this a few times
just to make sure that it takes up quite
a bit of space okay cool
and that should be fine so let's go over
to your notepad plus plus again I don't
know how I change to the browser
but anyways notepad plus plus and
instead of working with the first letter
class let's work with the first line and
I think this is fine I think we'll just
keep the color blue font-weight:bold and
the size of 20 pixels and what this is
going to do is change the entire font
size font weight and color of our first
line in the paragraph so basically you
can see here we've got quite a few lines
that are actually displaying but only
the first line of the paragraph or the
top line of the paragraph has changed
okay and I guess if I made my browser
narrower anything that falls down to the
next line changes back to black which is
that's cool
so that's pretty much all I have for you
