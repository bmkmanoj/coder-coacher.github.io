here and welcome to tutorial number two
in my JavaScript series and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
about statements and comments okay
so in the last tutorial actually went
ahead and I use this statement and I
told you guys that that is called a
statement but I didn't actually tell you
guys what a statement is and what a
statement is for and let me go ahead and
do that now so first of all what is a
statement well a statement is an
instruction that we give to the computer
okay when we tell the computer to do
something so this is how programming
languages in general work not just
JavaScript but all programming languages
we give the computer instructions called
statements and we are that that's also
computer to do something so what this
statement did was it said okay computer
grab the document and write the words
hello world to the document and if we go
ahead and we look at this in our browser
that's exactly what it did it just went
ahead and it wrote the words hello world
and then because that's all we had in
our script tags that's all it did and
the program was finished okay so let's
just talk about the semicolon here at
the end of the statement real quick
and what that semicolon does is that
basically means this is the end of the
statement okay it's like if you had to
compare that to and the English language
whenever you write a sentence in the
English language so let's say this is a
sentence
. whenever you write a sentence in the
English language you end your sentence
off with a . so whenever you write a
statement in programming you end your
statement off with a semicolon okay so
that just means that that's the end of
the statement
whatever comes after this is a
completely new statement okay so let's
go ahead and get rid of this
and we can use multiple statements in
our script tags over there
so we already use the one and because
document dot write is all we know how to
use so long let's go ahead and print
something else out on the page so
document dot write and we'll add in our
semicolon here and we'll write the words
good bye
world and I spelled fire wrong so we
just go fix that goodbye world and the
only reason why I did that is because
I'm boring and I couldn't think of
anything else to print out so let's just
go ahead and save that like that and go
back to our browser click refresh and
now you can see our first statement
executed and wrote hello world and after
our first statement was finished
executing that was this one then our
second statement executed and that wrote
goodbye world so that's pretty easy and
a nice little tip for you guys is that
if you ever included HTML tags inside of
our quotation marks here so inside the
quotation marks then our browser
actually treats those HTML tags as
proper HTML tags that go in printout
smaller than sign or is that smaller
than smaller and sign BR forward slash
grade inside it's not going to print
that out it's actually going to include
a line break in our page so let's go
ahead and click refresh and as you can
see we now have a line break where that
tag was supposed to have been so that's
actually quite a cool feature and we can
use that to you know write content to
our page dynamically but now what I want
to talk about is hmm I'm looking at my
notes here
okay cool yeah that's pretty much
actually all I had to talk about
statements so now let's go ahead and
we'll talk about comments and what
comments are is basically like notes to
yourself in your programming or notes to
other programmers you might be reading
your code so it's good practice to keep
a lot of comments in your code I mean
you don't want to you know one day come
back to your code and forgot forget
everything you wrote and like forget
what it did so let's go ahead and just
leave a single line comment for now and
to leave a single line comment you just
go ahead and you add in two forward
slashes okay and whatever comes after
that is a comment so we can maybe just
say prints out the words hello world
okay so now our comment is actually
telling us what the code underneath it
does again that's a good thing you
should always leave comments like that
in your code maybe not for simple tasks
like this but if you're programming ever
gets a little bit complicated you know
I'm saying like two weeks three weeks
down the line you might forget what your
code actually does and then if you've
left a comment then you can actually
help yourself remember otherwise you've
got to go and figure all of that stuff
out again
likewise if another programmer looks at
your code you wrote it not him you know
so he might not understand exactly what
you're trying to do there so that's just
why it's helpful to leave a comment and
now this is like I said this is a single
line comment so what happens is if you
break down to a new line whatever you
write underneath here isn't commented
out anymore okay so let's go ahead and
show you guys how to actually leave a
multi-line comment okay so maybe you
wanted to include your name on the first
line and then maybe what the program
does on the second line okay - so to
leave a multi-line comment what you do
is you add in a full
/ and then an Asterix sign and as you
can see everything below is turned green
so let's just write my name Quinton what
and then we'll write what the program
does so we'll say prints out hello world
okay and now I want to end off the
comment over here so I just put in
asterisks forward slash and the comment
is now ended and all of this is actually
seen as an HTML data again so that's
pretty cool and that's how to leave a
multi-line comment and obviously the
other thing is a comment won't print out
on the page so if we have our comment
like this or even if it was just a
single line comment when we ran that in
the browser you can see it will never
print out that code okay it will never
print out a comment so that's only there
just for whoever's reading the code and
that's actually all I have to say about
statements and comments so thank you
very much for watching guys and I will
see you guys in the next video don't
forget to subscribe don't forget to
leave a comment please don't forget to
sign up on my forum and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
