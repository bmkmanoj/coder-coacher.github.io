to tutorial number 20 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to talk to you
guys about IDs and arming explain when
and where to use them so ideas are
almost the same as classes in a sense
that you can use an ID to style an
element except that an ID should be
unique to only one element so let's just
say you had three different paragraphs
on your website and you wanted them all
to look the same then you should
probably use a class to style all three
of those paragraphs with one specific
Clause but if you had three paragraphs
and you just wanted one to be different
and the other two to be the same then
what you can do is you can go ahead and
use an ID and the reason for it is you
know you'll have to identify your your
paragraphs and things later on with
JavaScript etc and you'd have to use the
ID and only one element can then have
that ID otherwise you're just gonna give
it confuse everything with JavaScript
but that's like a whole other tutorial
anyways
so for now what we can do is we can just
add in three paragraphs so just go ahead
and make three paragraphs on your
webpage okay so we can just go
this is paragraph 1 and I'm actually
just gonna probably that again okay and
we'll have fair rough - and we'll have
paragraph 3
and now we've got three basic simple
paragraphs on our websites but like I
said if we wanted one of these
paragraphs to be different and only one
we can go ahead then and add an ID
attribute ID equals and we can set this
Adi we can make this Adi anything we
want but I'm just gonna name mine blue I
don't know how my cursor got down there
I'm gonna name my blue underscore P just
because I'm gonna turn the paragraph
blue so it's a blue paragraph like I
said it's better to just when you're
gonna give you when you're gonna name
your IDs or your glasses you should name
them something descriptive so you know
what the ID is going to be doing and now
what we can do is go back to our CSS and
to star something or to style an ID in
CSS you have to use the hash symbol some
of you guys might call it the pound sign
and then after that you'll put the ID
name so our ID name was blue underscore
P so let's go ahead and copy that and
there we go blue under square P and as
you can see whenever you refer to an ID
in a CSS notepad plus plus changes the
eye ID to be blue so that you can easily
see what is an ID and what is the class
and obviously in the previous and things
just what what is an element so in our
class looks like that because it's red
and close and a normal element would be
blue like that and an ID is blue like
that so that's just that you can tell
apart things in CSS but anyways let's go
back to our ID here I'm going a bit
off-topic and what I said we were gonna
do is just change the color to be blue
my gosh I don't know how much my cursor
keeps doing that's weird anyways there
we go
and now what we can do is you can go
back to our index and run this in
Firefox and as you can see we now have
two normal paragraphs 1 &amp;amp; 2 or 1 &amp;amp; 3 are
normal but number two that had the ID of
paraone or parrot bleep error what is
that bleep II okay
the idea of blue P changed the paragraph
blue so if you guys don't really
understand then maybe we can do it one
more time just to get this really into
your heads we can go to our first
paragraph and set this ID equal to red
underscore P and we can go back to CSS
over here and just refer to that as red
underscore P so like I said it's the
hash symbol first and then the name of
your ID and then you can go ahead and
start styling it so we'll change this
color to red and we'll save that go back
to firefox and when we refresh this
paragraph over here should turn red so
take a look at that pretty awesome hey
so that's how you would use an ID in
HTML and CSS but like I said an idea
should be unique to only one element on
your webpage you shouldn't be using ID
of the same ID along four or five
different elements on your webpage
because when you use JavaScript in the
future you're gonna want to get elements
by ID and if there's two two elements
with the same ID you're gonna confuse
your JavaScript a little bit so anyways
