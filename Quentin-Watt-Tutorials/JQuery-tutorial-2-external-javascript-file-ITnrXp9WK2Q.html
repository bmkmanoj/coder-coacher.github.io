here and in this tutorial we're going to
take a look at how to use an external
javascript file and what the difference
is between inline JavaScript which is
what we used over here in the previous
tutorial when we actually tested our
jQuery so as you can see inline
javascript or inline jQuery is basically
added with an attribute and the
attribute is whatever event you were
looking for so in this case we were
waiting for the click and then we went
ahead and added our code now I want to
take a look at doing the exact same
thing but instead of using inline
JavaScript or inline jQuery we're
actually going to use an external
javascript file that's going to do the
same thing so first of all I have to
create my new javascript file so I'm
going to say file new and we're going to
save this and I'm going to save it in my
J's folder from the previous tutorial
which I made and you guys should all
have this and I'm going to save this as
script dot J s it doesn't really matter
what you name it but just keep in mind
that whatever you name this you're going
to have to use it in just a moment so
I'm going to click Save and now we have
our external javascript file but we
still need to actually link this file to
our web page and the way we're going to
do that is by pretty much doing this
exact same thing we did with the jQuery
file so I'm just going to copy that and
I'm going to paste this but instead of
linking to j/s jQuery or slash jQuery
we're going to be linking to script dot
of this file and I saved it in the same
place that I save my jQuery file ok so
now that we've linked this script file
to our web page we can actually get rid
of the
on-click attribute over here because
we're not going to need that and we're
going to take a look at how to run the
exact same code and hide this paragraph
by using this file over here and the
first thing we want to do is obviously
select this paragraph now since I took
that on click out we're going to have to
give this paragraph an ID and I'm going
to give this an ID of Perak and that'll
be fine so I'll click Save and now we
know we can reference this paragraph by
the ID para so I'm going to go over to
my script and I'm going to add in my
dollar sign and my parenthesis and I'm
going to select the paragraph this
paragraph over here by its ID and the
way I do that is by adding quotation
marks and I'm going to add in a hashtag
or pound key symbol and that's going to
tell the browser that I'm trying to
select by ID and then I'm going to put
the ID of the element that I'm looking
for which in this case is para so I can
go ahead and actually copy that since I
had it selected and I'm going to paste
that in here and now we've selected our
paragraph by its ID and then I'm just
going to go ahead and say on click so
click is pretty much the event that
we're listening for so I'm going to add
that in with some parentheses and in
these parentheses parentheses are going
to type the word function so don't worry
if the syntax looks a little bit scary
for now but basically what we're doing
here is we're just selecting our
paragraph and then on click we're
telling jQuery that we want something to
happen and that's why we're typing this
word function so I'm going to add in
these parentheses and I'm going to then
add in my curly braces and break down a
line like that and this does look
somewhat weird but this is actually how
we code
in jQuery and I'm going to be talking
about all of these selectors and event
handlers and everything in the future so
if you don't really understand what I'm
saying right now then just go ahead and
copy the code test it make sure it works
and we're going to be learning about
selectors and event handlers and things
in the future especially functions so
just copy what I'm doing and hopefully
you'll you'll come right but we're
selecting our paragraph and only on
click we want something to happen and
that's this function and what do we want
to happen well we want to the paragraph
so I'm going to select my paragraph
again and I'm going to say power and I
want this paragraph to hide so this code
should look somewhat familiar from the
previous tutorial we're selecting our
paragraph and then we're using the hide
function to hide it away and I'm going
to click Save and that is this code
finished so we should be able to select
our paragraph and hide it so I'm going
to go over to my browser let's actually
run this in Chrome or Firefox seeing as
I haven't done that yet and there we go
we have our paragraph and when I click
on it it hides away
so that's the difference between using
an external javascript file and inline
javascript and the reason why I showed
you that is because we're going to be
working with an external javascript file
for the next few tutorials and I just
thought it would be best to get this out
the way now so that you guys can see the
difference and that we will you guys
will be able to understand what we're
going to be doing for the next few
tutorials and that's all I have for you
for this video so don't forget to

really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
