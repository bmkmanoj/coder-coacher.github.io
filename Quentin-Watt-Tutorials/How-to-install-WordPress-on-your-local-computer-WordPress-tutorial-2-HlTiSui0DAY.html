here and welcome to this WordPress video
and in this video we are going to
download and install WordPress on to our
local computers now before you get
started going over to WordPress and
downloading all the WordPress files
you're going to have to do something
you're going to have to install Apache
and my sequel on your computer so there
are a bunch of different programs that
you can use to do this the program that
I use is called map which I have open on
my computer over here and if you don't
have map if you've never used map before
go ahead and watch one of these two
videos I'm going to have a video form
downloading and installing map on Mac
and downloading and installing map on
windows pick whichever one is relevant
to you and watch the videos that you
know where to install WordPress then if
you already have MAMP
you're good to go and you can continue
with this tutorials so let's open up
firefox and go over to wordpress.org
which is a wordpress website and i'm
going to leave a link in the description
and then you'll have to click on
download which is going to be up here at
the top corner of the screen and then
you can hit download again and that is
going to prompt you to download a zipped
version of WordPress so pick wherever
you want to save this on your computer
I'm just going to hit save and will put
it on my desktop so let me hit save and
that is going to download all of the
zipped files so oh it's already done I
thought it might take a little bit
longer than that okay so let me pull my
zip file across here and you can see
that I've got this version of WordPress
or version 4.5 of WordPress zipped on my
desktop and now what I need to do is
move it over to the root directory on my
computer which in this case because I'm
using MAMP is in applications MAMP and
htdocs' if you're using Windows the path
is slightly different
but still you need to find this htdocs
folder and then you're going to want to
drag WordPress into that directory and
now we can unzip this and now we've got
some WordPress files but they're all in
a WordPress directory which can be a
little bit annoying because if I go over
to mam and I hit my open start start
page or web start page you can see that
I've got MAMP open and if I go to my
website which is my local host up here I
can see the two wordpress directories so
this is the zip file which obviously we
can't use and then I can go into
WordPress itself and that is going to
open up WordPress but watch what happens
to the URL so the URL is now localhost /
WordPress slash wp-admin and that means
that we'd be running WordPress in a
subdirectory on our route well that is
quite a confusing like sentence to say
but we're going to be running WordPress
in a subdirectory on our root domain or
on our root folder and I don't want that
to happen I want it just to be on our
localhost so we don't want localhost /
WordPress we don't want that
subdirectory right so let's go back over
to my htdocs folder go into wordpress
and i'm going to just grab all of these
files and I'm going to copy them go back
and paste them over here
and then I'm going to delete this
WordPress directory because I'm not
going to need that anymore
I could also delete the wordpress zip
file although I don't think I'm going to
I might want to use this in future so
I'm just going to I'm just going to
leave it here right and now if I close
this and I go back to my website from
the by the way we're on the start page
so let's go ahead and hit my website and
this is
going to open the WordPress installation
so now I can finally run through this
installation of WordPress go ahead and
pick your language I usually just use
English United States although I could
probably use English South Africa seeing
as I am South African but hmm I wonder
what's different let's hit continue and
see and this is now going to download a
language file I suppose English United
States would have been default and it
would have probably not loaded as slowly
okay right so now we've got to the next
step of the installation and it's
basically just telling us what's going
to happen from here so we need to set up
a database and then we need to add in
our database net database name username
and password so if you guys don't know
how to set up a database then if you're
using MAMP
you can kind of just go over to hmm I
thought there might be a quick link here
no okay
well just go over to your localhost if I
can type localhost / 8 8 8 8 and then
type in PHP my slash PHP my admin' Wow
typing skills are not on point today but
yeah go ahead and type this into your
url bar and hit enter and this is going
to take you to PHP myadmin
and from here you can set up a new
database for yourself so I'm going to
hit new and then I'm going to go over to
database and just type in a name so
let's type in WP underscore demo because
it is a wordpress demo and then I'm
going to choose utf-8 for my collation
so let's type in utf-8 and I'll probably
just have to scroll down until I can see
utf-8 general and that is just the
standard code it basically just makes
your database Unicode
and English the English version and not
any of the others okay so let's go back
to general and then hit create and now
we have an empty database which is
exactly what we need for WordPress so we
don't have to do anything here on PHP
myadmin let's just go back to the
wordpress installation and hit let's go
and now I can fill in all of these
details so I'll show you where to get
some of them the word or the database
name is what we just set up so whatever
you typed in as your database name
you're going to have to copy that and
then paste that in database name and
then for username you can go over to
your start page for MAMP
and scroll down and you'll see and there
was the quick link that I was looking
for a second ago so by the way if you
don't wanna type in phpMyAdmin
just go ahead and click on that link and
then from there you can also get your
username and your password which are by
default set to root and root so let's go
back here and just type in root and root
and obviously our database host is our
localhost so we'll just leave that as it
is table prefix by default WordPress
will prefix all tables in the SQL
database with a sequel database with the
letters WP and underscore and I think
I'm going to leave it like that so
there's no reason to change it unless
like you're super worried about security
or something let's go ahead and hit
submit and now run the install and
basically what happened there was we
connected to the database and if it
didn't connect you would have received
an error probably because you can't
connect to your database maybe because
you username or password is incorrect or
localhost is incorrect or something like
that so sup some part of the information
that we
set up earlier must be incorrect but I
did just show you where to get the
correct info so it's this page and then
whatever database name you set up over
here right now we're need we need to
fill in this welcome form which is
basically just giving us our website a
name and then also setting up a user so
we can login to our WordPress website so
for site title I'm just going to add
WordPress demo as the title user name
I'm going to set myself up as a user so
Quinten password you could have used a
randomly generated password I don't know
if you guys saw that but as soon as I
typed in my name it put in a password of
password which is very weak and I'm
think I'm just going to leave it like
this for now because nobody else has
access to my computer so it doesn't
matter if I have a weak password or not
although if this were on a live server I
might want to use a randomly generated
password that is a lot harder to guess
and then if you do not tick this confirm
use a weak password button you're not
going to be able to click the install
WordPress button so go go here and check
this box and then hit install at well
I'm gonna have to put in my email
address as well means a lot of viewers
are going to start emailing me let's
just type in business at Quinten
watch.com and now I can install so there
we go success we've now set up a user
and we've given our website a name
so let's hit login and now I'll have to
log in with the username and the
password that I had just set up which if
you guys can remember correctly we're
just Quinton and password and now I'm
going to log in and now we're logged
into the backend of WordPress so this is
our wordpress installation and if i
hover over the
the site title over here whatever you
typed in as your site title will show up
here so I typed in WordPress demo but if
you've typed in my website or whatever
it's going to show up here then you can
go ahead and hit the visit site button
and that'll take you to the front end of
your website which right now for me
looks kind of boring but this is the
WordPress 2016 theme and it's just a one
random blog post that was set up and
your website title so whatever you typed
in again as your website title is going
to appear here and in the next couple
tutorials I'm going to show you guys how
to change all of this information and
how to add more posts and add images and
all that good stuff so if you're ever
logged out of WordPress and you want to
be able to log back into your WordPress
site you might be at the front end of
your WordPress site thinking like hey
how do I log in well you just go to your
domain name or your URL name which in my
case is localhost 4/8 but for in your
case it might be like dub dub dub
yourwebsite.com and all you want to do
is add back slash WP dash admin and that
is going to let you login to your
WordPress installation so if I hit enter
there we go I'm now in on the login page
and I can just put my details in and
login if you like that video there are a
