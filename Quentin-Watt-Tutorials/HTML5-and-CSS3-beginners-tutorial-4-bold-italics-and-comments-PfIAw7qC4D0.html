here and welcome to tutorial number four
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at how to bold and italicize
italicized text in HTML and we're also
going to take a look at comments and the
horizontal rule so the first thing we
can do is just delete all this code from
the previous tutorial and now to bold or
italicize something we need to have some
text on our screen so let's go ahead and
just put out a paragraph and this
paragraph can just say this text will be
bold and something will be in italics
too and I see there's a bunch of typos
but we'll just leave them alone okay so
if I run this in Firefox now I'll get a
paragraph printed on the screen but you
guys already know that so I'm not even
going to waste my time showing you so
let's go ahead and bold something first
okay so let's say I wanted the word bold
to be displayed in bold like in bold
print then I'd go ahead and I'd start
off a strong tag okay so strong in HTML
means bold and that means okay we're
going to start bolding everything from
this tag until we get to an ending
strong tag so let's go ahead and end
this off over here and now when we
refresh this in Firefox we should get
just this word bold in bold print so
let's go ahead and save that run in
Firefox and as you can see this text
will be bold so bold is actually bolded
and everything else is normal and if we
want to bold something else
we could go ahead and just put in the
strong tag over there and
and it off over here
don't forget the closing slash so go
ahead and save this now and when we
refresh now just this text has been
bolded so that's cool
let's take a look at how to actually
emphasize something or put it in italics
okay and I actually just gave you a hint
at what the tag is so we'll emphasize
this these two words italics - okay so
to put something in italics you're going
to go ahead and type in the tag e/m and
then ending a.m. where you would like it
to stop okay so this means that the word
italics and two are going to be
italicized so if we go ahead and we save
this now come back to fire flock for
fire flocks and click refresh we now
have the words italics to being
italicized so that's cool now the next
thing I said I wanted to talk to you
guys about was the horizontal rule so
let's say I had two completely separate
paragraphs let's go ahead and make one
and this can just say man I like making
tutorials or something like that for you
okay let's say we wanted this to be
clear to the user that these are two
completely separate paragraphs okay so
this would be one and that would be the
other and you want to actually divide
them with like some kind of a line okay
then we've got this tag called the
horizontal rule which is actually just H
R with a closing slash so similar to the
BR tag except this one makes a line
instead of breaking down a line okay
so let's go ahead and save this and then
we'll
we'll go back to firefox and click
refresh and as you can see we've got the
one paragraph and then we've got this
line in the middle which clearly
separates these two paragraphs so we've
at least made clear to the user that
this is one paragraph and that is
another one that is where we would use
this horizontal rule tag but there's a
whole bunch of other uses for it yes you
guys will see fit to use it wherever you
need okay and the last thing I wanted to
talk to you guys about was comments in
HTML
okay now comments are basically words
that you want the browser to ignore but
still notes that you can see yourself so
let's say I wasn't actually happy with
this paragraph and I wanted to change it
before I put it up on my website or
maybe I thought there were a few typos
and then I just want to put a comment
here to tell whoever looks at this code
after me or maybe if I look at it in a
month's time just want to leave a note
for myself like check this paragraph
here there might be typos okay I can't
just go ahead and write check this
paragraph there might be typos typers
okay I can't just go ahead and type
something like that because when I do
that it shows up in the browser so the
browser is clearly not ignoring it so if
I actually want the browser to ignore
these words but I still want to be able
to see them in the text editor I can go
ahead and have to type in these symbols
so it starts off with the smaller than
sign then the exclamation mark and then
you have to put in I guess this thing
called a hyphen or a minus sign so you
have to put two of those in and then you
need to go to the end of wherever your
comment is and go - - and the greater
than sign okay so that is how you make a
comment
and obviously everything in the comment
turns green if you're using notepad plus
plus so then you know where your comment
starts and where it ends what you saw
earlier that all of this was green like
that that means my comment hasn't ended
yet and this is all going to be ignored
by the browser so we're not even going
to get that stuff showing up if we don't
close our tag properly just go ahead and
save us now and click refresh and as you
can see my comment doesn't show up how
it was right here so that's not showing
up anymore
but I can still see it here in notepad
plus plus so I know okay I need to check
this paragraph there could be some typos
so that that's why comments are useful
okay so that's actually all I have for
