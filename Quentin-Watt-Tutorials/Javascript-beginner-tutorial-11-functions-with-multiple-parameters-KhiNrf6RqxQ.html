here and welcome to tutorial number 11
and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about functions with multiple
parameters so in the last video I
explained that we could include a
parameter in the parentheses of our
function and when we did this it was
basically the same as declaring a new
variable and that we were free to use
this variable anywhere within our
function however what I didn't tell you
is that we can have multiple parameters
inside of the parentheses of our
function so let's go ahead and delete
all of this and then we'll make a
function that actually uses more than
one parameter so what I decided to do
was we'll make a function that adds two
numbers together and then prints out the
answer on the screen so let's go ahead
and just make that function so function
and I will call it add numbers okay and
then I'll put in my parentheses and my
curly braces you guys kind of get the
point by now
and what we can do is before we worry
about anything in here let's talk about
multiple parameters so the way we give
multiple parameters or use multiple
parameters in our function is we type
the name of our first parameter which
I'm going to call num1 for number one
and then I separate my different
parameters with a comma
so after number one I can type num2 for
number two and those will be my two
numbers that I add together so what we
can do now is actually just start
working on the code that adds these two
numbers together
so what I can do is we can make a third
variable which I'll declare with my VAR
keyword saga VAR answer is equal to num1
plus num2 okay so basically the variable
answer is now holding the value of these
two numbers added together so what I can
do is just go ahead and print that out
on the screen so document dot right and
inside our brackets over here inside our
parentheses we just write the variable
answer but what I want to do is
concatenate a break on to the end so go
ahead and just put in our break tag HTML
tag and what this is going to do is it's
just going to mean that if we call this
function three or four times every time
this this function prints out the answer
onto the page it's going to start on a
new line
okay that's basically all it means so go
ahead and just end that off with a
semicolon and now what I can do is I can
call this function and pass in different
values by separating the values with a
comma so let's go ahead and call the
function add numbers and inside my
parentheses I can assign num1 the value
of two and then separate this with a
comma and assign num to the value of
four so when I go ahead and end this off
with a semicolon and save you can see
when I run this in Firefox the answer
will be printed out on the screen which
is six okay so that's pretty cool and
just like the previous tutorial we can
use this function as many times as we
want and get a different answer printed
out on the screen depending on what
value we pass to our variables so let's
go ahead and
call this function a few more times so
go ahead and control C and what we can
do now is we can pass the value of like
15 and 3 and we can pass the value of 12
and 24 and we should get all of these
answers printed out on the screen on a
new line so if I go back to Firefox and
I click refresh you can see we now have
6 18 and 36 which is basically all of
those numbers added together okay
so let's go back and recap for a second
so I'll just go ahead and minimize this
and what we did here was we created a
function that used more than one
parameter and the way we separate our
parameters is just by separating them
with a comma so that Java Script knows
okay
this is parameter one that's parameter
two and if I had a third one then that
would be the third parameter over there
and if I wanted to pass three values
then I'd also just separate the three
values or with commas as well okay so
that's basically how to use multiple
parameters with a function and that's
actually all I have for you guys in this
video so don't forget to subscribe and
if you found this video helpful then it
would mean a lot to me if you guys could
click that like button or just let me
know in a comment below that I was
helpful and then I'll be happy so thanks
guys and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
