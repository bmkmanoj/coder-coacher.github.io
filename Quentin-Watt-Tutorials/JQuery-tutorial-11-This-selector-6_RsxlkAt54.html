here and in this video we're going to
take a look at the this selector in
jQuery and we've actually used it a few
times in the series already but I
thought I would just give it its own
video so I could explain exactly what it
is used for so right now we've got these
three paragraphs over here and if I run
this in my browser then we basically
have three paragraphs that don't do
anything if I click them but they do
prompt us to actually click each
paragraph so let's use jQuery to make it
so that whenever I click one of these
paragraphs it changes the text in the
paragraph itself but only on the
paragraph that I click and not on any
other paragraphs on the page so we could
go ahead and actually do this really
simply using inline jQuery so let's
let's use inline jQuery first and I'm
going to say on click so we'll use this
event handler here and I'm going to set
this equal to something so first thing I
have to do is actually use my this
selector which I'm going to grab now and
what this the selector does is select
the current element so in this case
because the element that was clicked is
the one that also has this attribute or
this unclick attribute over here we're
only going to change this paragraph
we're not going to change any of these
others so I'm going to say the start
text and we can change the text of this
paragraph to something else and I'm
going to have to use single quotation
marks here so make sure if you've got
double quotation marks on the outside
that you're using single quotation marks
here and I'm going to say that tickles
so as soon as I click on one of the
these paragraphs or this paragraph
specifically it's going to say that
tickles but I
can actually copy this and I could paste
it in on this paragraph and on this
paragraph as well and when I click save
and go back over to the browser and
click refresh now when I click on my top
paragraph that text in that paragraph
changes to that tickles again when I
click on the next paragraph same thing
and the last paragraph same thing over
there as well so this this selector make
sure that we only select the current
element or whichever elements triggered
this on click event okay and that's
really easy or it's done really easily
when we're doing this with inline jQuery
but if I try to do it over here in my
external file you'll see we're going to
hit a little bit of a problem so I'm
actually just going to get rid of all of
that and let's do it using our external
script okay
so the first thing we need to do is
actually select our paragraphs on our
page and we're going to do that the
normal way by just selecting all
paragraphs like this with the element
selector and I'm going to listen up for
if any one of those paragraphs was
clicked and if they are clicked we want
to do something and what do we want to
do well we want to get the specific
element that was clicked right so you
might be thinking okay well I should
just go ahead and grab one of the
paragraphs that was clicked again and
then change this text over here to
something else like that tickles
and we probably should have put
something else here but it doesn't
matter now when I click Save and go back
over to Chrome or not Chrome but Firefox
when I click on this first paragraph
you'll notice that every single one of
my paragraphs change then all I did was
click on the first one and now
because of this selector I care because
we selected to listen to if one of the
paragraphs was clicked and then we
changed all of the paragraphs text to
that tickles and we don't want to do
that we actually just want to change the
current element so in in fact the
element that triggered this event to
occur we only want to select that
element and change that elements text to
that tickles so the way we do that is by
using the this selector and I'm going to
click Save and we'll go back over to
Firefox now and now when I click refresh
and we test this out now it should work
properly so if I click on the first
paragraph only that one changes if I
click on the last paragraph only that
one changes and if I click on the middle
one now that one changes as well so this
this selector helps us to select
whichever elements triggered whatever
event we were listening out for at the
top of the page even if there are
multiple elements that could select or
could trigger that event and that's all
