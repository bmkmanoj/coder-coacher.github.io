here and welcome to tutorial number 28
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to create gradients in HTML
so go over to your text editor and right
now I'm starting my index file off which
is this basic template that we've always
been using there is nothing in the body
then in main CSS this is my CSS file
there's nothing here and so of course if
we look at this in the browser it is
blank so what I want to do is create a
div so let's start off by creating this
div I'm going to give this div a class
of grad which stands for gradient I'm
just going to save it like this so now
we have a div on our page and I'm going
to leave it completely empty now in
order to make that div visible in the
browser I'm just going to give it a few
o'clock a few styling rules some a
select a class of grad and I'm going to
give the div a height of 300 pixels a
width of 100% and I'm going to give it a
background color of red so now we have a
big red div on the page and what I'd
like to do so the only reason why the
only reason why I put these styling
rules yet is basically so that we can
see it because if I didn't put these
filing rules here we wouldn't be able to
see the div all right so now that we can
actually see it let's go ahead and add
another attribute which is also
background and this attribute will
overwrite this attribute okay so the
second background attribute will
background styling rule is going to add
our gradient so let's type in linear
gradient and I'm going to open up some
parentheses and I'm going to end that
off with a semicolon and inside of these
parentheses we can add in a bunch of
attributes the first one would be the
and then the next one's our colors and
we can have a number of colors so you
don't have to only have one color you
could I mean ID you want at least two
but you could just have you know up to
as many as you like I mean I don't I'm
not sure if there is a limit or not but
somebody would have to google that and
find out and leave it in the comment
right I don't think you're going to be
using more than like five or six anyway
but yeah basically just add in a
direction where you want the gradient to
go if you don't add a direction it's
usually going to go from top to bottom
but a direction would be to write or to
left and that will change the direction
of the gradient right then let's just
work with two colors for now so you can
make one side of your gift red and then
it can fade into another color which I'm
going to just use yellow right so it
saves this now come back to the browser
and hit refresh and you can see we've
got red fading into yellow and this is
going from from left to right and that
was our direction to the right we can
also change this to left and then what
it'll do is it'll start red on the right
and fade in to the left and we can
change the direction up as well so it
can be too tough which will start at the
bottom and go up or it can be to bottom
and of course then it starts at the
let's say to bottom yeah okay to bottom
so it starts at the top and it fades its
way down into yellow at the bottom right
so yeah that is how you change the
directions of gradients and how you can
pick colors so you can pick red or
yellow as like preset colors but you can
also use RGB values like I don't know 30
you thirty thirty and that's going to be
like a light gray and then you can you
know mix it so you don't have to use RGB
over here I mean we could use whatever
you texted decimal colors and go ef ef
ef so it doesn't really matter how you
pick your color like it can be a wording
color like a preset color or it can be
an RGB value or it can be a hexadecimal
value as long as it's a color and your
gradient will work so now we're going
from like a dark grey into like a very
light gray right so that is how you pick
your colors and like I said you can have
a lot of multiple colors right so let's
make this fade in to the right and let's
use a number of colors here so I'm going
to start off with red then we can fade
it into orange and then we can fade it
into yellow then we can fade it into
blue then we can fade it into indigo
then we can fade it into violet so these
are all preset colors that come in CSS
and if we save this and come back over
to the browser and hit refresh hey we
have a rainbow although I think I kind
of missed green so that should be
somewhere over there hi and if we add
green in it looks more like a rainbow
awesome
yeah that's how you make a rainbow with
gradients and gradients can be linear
but they can also be radial so if we
change this to radial and then our
direction has to change because it can't
be to the right or to the left anymore
but let's just use radial gradients with
all these colors and see what happens
nothing and I believe that that might be
because we can't use so many colors or
something or it might because I felt
radial wrong okay it's a radio yeah okay
not radial
okay refresh there we go so now we've
got violet blue green yellow orange and
red in a radial gradient so it's a
circular gradient right let's get rid of
all these colors because it does look a
bit confusing when there's a lot and
instead let's just work with two come on
yellow red and yellow as our colors
great so now we've got red and yellow
okay so that's how you play around with
gradients there's a lot more stuff you
can do with them like in fact if we
change this back to a linear gradient
and we made this fade from RGB a of zero
zero zero zero
this should give us a transparent color
so we can make transparent or
see-through color fade into an actual
color so in this case we can make it say
from transparent interior let's try and
read it just because that's probably
gonna be the easiest to see and now
we've got it transparent at the top and
it sort of slowly fades into red as it
goes so if you make a go to the right as
well maybe we can see that a little bit
more clearly but it's like almost
completely clear here and then it fades
into red as we get to the end and there
are a number of different things you can
do with this so like I said you can use
a lot of different colors you can use
radial gradients or linear gradients you
can even adjust where the gradient
starts and ends if it repeats and all of
that kind of stuff is going to be a
little bit extra because you add
percentages values into here and if
you're interested in learning how to do
that basically you know just go ahead
and check how Google and I'll see you
guys next time
I just want to send a shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain they run a
coding bootcamp with courses on iOS
development UX design and web
development and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within two
of weeks so check out their website the
