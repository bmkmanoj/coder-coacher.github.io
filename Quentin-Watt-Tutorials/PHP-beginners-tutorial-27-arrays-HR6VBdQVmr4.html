here and welcome back to tutorial number
27 and in this video we are going to
start looking at something called an
array now an array is actually a
variable that can contain multiple
values so in other words I could store
an entire list of people's names or an
entire list of any other kind of value
as an array so here is one way to make
an array we'll start off by declaring a
new variable so I'm going to call mine
people because we're going to store a
bunch of people's names okay and then
I'm going to set this equal to array and
we have to use parentheses here okay and
this is basically a function that will
make an array for us okay and the first
value I want to put in here is going to
be a string so of course we have to use
quotation marks and I'm going to set
that equal to Ryan then when we want to
start over to our second value then
we're going to put in a comma okay so
basically you separate all your
different values of your array with a
comma so now let's go ahead and store
Sean in the second place and then in the
third place we can store Kyle and in the
last place we'll store myself
quinton okay so this was basically all
my high school friends growing up and
then me okay well not all my friends
just my best friends okay
and now let's try and take a look at how
to print one of these values out okay
because it's going to be slightly more
complicated than you might think okay I
can't just go ahead and type in echo
people because this is an array it's an
entire list so the computer's not going
to know which value we want to be
printed out or which value we're trying
to
work with and when you go ahead and do
something like this you're going to get
an error so it says array string
conversion blah blah blah it just tells
us that we have an array but we're what
you're trying to print out an array okay
so instead whenever you want to work
with a value in an array you're going to
go ahead and use these square brackets
just like that okay and inside the
square brackets you are going to put in
the array index of whichever element you
are trying to work with so because we're
working with a computer here computers
start counting at zero so in other words
this would be index zero
Ryan would be index zero Shawn would be
index one
Kyle would be index 2 and Quinten would
be index three okay
so if I go here and I just put in an
index of zero and now save this and
click refresh you can see we have Ryan
printed out on the screen so like I said
because Ryan is an index of zero if I go
back here and I put in an index of two
then remember we're counting zero one
two so we now should have Kyle print it
out and there we go Kyle so that's
actually pretty cool and I know
sometimes we might not always have the
entire list of values that we want to
store in our array straight away okay so
sometimes we might decide well what we
want to know we want to use an array but
we just don't know how many values we're
going to have or we don't know what the
values are going to be then we don't
have to make an array this way okay we
could just start off by saying people
zero okay and then we set that equal to
whoops
set that equal to Ryan
and then further down we can go ahead
and say people to or yeah
people want sorry and we're going to set
that equal to again Shawn so in other
words we could probably even use a loop
or something like that to assign values
and then later on we could go ahead and
still use those values anytime we wanted
just like this okay so this this is
basically our second way to make an
array as soon as we've just started off
a variable with square brackets on the
side then the computer knows okay we're
making an array and it goes ahead and it
fills that array position in with the
value over here okay so now when I go
ahead and click refresh there we go
we have Shawn declared and working
already so those are the two different
ways to make an array in PHP okay but
let's take a look at modifying an array
so I'm going to go just push and do a
few times over here and so we have our
previous array back okay
what happens if let's say I've got this
this list year Ryan Shawn Kyle quinton
but instead I wanted to change the first
value to Stacy so let's just say Ryan
wasn't my friend anymore or something
like that I wanted to change his name to
Stacy then I could go ahead and add in a
line over here just modify that so I can
go ahead and say people 1 sorry
or people 0 my bad people zero equals
Stacy and now when I go ahead and print
out people zero okay I should get Stacy
printed out in the place of where Ryan
should have been okay so we started off
our array with Ryan in the first place
or the zero with index but then we
change this
index to Stacey and now we're going to
print out the 0th index so we should get
Stacey printed out and I have an error
probably because I did not put a
semicolon in at the end of my line cool
go back and click refresh there we go
Stacey okay so that's how to modify an
element or an index in the array now
let's go ahead and take a look at how to
delete an index okay
so all I have to do is go ahead and type
in this function unset and then I'll
just go ahead and put in the index that
I want to unset so that let's just say
we wanted to unset people 0 okay then
we've gone ahead and done that okay so
now we've started our array off with
people zero being Ryan but then we just
deleted Ryan from the array completely
and now we're trying to echo out an
empty value so we're probably going to
get an error let's go back here and
click refresh and as you can see
undefined offset zero so this basically
means there is no value in the zeroeth
index of our array because we went ahead
and we deleted it okay so if you ever
want to delete a value from an array you
want to try not to use it again
otherwise you're going to get an error
okay so it's probably best if you have
kind of change something that's in our
array just to modify it rather than to
delete it okay and this will still work
for the rest of the race so if I go
ahead and print out the second index
that should be Kyle again then this
should still work so Kyle still works
it's just that our first index is now
empty okay but that's all I have for you
