here and welcome to tutorial number 21
and in this tutorial I am going to talk
to you guys about the do-while loop
which is slightly different to the while
loop but not by much
so let's first start off by taking a
look at the code from the previous
tutorial so I'm going to paste that in
right now and if you guys can remember I
told you guys that a while loop first
checks for the condition and then runs
the code only if this condition over
here is true and if this condition is
false then this code inside of the while
loop will never ever run so let's say I
changed my counter to 11 so I started
counting at 11 well then this kind of
makes our condition false because now
counter is not less than or equal to 10
it's 11 so now that conditions false and
if I go ahead and save this and I run
this in Firefox you can see we get a
blank web page nothing happens
why because that code doesn't run
because this condition is false now
although that works there might be a
time when you would like your code in
the loop to run at least once before
checking the condition or before
deciding to stop even if the condition
is false and for this reason we have the
do-while loop and the syntax for the
do-while loop goes as follows so let me
just go ahead and delete this okay we
type in the word du which as you can see
it's a keyword so it's turned blue and
then we're not putting any parentheses
in here right now what we're going to do
is we're going to open our curly braces
and inside of here
that is where our statements will go so
this is where whatever we want to happen
inside of our loop this is where all of
that goes and then at the bottom after
this closing curly brace we type in the
word while and then we'll put in uh
parentheses okay and inside these
parentheses that's where we will put our
condition so as you guys can see from
this syntax when this loop runs the
computer first does all of these lines
of code so it reaches this line that is
due and it goes okay you want me to do
stuff and then it goes ahead and it runs
all of these statements inside of our
loop first and then it comes down and it
sees the condition here and then then it
checks the condition and goes okay is
this condition true and if the condition
is true then it'll start the loop again
and carry on going until this condition
becomes false so much like a while loop
it'll carry on looping until the
condition becomes false and then after
that the computer would obviously
continue with the rest of our code but
in this case there isn't any so that
would be the end of the program now
because we only check for the condition
at the end of the statements this means
that this code inside of the state or
inside of this loop will always run at
least once even if this condition is
false because we're only checking for
the condition at the end so let's go
ahead and test this out a few times okay
and what we need to do is we also have
to have a counter for this loop because
we need to count how many times this
loop runs otherwise we're going to land
up having an infinite loop and like I
told you guys infinite loops are bad you
don't ever want to make one so I'm not
even going to make one just for the
purposes of showing you it's just don't
don't go there just make sure that you
always use a counter
so I'll go ahead and save our counter
and we might as well start counting at 1
because we're people so 1 and then we'll
put in some statements inside here so
let's say I want to print something out
on the screen we can just go ahead and
say document dot write and what do we
want to write on the screen we might as
well just write this is iteration and
then we'll concatenate our counter on
here and then we'll also concatenate a
break just to make sure that every time
this is printed out it'll appear on a
new line okay so we'll go ahead and put
a semicolon on there and then we'll go
ahead and increment our counter like I
told you guys in the previous tutorial
we have to make sure that our counter is
always incremented inside of our loop so
that way this counter will eventually I
will keep going up and then it will
eventually meet our condition which we
will sit right now so let's go ahead and
we'll say this must loop ten times so in
order to do that we'll just say while
counter is less than or equal to ten
okay so we're including ten in our loop
so that means we'll run one time two
times three times until we get to ten
it'll still run when counter is equal to
ten but after that counter will be equal
to eleven and the code will never run
okay that code inside the loop will stop
sorry okay so let's go ahead and save
this and go back to Firefox and we can
click refresh and as you can see we now
have ten lines printed out on the screen
and it just says this is iteration 1
this is iteration 2 this is it
3x so and so on so you can see our loop
actually ran 10 times and if we want to
fix this little space issue up then we
can probably just go ahead and go back
to our code and put a space in our
sentence over there so go ahead and save
that now click refresh and we've got
some spaces in between our numbers which
just looks a little bit more tidy okay
now that's what would happen if our
condition inside our parentheses here
was true but let's say it was false so
let's go ahead and change counter back
to 11 so that means that when we finally
reach this counter condition of year
when we finally reach this condition
counter it's going to evaluate to false
because counter is 11 so 11 is not less
than or equal to 10 but let's go ahead
and save this and then go back to
Firefox click refresh and see what
happens as you can see the loop still
ran once even though this condition over
here was false our loop still ran once
and that's because we checked for our
condition at the end so we ran the code
first we told the computer do this okay
so the computer went ahead and it
printed this out on the screen and then
it increased counter and then I checked
the condition I was like okay hold up
you only wanted me to to print this out
on the screen as long as Counsell was
less than or equal to 10 well I've done
it once for you already anyway but
seeing as the conditions false we'll
just stop right there
okay so that's what I do while loop does
it will loop very similar to a while
loop except it'll always loop at least
once or the code inside the loop will
always print at least once as even if
the condition is false basically so
