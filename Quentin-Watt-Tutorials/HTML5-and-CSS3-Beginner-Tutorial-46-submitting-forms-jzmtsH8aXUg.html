to tutorial number 46 and in this
tutorial we are just going to talk about
clearing the form or resetting creating
a reset button and then I also want to
talk about submitting the form so we'll
do the submitting part lost just because
that's going to involve a lot of
programming talk and if you guys are
following just for design purposes
that's fine you'll be able to follow
along with this tutorial okay but
anything when I start talking about
programming if that goes over your head
and you get a little bit confused then
you know don't worry because programmers
will probably understand or guys that
want to get into programming will
understand but if you're following this
just for design purposes then again
don't even worry if I start saying it's
for programming then just switch off
right there okay so let's go ahead and
for now let's put in an input type is
equal to text and we'll just give the
name is equal to name and this is just
so that we've got some daughter to work
with so let's say we were asking the
user for their name what is your name
then they'd have to fill in their name
and now we can do is just give this a
break and we'll add in another button in
the bottom of here input type and we're
going to give this input a type of reset
and what reset does is it takes whatever
data has been folded in the form and
just deletes it pretty much so it's not
there anymore so input type equals reset
and we'll just give it a name or reset
and then we can go ahead and give it a
value and we can set this value equal to
clear the form and if you guys don't
know what a value does then
whatever is inside of this attribute
value is going to be what's written on
our button so maybe just it'll be better
if you see what's happening here so
value is clear the form and when I run
this in Firefox then the value of my
button is clear the form so pretty
self-explanatory
now that you actually saw what it does
and as you can see our website now asks
what is your name and you can go ahead
and fill in your name over there like -
Quinton and now what happens is because
this is a reset button whenever we go
ahead and we click on this button
whatever is inside of our form
disappears and this would work even if
you had like 20 input elements on your
form or input type of text on your form
it would delete all 20 of those so if
you've got anything on your form that
has been folded by the user and they
click this button boom that information
is all gone and that could probably be
kind of annoying to a user if they click
that button by accidents so I see there
are quite a few websites that don't have
a button like this at the bottom of
their form and then there are also some
that do so it's your preference if you
want the user to be able to delete
whatever's in their form you know maybe
they get halfway through the form and
they decide no they don't want to give
that information to you anymore and they
click clear then you know that's up to
them they can do that but yeah so if you
want to include the Clear button on your
form go ahead and do that if you don't
then that's fine too because I actually
think there's a lot of people out there
that don't use that button so just for
the purpose that they don't want
anything to get deleted by accidents so
that's fine and now what we can do is we
can go ahead and start talking about
actually submitting the information that
has been fold in so go ahead and just
delete that clear button and instead of
using a Clear button
what we want to do now is we're going to
use an input with a type equal to submit
and that's also going to show up as a
button so input type equals submit and
then we'll go value is equal to submit
or you could put send here if you wanted
to so like send and look at the name
also equal to submit so here we go now
have a submit button on our form and if
you refresh this in Firefox you can see
our button now says submit and it
actually has a completely different
purpose to the reset button because what
the submit button does is it'll take
whatever information you fold in so
let's say I says what is your name and I
fold in my name Quinton then this
information is now stored as like a
variable or well we'll talk about that
variables and programming stuff later
but we can now send this information
through to our server and actually start
doing clever stuff with it like we can
start putting it in our database or you
know start searching in our database for
a value of Quinton or something to that
effect so there's a whole lot of
programming stuff that we can do with
this value over here but only once it
has been submitted so only once the
users click the submit button and what
we need now need to do is we actually
need a little bit more information
because the submit button on its own
just like this isn't going to send the
data to the correct place so let's go
back to notepad plus plus and if you
remember from our previous tutorial I
told you guys that we have some
attributes so actually have to fill in
in the top of our form and we're going
to have to do that now so this is what
happens when we want to submit the form
we need to find out where we want to
send this information too so because
we've asked for my name where do we want
to send my name to and what do we want
to do with it so let's just we'll send
it to another page so you type in action
that is the attribute and the action is
where we want to send our name to so
let's just say I wanted to send my name
to second page and we currently have to
be some clever page it can't be an HTML
page because HTML you can't really do
any programming with it so let's just
say PHP and if you don't know what PHP
is it's a programming language but I'm
not going to get explain this in too
much detail we just need to know that we
have to send our information somewhere
to get processed so that's somewhere
where we are sending this to is second
page and then we need to find out how we
want to send our information to second
page so there are two different ways
that you can send information with web
development and the first way is a
method called get which basically what
that does is it'll take my name and
it'll put it up here on the top of the
browser and it will attach it on to the
end of the URL over here so you'd see
something like where is the question or
question mark and then name is equal to
Quinton so that's probably what you'd
see if you are sending a get request or
if you are sending your information with
the get method and then so let's go
ahead and just say your method so you
can set this equal to get or you can set
this method equal to post and what the
post method does is instead of sending
it up here in the URL as part of the URL
it sends it as a completely separate
message so you
you would get redirected to the
different page so let's say you clicked
the submit button you would get
redirected to second page dot PHP and
then your name Quinton would arrive
afterwards as a second part or a second
bit of information so if you guys don't
understand what I'm saying there don't
you know don't worry it's probably a
little bit over your head for now but
we'll learn about those methods a little
bit later on okay so let's just go ahead
and click the submit button for fun just
to see what happens we go ahead and
click it and as you can see our URL
changed at the top here and we went from
going to be at index dot PHP or index
dot HTML to go into second page dot PHP
and as you can see second page lock PHP
doesn't actually exist on my computer at
the moment and so we get this error so
that's fine and if you guys didn't
understand anything that was happening
here then don't worry and we'll get to
that a little bit later on when we
actually start talking about programming
and you guys will eventually understand
but for now thanks for watching and I'll
see you guys next time don't forget to
subscribe please check out my previous
videos comment like and share on all my
videos please it's really going to help
my channel grow and please don't forget
