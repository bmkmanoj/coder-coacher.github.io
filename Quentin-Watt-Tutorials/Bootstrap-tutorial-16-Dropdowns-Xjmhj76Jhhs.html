here and welcome to tutorial number 16
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to create a little
drop-down button or a drop-down menu in
bootstrap and we're the reason why I'm
showing you guys this is because we're
going to be making a navbar in the next
tutorial and you guys need to kind of
understand the basics of just having a
drop-down so we can add the drop-down
into our menu in the next tutorial or
into our navbar but for now we're just
going to create a little drop-down menu
so to do that I'm going to open up a div
tag and we're going to close that off
and this stuff tag needs a class of
drop-down so let's say a class and we'll
set that equal to drop-down and that
just means that this div is going to
have a drop-down in it okay so let's
save that and inside of this div is
where we're actually going to put our
content so the first thing we need to do
is add a button and the next element
that we have to put below that is going
to be an unordered list so unordered
list there we go now we have one and by
the way we still need to put a bit of
content in side of each one of these
elements and not only do we have to do
that but each one of these elements is
going to have a list of classes and
other attributes that is like a million
miles long okay
I kid maybe not so long but there really
are a lot of classes that we're going to
have to add to this button right now so
for our button let's add in our content
and I want my button to say drop down
and this is just going to be the caption
that goes onto the button then the next
thing I want to do is add a span tag and
I'm going to give the span a class equal
to carrot and if you guys aren't sure
what this
it does or if you don't know what a
carat is then basically if I come back
over to my browser and I'll refresh this
back to the code that we just had here
sorry I kind of you can see that I was
practicing beforehand but yeah I had now
have a button and it's got a little
triangle symbol over this so that is a
caret and yeah I guess I'm maybe not
pronouncing that right
maybe it's carat or something I have no
idea but there we go that is how you add
one of these to your button just a
little clasp like that and now what we
need to do is continue with this button
so I also need to give this button a
clasp and I'm going to give it a class
of BTN I'm also going to give it a
secondary class of BTN - default which
is just going to make it look like a
default button in bootstrap I also want
to add in another class which is
drop-down - toggle and this is therefore
you know toggling our drop-down so when
you click on it the list is going to
drop down and you click on it again it's
going to make the list disappear then we
also need to give this button a type of
just button and that's just there to
tell the browser that we're actually
using this button to be a button and not
a submit button or anything like that
okay
ID we're going to use to identify this
button to this list so whatever I give
whatever ID I give to this button I also
have to add that same ID as an attribute
over here somewhere to my list and I'll
be getting to that in just a second but
let's just add an ID of drop-down menu
right and I also want to add another
attribute so while like I said this
button is going to have a list of
attributes that are just so long but
anyway
data toggle and I'm going to set data
toggle equal to drop-down and that just
means that this button is going to
toggle the drop-down then the next thing
I want to do is go over to my unordered
list and we need to give this some
content as well so you guess that we're
going to be adding in some list items
and inside of these list items we could
put a bunch of links or any other
content so I'm just going to I'm going
to create a link and we'll just href
that to hash at the moment and I'm going
to add some text as the dummy text of
yes or some text and then I want to just
duplicate this a couple times so some
more text and let's just say something
else come Leedy cool so we've got a
unordered list here as well we need to
just give this unordered list some
classes so I'm going to give that a
class of drop-down - menu so you can see
that this is now in line with no that's
just a class but when I add in area
- labeled - by then we're going to set
that equal to the ID that we have over
here so control C control V and this
attribute kind of ties this button to
this unordered list as well as that
drop-down menu drop-down menu remember
seeing this somewhere that there was
another link between the two it should
have always been
data toggle but I guess
that's not going to happen so let me go
ahead and hit refresh and test this out
and you can see that it works perfectly
so that is our drop-down list where we
basically add a million classes to this
button and then we add a few classes to
this unordered list and they're linked
between the two of them so now whenever
you click on this button it drops this
list down over here and that is all I
have for you guys in this tutorial so
