and welcome to tutorial number 14 and in
this tutorial we are gonna be taking a
look at making our header for our
website responsive so right now the
desktop version looks pretty similar or
pretty much exactly the same as our
design I think the only difference here
is that our font weight is not really
where we want it to be but I think we
can always fix this at a later stage
what I'd like to do now though is
convert this header or this nav bar to
work on mobile because right now if I
right-click on our website and I inspect
elements in Google Chrome if you take a
look in the top corner over here in
Google Chrome you can toggle your device
to be a mobile phone and in this case
you can choose a kind of device that
you'd like to use and in this case
iPhone 6 is already set up for us and
I'm gonna just set that to 100% but
right now our there there are two
problems right so one of the problems is
that our device hasn't really scaled to
fit the screen size so essentially what
I've done here is I've I've left out a
bit of code a very very important bit of
code that we need to add into our
website template so if we go over to our
header tag I need to paste in this
little bit of code right so this is a
meta tag that essentially just checks
what the viewport sizes and then sets
the content size to the same size as the
viewport it's very very important it
makes our website responsive now while
we're here there's also another little
bit of code that I've left out which is
another meta tag so let's go meta
charset is equal to utf-8 that makes our
website unicode so these are two very
very important bits of code we should
not have built our website without them
but now they're there so what I'm gonna
do is just close off this header because
I think everything is now fixed there
and if I jump back over to Google Chrome
and
hit the refresh button tada our website
has now kind of scaled to fit our phones
everything still looks sort of okay but
we've got a few problems in the fact
that this navigation needs to be
responsive and it isn't so let's work on
fixing that and the way we do that is if
you go over to UI kits website go to the
navbar section and scroll down a little
bit until you get to responsive
visibility so this is very important
there are certain things that you can
hide and show using the UK hidden class
and the UK visible class a UK hidden
small and UK visible small will allow
you to hide things that should be hidden
on a small screen on a phone screen and
then show things that should be visible
on a phone screen so I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this class UK hidden small and
I'm gonna paste that in a few places the
first place I want to paste that is our
logo because I don't want our I don't
want this logo to be visible on a small
screen I also don't want this menu so I
don't want this logo visible I don't
want this menu visible and I don't want
this menu visible on small screen so
we're gonna go ahead and hide all of
them actually
so this nav we can hide that and this
div or this UK nav bar flip we can hide
that so all of those are going to be
hidden now what I'd like to do is
uncomment this thing that says it'll be
useful for mobile later and yeah we're
going to use these for our mobile screen
so what I'd like to do is take that
exact same class UK hidden small and we
want to change that to UK visible small
for this one and we want to change it to
UK visible small for this one as well
and I think what I'd like to do is
actually take this link and paste it
before the content right so if we save
this and we jump back over to google
chrome let's take a look at
what I've done here so what I've done is
essentially hide everything that we
didn't want and then I've put in our
little three bar thing our hamburger
menu which is this link here and then
I've also got a div that is ready to
hold a logo for our centered logo which
kind of looks exactly like our mobile
design over here so we have the little
hamburger menu thing and then we have
our centered logo so in order to add
that logo there what I like to do is
jump back over to our text editor and we
already have the logo set up as a link
so I'm just going to go ahead and copy
that logo with with all of the SVG code
inside of it let's copy that and paste
that in here so I think I'm just gonna
indent all of this and space it out
correctly but yeah now we have a logo
the only problem is okay let's just
intend that one as well is that we need
to get rid of this UK hidden small class
because if you save it like this you're
gonna have a little bit of a problem and
we need to get rid of this UK nav bar
brand class so let's get rid of both of
those save this and what's up okay so
let's take a look at this in our browser
right now and you can see that we now
have our scented logo by the way if this
logo is not in the center it's probably
because you didn't remove the classes
that were originally here or if it's not
showing up you might have UK hidden
small still on that class so just make
sure to yeah remove all of those and
yeah now our navigation is kind of
halfway there we've just got a few more
problems and one of those problems is
that when we click on this button
nothing happens because we kind of need
our off canvas to slide in so if we look
at the example set up here I think we're
gonna have to do the exact same thing
just turn this MOBOT of this design into
a mobile design
where's responsive visibility there we
go
right so what we need to do here is get
that same kind of functionality working
and the way we do that is by adding in
or yeah about adding in an off canvas
section and then just getting that link
correct with that ID and we've got to
make sure that we're using the off
canvas class here and also the off
canvas well yeah basically we need to
have this little ID set up right so what
we need to do here is grab this this
whole off canvas section let's copy that
and let's paste that in underneath our
navigation so it has to be outside the
main nav tag don't forget to put it
outside the nav tag if you put it inside
the nav tag this might not work there's
also some really important stuff that
goes that needs to go here so we cannot
leave this as three simple dots we
actually need to get the information
from here but under the ID let's change
this to something that makes a little
more sense so let's say off canvas -
menu or off canvas - nav and then let's
take this exact ID
copy that and for our little toggle nav
bar toggle let's add that ID in here
make sure that you also put in a hash if
you don't put in the hash this isn't
gonna work right because this is
referencing the ID for this element
right now let's see if we can find the
code that needs to go in this div tag so
if we go over to see it it says we're
making use of the off canvas component
so let's click on that link and take a
look at what's going on in the of canvas
section we need to get this div right
and reason why is because it's got this
class UK canvas bar that's something
important that we're going to need and
we're also going to need that attribute
which we're gonna add to our button
later on so let's first of all paste in
our div of canvas div ball let's paste
that in here and now let's go back to
the browser get that attribute that I
said we're gonna need and we need to
take that attribute and put that
attribute in on the nav bar toggle
button so let's add that in over there
right and now if we come back over to
our browser refresh and then click the
button you should now have an off canvas
navigation that opens up as you click on
the item and now all you really need to
do is go back over to your text editor
take the menu that you've got already
set up and copy that over to the off
canvas section so let's just space that
out a little bit and just remove that UK
hidden small class because we're gonna
need that and it seems like we've got
that our list in there twice so that's
something I need to fix and let's just
pull that back I guess I need to fix
that here too
same problem got the list in there twice
I did not notice that the first time
around but let's pull that back and if
we jump back over to our browser and hit
refresh now as we click on this we
actually have our menu sitting in there
but a little bit of a problem the menu
item is displaying as if it were a full
on menu so let's see if we can find the
code for an off canvas menu right so
under the off canvas section of our page
if we scroll down to off canvas Navs
and you can see that the navigation
classes were supposed to be using a UK
dash
and UK - nav - off canvas so those are
the ones we want we probably also want
that attribute by the way so let's just
copy all of those and then jump back
over to our text editor and replace
those because right now we've got UK nav
bar nav as a class that's not something
we want for our off canvas nav and let
me just add the word class back in there
right so that looks good to me let's
save this now and jump back over to our
browser back to build a website so right
now it's got the UK now for now we don't
want that but if we refresh and we hit
the button tada
we now have a navigation that works well
on a mobile as well so that is all I
