here and welcome to tutorial number
seven in my JavaScript series and in
this tutorial I just want to talk to you
guys about strings and more specifically
how to work with strings in JavaScript
now if you guys watched my data types
tutorial then you already know that a
string is a collection of text that we
can store as a variable or even print
out on the screen and you already know
that we have to surround our string in
quotation marks so let me go ahead and
print out a string example here and if I
wanted to print my name out as a
variable then I could go ahead and say
var name equals and I could create my
string here which is my name okay so
I've started off my string with my
quotation mark and I ended it off over
here with my ending quotation mark and
everything inside of here was my string
value which I've explained to you guys
before but you guys know that
surrounding our string with quotation
marks does present a problem because
what happens if we wanted to actually
use quotation marks as part of our
string then what happens is we actually
accidentally break out of our string so
let me go ahead and make an example of
that real quick and I'm just going to
make a variable called subscriber
underscore message and this can be a
message from me to all of you guys and I
can say Quinton said thanks to all my
subscribers and I'm spelling everything
wrong I now have over 1,000 so thank you
guys for all of you who subscribed I now
have over 1
thousand of you but let's get back to
this topic over here and as you can see
I accidentally broke out of my string
with this quotation mark over here and
now if I try to run this I'm going to
get an error because JavaScript and my
computer doesn't know what the heck all
of this text is over here so it's kind
of gone okay you've started the string
you've ended it and you've given me a
whole bunch of rubbish and then you've
started a string and ended it again so
what the heck is your problem okay so
javascript doesn't understand that this
is actually a saying and then it all
needs to be surrounded in quotation
marks so what we have to do is we have
to tell JavaScript okay JavaScript
ignore this quotation mark and ignore
this quotation mark and the way we do
that is we use something called an
escape character so let me go ahead and
just comment this out over here so the
escape character in JavaScript is this
little slash over there okay and as you
can see now that I've put that there the
rest of our text has turned gray but we
still need to escape that quotation mark
over there and now what we've done is
we've started our string here and ended
it here and we've sold JavaScript to
ignore these two two quotation marks
those are just part of our string and
they also need to be printed out on the
screen so now what we can do is you can
go ahead and print this out on the
screen using document dot write and I'm
just going to copy this because I'm lazy
and we'll put that inside of document
dot write brackets go ahead and save
this and we can run this in Firefox and
now you can see we have Quinton said
thanks to all of my subscribers I now
have over 1,000 and my quotation marks
are included as part of my saying
so javascript didn't ignore them
completely it just stopped them from
having any programming purpose okay so
that's pretty cool
and you guys actually already knew all
of that but now what I want to talk to
you guys about is something called
string concatenation so I just want to
go ahead and delete that line and now we
can talk about string concatenation and
this is a really big word but don't be
intimidated it actually has a really
simple meaning okay concatenation is
just the term that we use in programming
for saying we joining two strings or
joining two sentences so for example
let's say I had a variable called
sentence one and I could set this equal
to my name is Quinton and that off with
a semicolon and I can have another
variable and I'm just going to call this
one sentence two and I can set this
equal to and I am 21 years old and I am
this off with a semicolon now what I can
do is I can actually use concatenation
to add these two sentences together when
I print them out so let's go ahead and
document dot right and inside here we
can add these two sentences together so
to do that I can just type in the name
of my first variable which is sentence 1
and then I can put a space and add in
the plus sign and then type in the name
of my second variable which is sentence
- okay so we now have sentence 1 and
sentence - with the little plus sign in
between and what this does
in if we're working with strings is it
concatenates the two sentences together
so if we go ahead and click Save
and we run this in Firefox you can see
we now have the two sentences joined
together my name is Quinton and and then
and I am 21 years old so you can see
JavaScript forgot that they actually has
to be a space there it doesn't know that
the only way to fix this is if I go back
to notepad plus plus and I just add in a
space at the beginning of my second
sentence and if we save this and now run
this in Firefox you can see we now have
our space fold-in in the sentence so
that's how we can add two sentences
together and there's actually another
way we can do this we don't only have to
add them together here in the document
dot write statement I could actually
have a third variable called combine the
sentences and I could set this equal to
sentence 1 plus sentence - and then I
could actually just print out that whole
variable there so go ahead and print
that out save go back to firefox refresh
and we actually get the exact same
output so my screen isn't going to
change but that's pretty cool how we can
add two sentences together and that is
called concatenation or string
concatenation but we don't only have to
have two strings that we can add
together we can also add a string and a
number together so let's go ahead and
take a look at that real quick and what
I want to do is just get rid of this and
then we'll just create some space here
for myself and now let's do a string
concatenation with numbers okay so let's
say for example I had a program or a
website that asked users how old they
were I could then store their age in a
variable called age and print out the
words hello you are whatever their ages
and then say years old so let's go ahead
and make an example of that real quick
and let's say the user came to my
website and then they just happen to be
12 years old I can say variable age is
equal to 12
so now we put the users age and I can
print this out on the page with document
dot right and now I can actually just
use a string inside of my document right
function so I can say hello you are and
I'll leave a space over here add in my
plus symbol or my concatenation sign and
then I can type in the word age because
that's our variable so we can use it
over here and then go ahead and
concatenate another bit of string on the
end and say years old and I also
included a space of ear just so our
sentence makes sense so let's go ahead
and click refresh and now you can see we
get the text hello you are 12 years old
and that's cool and if we go ahead and
change this number over here like we
could say 54 then we could go ahead and
print this out on the screen again go
again click refresh and you can see
we've got hello
you are 54 years old so as you can see
not only can we combine two sentences
together with concatenation or two
string variables
we can also join a sentence with a
number and add another sentence on the
end using concatenation as well so that
is actually really cool so the last
thing I wanted to talk to you guys about
is using HTML elements inside of our
string okay so I'm going to go ahead and
just comment this out here elements
inside our string okay and this is
actually possible so let's say I wanted
to print out the words hello world let
me just go ahead and delete this quick
and let's say I wanted to print out the
words hello world on my screen well you
already know how to do that I could just
type in the document dot write property
and I could just print out the words
hello world whoops hello world go ahead
and save this and when I run this in
Firefox we now have the words hello
world print it out but what if I
actually wanted this to be a header well
I could actually use the HTML heading
one tag which is h1 and I could just end
it off here after my string ending h1
and JavaScript will actually treat these
as the actual HTML tag so when I go
ahead and I save this and I click
refresh you can see we actually have a
heading one printed out on the screen so
these are all really cool things you can
do with text and that's pretty much all
I have for this tutorial so I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
