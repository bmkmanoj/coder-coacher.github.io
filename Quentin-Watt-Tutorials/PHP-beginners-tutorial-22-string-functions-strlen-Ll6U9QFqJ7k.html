here and welcome back to tutorial number
22 and in this tutorial I am going to
start speaking to you guys about some
basic string functions in PHP now we're
actually going to be talking about these
string functions over the next few
tutorials but these aren't actually
functions that we have to build or
create ourselves they are actually
functions that are built into PHP we
don't even have to see how they work or
what the code behind them is all we have
to know is how how to use these string
functions okay so in this tutorial we
are going to be specifically looking at
the string length function and what the
string length function does is count how
many characters they are in our string
and then return that value back to us so
let's start off by just taking a look at
the syntax for using a function and it's
actually really simple because all you
have to do is type in the function name
which is STR L e in which stands for
string length so that's what we're going
to be using and then we put in some
parentheses okay but this is still not
complete because this function requires
an argument and the argument is
basically the part that we put inside
the parentheses here and this is going
to have to be a string because it's
obviously the string that this function
has to count okay so I'm going to go
ahead and just put in ahoy Maties
because I wash pirates of the carribean
recently and I'm kind of obsessed with
pirates okay so we've got string length
okay which is counting how many
characters we have here but we're not
actually doing anything with that value
just yet so let me go
just echo this out and when we do this
we should get the final value of how
many characters we have in here so don't
forget to end that off with a semicolon
we'll save this and come back to Firefox
now and lick refresh and as you can see
we have 12 so if you go back and count
all of those characters we should get 12
as well but just to prove it to you guys
really quickly we'll just put in one
character here so now when we go back
and lick refresh we only get one printed
out so the function does work correctly
and it it counts just how many
characters they are inside our string so
that's actually pretty easy although I
don't want you guys to get used to just
throwing strings in here straight away
like this okay because in the future
when we learn how to get data back from
the user from a forum or something
we're actually going to be storing all
the data in variables so let's say I
asked the user for their name and we'll
just use Quinton because that's my name
okay
and that'll for the semicolon would
rather throw the variables in here to
check maybe how many characters their
name was like maybe we only want to have
them put in a 10 character long name
nothing longer than that then we'll use
these functions to check that kind of
situation so let me go ahead and throw
the variable name in here and that is
more likely what we'll see when using
these functions is we'll see the
function with a variable inside the
parentheses so let's save this now and
when I click refresh I get I get 7
printed out and that is because my name
has seven characters in it and now there
is actually
one last thing I want to show you guys
and that is actually how to loop through
every single individual character in our
string okay so I'm going to create a new
variable here called name underscore
length and I'll set that equal to the
string length of name so we basically
have a variable here name which holds my
name and then name length which is
counting how many characters they are in
this variable so obviously this variable
will change depending on what's in here
okay now what we can do is start off
with a for loop because like I said
we're going to loop through every single
character in my name so for I is equal
to 0 and what while I is less than name
length okay you need to go back in and
put in that dollar sign okay so this
basically means that we'll start at 0
and we're going to keep going as long as
our variable I is less than the length
of our string okay which means that this
loop can change how many times it runs
depending on how many characters we have
in our string so if I make this longer
the loop will run more times and if I
make that shorter the loop will run less
times okay and then of course we're just
going to go ahead and say I plus plus
because we're only going to increment by
one every time and now here is a little
bit of a confusing part because we
haven't learned how to print each
individual character of our string out
yet that is still going to be in a
future tutorial but
for now we'll just count each character
or will print out whichever current
character we are on at the moment so I'm
just going to go ahead and say echo I
and then we'll just depend on a break
tag here as well so that everything
appears on a new line I don't know how I
missed that there we go fix that cool so
now when we save this we should and
start counting at zero and we'll count
through all of the letters in my name so
let's go back and click refresh and we
get 0 3 2 6 printed out ok so now all
you have to do is carry on watching my
tutorials and we'll learn about a string
function where we can grab just the
letter that we are working with at that
time and then we'll be able to print out
my name instead of going this way we'll
be able to print it one letter at a time
on each line okay so thank you guys for
