here and welcome back to tutorial number
thirteen and in this tutorial I thought
it would be best that we practice our
CSS just a little bit more and the way
we're going to do that is we're going to
work with some font properties okay so
the font properties in CSS obviously
allow us to do some really cool stuff to
all the font on our website so let's go
ahead and just add in a paragraph
quickly so we'll just write something
silly like the quick red fox jumped over
the lazy Brown dogs back and I managed
to top that without any typos can you
believe it okay and that's actually a
sentence that uses every single letter
in the alphabet funny enough okay cool
so now we've got this sentence over here
let's see if we can actually edit it a
little bit with some CSS styling okay so
if we run this in Firefox now you can
see it gets printed out quite default
this is Times New Roman font I think so
I mean it's just it's not interesting
and imagine every single website you
went to was always using Times New Roman
and was always the size obviously
doesn't look very appealing so let's try
and change that okay so what we're going
to do now is just select this paragraph
by its element name so remember we use a
selector in CSS just to select the
element that we want to style okay then
we're going to put in those curly braces
and inside here we use our properties
and values okay so one of the font
properties that we can change is the
font family okay and the font family is
basically what kind of font you're using
so like I said by default
it's Times New Roman okay but we can
change this so let's just change it to
something like Arial and you have to
spell this right unfortunately okay
Arial and now when we save this and go
back and click refresh you can see that
the text has quite clearly changed from
Times New Roman to Arial okay and again
we can change this to Tahoma or anything
else that is actually installed on your
computer okay now when it comes to using
fonts that aren't installed on the
user's computer so if you want to use a
special font that you may be downloaded
from the internet that gets a little bit
complicated so I'm not going to be
speaking about that in this video but
for now you guys can just be aware that
you can use any kind of font as long as
it's a font that's like standard to your
computer so there are some fonts that
like differ from Windows to Mac to Linux
or whatever but there are some that are
across all platforms so you might just
want to get used to that or just read up
a bit about that okay and then the next
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is a font property called fund weight
okay and the font weight is basically
whether your text should be bold or not
bold so if you type in bold here then
you'll get bolded text otherwise if you
type in normal then your text should be
normal so let's go ahead and actually
just save that as bold again quickly
there we go okay save this come back
here click refresh and as you can see
font-weight:bold makes our text bold now
we don't only have to use bold or normal
we could also use values that go from
100 through to 900 okay and those
basically mean 100 is normal and then
900 is fully bold
if you go ahead and put in something
like 500 then that is only half as bold
if that makes sense it's not it's not
fully bold it's just half as bold as it
should have been not that we can
actually see a difference here because
when I click refresh well it changes
slightly so just be aware of that if you
want to be able to change like your text
to be bold but not as bold you can use
those numbers as well but let's just go
ahead and put that back as bold then the
next thing I want to talk to you guys
about is the font style property so font
- style and this is basically if you
want your text to be italicized or not
so if you go ahead and you type in
italic then it'll turn everything into
italics and again the other value for
this is normal so if you want your text
to appear normal then you can go ahead
and just print type in normal there as
well doesn't really matter okay so
you've got bold italics font family what
else we can also work with something
called the font size property okay and
font size is basically how big do you
want your text obviously so you can give
this a measurement in pixels and by
default I think it's around 12 pixels so
let's make it something really big
that's kind of noticeable so we'll go
ahead and say 24 pixels okay and now it
should actually pretty much double in
size so we're going to go ahead and
click refresh you can see the text is
much bigger okay so those are the four
different properties that we can work
with in CSS when we're working with
proper fonts but we can actually make
this shorter because we can actually put
all of these properties into one
okay and to do that all we have to do is
type in the word font so that's the
property we're going to access and then
you can start off with typing the word
bold if you want your text to be bold if
you don't want your text to be bolded
then you can actually leave this stage
out we can also type in italics if we
want it to be in italics but if we don't
need italics then we can also leave that
section out and then the last two are
the size so let's say 14 pixels and then
the last one is the font family so let's
go ahead and say Tahoma and now we
should get all of this printed out but
now we've done we've changed all four of
those properties in one line so that's
one really cool CSS trick you can just
go ahead and do it all in one line just
like that okay so that's actually all I
have for you guys in this video don't

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
