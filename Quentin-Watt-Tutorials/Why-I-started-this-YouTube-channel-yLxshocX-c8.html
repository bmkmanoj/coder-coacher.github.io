here and in this video i'm gonna tell
you guys my creation story so it's not
gonna be a tutorial i know a lot of you
guys probably came here expecting in
tutorial but i actually want to tell you
guys a story that I should have told you
a really long time ago because YouTube
recommends to the creators that you
should always tell your creation story
you should tell your audience why you
make youtube videos and it's a rule that
I've always kind of ignored I've always
thought like yeah I'll tell my creation
story another time I'll do it later but
yeah this tutorial Channel is actually
four years old now and I still haven't
told you guys why I make youtube videos
and why I like where I was in my life
when I started making these videos so
yeah let's talk about that and I guess
to really explain why i started the
tutorial Channel I need to give you guys
a little bit more background information
about where i was in my life at the time
so i finished school in 2010 that was
when i finish high school my first
videos on this tutorial Channel went up
in about 2012 but there was a whole
bunch of stuff that happened in between
that really influenced me and drove me
towards starting a YouTube channel so
yeah like I said I finished high school
in 2010 and basically what happened
there was I wanted to go and study I
wanted to attend a university and my mom
kind of told me look it doesn't matter
where you get accepted at University I'm
not going to have the money to send you
there so you just can't go to university
when you finish school you're going to
have to get a job and you're gonna have
to pay rent that's pretty much how this
is going to go so I finished school
and it took me about three months to
find a job start searching and I went
through the whole process of like you
know calling people and going to job
interviews and people just never getting
back to you which sucks and then some
people do get back to you but they tell
you like listen you're not good enough
to work here or whatever the situation
is like that also sucks but eventually I
found a place that did accept me and did
so you can come work here and I started
my first job on februari the 14th 2011
so I started working on Valentine's Day
not that I had a date for Valentine's
Day anyway so might as well just go to
work and yeah I i went and i started my
my my first day at work at an irrigation
company so irrigation web development
two entirely different spheres it's not
like I went into this job and I was like
hell yeah I always wanted to be an
irrigation technician person like this
is my dream job I always wanted this
like I went into the job never ever
wanting to do it in the first place it
was just the only place that would
accept me and pay me money to do
something by the way the job paid three
thousand south african rand which at the
time was worth about three hundred
dollars roughly you know just an
estimation and also sucked because you
know three hundred dollars for a 40-hour
work week and it's three hundred dollars
a month that i was making there's not
much you can do with three hundred
dollars a month depending on where you
are in the world you probably think like
holy that's crazy why like would
you work for such a little bit amount of
money I mean why wouldn't you just go on
welfare or whatever like but the thing
is in South Africa there is no such
thing as welfare I don't know what it
means to be given money like you have to
work for money whether it is like the
smallest amount like you can imagine or
not like it's either that or it's
nothing you know so I landed up working
this job and
I lost pretty much half the money just
getting to work and back and paying rent
to my mom now I know a lot of people
probably think three hundred dollars I
pay him like double that as rent you
know I lived with my mom so I got just
pay her a little portion of the money
not what rent would actually be worth so
yeah I I think i'm hanging around on
this topic a little bit too much but
like it just kind of sucked that i was
in this position where i was making
three hundred dollars a month and
basically all of the money disappeared
like just living and getting to work in
back i didn't actually make any money to
use on myself or to better myself you
know i wanted to go and study or save up
to go study but i couldn't even do that
because I wasn't making enough money to
do that right so I did manage to save up
enough money to buy a computer this is
my first computer I ever owned it was an
HP yeah I 3 with four gigs of ram in not
an amazing computer no graphics card
nothing like that it was just a silly
old laptop it cost five thousand ran for
me to buy which at the time was about
five hundred dollars so roughly twice my
salary to buy a computer and I actually
had to save up for this and pay it off
over a few months but I got a computer
and I got internet and it was at that
point where I was like okay you know
what I've got this computer I've got
internet I might as well do something to
improve my life might as well do
something to make my life a little
better at work being this irrigation
technician person I was promised that I
was gonna you know learn how to become
sort of like a civil engineer and I'd be
giving exams and I'd be going on courses
and that's not actually what happened
what happened was I was digging holes in
the ground with a spade for 3000 random
three hundred dollars a month and now
you know like it was while I was digging
these holes in the ground of the Spade I
was just like you know what this sucks
and I have to do something to make my
life better and that's where I went out
and I got that computer and I was like
okay cool in high school my favorite
subject was IT and I did learn how to
program in high school we did a language
called Delphie so I might as well look
back on that and just try and learn how
to program again in a more useful
language and at the time my friend
suggested that I learn Python so I had
this computer I had internet by the way
I only had 10 gigs of internet a month I
couldn't go over 10 gigs and yeah I used
those 10 gigs a month to start learning
python and I stumbled across what
basically some across some pdfs and some
websites where i was learning python but
you know it is hard to teach yourself a
programming language from pdfs and from
websites alone you do kind of need
something a little bit more and that's
where YouTube comes and that's where i
actually discovered what youtube was
because i ended up googling for python
some i can't remember what the exact
search was but it was something to do
with python and some youtube videos
popped up and i was like hmm i might as
well watch these and i watched the video
and i realized at that point like
youtube is so much more than i thought
it was I always thought YouTube was this
place where people went and put funny
cat videos funny cat videos or like
funny fail videos about like you know
people falling off bicycles and jumping
off of walls and stupid stuff like that
I never actually realized until that
point that YouTube is actually so much
more than that right so I realize we all
have our own YouTube channels if you
have a google account you have a channel
and
you know you can upload videos and at
that point the partner program had just
opened up and so there was a lot of
content exploding and doing really well
on YouTube talking about the partner
program people basically said like you
can start a YouTube channel you can make
money from a youtube channel you can now
also make custom thumbnails because
before that like that wasn't even a
thing before the partner program opened
up we couldn't couldn't choose what your
video thumbnail would be and yeah like
it was just at that point really
interesting for me I was kind of like
okay wow I could start a YouTube channel
and make money from it that sounds cool
but I didn't this was 2011 when I
discovered what YouTube really was but I
didn't actually make any videos until
2012 so basically a year later and so
what happened was in 2011 I used YouTube
to learn Python and run about the end of
2011 I kind of realized Python isn't a
very useful language is not much I can
do with it right now privately as my own
like as one guy I can't do much with it
but as one guy one developer I can build
websites for people so let me learn HTML
and CSS and JavaScript i'm sure i'll
just keep like down following down this
line and the web development stuff is
going to lead me somewhere so that's
basically what happened is I let I spent
the end of 2011 plane flying over
it's gonna be noisy but I spent I spent
the end of 2011 basically learning
python and well starting to learn a HTML
CSS and then I switched jobs so i left
the irrigation company because we had
some disagreements and some arguments
and things were not going well so i left
them and i'll end up working as a PA bx
technician at the beginning of 2012 if
you guys don't know what a PAB x is a
PAB x is like the central box that
connects all office telephones so you
know before the days of these things
well actually we still use these things
and they're so much better than a normal
telephone but if you work in a company
you probably have normal telephone and
that telephone connects to a box
somewhere and that is the PAB x and so
that's what i did i installed PAB X's
and set up those telephones for people
and that was I guess slightly more in
the technical field but it was still not
a cool job and when I moved to this job
i was making 3500 random months which at
the time i guess was about roughly three
hundred and fifty dollars roughly so
that you know that still sucks i was
still working a 40-hour work week for
three hundred and fifty dollars that's
not cool and yeah I carried on learning
the youtubes learning HTML from YouTube
because I was like this is really going
to take me somewhere I feel like this
might push me beyond just working these
crappy little jobs that i was working in
so yeah it was around about july twenty
twelve when I decided okay I've learned
enough HTML but I need a try figure out
some way to make money from it or some
way to actually get a job doing we have
a development stuff so how am I going to
do this I don't have a degree I haven't
actually seen anyone doing websites in
in the town that i was i was living in
east london there wasn't really like a
place that i could just go to and be
like hi I know HTML please hire me so
what I decided to do was put up some
YouTube videos and I was like cool like
there are a bunch of reasons why I
should do this first of all if I put up
YouTube videos there's a good chance I
could make some money from them the pot
and program is open and anybody can be a
youtube partner the second reason was
like okay if I have YouTube videos up
even though I don't have a degree or
even though I don't have a certification
I can walk up to a company and say
listen I have 5,000 youtube subscribers
or whatever it is I didn't actually have
that at the time I was on zero
subscribers at the time but I was like
if i can get 5000 subscribers or
something it would just be a really good
thing to have in my cv in my resume like
okay I have 5,000 people on YouTube who
think I can program does that not mean
anything to you do you not want to hire
me because I have a large number of
YouTube subscribers and then the third
reason was obviously because I had been
learning from YouTube for so long I kind
of just wanted to give back to YouTube a
little bit and so I started making my
own YouTube videos and the only
equipment I had at the time was that HP
laptop of mine the little 3g dongle
which i only had 10 gigs of internet a
month and then I had this headset it was
a really cheap headset about you know
roughly fifteen dollars if you were to
buy it so that's why the audio in most
of my old videos is really bad because I
use a really crappy microphone but
that's all I had and that's all I needed
to get the job done right so I started
making some videos there and that was
like the first thing its first videos
uploaded word july twenty twelve just
about like making a drop down menu or
something and then from there HTML and
CSS and then the javascript series and
so on I need a look at my notes now
okay yeah so basically I started putting
up those videos but it was also around
about the beginning of 2013 I decided
like okay I am making sort of enough
money right now to register at a
part-time University and just try to
take some plot I'm modules and so I
started studying the beginning of 2013
as well by the end of 2013 my youtube
channel had got to the point where is
making about three hundred and fifty
dollars a month so that's quite crazy
actually because I put up videos I
carried on putting up videos on my
youtube channel for over a year before I
made a hundred dollars before I made a
thousand Rand from my my youtube channel
i already had about 70 videos up so i
had i had kept working even though my
youtube channel was not making any money
even though like you know money wasn't
actually the driving force here it was
the fact that i was trying to use
YouTube to get a job and I carried I'm
just putting up videos even though it
wasn't making me any money it took me a
year to make a hundred dollars so
probably like the hardest and longest
hundred dollars I've ever worked for in
my life and from there the money just
started rolling in a lot faster once I
made my first hundred dollars like
YouTube money just kept coming in a
little bit faster so by the end of 2013
i was making three hundred and fifty
dollars roughly from youtube in a month
and i decided well you know what if I'm
making 300 up from fifty dollars from
YouTube month I don't need to work 40
hours a week and make three hundred and
fifty dollars from the stupid company
that I'm working for so I quit my job
and I tried youtubing full time and I
don't want to say full time because I
didn't actually spend all my time doing
YouTube I spent some time playing
computer games and I also spent some
time studying but this was still the
most productive my youtube channel had
ever
because from about January in 2014 when
I wasn't working anymore till about
August of 2014 that was the period where
I I didn't actually have a job I wasn't
employed anywhere i made about 120
videos in those seven well eight months
almost I made 120 video so that was
definitely the most productive my
youtube channel had ever been or I had
ever been on my youtube channel and then
from there it was while I was working on
that content that I got invited to the
first ever YouTube event in South Africa
which happened in cape town so I had to
drive all the way across the country and
I attended this YouTube event because i
was like maybe something good will come
of this and i tried applying for jobs
while i was in cape town as well try to
see if my youtube channel would impress
anyone and it didn't but I did get to
meet a whole bunch of other cool
youtubers and I you'll probably see them
one day I'll work with them on my
vlogging channel perhaps but yeah I I
met a whole bunch of cool youtubers and
I tried to impress people with my
youtube channel but it didn't work sorry
he goes and so it took about another six
months and then we had another YouTube
event happen in South Africa and this
time the YouTube event was in
Johannesburg and this was actually I
think it was this about the third
YouTube event that ever happened I'm
because I'm missing one somewhere in my
story but this was like the 3rd YouTube
in that ever happened in South Africa
and I drove again all the way across the
country well I caught a bus all the way
across the country to go to this next
YouTube event where I again use my
youtube channel to try and impress
people and try get a job that way and
that's what happened is my youtube
channel was impressive enough at that
point that I found a guy who
was interested in hiring me and my
youtube channel got me a job that's how
i got job i'm working in today is I
walked into Google's offices and there
was a guy who owns a web development
company and an SEO company which is the
company I work for right now and I
basically just said like this is my
youtube channel how do you like it and
he gave me his card he told me to
contact him I went for a job interview
and I got hired and youtube or my
youtube channel had served its purpose
like that was its entire goal was
obviously to help improve my life which
it did because I started making a bit of
money from it and stuff but it also got
me a full-time decent paying job not
something that was paying me peanuts but
something that I could actually get a
fair wage from and live off of ah and
yeah like I feel like since I've had
this job I've lost one of my biggest
driving forces my biggest like
inspiration behind making videos and I
need to find that again I need a find
more inspiration to do videos and that's
kind of where I am right now is I've had
a job for the past two years I've been
happy with this job for the past two
years and it has somewhat affected the
YouTube channel in the sense that i'm
not making content as often as i could
be or as often as I should be because
well you know the the biggest driving
force that was pushing me to make videos
is now not there anymore but i have
worked this job for two years now and I
mean this was a job that I chased like
four years eventually got the job and
now I've worked in it for two years and
i'm bored i constantly ask myself the
question is this really what I want to
do for the rest of my life and I think
the answer to that is really like if I
have to carry on doing what I'm doing
right now for the rest of
my life I'm gonna be bored so no I don't
really want to do this for the rest of
my life and so I need to find another
goal to chase and I think I already have
it what I'm really chasing is education
I want to go and get a degree and i also
want to find something that is a little
bit more fun to work on and so yeah if
you guys watch my vlog channel you'll
know that i just recently traveled all
the way across the world that was a
little bit of fun but i also looked at a
university all the way across on the
other side of the world because well i
just wanted to see how different
university life was in that country
compared to here and yeah i hope made a
whole bunch of personal comparisons but
you'll really have to watch the vlog
channel to find out more about that and
yeah that that's just what I'm chasing
right now as I want a degree and I want
to do or find something else that is
more fun now in terms of fun I'm not
saying programming or coding is not fun
because it can be and it is but for me
it's more fun when I'm doing stuff for
myself if I have my own project to work
on my own website or own app to build
and I grow this company or I grow this
little app like it's my baby that's fun
right I think for me what's not fun is
when everybody else comes in and says
like hi I've got this really cool idea
that I'd like you to work on and I have
to build their sites in this guy site
and whatever like I land up doing
everybody else's work or work that
interests everybody else but it's not
work that interests me that's where the
fun has faded but now I'm rambling on
about things that have nothing to do
with why I started the channel I think
we've kind of reached the end of that
story so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
hearing why I started the channel and
I hope it inspires some of you guys as
well or at least answer some of your
questions I know I get asked a lot of
questions about like how I got my job
and stuff like that and that's all in
the story and that's all i have for you
guys in this video if you guys want to
know more about like the why i'm bored
and that kind of stuff I'll explain in
future videos so that's all I have for
you guys in this video and I'll see you
guys next time and so it was at that
point where I didn't know what I wanted
to do anymore because I was kind of like
well I do one a degree i do want people
to think I'm smart like I want a little
piece of paper to say like yeah higher
quinton because he knows stuff and so
that's where we are in my life right now
because I find myself at this point
where i still really want that degree i
still really want to be qualified in
something but I've made the decision
that like if I'm gonna study I'm gonna
study somewhere that matters so like I'm
not gonna sit around and waste my money
on stupid University</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
