here and welcome to this tutorial on
using SVG's as icons or using icons as
SVG's I don't know really how I should
word that but yeah anyway in this video
I just wanted to show you guys some cool
SVG resources or SVG SVG assets and then
also how to actually use an SVG in your
browser but if you guys haven't watched
my previous tutorial on using font
awesome for icons you should go ahead
and check that out so if you're watching
this on youtube there should be a link
over here if you're watching this yeah
somewhere else I'll probably leave a
link somewhere below the video and yeah
go ahead and just check out font
awesomes website because they have a
bunch of different icons so if you go
over to the icons tab I mean they have
icons for web applications so I mean
anything that you could think of like an
address book or a bank icon on a bar
child
icon bar slow batteries whatever you're
looking for they probably have it
including if you scroll all the way down
to the bottom of the page some brand
icons so if you're looking to have an
Apple logo or the Facebook logo
especially for linking to social media
you might want to use the Facebook icon
or the Twitter icon or something like
that and those are all included here but
the thing with font awesome is sometimes
they just don't have everything
sometimes you have to actually go
somewhere else you have to look for an
SVG and yeah I'm going to show you guys
how to do that now so you could just
simply pop over to Google search for
website icons as SVG or website icon
vector and that's probably going to give
you a cool a few cool websites that you
can use as resources but I find one that
I've used in the past that works really
well and one that I really like is a
website called icon monster so go ahead
and pop over the icon monster's website
I will leave a link in the video
description and you can check that out
so if you're looking for something
specific you can go ahead and type
whatever you're looking for in the
search and see if they have that but I
think for the purpose of this tutorial
let's just pick
random icon over here so I think I'll
use the plane tickets cuz I'm pretty
certain font awesome doesn't have an
icon for that so let's go ahead and
click that and the great thing about
icon monster is it gives you four
different options so you get to choose
how you actually want to download your
icon you can download it as an SVG an
EPS PSD or a ping if you guys don't know
the difference between these files SVG
is a vector format file meaning that it
scales and it will never pixelate EPS is
Adobe Illustrator file PSD is a
Photoshop file and a ping is just a
plain old image so well it's a it's an
image with transparency in the
background but let me go ahead and
download this as a ping and I'm just
going to show you guys the difference of
why you would want to use an SVG over a
ping
so let's hit download and this is gonna
take a couple seconds but when it
downloads you can see I've now got the
image open and yeah the crappy thing
about an SVG is as you make or the
crappy thing about a ping a PNG is as
you make it bigger it gets really blurry
so as you can see all the pixels around
the corners here have pixelated and it
looks really really terrible so if
you're ever using a ping image that kind
of sucks but the great thing about using
an SVG is that never happens right so
let's go over the SVG tab over here
let's agree to the license agreement and
download and yeah you're gonna see
something funny happen here because now
I've got the SVG downloaded if I click
on this it actually opens up in my
browser and you can see that the icon is
all the way up there in the corner
but let's close that now and I'm gonna
go over to my downloads and show you
guys actually how to use this SVG so
once you've downloaded an SVG from
whichever website you were planning to
use or planning to download from I'd say
you should open this up in Adobe
Illustrator if you have it hopefully you
do
if you don't I recommend using it but
the great thing about this is now you
can say just as it is file save as and
then save this as an SVG again and it
doesn't really matter what you name it
because we're not actually going to be
dealing with the name here so let's say
icon monster tickets or something like
that
okay I'm gonna hit save and here's the
great thing about Adobe Illustrator is
just before I've actually saves my SVG I
get this little SVG options tab and
you're probably gonna want to make sure
that all of your settings are exactly
the same as my settings over here
so ya make sure that SVG profiles is SVG
one type is SVG all of this kind of
stuff I actually haven't changed in
anything here by the way so all of these
should be defaults and then go ahead and
just click that SVG code button and you
can see this opens up a text editor with
a bit of code and you can see we've got
an SVG tag starting up here and we've
got the SVG tag ending all the way down
there so let's copy all of that by the
way all of this is unnecessary so just
ignore that only copy from the start of
the SVG tag down to the end of the SVG
tag you can copy that and go over to
your text editor and okay don't go to
the CSS file go to the index.html or
index.php or whatever file you're trying
to put this in and yeah all you need to
do is simply paste in the code like that
and if I just indent this and make it
look a little bit more tidy and then
jump back over to the browser will save
jump back over to the browser and
refresh I should now have an extra icon
appearing over here so another great
thing about using an SVG instead of
using a picture as an icon is that I can
now change the size of this with code
and I can also change the color of this
with code as well so let's jump back
over to my text editor and yeah these
two SVG's here are the previous two SVG
we started with so those two and now the
SVG we were working with is this bottom
one here I know this code can look a
little bit messy but yeah just paste it
somewhere and try and keep it neat and
tidy if if you're worried about it
looking messy I mean you can always
expand or unexpanded
right but like I said the one thing I
wanted to show you guys is that we can
dynamically change the size of this
using some code so if I go over to the
width and height it should be over there
let's just put that all on one line but
if I go over to these width and height
attributes I can now set that equal to
like a hundred and sixty and save and if
I jump back over the browser and hit
refresh my icon is now 160 by 160 pixels
so it's a big square and that makes my
icon appear just as big as all the
others I can also make it really big if
I want so let's say a thousand six
hundred pixels by a thousand six hundred
pixels and of course now it's so big
that it's off the page but I think you
guys get the point right I can just
resize it simply by changing the sizes
here and as I do that the the SVG just
gets bigger and smaller but it never
ever pixel it's like that's the
important part I wanna stress here is
that even at a thousand six hundred
pixels or at a thousand pixels the the
bigger this SVG got it never actually
pixelated that line is crisp and clean
and not pixelated at all which is
awesome and that's exactly what we want
from an icon is to be able to use it
pretty much everywhere alright so I'm
gonna make the size a little bit smaller
and something else I want to show you
guys just before I end of the tutorial
is how to change colors so you can just
go over to any one of your SVG's so go
to the opening SVG tag don't do this on
the path but actually do it on the SVG
tag itself you can add in an extra
attribute here called fill
and you can set the fill to whatever you
want so in this case I can set the fill
- I think that might not be a good color
just you know go over to a color picker
and then like pick a color that you
actually want to use so let's say I like
that color blue I'll pull that into here
and use that hexadecimal color over
there and now when I jump back over to
my browser and hit refresh instead of
the icon being plain old black it's now
the blue that I selected and yeah I
could go ahead with that example and
just change each one of these icons but
I'm not gonna bother and one last thing
I want to show you guys before I end of
this tutorial is that you can use CSS to
style your icons as well so let's jump
back over the text editor and pink one
of the SVG's make sure you do this on
the SVG tag not on the path tag but what
you want to do is go ahead and add in a
specific class so let's say icon -
ticket for the ticketing icon this
should be the ticket icon and now that I
have that class add it in here I can go
through my CSS and basically select that
class and then add in some styling so
let's change the fill to specific color
so let's jump back over to Google Chrome
pick a color I've already picked a nice
little red color so let's jump back over
to my text editor and now that I've got
my color picked I can also choose a
different size so let's say with 800
pixels and height as 800 pixels and save
this now and jump back over to my
browser refresh and you can see that my
icon has now changed so it's now 800 by
800 pixels and it's also red so if you
guys are ever looking to style SVG with
a class or with CSS that's how you do
that and that's all I have for you guys
