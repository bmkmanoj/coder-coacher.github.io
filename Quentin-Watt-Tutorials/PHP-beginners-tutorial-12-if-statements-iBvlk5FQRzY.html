here and welcome to tutorial number 12
and in this video we are going to talk
about if statements in PHP so up until
now whenever we typed code into notepad
plus plus absolutely all of that code
was executed line by line by line but if
statements actually give us the ability
to make decisions so in other words we
can decide whether we want a certain
line of code or a certain section of
code to get executed based on whether
that a variable or something meets a
certain condition in our code okay so
the syntax for an if statement looks
like this and by syntax I'm just talking
about how the layout layout of the code
looks okay so we type in if and then
we've got two parenthesis opening
parenthesis and a closing one okay and
then we also put in a condition okay and
I spelled that thing wrong twice in a
row okay so condition okay some people
like to call this condition and
expression but it doesn't really matter
whatever you call it it's just
whatever's in here this is gonna be a
test okay the computer has to run this
test and see if this test is true or
false okay so in other words we're just
giving it a condition to check okay and
after that what will do is will indent
one line so just one tab space and then
we'll put in another statement okay so
this will be basically the code of the
line of code that runs if this condition
gets evaluated to true now I like to
actually use the curly braces whenever
I'm using an if statement
if we're only using if we're only gonna
run one line of code then we don't
actually need these curly braces but if
we want to run more than one line of
codes in other words if we want to run a
few state mints then we need these curly
braces okay
now some people like to make their curly
braces like this so they give this curly
brace its own line I like to save time
or save space sorry and actually just
keep it all on one line okay but you'll
actually see if you check around on
reddit and some other social networks
and stuff a lot of people joke around
and they say there are two types of
programmers the guys that do this and
the guys that do this they're really
there is no difference except for the
fact that we get to save space if we do
it this way so that's how I like to keep
my if statements looking like keep my if
statements looking like I mean what I
like to keep my if statements like that
makes more sense okay so like I said
we're going to put a condition in here
basically a test that the computer needs
to run okay so let's make a variable
outside this if statement now called
apples and let's assign the value of 3
to apples okay now for our condition
what we can do is check if there's more
than one Apple so we can go ahead and
say apples greater than one so the
computer reads this and goes if apples
is greater than one then I'm going to
run this code okay so for this example
apples is 3 so the computer is reading
this like this it's going if 3 is
greater than 1 I'm going to run the
statement okay so is 3 greater than 1
well yes it
is okay so let's actually give the
computer something to do here okay so
let's echo out something on the screen
and we can just echo you have more than
one Apple okay so let's go ahead and
save that now and we can go back to
Firefox and click refresh and as you can
see it says you have more than one Apple
okay so this code ran because three was
greater than one but what happens if
Apple's isn't greater than one okay so
let's say we set apples to zero well
then the computer is going to read this
and go
if apples which is zero is greater than
one do this code but zero isn't greater
than one so while we're not going to do
this code at all we're just gonna skip
this okay so now that I've saved that if
I go back to Firefox and click refresh
you can see we've got nothing okay
and that's because zero is obviously not
greater than one so the computer decided
well then we'll just skip this code okay
and that's how you use an if statement
to make a decision in your code so
basically to decide whether you're gonna
run a line of code or not and we can
actually have more than one line of code
here so we can have two as well and we
can echo out you have let's just say the
variable here will append on the
variable so you have apples and will
append on this again so you have apples
apples and basically that's gonna tell
us how many apples we do in fact have so
let's make this five so that the
statement is true and when we come back
to Firefox and click refresh it says you
have more than one Apple
you have five apples okay so if we
wanted to make it a little bit more tidy
we could probably just put a line break
in there and it should print on two
lines so that's cool
and that is actually what an
if-statement does so thank you for
