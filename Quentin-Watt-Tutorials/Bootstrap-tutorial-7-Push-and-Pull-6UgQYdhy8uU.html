here and welcome to tutorial number
seven and in this video I'm going to
show you how to push and pull columns
using bootstrap okay and I also want to
apologize before the video actually
starts if I sound like I'm breathing in
and out a lot or if my nose just sounds
like it's blocked or if my voice just
sounds different it's because I'm sick
so it's quite difficult to record right
now but I'm gonna try my best to get
some videos done for you guys so yeah I
just want to apologize if you hear me
breathe in and out a lot or something
like that it's it's just because I
really I'm struggling to breathe right
now
and yeah let's let's try get some videos
done now I do want to mention that I've
also added my own custom CSS file over
here and I've done that the exact same
way you would add a custom CSS file to
any HTML page okay so I just want to
mention that that's actually there and
I'm going to be using some custom CSS
later on in this video so yeah if you
guys ever want to add custom CSS to a
bootstrap file or a bootstrap page then
yeah don't edit the bootstrap files
themselves actually go ahead and create
your own CSS file that is the best
practice if you edit the bootstrap files
that is considered bad practice and
that's why we were using the many five
versions to kind of convince you guys or
make you guys not want to use these
files okay so yeah now that we've got
that whole rant out the way let's get
started and you can see that I've
already got my container in my row over
here so I'm going to start creating some
columns and in fact I'm actually going
to create two columns the first one is
going to be div
and I'm going to give that a class of
coal md4 so on a medium-sized screen or
larger this column is going to take up
all the stiff is going to take up four
columns okay
then I also want to give this a
secondary class of BG danger just so we
can see exactly how big that column
actually is and then I'm going to add
another column over here and I'm going
to make that call m d8 so that's
actually gonna be eight columns long and
I'm going to give this a class of BG
success okay and I just need to give
each one of these some content so we'll
say column one and the next one will
give a class of this oh this is column
two and it's not a class is just content
sorry so let me go ahead and save that
now and if I jump back over to the
browser and I hit refresh you can see
that now I've got column one and we've
got column two but that's not what this
tutorial is about I actually want to
show you guys how to push and pull
content okay so pushing and pulling
basically means that we can swap these
two columns around using the push and
pull classes so what I can do is if I go
over to column one and I give this a
class of Col MD push eight okay then
that means on a medium device so on a
medium device we want to push this
column or this div by eight columns so
you guys can probably see where this is
going because this div is eight columns
so we're pushing this div all the way to
the end of this div okay so we need to
go ahead and save this now and when I
jump back into the browser and hit
refresh you can see that column one has
kind
disappeared from here and it's actually
appearing behind column two so we need
to sort this issue out where column two
is now hiding column one away because
column one is underneath column two so
to do that we're going to jump over to
our column two and we're going to give
this a class of coal MD pull four okay
so I'm going to go ahead and hit save
and the reason we did this was because
now that we've pushed column one by
eight spaces we need to then pull column
two by the same amount of columns that
the first day was taking up right so
because this div 1 or column 1 was
taking up 4 columns we needed to go over
to column 2 and just pull it back those
four spaces so now if we come back over
to the browser and hit refresh you can
see that now we've got column one where
column two should have been and then
we've got column two where column one
should have bitten so we swap them
around using push and pull and this is
quite handy because what I like to do
sometimes on my web sites is I'll put an
image on the right hand side over here
and that would be column one and then
I'll put the article or the content over
here and that would be column two but
then on a phone I want these two to swap
around again so if I go into responsive
design view you can see that now we've
got column one on top and then we've got
column two on the bottom where it should
be but if we take a look at that on the
screen on the computer screen then you
can see that we've swapped them around
again so column one is where columns you
should be and column two is where one
column one should be right so
yeah that is what pushing and pulling
basically does and the reason why it's
pushed and pulled that way is because we
pushed it and pulled it on a medium
device so anything smaller than a medium
device it would go back to normal and
that is why a phone which is a extra
small device column-one displays on the
top and column two displays on the
bottom right so yeah something I wanted
to show you guys with my custom CSS is
that I have this class of BG cover which
is a class that I created and all it
does is add a background image gives
that background image some height and
also sets the background size to cover
okay so if I come back over to column
one over here and I change this from BG
danger to beam gbg cover which by the
way this is not a bootstrap class I just
showed you guys that that is a class I
created by myself over here and my own
custom CSS file then what we should have
is our image on the right hand side and
then this could be your article or
something like that that will be on the
left hand side but then what happens is
if you ever have viewers come visit your
site on a mobile phone then you have the
image at the top it kind of attracts
their attention a little bit more and
entices them to read the rest of the
article so yeah I think that that was
kind of creative I liked the whole idea
of doing that on a website that I
recently created so yeah I just wanted
to show you guys where this would be
useful and that's pretty much all I have
in this video so don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
