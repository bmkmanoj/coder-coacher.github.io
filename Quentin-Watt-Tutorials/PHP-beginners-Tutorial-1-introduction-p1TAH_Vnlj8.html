here and welcome to your very first PHP
tutorial and this has actually been one
of the most requested tutorial series
for my channel and I'm happy to announce
it's finally here now for those of you
guys who don't know what PHP is then let
me explain PHP is a server-side
scripting language for the web so what
that means is that all of the code is
run or executed on the server which
allows us to do some really cool stuff
like work with the database and store
information to make for a really
interactive or a really clever website
but you guys didn't just come here to
listen to me talk about PHP you want to
actually start writing some code but
before we get started there are two
things you guys have to do first now the
first one you guys may already have and
that is a basic knowledge of HTML so if
you guys don't know HTML you are
probably not going to follow along with
the series so well okay so don't worry I
have a solution if you go back to my
channel there is a complete series on
HTML already so go ahead and watch that
and when you finish to that come back
here and start with the PHP series again
and you'll do just fine
the second thing you guys are going to
have to do is install PHP on your
computer so that you can actually run or
test the code that we are going to write
in this series so what you guys are
going to have to do is download and
install a program called XM so I'm just
going to go ahead and open my browser
and my Internet's a little bit slow so
bear with me
and we're going to go ahead and google
XM okay and right at the top you should
get a link to Apache friends org this is
the website you're going to want to go
to and you want to going to want to go
to this link of here xampp for windows
unless you guys have a mac then you're
probably going to want to install a mac
or linux but most of us are probably on
Windows so most of us are probably going
to want to click on this link over here
now as you can see here you'll get a
whole bunch of information based on what
version of xampp this is so right now
it's got PHP version five point four
point two two and if you guys want to
download this you're going to have to go
to SourceForge so here's the link over
here this is actually quite a long
series of links so what I'm going to do
is I'll put the SourceForge link in the
description below so just check the
description of the video and you should
find the source for which link and now
we can just go ahead and click download
okay so it should start downloading a
few seconds
I'm going to save it okay so while
that's downloading I think I'll just
pause the recording okay I'm back and
the program finished downloading so I'm
going to go ahead and just run the
install which can be found over there
and that's fine I know it's just asking
me do I really want to run this file so
I'm going to go ahead and just click run
I know it's safe and then I'm going to
click Next so I'm going to leave all of
these things as default as I run through
the install and I'm going to go next
leave that as default again next next
and it opens this other page in my
browser that's okay go back to the
install click next and I guess these are
just extra add-ons that you can put onto
your computer to make it more like a
server and you can run these programs
that are usually on a web server but
this is probably going to install for a
few minutes so I'm just going to pause
the install and come back when it's done
okay
I'm back and it's almost finished
installing now I realize I think I said
I'm going to pause the install what I
meant to say was I'm going to pause the
recorder okay so I'm going to leave this
as ticked for now and that means that
the program is going to finish I mean
the programs in a start when I click
finish so there we go
now we have xampp on our computer and if
I go ahead and I click the start button
next to Apache and the start button next
to MySQL just to make sure that
everything starts and runs okay
this means that we can now use our
computer to run PHP code so I'm going to
go ahead and minimize this and if you
guys want to check that everything
worked correctly go ahead and open up
your computer and go to the see
drive and inside your C Drive you should
see a folder here called
XM okay now that means that the program
has installed in the right place and if
you guys call and find this file then
that means you did something wrong in
the install and you have to come go back
and watch the video again just make sure
you did everything correctly but by
default it should be here ok and if we
open up that folder you'll see there's
another folder called h TX ok this is
where all of the websites that we're
going to make with PHP have to go so I'm
going to go ahead and open up that
folder and as you can see there are
quite a few default folders in this
directory already now we're just going
to leave those as is don't delete them
and we can create a new folder and
seeing as this is a tutorial series you
guys can just create a folder called
tutorials or something like that and in
here is where we can save all of our PHP
code so I'm actually going to save all
of that for the next tutorial
so come back in the next tutorial and
you'll get to actually start writing
some PHP code and as always don't forget
to subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment give the video a thumbs up or
share the video it's really going to
help my channel grow so thank you very
much and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
