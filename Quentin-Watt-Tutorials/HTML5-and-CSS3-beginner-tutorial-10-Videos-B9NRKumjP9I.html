here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this video I'm gonna show you
guys how to use the video tag in HTML so
if you ever want to add a video to your
website then this is how you do it so
jump over to your text editor and you
can see right now I've cleared
everything out so my browser is blank
and I'm gonna add a video to my website
by opening up a video tag now this is a
new tag in HTML so it's it's new to
html5 fortunately though html5 has been
around for quite a long time now and it
should actually be supported by most
browsers but just in case somebody's
using a computer that's like 10 years
old and they're using Internet Explorer
and they've never updated Internet
Explorer this video tag would probably
not work for that person so you know the
number of people who this applies to is
hopefully by now very very small but
let's just add in a message yet to say
this if you can see this if you can see
this update your browser right so
basically this message should only
display if the user has a really old
out-of-date browser and a really old
computer so let me save this and hit
refresh in my browser and as you can see
the message isn't showing up that means
my browser at least supports html5 and
it supports this video tag so I'm good
to go and I'll continue by adding some
more information here so inside of the
video tag I want to add another tag by
the way whenever you add a tag within a
tag that's called nesting and we're
going to do that quite a lot in future
videos so I thought I just mentioned the
term but let me add another tag over
here called sauce and
and the source tag basically lets you
set a source for the videos we get to
decide what video we want to add to our
website now if I take a look at my
htdocs folder over here I wonder if I
just zoom in this way if again if they
get bigger nice now I don't have to edit
that so I've got my index file and then
I've also got this video called storm
clouds mp4 now make sure that whatever
video you're trying to add is an mp4
because mp4 is supported by most
browsers if you're trying to add a video
that is not an mp4 chances are good it's
not gonna work
so make sure that it is an mp4 and then
what you can do is just go ahead and
grab that file name or if your folder in
your videos away.he make sure you use
the correct file path but seeing as my
video and my HTML document are in the
same directory I'm just going to copy
that name paste it in here and then for
type I'm gonna set this equal to video
slash mp4 right so the type is just to
specify what type of video it is but we
know that most videos that work I mean
most browsers only support mp4 so we're
gonna specify a type of mp4 and we're
gonna make sure that we're using an mp4
if you're using something else I think
the only other ones that are supported
are OGG and WebM and even those are only
supported in some browsers and not in
others so just make sure that you're
using an mp4 it's the safest way okay so
now let me go ahead and save this and
jump back over to the browser and hit
refresh and you can see I've got a video
showing up but it is rather large so
this was a video of me in Germany and
there were some storm clouds come
in its actually on my blog channel if
you want to check it out
but let me just add a few more
attributes to this video to make it fit
the page and also to make the video play
because right now you know I'm clicking
on the video it's not playing how do I
get this video to play let me show you
right so for in the video tag I'm going
to add an attribute called width and
what that is going to do is determine
the width of our video so I'm going to
set that equal to 600 then I'm going to
also add an attribute for height and I'm
going to set that equal to 340 so 600 by
340 used to be the old YouTube standard
so that's how I know this video should
fit so let me come back here and hit
refresh okay so now the video fits
inside of the browser but I still can't
play it how do I get this video to play
well we can come back to the text editor
and add an extra attribute here called
controls and that doesn't have to be set
to anything so you don't have to have an
equal sign as long as the word controls
appears in the tag we should now get
some controls appearing in the browser
so let me come back here and refresh and
now I've got this beautiful set of
controls below my video so if I hit play
then my video actually plays and
obviously pause and I've got some volume
controls etc etc I can also make it
fullscreen so yeah the default controls
are pretty good whoopsie yeah I messed
my my window up now I've got to resize
it again okay so that is how you add a
video with controls but there are a few
other attributes I want to talk about
and so let me just grab my list over
here there is another attribute called
autoplay which if you specify this as
long as autoplay is
set as a value over here whenever you
open this web page in your browser it
will automatically play the video so let
me hit refresh ok so now whenever the
the page opens the video plays right so
yeah that is somewhat its useful in some
cases but it can be annoying in others
so you need to decide when you want a
video to play automatically or not but
yeah the autoplay options are them then
there is another option or another
attribute that we can add called loop
and this does precisely what you think
it does it loops the video so let me
remove autoplay save this go back to the
browser refresh and I'm gonna play the
video but when the video gets to the end
it's gonna loop so so yeah now that the
the video reached the end it looped and
that is because we have the loop
attribute set if that's not set the
video will not loop over and over again
okay so let me take that out and then I
want to talk to you guys about another
attribute that you can set which is
muted and obviously if you set this and
you you run it in the browser the video
will automatically be muted so you can
see the the symbol there is down I'm
playing the video there's no sound as
soon as I click on the microphone it's
now unmuted so you can control all these
sorts of things by just adding in an
extra attribute in the
the opening tag of your video and by the
way if you're following along with this
tutorial and your videos not showing up
or you you can't figure out what the
problem is just make sure to validate
your code so if you let me make a
mistakes that the video doesn't show up
I'll purposefully make a spelling
mistake in the video name come back over
to the browser refresh oh now you can
see the video is not displaying because
well I made a spelling mistake in the
name right but if you're ever trying to
figure out what your error is go over to
the HTML validator I will leave a link
in the video description browse find
that HTML file that you've been creating
and upload that to the HTML validator
and just check to see what your error is
because if you made a typo in your video
name it will be
oopsie let's check this again maybe it's
because I have a video set but it should
actually tell me that I've made a
mistake not
Oh
okay so if you upload your file and hit
check it should tell you if you've made
some kind of a mistake service not
available what the hell
it just it literally just works let me
hit refresh here I can okay so check
that's taking time okay there we go for
some reason those websites got issues
today but there we go if you check your
file in an HTML validator it'll give you
the error so bad value storm-clouds
attribute source on element sauce
illegal character in path segment space
is not allowed so I used the space
that's bad
and yeah bad bad value because it
couldn't find the actual video so let me
go ahead and correct that and save this
and now if I jump back over the browser
and i refresh you can see that the video
showing up again but if I test this in a
validator I should not have any errors
hopefully it works this time
please bad okay so so it seems for some
reason this the site is down that's not
good but let's try again okay there we
go
document checking completed no errors to
show awesome so that is how you add a
video to your website and that is all I
have for you and I'll see you next time
I just want to send a shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain they run a
coding bootcamp with courses on iOS

development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job

within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead

in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
