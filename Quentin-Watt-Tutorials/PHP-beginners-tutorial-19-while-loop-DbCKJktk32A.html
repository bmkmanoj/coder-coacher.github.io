here and welcome back to you tutorial
number 19 and in this tutorial I'm going
to talk to you guys a little bit more
about loops and specifically the while
loop so a while loop works in a very
similar way to a for loop except the
syntax you'll notice is going to be a
little bit different because a while
loop doesn't have a bolt encounter and a
for loop did if you can remember we had
that little counter incrementing in
those parentheses okay for a while loop
we don't actually have that so we have
to make our own counter outside the loop
and then increment it inside the loop it
can get a little bit confusing but I'll
you guys will understand as soon as I
show you everything so let's take a look
at the syntax for a while loop real
quick and the first thing you have to do
is type in the word while and as you can
see it turns blue okay and then we've
got two parenthesis and our curly braces
okay
now in these parentheses that's where
our condition goes but only the
condition so while this condition is
true the loop will continue to execute
okay but we haven't made a counter yet
and we haven't incremented our counter
so like I said we actually when using a
while loop have to make our own counter
so basically the code that we want to
repeat would go here and then for our
own counter that we have to make we'll
just go ahead and declare our new
variable I up here and we'll start at
zero and then again we have to increment
I inside this loop now this is actually
very very important guys if you
create a variable here and you don't
increment it in the loop then your
program is probably going to crash okay
because especially if you're not
incrementing I inside this loop here
you're gonna make a loop that runs
forever because this condition will
never ever become false and that the
computer is just gonna freeze and like
the users never ever gonna be able to
see your website basically so let's go
ahead and just make a program that
counts up to ten so let's go while I is
less than 10 so basically once I gets to
ten then this loop will stop but while I
is less than 10 let's echo something
else and we'll just echo I can count two
variable I and then we'll just put in a
break tag so that everything appears on
a new line okay so let's go ahead now
and run this in Firefox so I'm just
gonna go ahead and click refresh and as
you can see the computer actually counts
from 0 up until nine okay if we wanted
to actually count from 1 to 10 we could
start at 1 and like I told you guys
about the comparison operators we can go
while I is less than or equal to 10 and
this will include 10 as part of our
range over here so when we click refresh
we should get from 1 up 3 to 10 so
that's pretty cool and that's basically
an example of how a while loop works but
let's take a look at an example of an
error that you guys might possibly make
at the very beginning
okay so I've taken out
increments so basically we're not going
to increment I inside our loop okay now
this means that I is never gonna get
bigger so I will always be equal to one
and that means that this loop is gonna
stay running forever and that's actually
a problem when it comes to actually
writing programs like this so you're
gonna see that when we go back to
Firefox now and click refresh it kind of
gets stuck loading and it might actually
be stuck for the like this for about a
minute or so and eventually Firefox is
gonna crash so you can see it's still
loading so yeah there we go
Firefox crashed there's the message okay
so I'm just gonna go ahead and quit but
basically making a forever loop like
that or making a loop that runs forever
is really bad so you don't want to do
that so I hope that you guys do not make
that error always remember to increment
your loop in or increment your counter
inside your loop and that's actually all
I have for you guys in this video so

really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
