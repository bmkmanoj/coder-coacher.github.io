here and welcome to tutorial number 21
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about classes in HTML and CSS
obviously and what a class is is
basically just like a styling selector
so you are able to add a class to one of
your elements and you can style your
element according to the class rather
than the actual element name and I'm
going to show you just where there comes
in handy now because let's say I had
three paragraphs in my body so let's go
ahead and make one paragraph and this
paragraph can say I am blue and then
we'll make another paragraph and this
one can be a different color so let's
say that this paragraph must say I wish
I were red and one last one just for
good measure and we'll say I'm feeling
bright yellow bright and yellow okay
cool
so we'll try and make this one blue
we'll try and make this paragraph red
and we'll try and make this paragraph
yellow now you know from previous
tutorials that I can go ahead and select
a paragraph tag by its actual element
name so I could go ahead and just type
in P over here and then style my
paragraph like this but the problem with
this is that it's going to style all
paragraphs the same color as whatever I
put in here so if I go ahead and I maybe
change this color to blue then it's
going to change all of my paragraphs to
blue so if I go ahead and run this in
Firefox now I have all blue paragraphs
so how do I tell Firefox so how do I
tell the browser that I only want this
paragraph to be blue this one I want to
be red and this one I want to be yellow
and the answer to that is to pretty much
use a class okay
so let's go back to HTML over here and
I'm going to go ahead and say class is
equal to something so we'll set this
class equal to blue and basically now
we'll be able to select anything with
the class of blue and turn that blue and
then we'll go ahead and give this one a
class as well and we'll set that equal
to a class of red and the next one we
can set class equal to yellow and my
phone just went off like five times
during this tutorial so I have no idea
what you're on about let's take a look
now it's a guy from another YouTube
channel just messaging me okay that's
cool I'll reply to him later because you
guys are more important to me then he is
you know I love you guys anyways so
we've got the first paragraph with a
class of blue the second with the class
of red and the third with the class of
yellow so let's go over to CSS and
instead of styling all of our paragraphs
by element name we're going to use the
class and to style an element or to
style something using a class you're
going to go ahead and first put in a
period or a full-stop whatever you want
to call it and that basically means okay
HTML or CSS listen up I'm going to use a
cloth then you're going to put in your
class name so for our first paragraph we
named our class blue so I'm going to go
ahead and just copy that and paste that
in here and whenever you style something
as a class in CSS using notepad plus
plus and notepad plus plus always
changes the class
by default so we can go ahead and or it
turns the actual text of the glass red
not the class rate but yeah okay so now
we can go ahead and style our blue class
to have a color of blue and I'm going to
save this now and when I go back to
Firefox and click refresh you can see
that only the blue class is blue and the
other two haven't changed yet because we
haven't styled them yet okay but that's
how you would use a class to style only
one element or you could actually style
many elements using the same class but
yeah let's go ahead now and add in our
red glass so remember a period symbol or
. and then we'll go ahead and say red
and we'll set this color to red and
we'll make another class over here
called yellow was it actually yellow
then i call it yellow I did okay
yellow and I'll set this equal to color
of yellow yellow you there mm-hmm just
kidding
okay cool click refresh and I guess the
yellow was maybe a bad choice because
you can't really see it on the white
background but hey okay so we've got one
blue paragraph one red paragraph and one
yellow paragraph okay so that's how you
would use a class to style one element
at a time but like I said classes can
actually be used to style more than one
element so let's say I wanted to add in
another paragraph over here and I wanted
this one to be blue as well then I could
go ahead and actually just add that
class to this element so class equals
blue and then I'll say this is another
blue para
and when I save this now and click
refresh this paragraph is blue as well
okay so basically just add whichever
class you create to whatever paragraph
you want to apply the styling to and it
doesn't have to be colors obviously it
can be anything you can be working with
borders or background colors or
background images or anything that I've
shown you guys in the past few tutorials
so that's actually all I have for you
