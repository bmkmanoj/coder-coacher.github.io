here
and welcome to tutorial number 31 and in
this tutorial I'm going to speak to you
guys a little bit more about form
validation so in the previous tutorial
we started looking at form validation
and I showed you guys how to check if
there was any information fold into a
text box or a password field now in this
tutorial what I want to show you guys is
how to check if a radio button has been
checked or not checked so first of all
we're going to have to add some radio
buttons into our browser so we'd only
use a radio button if the user required
like a yes-or-no answer like we're going
to give them a question and we only want
a specific answer back we don't want
them to make up a whole bunch of stuff
so let's say I asked the user do you
want to auto renew your membership on to
this website okay then that is a
yes-or-no question I only want them to
tell me yes or no so let's go ahead and
just add in that question over here
so we'll say do you want to auto renew
your membership okay and now we need to
give them the option of either checking
yes or no so we're going to add in an
input element and we're going to put it
off type is equal to radio and then
we're going to give it a name of Auto
renew and then we're going to give it a
value and I'm going to just set this
value equal to yes and then I'm also
going to give it an ID of Auto renew now
I'll explain what our new years okay I'm
going to explain what all
of these attributes do in a second but
let's just go ahead and I might as well
just duplicate that at the bottom here
I'm going to change this Auto renew ID
to know and I'm also going to change
this value to note and remodels we'll
just put in a label over here so this
one is yes and this one is no sorry guys
I'm actually just tidying up because I
didn't make this appear very tidy so
I'll just put in some brake tags there
as well and now when we save this and
run this in Firefox we get this form
oviya do you want to auto renew your
membership and then you have the option
of either checking yes or no so when you
check it you're going to land up having
that dot in the middle but we can't
uncheck it now so okay one of them is
always going to be checked after we
click there so as you can see there are
quite a few attributes that we used here
on this input element now the first one
is obviously to tell HTML that this is a
radio button we want it to be rendered
as a radio button which is obviously
these little circle things okay then I
gave it a name of Auto renew and this
name actually serves two purposes
so the first purpose that this name
serves is basically just to put these
two radio buttons in a group because
whenever you group radio buttons by
giving them the same name then only one
of them can be selected so the user can
only check yes or no as soon as we click
on one the other one becomes unselected
so that's one purpose of why we have
this name here then the second one is
basically for the same reasons we have a
name for input elements as well is when
we click Submit and the
form goes through okay you'll notice at
the end of the URL we've got the name
here and then we've also got our value
what it's set equal to okay so because
we clicked the no input elements we
landed up having no sent through as the
value okay so that's actually what this
value does here as well so we send
through the name and then we also send
through the value that appears here so
if the yes radio button was checked then
we'd send through the value of yes so we
can go back there and actually click yes
and when we click Submit now we've
actually sent yes instead of no but with
this still with the same name Auto renew
then lastly we have the ID attribute
which you guys all know what that means
or what we use that for it's just so
that we can obviously work with this
elements in JavaScript we've got a way
to identify this element okay so now
what we want to do is we actually want
to create a function that's going to be
able to check if one of these two check
boxes or radio buttons has been checked
so what we need to do is start off our
function so I'm going to call my
function is checked and I'm going to
call it when this form is submitted so
we'll go ahead and just type in the name
here is checked okay so we're going to
return the value from this function and
now I need to go ahead and create this
function up here so function is checked
should probably should it just copy
pasted it but okay I think it's right
cool okay so what I do is I double click
on the word and then it highlights both
of them I like green and then I know
that they're both spelt the same so in
this function I want to declare two
variables okay
so let's go ahead and just type in the
word VAR would help if I didn't hit caps
lock okay
var and the first variable I'm going to
call
yes checked and I'm going to set this
equal to documents well you can hear it
is storming outside document dot get
element by ID and obviously I want to
grab it by this ID here so author in you
yes and then I want to create another
variable which is going to be exactly
the same except I'm going to call this
no checked and I'm going to set it equal
to this element over they instead alter
in you know so I don't need this entire
input element over here to be my
variable all I want to know is if this
element of yeah or this element of iya
has been checked or not checked and the
way I can do that is I can use a
property called checked and I can append
it on to this El document.getelementbyid
d statement so I'll go ahead and append
on checked and now I'm only accessing
this checked property over here so let's
go ahead and put it in on the bottom one
as well now what this means is that if
this input element of yes has been
checked then this variable yes checked
will be equal to true and if it wasn't
checked then this variable yes checked
is going to be equal to false so let's
go back to our browser here and right
now you can see that no is checked which
means no is now true and the variable
yes checked is now false
but if I go ahead and I check this then
yes checks will be equal to true and no
checked these are variables over here
will be equal to false okay
unfortunately that's all I have time for
in this tutorial but please join me in
the next tutorial and we'll carry on
working on this and we'll finish it up
and start on a new project so thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
