here just a quick update on the whole
internet issue from last week and also
the reason why I didn't post videos last
week so I let you guys know that my
internet line was down
and what I was doing for a little while
was recording at home and going to work
and uploading and that's actually how
I've always done things like the past
two years I've always had to record at
home go to work and upload because I
always had a faster line at work than I
had at home but last week things changed
with the fact that my internet line over
here blew up and I was able to get a
fiber line I managed to get the fastest
line I've ever had so take a look at
that real quick should probably just try
focus but there we go 29 megabits per
second download it's actually supposed
to be 40 and 19 megabits per second
upload and that's actually supposed to
be 20 all right so that is the fastest
whoopsie just get myself back in focus
that is the fastest internet line I've
ever had and what that means is now for
the first time in about two years I can
upload HD video from home in fact it
means for the first time in my life I
can upload HD videos from home because
my first couple of videos were never HD
and that's exciting hopefully it means
good things for the channel hopefully it
means that I can be a little bit more
productive and work a little bit faster
I just don't want to promise too much
right now because the whole one video a
day thing last week got to me a little
bit it's it's hard work doing one video
a day when I still have a full-time job
as well and yeah I just wanted to get
you guys or keep you guys within the
loop and just let you guys know what was
going on so i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
