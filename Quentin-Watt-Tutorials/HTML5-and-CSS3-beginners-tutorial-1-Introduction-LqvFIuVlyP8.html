here and welcome to my html5 and css3
tutorial series reboot in this series we
are going to learn how to create
websites using html5 and css3 which in
case you guys didn't know are the
languages that websites are written in
now I'm going to be recording the series
as if you the viewer has had no previous
experience in HTML or CSS before so if
you are a complete beginner then don't
worry you found the right series you can
continue watching from here and you'll
do great
ok and if you guys do have a little bit
of experience with HTML then you know
you could carry on watching just for
some revision or you could join in later
on when we start talking about some more
complicated stuff so because this is a
tutorial series reboot I have to mention
to you guys that I do have another HTML
series on my channel at the moment and I
don't want you to confuse the two
okay the older one is going to have a
different thumbnail to this new series
so the older series will have a dark
blue checkered thumbnail as the
background and the new series is going
to have a flat light blue background on
the thumbnail now the difference between
the two series is that my old series was
recorded on my old computer with an old
mic and a smaller screen so the quality
of those tutorials are just really bad
and I really wanted to redo them to
improve on the quality of the tutorials
on my channel ok so that's why I'm
making a new series and if you guys want
to follow this new series then just make
sure you follow all the same thumbnails
so to get started with this series there
are two things that you guys are
I have to download or maybe you've
already got them on your computer okay
and the first thing we need is a good
text editor so the text editor that I
use is notepad plus plus and it's a good
one I would recommend if you're
following along with my tutorials that
you download that and I will show you
how to download that in just a moment
and then the second thing that we need
or that you guys need is a good browser
now I use Firefox but if you guys want
to use Chrome that's up to you
they both work equally as well okay but
just make sure you're not using
something like Internet Explorer or you
know some older browser okay so let's
take a look at installing notepad plus
plus now what I'm going to do is just
open up my browser and I'm going to
google notepad plus plus okay so you can
see that I've got this link that shows
up at the top here which I'll click and
that's going to take me straight to the
download page for notepad plus plus now
of course I want the latest version
which at this moment in time is version
six point five point three but if you're
watching this like six months from now
there's probably going to be a newer
version so whatever it is just download
the latest version so I'm going to go
ahead and click download and I'm going
to click save now it's probably worth
mentioning that if you guys are using a
Mac then notepad plus plus will not work
on your computer and you're going to
have to download something like text
wrangler or some other alternative now
that doesn't mean you won't be able to
follow along with my tutorials it just
means that you will be typing in a text
editor
that looks different to mine okay so I
would go ahead and just Google a few
other options and see what you can come
up with and
go from there okay so I'm going to go
ahead and click install here so yep I'm
going to save this and I'm going to run
it you guys probably weren't able to see
that message that I just clicked on by
the way it was like that Windows message
but anyways okay so please select the
language I'm English so I'm just going
to go ahead and click English next and I
mean you guys pretty much know how to
install a program so will obviously read
through all of this stuff just make sure
that we don't sign our life away go
ahead and click I agree a destination
folder that's fine and I will go ahead
and just leave everything as default go
ahead and click Next
and I want to desktop shortcuts so I'll
go ahead and I'll take that make sure
that you're not installing any malware
or anything that's the most important or
most irritating part about installing
new software which fortunately notepad
plus plus doesn't have any malware so
I'm we're lucky go ahead and click run
notepad we'll go ahead and finish this
okay so now you can see that notepad
plus plus is open on my screen and this
is just the changelog so what's new
whoops so this is just telling us what's
new in this version and we can go ahead
and close that because there's nothing
really interesting there for now okay
so now we can actually start writing our
code but I think I'm going to save that
for the next tutorial so guys get keen
to learn how to write websites and come
back in the next tutorial where we'll
actually start writing some code and as
always don't forget to subscribe please
feel free to leave a comment give the
video a thumbs up or share the video
it's really going to help my channel
grow so thank you very much and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
