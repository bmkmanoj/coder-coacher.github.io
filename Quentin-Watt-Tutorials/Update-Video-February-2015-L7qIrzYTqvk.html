here and i have a few awesome updates
for you guys some maybe not so awesome
but at least they explain where I've
been and what I've been doing over the
past couple months so the first thing I
wanted to mention is how awesome does
this audio sound this is freaking
amazing I love it okay and the reason
for that is because I got a new
microphone a little while ago you might
know that I was raising trying to raise
some money through a paypal donation
button and a couple of you guys actually
donated so I managed to make a bit of
cash from there and then I also chipped
in a little bit of extra cash myself so
in total i raised about one hundred and
sixty dollars from my donate button and
then I chipped in an extra about 250
almost 300 bucks or three hundred
dollars of my own money and I got a blue
Yeti microphone and this microphone is
fantastic so I just want to thank or
everyone who donated I'm going to read
out your names now I do apologize if I
read your name wrong if maybe i
pronounced it wrong or something but
this is how they came through on paypal
so this is exactly how i'm going to read
them and yeah the first guy or the last
guy to donate was Eugene iguales then
liana son Trisha solar Jack Watson
Gwendolyn Oh benza Simon Brown ayub
asadi and the last or the first donator
was cool guy 727 that's how his name
came through and paypal so that's what
I'm going to mention but I just want to
thank all of you guys for donating you
guys have really helped me out and
you've definitely helped this channel
out because now I can make much higher
quality videos and yeah it's just going
to be amazing so I really want to thank
you guys and now we can move on i guess
so the
next thing I want to talk about is the
fact that I've moved okay so you guys
will remember from my last update video
I mentioned that I moved cities I got a
new job and yeah now I've moved to my
own house i'm no longer staying with my
sister and I'm a little bit closer to
work right now but the unfortunate thing
about that is i don't have internet i'm
trying to get internet installed at my
place it is taking a really long time
yeah it's just I'm really struggling
with the internet company here it's
basically a monopoly and trying to get
them to do anything is most mostly a
nightmare so hopefully i'll get internet
soon but for now i am kind of running
off of mobile data on my phone and yeah
that's pretty much what i'm doing so i'm
gonna be recording videos at home and
then trying to upload them add like
Wi-Fi hotspots or Wi-Fi areas around the
city so yeah whenever I get a chance to
upload videos at a Wi-Fi hotspot
somewhere or at my work or something
like that then you guys will see some
more videos from me but yeah I'm going
to be recording at home offline most of
the time so that's just what you can
look forward to okay and the next thing
is I should be getting a macbook pro
that should be arriving soon in fact it
should actually be arriving tomorrow
morning so that is pretty awesome
because now I'll be able to support all
the guys on Mac who are constantly
asking me questions like how do you do
this on a Mac at what is the alternative
on a mac okay seeing as I'm going to be
using a Mac now i'm going to be having a
mac or I'm going to own a mac then yeah
I should be able to come up with an
alternative for you guys so 11 of the
the programs they use a lot is no pair
plus plus and there is no mac version of
that so I always have to suggest to
people to use sublime that's just the
kind of situation will be in where I'll
be able to support both Windows users
and mac users ok and the last thing I
want to mention is if you guys made it
this far then thank you for watching and
if you're new then don't forget to hit
the subscribe button below it's really
going to help my channel grow and I will
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
