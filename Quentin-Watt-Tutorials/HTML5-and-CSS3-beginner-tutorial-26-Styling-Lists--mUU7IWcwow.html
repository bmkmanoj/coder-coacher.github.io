here and welcome to tutorial number 26
and in this tutorial we are gonna take a
look at how to style lists in HTML so if
you take a look at my text editor over
here I've gone ahead and just
pre-populated a little bit of code so
we've got an h2 that says this is a or
here's a list to style and then I've got
a bunch of list items within a unordered
list and each one of them actually has
instructions of what we're gonna do in
this tutorial and then if we take a look
at my main CSS file that's empty so
looking at this in the browser this is
pretty much what our page looks like in
fact let me just zoom in to make this a
little bit bigger and clearer for
everyone right so here's a list style
and here's some things that we can do
this list we can change the list styling
from circles to squares or another shape
we can also make this unordered list
into an ordered list so right now it
uses bullet points but we could actually
make this list use numbers as if it were
an ordered list even though it's not an
ordered list
it's an unordered this ul right then we
can add an image so instead of using
numbers or instead of using a shape like
these bullets we can actually use an
image and then the last thing we can do
is actually just remove the styling
completely so I'm going to show you guys
how to do all of that in this tutorial
so let's jump over to my CSS file
because that's where the meat of this
tutorial is gonna be and I want to
select this list by just going ahead and
selecting ul and that is going to select
our unordered list and then I'm gonna
use a property called list style type
and then I'm going to change this from
right now the default setting is
actually disc that's what these little
colored in bullet points are actually
but I'm gonna change this to a circle
alright so if I change that to circle
come back and hit refresh you can see
that we now have Mt
holes are bullet points and there are a
bunch of other settings for this so you
can actually just Google this and find a
bunch of different options to decide
which one you want to use right but the
circle there is a square so stay with us
come back here hit refresh now we've got
little squeeze and like I said the
default one is disk so if you set that
back to disk it goes back to those
colored in circles and there's a whole
bunch of different options so go ahead
google it find out what options there
are I'm just showing you guys more or
less how to do this not every single
option that there is right okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and comment this line of
text out now and let's take a look at
the second point wishes to make this
unordered list into an ordered list so
that's something we can do as well and
let's just change it to circle and we
can actually use the same property so
I'm gonna just paste that down here I
know if somebody's probably gonna ask
why I just commented this out and then
use the same line it's because when I
make the tutorial code downloadable
later on I actually want this there
right so now we've got a list style type
is equal to circle but let's change that
from circle let's set it equal to
decimal so decimal numbers of course you
guys know are the numbers 1 2 3 4 that
kind of stuff so if we come back here
and hit refresh we now have our
unordered list displaying as if it were
an ordered list we've got the numbers 1
2 3 and 4 in front of each bullet point
right so that's something we can do as
an ordered turn our unordered list into
an ordered list we can do the same thing
as well if if we change this from ul -
oh L then by default it would be a
numbered list right but we can then go
back to our code and actually change
ordered lists into unordered lists by
doing the same thing list-style-type and
then just
sitting that to square or disc or
something and come back here and hit
refresh and now we've changed an ordered
list into an unordered list so you can
do things both ways it's it's
interchangeable right so I'm just gonna
comment that part out as well and let's
change this back to a unordered list
right so the other options that we have
here are refresh this again okay so the
other options that we have instead of
decimal there are also things like
decimal - leading zero and that'll put
zero in front of the number so now it's
a 1 o 2 O 3 right then we can also do
Roman numerals so I forget the setting
for that it's Roman lo ok Papa Lewin
upper upper Roman and lower Roman right
so come back here and now we've got
lower Roman numerals as in III III IV
right you can also do it as upper Roma a
proven I don't know why I'm struggling
to say that Oh as a weird laughs as well
okay come back hit refresh and now I've
got upper Roman numerals and like I said
there's a bunch of different options
here so you can go ahead and Google
these find out what they are I mean
there's things like Greek lower Greek
there are Japanese symbols like katakana
so I mean you decide if you want to use
something like that and just do the
research right okay so that was changing
the that was the second point which was
making an unordered list into an ordered
list we can also add a list style image
instead of using Roman numerals or
instead of using bullet points right so
if we take a look at my htdocs folder
over here obviously I've got my index
file that we've been using this whole
time I've got my
CSS which is in there but I've also
added an emoji which is the sunglasses
emoji that cool emoji and yeah we can
actually use something like this as a
style item as well so the name of this
emoji is emoji dot ping so let me copy
that
and I'm gonna comment that line of code
out there and instead of using that lets
let's use a new line which is gonna be
list style image so it's a new property
as well and I'm gonna set this equal to
URL open my brackets and this is how you
set an image for your your list item now
we have to get the correct file path
over here so my CSS file is here which
means I need to go back one folder and
then I need to go into this emoji or I
need to select this emoji image so how
do we go back one folder we go dot dot
slash that's going to take us back one
folder and then I'm gonna put the emoji
or the image name in here which is emoji
dot ping because it is a ping image if
it is not a ping image of course then
use jpg or whatever file extension your
image actually is please don't just copy
me when you have a different file type
okay let's come back here and hit
refresh and now you can see we've got
our list item showing up with images in
front of each list item you know it does
look a little bit not nice because the
image and the text don't exactly line up
so they are some styling rules that you
can go about there are some things that
you can go about doing to fix this one
of those might be to just add a little
bit of extra padding in front of our
list item so to be honest we might have
to do okay well actually ul padding left
let's just make that a little bit bigger
like 50 pixels by default I think it's
like 20 or 15 or so
thing okay refresh fifty pixels and now
we got a little bit more space here the
actual image shows in the browser then
you might want to just line this text
and the actual picture up by adding some
margin or padding on the bottom as well
so yeah I don't want to spend too much
time on this because it's gonna add a
lot of minutes to my tutorial but just
know that you might want to just add
some padding or margin or something to
the bottom or the tops of these things
and you can get them in line right right
so that was this style image let's take
a look at loops let's take a look at the
fourth point which is to remove all of
the styling completely so if I comment
this out as well right
we should come back to a normal default
list but we can remove the styling of
these these list items by saying
list-style-type:none and that's going to
completely get rid of all these list
items or these bullet points right but
you'll see there's still a little bit of
padding here so it's not exactly lined
up against the edge of the website or
against the edge of the browser so what
we can do as well as go padding padding
left the reason why I always select
padding left is because while this is
the left of our list and if you actually
take a look at this in the browser or in
the console if I hover over my unordered
list you can see that purple block next
to the text that's padding so if I make
that smaller or if I set that to zero
pixels like I'm gonna do now zero pixels
then it disappears and now everything is
in line right but by default that
padding is pretty much always the
to make space for the list or the bullet
points that that appear or the images
that you want to use or something like
that right I just want to send a shout
