here and yeah the other day we reached
100,000 subscribers on this YouTube
channel which is really really really
really really really exciting and I
actually video at the moment that it
happened so I'm just gonna jump today
that was super super exciting that was
really good news because I've been
working on getting 100,000 subscribers
quite a long time and it's been exciting
and an exciting journey to get there
right now it just so happened that the
same time that I reach 100,000
subscribers I kind of also found out
about something this weekend so I
thought I got that 100,000 subscribers
last week Thursday and I there was
something like found out about on this
weekend which is kind of upsetting and
disturbing and it looks like it's been
going on for a couple of years now
I emailed the party involved with this
or the website involved with this and
they kind of asked me to confirm my
identity by holding up a piece of paper
which you know I don't think is a real
confirmation of my identity this is the
same test that people give to somebody
who is a catfish right but yeah let me
do that so today's date is the 8th of
the 8th 2017 that's today's a day I'm
recording this the day I reported my
problem was the 7th of the 8th 2017
right and yeah the problem is tonight I
fly to Zurich and I'm probably if I
can't get those video uploaded in the
next couple of hours I'm probably going
to be on a plane to Zurich and then I'm
going to have limited internet
connectivity while I'm in Zurich so yeah
you might not see this video on today's
date the 8th of the 8th 2017 that's a
little bit of a problem right but make
no mistake I am real I'm really really
real right so this is a South African
passport right and if I open this up to
the identity page I'm just going to
cover part of the passport over here
because I don't want you to be able to
see my ID now
my passport number and those sorts of
things because yeah you could steal my
identity and run up credit in my name or
something but something that you guys
already have access to is my name and
pictures of me and my birthday so yeah
that all that information is all
available over here on my passport as
well I'm just going to give this a few
seconds to kind of focus so you can very
clearly see my name and those other
details so yeah that's me and you know
who's definitely not me if you go over
to udemy.com
slash user slash Stanley William
3 I'm going to leave the link in the
description below that is definitely not
me but it does kind of look an awful lot
like me the profile name says Quinton
what is or Quinton what's easy so I
don't know where they got the EZ from
but there we go
that's that's that's my name apparently
and from that picture you can see that
Quinton what is is pretty much a really
handsome guy in fact that picture looks
really really familiar
it was once on my Facebook page and it's
also kind of on my cPanel tutorial
series so if you take a look at the
thumbnail there that's me and yeah it's
over there as well on all of the cPanel
tutorial videos so not only did this
person impersonate me they impersonated
me really really poorly because they
spoke terrible English let's check out
this profile real quick now if you take
a look at it let's ignore the quote at
the top there but underneath my CV
Quinton spelt with a lowercase Q because
that's definitely something I would do I
would spell my own name with a lowercase
Q because you know that's the cool way
to do it yeah she so all of a sudden I'm
a girl
she has been interested in computer
science and programming from his so now
all of a sudden I'm a guy again
early years right so what the heck did I
just change genders halfways or a
sentence I started as a she and I change
to a his like before the sentence even
ended
my multi-gender now or something I don't
I don't get it hi so now instead of
talking about myself in the third person
as in Quinton she his and her I'm
talking about myself in the first person
like I am active in various programming
fields like css3 javascript C++ jQuery
jQuery is spelt with a capital Q by the
way just just so you know html5 PHP Ruby
I don't actually know Ruby so if you're
gonna lie or if you're going to
impersonate me at least do it correctly
Python and a lot more okay teaching has
been my passion since a long time hmm
since a long time
do you remember that time that we
couldn't just give a name to like
October the 1st 2010 or something like
that we just decided to call it a long
time so since a long time my aim is to
teach so my I'm one person right now my
aim is to teach technology the way that
it is used in this yeah this doesn't
really make much sense my aim is to
teach technology the way it is used in
the industry and professional world well
in the professional world yeah so if we
use the somewhere in that sentence it
would have been really helpful we
deliver high quality courses so all of a
sudden I am now not one person anymore
I'm two people we or you know more than
two people we deliver only high quality
courses that take you from a beginner to
an expert in a matter of hours on any
topics we again I'm apparently more than
one person here cover I am not that dumb
I mean I might be a little bit dumb but
I'm not that now the problem I have with
this is that apparently this guy has
amassed 8960 to students eight thousand
nine hundred and sixty two that means
that even if these courses didn't sell
at their recommended prices and they
sold at like the lowest discount price
that udemy could sell them at they'd be
selling at ten dollars right
ten dollars times 8900 M oh yeah eight
thousand nine hundred and sixty-two
students would be eighty nine thousand
six hundred and twenty dollars right
that is a huge profit that this person
has been making in my name and by
impersonating me and not only did he
just impersonate me he actually used all
of my content so if you go over to any
one of these courses just click on it
and actually preview the course you can
see that it is literally the exact same
video that I put on YouTube it is the
exact same video that I put on YouTube
he didn't like I mean he cut out the
beginning where I said hey YouTube how's
it going but he used the rest of the
video so yeah he's made eighty nine
thousand dollars off of something that I
made off of my creation my content
things that I film the way that I was
talking I mean he could have at least
just taken the exact same stuff I said
in a video and then recorded his own
video on his own computer with his own
voice and it wouldn't really be
copyright because it would be him
explaining the stuff so yeah yeah like I
don't know why I had to go ahead and
steal my content but he did and then he
profited right so the way I understand
this is that basically what happens when
you upload content to udemy udemy splits
the profits right so you go 5050 right
so 50% of the content went to the guy
who stole my content and uploaded it to
YouTube and 50% of the profit made from
these this content also went to udemy
that means that you me and this guy
working at the lowest ratio of ten
dollars per course have made each forty
four thousand dollars right now or just
over forty four thousand dollars which
is quite a lot of money to just kind of
ignore and throw away right but here's
the problem right I reported this as
copyright theft I reported this as the
content that belonged to me and that
this guy has created a fake fake profile
so he's impersonating me or she's
impersonating me I have no idea who did
this right could even be more than one
person but
whoever these people or this person is
they have profited $44,000 or just over
and udemy has profited forty-four
thousand US dollars or just over that
and that is if this number is real if
eight thousand nine hundred and sixty
two students have actually signed up but
I also fully understand that this number
might have been clicked formed so they
might have been a free coupon code or
something like that that a few thousand
people signed up on and maybe actually
yeah because this number was clicked
formed and this isn't the profit that
has been made but there's no way of me
telling there's no way for me to tell
unless you two meet actually releases
some analytics and some statistics on
these courses but udemy won't do that so
that kind of means that if you de me
made forty four thousand dollars profit
from this course and this guy made forty
four thousand dollars profit from this
course you know basically the two of
them have been accomplices in a crime
even though
udemy might have been unwillingly an
accomplice or unknowingly and an
accomplice they have still committed a
crime and I know they're not going to
like me saying this but it's true it's
happened a crime has been committed
right so my only question is what do we
do from here right where do we go from
here what what's the process going
forward and udemy has said that they
will terminate the profile and you know
that's great because it means that this
guy will stop making profit off of
content that doesn't actually belong to
him that belongs to me but then what
happened to the forty four thousand
dollars you've already paid the guy and
what happened to the forty four thousand
dollars that udemy is already made you
know do you guys just keep the money you
do you refund all the users do you
refund all the people who bought the
course do you pay their profit out to me
right what happens and I think the first
step to really resolving and solving
this problem amicably is for you to me
to come to an agreement to work with me
on this and to release information that
is available to them analytics based on
how many people actually saw
you know bought one of these courses how
much profits these courses have made
over their lifetime and yeah basically
for me to find out whether it's actually
worth doing anything about and you know
if we can work together on this
peacefully and resolve this kind of this
problem peacefully I can still work with
you to me in future so as a creator
obviously if if this person managed to
sell eight thousand nine hundred and
sixty two courses with my content
obviously my content does well on udemy
so it would be you know stupid to not
have me put courses on udemy in future
but I wouldn't really feel comfortable
working with you to me if we cannot come
to a peaceful amicable solution to this
problem so yes
udemy I would like to come to a peaceful
agreement on this and I would like one
of your
your people to contact me and talk to me
a little bit more about this problem in
private of course and just remember this
is today's day to the eight of DA 2017
I'm real I'm really really real and I'll
see you guys soon hopefully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
