here and in this video I wanted to show
you guys how to back WordPress up and
move it over to a live server because
right now I've got this demo WordPress
site that we've set up and it is on our
localhost and that means that only we
can see our website but I might want to
move this over to a live server where
everybody can see it and the way we're
going to go about doing this is first of
all we're going to backup the website
then we're gonna move those backed up
files over to the live server and then
we're going to have to just run an
installation on the live side now first
of all there are two ways to go about
doing this there is the easy way which
I'm going to show you guys how to do it
in this tutorial which is just install a
plug-in which will make you or help you
make the backup but you could also do
this manually and I'm gonna show you
guys how to do that in the next video
because the manual way is a little bit
more advanced is a little more tricky if
you don't know what you're doing you
could mess it up
but this plug-in or using the plug-in
it's a lot easier it just doesn't work
100% of the time like it works all that
most of the time but not 100% of the
time this is always every now and then I
hit like an issue maybe the site is too
big to backup or something like that and
there's this or the way I go about doing
that
or getting around that problem is just
by doing the backup manually so let me
show you guys how to do the plug-in
method and I know I'm better ambling a
little bit but it was just because
obviously I wanted to explain all that
but let's login to WordPress so I'm
logged in to the backend over here and
like I said the first thing I want to do
is install a plugin so I'm gonna go over
to plugins and you can hit add new and
from here you could search for a plug-in
called Akiba this is the backup plug-in
I like to use I'm not sure if it's
listed in the WordPress directory or not
looks like it isn't listed in the
directory so I'm going to hit up
and then you're going to want to go over
to akeeba backup dot-com so let me just
show you how to navigate here from the
home page if you're on the home page
you'll see they have a backup component
for joomla they've also got this backup
component for WordPress and since our
website is in WordPress we're going to
use this one and then there are a whole
bunch of other products that they offer
but I'm only going to be downloading
this one and then go ahead and hit
download for WordPress and this will
then let you download Akiba the only
thing is it is quite a big file so it's
probably going to take some time to
download so instead of hitting download
I went ahead and I downloaded it before
the tutorial and here it is on my
desktop so what I want to do now is take
this plug-in and install it into
WordPress so go over to WordPress and
from the plugins page if you follow it
along with add a plug-in and then upload
just go ahead and browse on your
computer it's going to be on my desktop
I've got this file akeeba backup WP 2.0
so let's go ahead and hit open and
install now and this is going to install
the plugin and that actually was a lot
faster than I was expecting I thought it
would take some time to install but hey
there we go let's go ahead and hit
activate and this will now activate the
plug-in so now we have Akiba installed
and active as a plugin and since this
has happened we also have this akeeba
backup menu item in WordPress as menu so
go ahead and click on that and from here
you could just go ahead and make a
backup but I think you're going to hit a
little bit of a problem because the
backup it generates is made out of eight
it's a dot JPA file which not many of us
have the option to run or extract a dot
jba so let's just go over the
configuration and we're going to change
one thing in the config
and one thing only which is under
advanced configuration just change
archiver engine 2.0 Matt instead of dot
J PA I know it says J PA is recommended
but I'm recommending dot zip so go ahead
and follow what I say and from here I go
ahead and hit save and close and now
whenever you hit this back up now button
Akiba should generate a backup which is
actually going to be a zip file so let's
hit backup now and you'll see you've got
the option to put in a description or an
encryption key I'd say don't worry about
any of this stuff it's just if you don't
want it's basically like nobody can run
your backup without the password if you
do put an encryption key in I don't
really like to use this kind of stuff
because sometimes I might forget the
password right so I'm just gonna leave
that blank and I'm gonna hit backup now
and this is a process that's gonna run
for probably 10 minutes I suppose it
could take a while I mean the science is
quite small but I think I'm gonna pause
the recording and come back when it is
done
okay so seeing as the website was quite
small that backup ran for probably like
30 seconds after I pause the recording
not long at all but if it is a big
website or the bigger the website the
longer it's gonna take to backup your
files so now that the backup has run I'm
gonna go ahead and hit manage backups
and you'll see it's giving me a little
message to say I can watch one of the
video tutorials on their website by the
way if you guys want to learn more about
Akiba they do have video tutorials
somewhere their videos in the menu ok go
ahead click on that watch some of the
videos they are quite good and I'm just
gonna hit got it because I know how it
works I'm gonna go over to this backup
which is the backup that we
took today a few minutes ago and I'm
gonna hit download and this is going to
prompt me to download a zip file it says
that I could use FTP FCP in and download
the file or I could just download it
with this download button so I like to
just hit download especially since the
site is not actually that big it's only
29 Meg's so not big at all let's go
ahead and hit save and I'm gonna save
this to my desktop you could name it
literally anything you wanted I'm gonna
name it cool helicopter flying over I'm
making noises during my tutorials
okay let's name it WP backup taught okay
I'm gonna hit save and that should save
the file somewhere on my computer it's
actually on my desktop great so let me
just pull that over and pull the back up
here where we can see it and from here
now that we've made this backup of the
zip file we need to upload this zip file
to our server to wherever we're planning
on hosting the site so I'm gonna quickly
just open up a bunch of tabs and then
I'll resume the tutorial once I've got
everything that I need open opened all
right so I hope you guys took a little
bit of a break because I did and now I'm
back to continue on uploading this
backup to my web server so if you guys
followed along with one of my previous
tutorial series which is the cPanel
series you'll know I have this domain
that I own called Josie Corp com I
bought it specifically for that series
and now what I'm gonna do is upload my
wordpress site to this domain now this
domain comes with something called
cPanel which is the control panel that I
use to upload and manage files on my web
server if you guys don't know what
cPanel is and if you
have never worked with like hosting
shared hosting or hosting websites on a
server you need to go back and watch my
cPanel series now I know that somebody's
gonna leave an anchoring comment and say
that I didn't explain all of cPanel in
this video but again I cannot explain a
whole lot web development in like under
15 minutes and this is already gonna be
like a 15 minute video so yeah just go
back watch my cPanel series learn a
little bit about how to use cPanel and
then you come back you can come back and
watch this video series or learn how to
make a website live so from here what I
want to do is upload all of my files and
I could do this using the file manager
which is open in this tab but let's just
go to public HTML because that's where
all your public web files should go and
I could upload my files using this
upload button but if I did that it's
probably gonna take a long time and also
it could fail so I don't like using the
upload button I like to use something
called an FTP client yeah wow I'm really
messing everything up yet but I you'd
like to use something called an FTP
client and the FTP client that I use is
FileZilla so you're just gonna have to
go ahead and set up an FTP client and
from here you can basically if I hit
refresh
take my Akiba or sorry my WP back up
chat zip file and upload it to the
server so this is my computer and this
is the server and as soon as I hit
upload it should upload all of these
files to the server now this might take
a few minutes so I'm gonna have to stop
the recording or pause the recording and
just jump to when this reaches a hundred
percent okay so we basically got the
file uploaded
I go over to the server side here and I
just hit refresh
let's probably go for a little while but
now you can see that the zip file has
been uploaded to the server so now I can
go over to my file manager and here
where it said this directory is empty
if I hit reload the Dayak directory
should no longer be empty so I can go
ahead and extract this so I'm gonna hit
extract and I want to extract it to
public HTML that's perfect so let's go
ahead and run the extraction this is
well yeah it's gonna take a few minutes
but once that is done you can go ahead
and hit close and now you can see we've
got all of the WordPress files and
folders but we've also got this
installation folder which is actually
something that's new it was added by the
backup process
so by Akiba Akiba actually added this in
and now if i go over to my domain Jozy
cope calm and i hit enter instead of
getting the index of thing we've got
this error which is error establishing a
database connection so what I need to do
is actually just add a back slash in
here and then go to that installation
directory so what we're doing is we're
accessing this directory via the URL
Jozy cocom slash installation and that's
gonna run an installation that was made
by Akiba so if i go ahead and hit next
by the way this is just kind of giving
me a summary of I and I was just not
explaining the stuff but it's just
giving me a summary of what's on the
server so we just need to make sure that
we're running PHP 5.3 I need to make
sure that all of the stuff is working
okay like I almost never read any of
these things but if it's yellow that's
kind of like a warning and if it's red
it means that there's a problem in your
you
installation is probably not gonna run
but I'm just gonna hit next because
everything seems to be good database
type mysqli that's good database or
servant name these are details that
we're gonna have to set up now so if I
go back over to cPanel and I go to my
SQL databases right now I don't have one
so I'm gonna have to just set up a
database so let's set one up called
jozek Bay DB or WP d for WordPress
database let's go ahead and create that
and I'm gonna go ahead and hit back so
now I know I have a database of the by
the way I'm only allowed to have one
database here which is why I get this
error but I know I've got this database
called jozek bay so i'm going to copy
that database and i'm gonna place that
in database name because that is the
name of my database because i'm hosting
this database on the same server that
I'm hosting the website on I'm gonna put
in localhost over here so I don't have
to use that port 888 like we did in the
WordPress installation because this is
no longer this is no longer our map
installation this is actually a server
but because the website is on the same
server as the database we're just gonna
put a localhost okay user name I'm going
to then have to quote go back over to
the database here I'm gonna have to
create a MySQL user so jozek Bay let's
just make one call Joseph a user
password I'm just going to generate this
thing okay so let me take I have copied
this and save in a safe place and I'm
gonna use this password let's create the
user and well I'm just gonna not save
that but now we've got our user and
we've also got the password which I have
copied and I haven't actually pasted it
anywhere so let me go ahead
to this installation and I'm going to
paste the password in this field and
then I'm gonna come back here
and I'm just gonna grab the user name
and copy that and I'm gonna paste that
in the Jose eBay or in the user name
field right so let me hit go back great
so now that we've got our database and
we've got our user setup we actually
need to assign our user
jozek Bay user to the database so I'm
going to hit add and I'm just going to
select all privileges because if you're
using WordPress you're going to need all
privileges anyway so let's just go ahead
and hit make changes and go back and now
you'll see under current databases we've
got our database and we've got the user
that we just set up set up as a user so
now hopefully that now that all of these
details are filled in the localhost the
user the password and the database I
should be able to hit next and I
shouldn't actually get an error but
what's it say your password contain
special characters okay hopefully this
isn't going to be an issue let's hit
continue an error occurred restoring the
database the error message can be found
below unable to connect to the database
could not connect to my SQL great so
I've got a bit of an issue here my
database user name is Joseph a user
that is correct and Joseph Bay WPD be
the only thing I can assume is that the
password was bad because we did get that
warning about the password right so
let's go Joseph Bay user change password
I'm gonna just use the password
generator again this one doesn't look to
have any funny symbols let's use that
change okay
and let's paste that in here and try one
more time again getting an error okay
only a 2z lowercase a to z and numbers 0
to 9 so I do have a square bracket in
mine see what happens
database race okay database was restored
so for me the problem was that the
password was too complicated but the
second password even though it had
special characters was still okay so
let's hit next okay now you can see that
we've got some site parameters set up
here so the site name was Quinton sites
and that's exactly how it was in the
demo so I'm just gonna leave it like
that tagline just another WordPress site
this is something I can always change
later anyway so I'm just gonna leave it
as it is
WordPress URL so we now know that the
URL I want to host this website on is
josie cocom so that's perfect
site address josie cocom that's again
the same URL that i have over here so
that's perfect its users super users
we've got Quinten and we've got business
at Quinten what set up as the email
address that is all perfect so i'm just
going to go ahead and hit next now you
can see we've got some replacements to
be made so there are some cases where
we've set up a URL that was applications
MAMP htdocs and we're just going to
change that to home jozek pay public
HTML and then HTTP localhost needs to
become HTTP Josie Corp so basically what
we're saying is anywhere in our database
where we see this URL change it to Josie
cocom that URL because obviously the
website has moved from our localhost or
our map installation to the live server
so we need to make sure the domain is
correct again
application I'm actually not sure why
these are here they're not always there
but
for some reason I assume that the
installation has picked up that we're
using this URL somewhere but everything
looks good I'm just gonna go ahead and
hit next if there's a problem I'll fix
it
when I hit that problem so basically
what it's doing now is it's running
through the database and just searching
for the URLs that need to be changed and
it's gonna change them my hair is
getting in my face this is taking some
time okay cool so once that's done
you're gonna head you're gonna have this
big green button up here that's gonna
ask you to remove the installation
directory so when you click on this
what's gonna happen is it's gonna delete
this folder from your server so let's go
ahead and remove and visit the site's
front-end and just to double-check
everything here I'm gonna hit reload and
that installation directory has been
removed great that's perfect the reason
why we do that is because some malicious
person might attempt to access the
installation folder and reinstall
WordPress or install their own version
of WordPress it's just it's makes your
website susceptible to hacking so you
don't want to keep it there you what you
do want to delete it but now that that
has been removed I can see that
Jozy cocom is successfully showing the
website over here so this is the same
website over here and over here but
they're different domains and it looks
to me like all the links are working as
well so what you might want to do is
just click on one of these links make
sure your URL doesn't change too much it
should be Jersey cocom / about us
contact us blog post it looks like all
the links are working this is cool
and so what we've done is we've
successfully moved our website from our
localhost from from mam our installation
of map and we've now moved it to a live
server
Jozy cocom where all of you guys
can see the website and the goal for
this tutorial has been completed so I'm
gonna jump to the end card real quick
