and I am down at the Cape Town
waterfront so this is the watershed
behind me which is a place where a whole
bunch of entrepreneurs go to like be
entrepreneurial and get business ii and
stuff and it just reminded me about a
question that somebody asked a couple
weeks ago so yeah somebody asked me a
couple weeks ago how do you become a
successful developer and he just like
everybody else spoke about success as if
it were an object as if success is
something you can just pick up and
you've got it and drop it and then you
don't have it anymore
and that's the problem with people's
thinking about success is that it isn't
actually something like object or some
physical thing that we can just gain and
lose and gain success is setting goals
and reaching them so when you set a goal
and you reach that goal you can say you
were successful if you don't reach that
goal well then you were unsuccessful
so with that definition in mind how do
you determine what if you are a
successful developer and I guess the
case is are you meeting your goals right
you might just want to be a developer
who works for somebody who has a stable
job and under stable income and - in
your mind that might be success or you
could be like so many other people out
there and definitely something that the
media shows us what success is and that
is you know starting a company having a
start-up building that startup into a
multi-billion dollar business or
something and like that's successful I
guess that's kind of the wrong
perception of what success actually is
Table Mountain here in the background
but anyway how do you determine whether
you're a successful developer well I
guess you have to set goals and meet
them and if you're not meeting your
goals you're obviously being
unsuccessful but meet those goals hold
yourself accountable get friends to hold
you accountable to goals that you would
like to meet it might be something as
simple as learning something new
building something different building
something that goes beyond what you
thought you could have built
and yeah if you keep doing that for long
enough you'll keep learning something
you'll keep accomplishing things and
that's pretty much the definition of
success reaching the goals that you've
set for yourself and it doesn't matter
how low those goals are I mean you can
start with something as simple as
developing a website for your auntie
your uncle or one of your family members
by next week and just keep raising the
bar keep building more and more awesome
things keep challenging yourself and
you'll probably find in a couple months
or a couple years that you are where you
want it to be in that dream job or with
that dream company that you started and
it all starts with setting goals and
actually meeting them but for now I'm
gonna leave and get back on my tour bus
so I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
