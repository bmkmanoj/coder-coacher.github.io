here and welcome back to tutorial number
16 and in this video we are going to
continue talking about the CSS box model
and in particular I'm going to be
talking about the border property of our
CSS box model so I'm actually using code
from the previous tutorial over here and
if you guys obviously don't know what
padding and that kind of stuff is you
need to go back watch the previous video
and then come back and you will be up to
dates to watch this video okay so there
are three different properties that
we're going to work with when putting a
border on our webpage okay and like I
said a border is basically just a
decorative pattern around the outside of
our box okay so the first property that
we can work with is the border style and
this is basically what do you want your
border to look like and there are a few
different options that you can put in
here so I'm going to go ahead and put in
solid so that's just going to give us a
solid border but then there's also
dotted dashed rich in set and out set
and a few others so I'm going to leave a
list in the description of the video
below and you guys can go ahead and just
try them all out and see what they all
look like then the second property that
we're going to work with is going to be
the border width and this is obviously
how wide or how big you want your border
so I'm going to go ahead and just put in
five pixels and then we've got the
border color so this is just what color
do you want your border to be and I'm
going to go ahead and just type in blue
over here now when we save this and go
back to Firefox and click refresh we
have a five pixel wide blue border that
is solid all the way around
our box okay and just so you guys can
get an idea of what some of the other
styles look like let's go ahead and try
our dashed and if we go ahead and
refresh now you can see we've got a dash
border which kind of makes it looks like
that we should have cut it out with the
scissors you know like those patterns on
plastic wrappers and things that you buy
I don't know okay so there's that kind
of look then you've also got dotted
which we'll try out now as well go ahead
and click refresh and that's just like a
bunch of dots so those are a few of the
different styles but you guys can go
ahead and try the rest out like I said
there will be a list in the description
below but now this actually does look a
little bit tedious because this means
that every time we want to put a border
around something on our web page there
are three lines of code involved and
just like all the other properties that
I've shown you guys in the past there is
actually a shortcut to doing this okay
instead we just have to put in the
property of border and then we go ahead
and put in the size so we're going to
put in the size of one pixel and then
we'll put in the pattern or the type
style so let's go ahead and say let's go
try Ridge out and then the last thing
would be the color which let's just
change that to red so I think one pixel
is actually a little bit low you're not
really going to be able to see that so
let's go ahead and make it about three
pixels okay and now when we go back and
click refresh you can see we've actually
got this three pixel wide border around
our head and now except it's actually in
the ridge style which doesn't actually
look too great in this color you can't
really see it maybe if I made it a
little bit bigger so let's go ahead and
make that eight pixels
click refresh and as you can see that's
a lot more clearer okay so that's that's
what the rich border looks like and
again there might be some times where
you don't want the border all the way
around this box okay so sometimes you
might only want a border on the top or a
border on the bottom or a border on the
top and the bottom or something but not
on the left and the right we can go
ahead and do that as well so if we clear
this out we can just type in border top
so this means that we'll put a border on
the top and we can choose that to be
four pixels solid green and we can also
just for interest sake put one on the
bottom so border bottom and we'll make
that eight pixels groove and let's try
orange
I guess if I can spell orange right one
day hopefully haha okay cool let's go
ahead and click refresh and as you can
see we now have a green solid border on
the whoopsie-daisy
I clicked on something I shouldn't have
okay so we've got a green solid border
on the top of our our box and then we've
got an orange grooved border on the
bottom so that's how you guys deal with
borders and that's pretty much all I
have for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share the video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
