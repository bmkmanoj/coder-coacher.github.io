here and in this video I'm gonna show
you guys how to install plugins in
Joomla and if you guys don't know what
plugins are then let me just ramble on
for about 20 seconds but basically a
plug-in is an additional bit of software
or additional features that somebody
else wrote for Joomla and you can go
ahead and install those features as a
plug-in and actually use them on your
site so chances are whatever you want to
do on your website like creating a
slider or a gallery or something like
that somebody else has probably already
written a plug-in for Joomla for that
and you can go ahead and just install
that plug-in and you'll be good to go
okay so I'm gonna show you guys a really
useful plugin that I like to use and
that is actually the jce text editor so
in to install that I actually have to go
over to the backend of Joomla and then I
need to go over to extensions and
extension manager okay now don't freak
out if your webpage does not look
exactly the same as this okay I actually
had to click a little button to add
install from web over here okay so I
think when you first land up on this
page you're gonna be landing on the
upload package file and there's going to
be a little alert box at the top of the
page over here that says would you like
to add the install from web tab you're
gonna have to go ahead and click on a
button and once you've done that you're
gonna have this tab over here where
you're able to install plugins directly
from the web okay so one of the most
used plugins for Joomla is actually jce
and what this does is actually creates a
really nice WYSIWYG editor as you can
see WYSIWYG that stands for what you see
is what you get editor okay and if you
guys don't know what a what you see is
what you get editor is then let me go
over
you article manager and I'm gonna open
that in a new tab okay
and if I open up this article then
you'll see we're gonna have a text that
it's over here
so right now thinks something must have
gone a little bit along with Joomla but
let me go ahead and get that right
quickly I probably just have to go over
to system global config and change my
editor here to tiny MCE and the reason
why I had to do that was because I
actually installed jce just to test it
out a couple minutes ago and then I
uninstalled it so that's why I have that
problem you guys shouldn't have that
problem but let's go over to article
manager again edit this article and by
default joomla actually comes with this
tiny MCE editor which really isn't a
great editor it actually strips some
tags and like validates your HTML like
it lands up that your article over here
might not look like you want it to look
like because this editor actually takes
some of the HTML tags away so paragraphs
and headings are fine but there are
certain tags that this editor doesn't
like and then it just strips them away
okay so if you're ever putting divs and
stuff in here it gets really complicated
okay
and what I'd like to do is actually just
get rid of this editor and install jce
so we're gonna go ahead and click on jce
click the install button and this should
actually run the Joomla install so this
is going to take a couple minutes but
once it's done Joomla or jce is going to
be installed into Joomla okay and
actually just want to close this article
for now okay so just while that was
installing something to do okay and
depending on how slow your internet is
this might take a while so I'm actually
just gonna pause this okay it's done so
once the plugin is finished installing
you're gonna have a message over here
that says
the install was complete or completed
successfully okay and you're gonna have
some information about the plugin you
just installed which in this case is jce
and a whole bunch of other stuff okay
and check that this worked I can click
on components and you can see I've got
jce editor added to my components now if
you didn't install this plugin it's not
going to appear there until you actually
install jce okay but what I want to do
now is actually just go over to my
global config and I want to change my
editor so the default editor I wanted to
be jce and if I go ahead and click Save
and close that is going to make it so
that everyone that logs in to Joomla
will be using the jce editor to edit
articles or modules in Joomla so let's
go over to my first article over here
and as you can see we now have a very
different editor appearing in our or on
our page okay so there's a whole bunch
more options over here if I want to
toggle over to view the code I can go
ahead and hit that button and now we've
got our code accessible so we can really
easily write code over here as well I'll
just paste code in that's what I do
usually okay and taking a look at the
front-end obviously there's a lot more
buttons here so it's a lot easier for
someone who doesn't know HTML to
actually update content on their website
and that's why I really like to install
jce in every single webpage or every
single website that I do in Joomla I
will always install jce and pretty much
everyone does that's why it's a very
popular plugin and I'm gonna go ahead
and click Save and close now and that is
actually how to install a plug-in in
Joomla and that's all I have for you
