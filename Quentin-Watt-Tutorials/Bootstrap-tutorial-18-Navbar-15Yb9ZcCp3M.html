here and welcome to tutorial number 18
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to use the bootstrap navbar
component and if you take a look at this
navbar real quick you'll notice that it
actually reuses a lot of elements that
we've already spoken about and quite a
few other tutorials so first of all the
search is actually a form which we made
use of or we talked about forms in
tutorial number 11 so yeah like we've
already learned how to code these
elements from scratch and what those
classes do and so on then we have this
navigation because this is a nav bar
which we spoke about in the previous
tutorial and we have dropdowns which we
spoke about not only in the previous
tutorial but the tutorial before that
and yeah like these are all like certain
elements that we'd have to recode in
this tutorial if I coded this from
scratch so to save a lot of time instead
of coding all of this from the beginning
I'm going to go over to the bootstrap
website get bootstrap comm and I just
want to scroll all the way up to the top
here so you guys can see where I am but
basically go over to get bootstrap and
click on the components link and that's
going to give you a menu on the side
where you can pick one of the components
so you can see Wells are here panels are
here a lot of components that I've
spoken about in the previous tutorials
like drop downs and so on they're all
here but let's take a look at this nav
bar so I'm going to scroll down until I
can see the code and you can see that
this is actually quite a lot of code to
make one little nav bar with a few links
and again like I said it reuses a lot of
elements that we've worked with before
everything like from that unordered list
down to this ending and already list
down here is all old code its code we've
used before its code that I've explained
before I'm not gonna like go through it
again so instead let's just copy all of
this and I'm gonna paste it in my text
editor and yeah this is what I've got
and I'm going to explain instead of like
explaining all of these things over
again I'm just going to explain like our
outer container this top part and this
outer container here so if we take a
look at this let's just space it out
better yeah like this is all stuff we've
spoken about so let me just contract
those or make them smaller so that they
take up less space let's go form form
cotton clothes okay I know what it lists
there we go great so like I said this is
stuff that we've spoken about before and
I don't need to explain all of that
again but let's take a look at these
elements basically from the top down and
now that I've got this in here I might
as well just hit save go back to my
browser and hit refresh so that you guys
can see that we're starting with the
menu brand new again and you notice that
it moved out a little bit so it's not
scented and the reason for that is
because I change the class over here so
we have a nav element which has a class
of nav bar and nav bar defaults that
brings through this background color it
brings through the drop shadow that's
what those are there for then we have a
div with a class of container fluid and
that just tells our navbar to take up
the entire width of the browser but I
could change that to container and like
you guys all should actually know this
by now but yeah container has a max
width and then gives padding on the
sides then we have
inside of this a div with a class of
navbar header and you can see above this
div we have a comment that says brand
and toggle are grouped for better mobile
display so what the heck does that even
mean and I'll show you let's go over to
the browser I'm gonna jump into my
mobile mode or mobile display and you
can see we've got brand and we've got a
toggle button
so Brandon toggle right and so they are
grouped like this so that when you are
on a phone all you see is the brand and
you see this button and when you click
on the button the rest of the menu drops
down so the menu is not taking up a lot
of space on a mobile device that's what
it's there for
and the way we do that is we create this
div inside of our container and we give
that a class of navbar header and then
inside of that div you can see we have
one button so this is all one button
guys I know it's a lot of elements right
here but that's one button and that is
our toggle button so you can see that we
have a bunch of spans inside here so
this span has a class of s our only
which stands for screen reader only and
that is toggle navigation and that just
is there for people with disabilities
like who can't read that have screen
readers reading to them basically the
screen reader will tell them that this
is a button to toggle the navigation
whereas the rest of us kind of know this
international hamburger symbol I guess
it's called
with the three bars so the way bootstrap
does that is it makes use of these three
spans with a class of icon dash bar and
then it makes those little bars so that
is what those are there for and you'll
see that this button actually has a
quite a lot of attributes right so we've
got data toggle and I think you guys
have kind of seen this before
where
we use data toggle on a drop-down as
well so you click on the drop-down and
it toggles this unordered list inside of
it to show and hide and so that's what
this button is doing as well it has a
class of data toggle which is set to
collapse and so it knows that it needs
to collapse something or a div and then
you've got data targets and here it
references an ID and we'll see the same
ID over here in this bottom div so this
is our second part of our navigation
remember it's the if we're in mobile
display it's this part down here so that
is our second part sorry guys I'm gonna
have to have last water huh yeah my
throat was starting to close up right
there but we have the second part over
here which is also getting hidden and
displayed very much like a drop down so
that is what those attributes do and
then if you look below this button we
also have a link and this could be text
over here we're using text in this
example but you could use an image and
that could be an image of your logo and
that's going to display in the menu at
the top over here and yeah that is this
top part explained and that's what it
does and then we have the bottom part
over here so the only new part is this
div which has all of these classes and
that ID remember this ID and that ID are
linked and I explained why and then the
rest of these are just classes to make
sure that the nav collapses or hides in
a mobile device and yeah from here on to
here we've already talked about so that
is kind of well I don't want to say it's
all I have this too
because there is one more thing I can
show you and that is if we take a look
at this navbar there are options for
fixed to top and there are options to
fixed to bottom and these are really
just one class if you want your navbar
at the bottom of your page or if you
want your navbar fixed to the top of
your page you can copy those classes and
you can add them in to the nav element
over here as a third class and when you
save that and go back over to your
website and refresh you can see right
now my nav has jumped down to the bottom
so it is fixed to the bottom because
that's the class I chose and then I can
also change this to fixed top and that
is going to fix the navigation to the
top so when I scroll if I had a lot of
content in my browser when I scroll the
navbar would stay fixed to the top of
the page and yeah I guess that's all I
have for this tutorial so thank you for
