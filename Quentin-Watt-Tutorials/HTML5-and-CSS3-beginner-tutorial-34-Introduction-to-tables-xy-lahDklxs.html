here and welcome to tutorial number 34
in the HTML and CSS series and in this
video seeing as we've finally taken care
of our layout I want to talk about
tables so now that we have this this is
actually done on purpose by the way now
that we've taken a look at how to make a
website layout I'm going to show you
guys how to use table and the reason why
I am showing you tables afterwards is
because there was a time with web
development especially like in the early
2000s and you know even up until five
six years ago people were using tables
to lay out their website and it is a
practice that you still see happening
today there are still people doing it
today not good practice but it's just
how they were taught how to do it so
they carry on doing it this way but the
problem is using a table to layout a
website in other words to make like
columns to make things appear next to
each other is absolutely absolutely
incorrect and you should never do it but
yeah there were people who just when
they were learning web development
that's the way people decided to do
things at the time because floating and
clearing stuff in CSS was maybe just a
little bit tricky or didn't really work
when it came to cross browser
compatibility and stuff like that so
yeah so let's take a look at how to
create a table and I've gone ahead and
clear everything out of my index file
I've also kid all of my CSS away and in
fact we're not even to be doing CSS in
this tutorial so probably not going to
use this all right and then in my
browser you can see I've got nothing
here right
so let's go ahead and add in a table to
our website and you do that by opening
up a table tag right so that tells HTML
told the browser okay we want to make a
table the next thing you need to do is
Table tables consist of rows which go
across and columns which go down right
so we need to make a table row which is
the TR tag so TR sense the table row go
ahead and add one of those and then
inside of the row you can go ahead and
start adding columns so to make a column
you add TD which I think stands for
table data or yeah I don't know maybe
there might be another word for it but
table data is how I remember it
right so this means that will now have
one row with one column inside of it and
I think that's going to be a pretty
boring table so let's go ahead and copy
the table data and I just add a few more
make sure you add the table data is all
inside of a table row so that we have
basically now three columns in one row
right and then you can go ahead and
actually copy these down as well so now
you can have three rows with three
columns and let's let's make it a table
with some information about people so
the first column could be the person's
name the second column could be their
citizenship so where they come from and
the third column could be I don't know
how much money they have I guess right
so yeah that would be three columns in a
table let's go ahead and add in two
people underneath this so I'm going to
go ahead and add someone's name so
basically what happens here is this
table data is going to be aligned
underneath this table data and this
table data is going to be under
underneath this one so all the first
ones kind of line up then all the second
ones kind of line up and then all the
third ones kind of
so let's go ahead and add Quinton what
Citizenship South African money zero
right and then we can go ahead and add a
next person so let's go Sean coolly
citizenship Namibian actually he isn't
but anyway for the sake of this tutorial
money let's go
twenty South African Rand right so that
saves us now take a look at what this
looks like in the browser and you can
see we've got a table showing up here
it's just kind of maybe a little bit
small and usually when you have a table
you'd expect there to be some kind of a
border or something but yeah this table
doesn't have any of that so if you want
to create a border on a table you need
to add an extra attribute here so you
can say a border equals one and that's
just going to make a border of one pixel
all right so let's come back here and
refresh and now you can see that
everything is actually laid out with the
table cells is what the main you might
know them as right so we've got these
these two people but now the problem is
these are our headings and this is just
normal data and now we can't tell the
difference between the heading of our
table and the actual data of our table
so we might want to make our headings
displayed differently and actually HTML
has taken care of that for us so they've
given us something called a th tag which
stands for table header and basically
that can just replace all the table
data's in the first row and that way we
have our headings so that's come or did
I say that just make sure I save come
back here and hit refresh and now you
can see that our headings display in a
little bit more of a bold fashion
so yeah basically we have the headings
displaying a lot more clearly right
there are better ways to style tables
and we'll definitely be taking a look at
that in the next video but for now just
make sure that you know how to display
tables with HTML right and another
comment that I got on some of the older
tutorials was somebody was confusing
HTML tables with CSS are not CSS SQL
tables sequel tables and HTML tables and
sequel tables are totally totally
different things so SQL we haven't
learned about that on my channel yet I
don't have any tutorials on that but
sequel tables or SQL tables however you
want to pronounce that word basically
store data on a server in a database
somewhere
whereas HTML tables are used for
displaying data and you don't have to be
pulling data from an SQL table to
display it with an HTML table but yeah
you can just simply hard code the data
in like we did with HTML or statically
code the data and that's probably a
better word and yeah have the data show
up in a table just like this and so I'm
going to end the tutorial up there but
if you guys want to come back and check
out the next tutorial we'll take a look
at how to style a table and make this
look a little bit more pretty because
right now it's kind of like nasty
looking and I'll see you guys in the
next video
