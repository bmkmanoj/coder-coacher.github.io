here and welcome to my very first
bootstrap tutorial and if you guys are
regular viewers then you'll probably
notice that this is my very first video
using a Mac so woohoo yeah I got a Mac
it's hats pretty awesome and yeah I know
I posted this on Facebook the other day
and the first comment that I got was yay
we finally get tutorials in OS X so I
had to that guy who was so keen to have
tutorials in our XS o sx wow that's
quite a tongue twister to that guy who
who left that comment yeah we finally
have some tutorials in OS X so yeah
enough about that you guys are here to
learn about bootstrap and before we get
started I actually just want to say one
last thing and that is if you want to
follow along with this tutorial series
you're gonna need a good understanding
of HTML and CSS so if you guys haven't
learned about HTML or CSS in the past
you need to go back and watch my
tutorial series on that so if you go to
my youtube channel and by the way that
is youtube.com slash Quinton what I will
leave a link in the description below
and scroll down to the html5 and css3
beginners playlist there you'll be able
to learn HTML and CSS and then you'll be
good to go for this bootstrap series
okay and if you guys already have a bit
of experience in HTML then let's get
started talking about all the bootstrap
ee stuff so first of all what is
bootstrap bootstrap is a front-end
framework that it was created to make
building responsive websites a much much
easier task and the idea behind
bootstrap is basically that you connect
some bootstrap CSS files and some
bootstrap JavaScript files to your
website and then you just add a bunch of
classes to your HTML and your elements
or your at your website
instantly becomes responsive okay so of
course if you guys still want a very
custom look to your website you still
need to add your own CSS files I just
want to mention that so basically the
purpose of bootstrap is just there to
give you a really strong or a really
great foundation for a responsive
website but you should still go ahead
and add your own CSS to make the website
look awesome so that when people come to
your website they're actually like wow
this is the best website I've ever seen
because you actually spend some time
creating it and you didn't just use
bootstraps built in theme because if you
did that it's going to look like every
other bootstrap website on the Internet
and people are going to get kind of
bored with it so I just wanted to
mention bootstrap is just there for a
foundation and it's up to you to build a
really or to design a really great
looking website okay so let's take a
look at a quick bootstrap demo and I'm
going to go over to this tab over here
in Firefox and yeah this is a demo that
I built using bootstrap so I've included
a menu over here and this is actually
our logo and the menu is actually fixed
which is quite nice so something that's
very easy to do in bootstrap all you
have to do is add a class you don't have
to type any CSS or anything like that
and the greatest thing about this is if
I go to Firefox and I use tools web
developer and in responsive design view
which happens to be alt or option
command M so I'm going to go ahead ahead
and hit that keyboard shortcut and then
you can see the website is actually
responsive so this is what the website
would look like on a phone screen at 320
pixels and then this is what it looks
like on a desktop so it's pretty amazing
and yeah bootstrap is just full of this
responsive functionality so if we take a
look further down the page you can see
that I start talking about the
responsive grid
here in my demo and this is something
I'm going to be explaining a lot more
and in a lot more detail later on in the
series but basically bootstrap is made
out of this thing called the responsive
grid that's like the whole core behind
bootstrap and bootstrap basically uses
these twelve columns - it basically
gives you the option of having twelve
columns okay and you can use as many of
those columns as you want so over here
I'm using four columns and four or
twelve divided by four is three so
that's why we have these three columns
all three are made in two different
colors just so you can see the
difference and yeah basically these
columns then expand to fit the grid
which starts here and ends here and we
could also make the grid fluid which
means that this grid could actually
start from whether window or the browser
starts on either side so we won't have
this big white margin but yeah that's
just something that I will be explaining
in further detail later on and the next
thing you can see is that we can
actually nest the grid so we can have
grids inside of grids which is pretty
awesome and yeah then we can also take a
look at responsive tables all of that's
going to be in the tutorial series later
on and we've got the option of having
unstyled lists and list groups we've
also got all these really awesome
buttons that bootstrap provides
responsive forms which are amazing
because if you take a look at this now
it takes up the whole container right
now and if I go ahead and alt control M
and scroll down to that responsive form
you can see that now it would take up
the phone screen and the labels and the
inputs are actually on two different
lines whereas on the desktop they were
all in one line just like that so you
can see that it's a very tidy looking
form as well so bootstrap gives that
functionality to us where we just add a
bunch of classes and
boom our forms look nice and tidy okay
and one of the last things I'm going to
show you guys is that bootstraps
actually got quite a bit of built-in
JavaScript functionality as well and it
actually makes use of jQuery to do this
so we're also going to be doing a little
bit of jQuery we're actually just going
to add the jQuery file that's all we're
going to do and bootstrap really takes
care of the rest
so if I go ahead and I click on this
button under modal's you can see that
I've got this modal window popping up
over here I thought this was absolutely
fantastic that we can actually open
modal's with bootstrap hours I was
actually amazed by this feature I don't
know if any of you guys are but this
definitely amazed me okay and I'm going
to go ahead and close that now and we've
also got like the show/hide feature
which I'll I'll show you guys later on
in the series but basically we can click
on a button and hide and show divs and I
didn't have to code any JavaScript to do
this all I did was included bootstraps
JavaScript file
and jQuery and then I just added a class
and bam it worked just like that no
scripting on my end okay so these are
all things that we're going to be
learning in this tutorial series and
that's all I have for you guys in this
video so as always don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
