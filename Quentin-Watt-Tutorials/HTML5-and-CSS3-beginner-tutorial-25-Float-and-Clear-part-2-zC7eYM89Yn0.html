in here and welcome to tutorial number
25 and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how it floats and clear
two boxes
so once the left and one to the right we
often use float and clear to create
columns and stuff like that and you know
basically like I said in a previous
tutorial float and clear can be used for
many things so this is what we ended the
last tutorial off with and you can see
that we used float to float an image
into the corner of some text right so
I'm gonna go ahead and just clear all of
that code out of my CSS I'm also going
to clear all of that code out of my body
and let's take a look at float and clear
part two right so like I said I want to
create a box to the left and then a box
to the right so let's create a div and
I'm gonna give this div a class of box
box one and then I'm also gonna copy
that div and move it over move over to a
new line and call that one box too so
we'll say that box one is the left side
and we'll say that box two is the right
side save this now come back over the
browser hit refresh and you can see
we've got our left side and we've got
our right side but right now they're not
displaying on the left and the right
instead they're displaying one above the
other so let's give this a little bit of
styling I'm gonna select box one by its
class and I'm gonna give it a border of
four pixels solid red I'm also gonna
give it a height of 400 pixels and we
can do the same thing for box too so let
me copy and paste that down here box to
save come back yeah hit refresh and
let's change that border to blue just so
we can see what's going on a little bit
more clearly so like I've told you guys
many times in the past divs always
extend
to take up the full width of the browser
that is until you float them right so
let's float left and for the other one
let's float that right right
and once you float a div like this it
loses its width
so let's come back and hit refresh and
now you can see we've got our left sign
on the left and we've got our right side
on the right and the width has become
Auto so basically it's made itself as
wide as the content inside of the div is
right and it's the same thing on this
side here as well so basically if you
want these divs to take up 50% and 50%
you could come back here and give this a
width of 50% and then you go over to the
next one and give that a width of 50%
save this and hit refresh and now you
can see with a little bit of problem
because they're not displaying next to
each other anymore we don't have our
left side on the left and our right side
on the right and that is a bit of a
problem but the reason why that I came
across is because if I inspect that in
Firebug and I hover over this element
you can see that box 1 has a border of 4
pixels on the left it's also got a
border of 4 pixels on the right and then
it's got its width over here in the
actual element so what that means is our
elements is 50% width which in this case
happens to be 712 pixels plus 4 on the
Left plus 4 on the right so it basically
makes this element more than 50% of the
width and then it also makes this
element more than 50% of the width so
each one of them is more than 50% now
they're too big to fit next to each
other if that makes sense you can you
can
see that overlapping happened just over
there right there too big to fit next to
each other so the right side drops and
displays below the left and we don't
want that so a simple solution might be
to just make that a little bit smaller
forty-nine percent and then make that
one a little bit smaller as well come
back here refresh and now we've got our
left side on the our left side on the
left and our right side on the right but
we don't know how big this spacing is
gonna be I mean if I resize the browser
that's facing you get bigger or smaller
depending on what the width of the
browser is so that's sometimes it's not
really the best solution let's go back
here make the box one 50% and box to 50%
again and another way to get rid of
something like this is to just not use
borders so let's make those both zero
pixels or we could just remove the line
either way all right and come back here
refresh and now we've got both of these
to the left and to the right and there's
actually no spacing between those so
okay one way I could do this is inspect
element and now you can see left side or
box one goes all the way to touching the
right hand side of the box and then the
right-hand side also touches the
left-hand side of the box so there's no
spacing between the two of these and an
easier way to see that might be to just
add a background of red to box one and a
background of blue to box to right so
let's come back in here refresh these
boxes are displayed pushed up against
each other sometimes you might want to
have a little bit of spacing over here
and you might want to determine how big
that spacing is so in this case let's
say I want 30 pixels between these two
boxes well again if I come back over to
Box 1 and I give this a margin right of
30 pixels come back here I'll save this
and come back over the browser and hit
refresh boom
box 2 is now back below box 1 instead of
next to each other and the reason for
that again
inspect element you can see that box 1
now has a margin on the right of 30
pixels so again it's bigger than 50%
it's bigger than the width that you were
trying to allow it to be and therefore
they don't fit next to each other
anymore so what I'm trying to say here
is borders and margins and padding's
contribute to the overall width of your
element and if you add borders and
modest margins and padding's you might
have this problem where when you're
trying to float things to the left and
to the right they don't fit and then
they drop down below each other so you
need to work away around that and I find
one of the solutions in doing that is to
not add borders or modern margins or
pairings anything to the parent elements
but rather to create a child element
within the div so in this case let's go
over to box 1 will indent these little
bits of text and I'm gonna place them
within another div and we'll give that a
class of inner box
right so let's copy and paste that text
into there and get rid of that spacing
and we can do the same thing with the
right-hand side
and now if I come back here
refresh we've got these two next to each
other but like I said I wanted to have
30 pixels of spacing between these two
so to do that let's get rid of the
background colors and the borders and
we'll do the same with number two and
then we can select the children inside
of these elements so let's go box one
and then we'll select the inner box
inside of box one so in well now what
we're doing is instead of selecting this
element we're selecting this element
spoken about child classes before so
that's exactly what happens here or
child selectors and let's give that a
background of red and we'll do the same
for box two box 2 s in a box we'll make
that or have that with the background of
blue and now they're displaying next to
each other they've lost the height
reason why is because the height was
given to the parent and the parent now
long that no longer has a background
color so you might want to take that
height out and put that down here as
well if you're expecting to have the
height and then all let's just save and
refresh all right so now that they've
got their Heights back but I want that
spacing here so now in a box of box one
can have a margin right of 30 pixels and
that's gonna give it that little bit of
space what that does mean is that box 1
is now smaller than box 2 so you might
want to actually give this a margin
right of 15 pixels and then copy that
down to the next one and give that any
margin left of 15 pixels and that will
keep them exactly the same size with
that spacing in the middle so you could
do it that way
are other ways you could take care of
this as well and yeah there's many
different ways to get get around this
problem right so it just depends on how
you want to do things and what the
ultimate goal or look for you is gonna
be but like I said there are many uses
for this because sometimes you might
want to have a paragraph of text over
here and then an image to the right we
might want to have an image to the left
and some paragraph of text to the right
so it all depends on on what it is
you're trying to do and yeah we will be
taking a look at more examples of this
in future there won't be specifically
dedicated to floating clear but
hopefully we'll use a practical example
somewhere and you'll get to see exactly
how this all works I just want to send a
shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain
