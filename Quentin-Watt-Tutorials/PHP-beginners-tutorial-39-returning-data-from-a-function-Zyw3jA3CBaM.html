here
and welcome to tutorial number 39 and in
this tutorial I am gonna show you guys
how to return data from function okay so
you guys might use this in a case where
you don't want your function itself to
handle the outputs so instead maybe
you'd prefer your function return the
value that you could use somewhere else
in your algorithm or in your code and
then output a value later on okay so
that's what I'm going to show you guys
how to do but before we get started with
that I just want to mention to you guys
that I do have a Twitter account and I
do have a Facebook page for the
programmers Creed so if you guys want to
get social with me if you guys just want
to chat or if you guys have any
questions go ahead and like this page
and follow me on Twitter the links are
in the description of every single one
of my videos and maybe I can help you
guys out so I just felt like I needed to
mention that so let's go back to just
tutorial 39 we've got nothing so far and
let's actually make a function that is
useful so I'm gonna make a function and
I'm gonna call my function adder because
it's gonna add two numbers together so
it's going to take two arguments and I'm
going to call the first arguments Arg 1
and I'm going to call the second
argument
Arg 2 for argument 1 and argument 2 so a
very creative naming system there and
all this function is going to do is add
argument 1 two arguments to so we're
going to make a new variable in here
called sum and I'm going to set that
equal to r1 plus Arg 2 forgot the dollar
sign okay cool
and normally what I would have done in
my previous tutorials is actually echo
out some in here but like I said I don't
want the function to actually handle the
output because we're gonna make a
function that we can use a few times
without actually having the function
output anything so we can use the the
return value of this function somewhere
else in our code so instead of doing
echo I'm actually gonna write this line
of code I'm gonna say return sum and
this is basically the whole points of
the tutorial that one line or actually
two words return and then the variable
we are returning so how easy was that
the tutorials pretty much done except we
just need to actually output this value
and or do something with it now put it
okay so I'm gonna make a new variable
and I'm gonna call this variable apples
and now I can actually call this
function to give my variable apples
value so I'll go ahead and say apples is
equal to adder and I'll add in my two
arguments will make it 12 and 4 not 54
just four okay
and now if I can explain to you guys
what's gonna happen here we're basically
calling our function adder and we're
giving the values of 12 and 4 so 12 and
4 to these two arguments so 12 will be R
1 R 1 and 4 will be R 2 and what happens
there is 12 and 4 actually added
together to our new variable called sum
and then we're returning the value of
sum which means that 16 because 12 + 4
16 is being returned and that return
value is actually going to be stored in
our new variable called
apples okay so now we could go ahead and
use Apple somewhere else in a code like
we could maybe just take apples and
subtract it from something or add apples
to something else and we could do a
whole bunch of other stuff with this new
variable here but just to prove to you
guys that apples is indeed equal to 16
I'm gonna go ahead and echo apples so
let's go ahead and save this now and
click refresh and as you can see we have
returned the value to our new variable
called apples and printed it out
so how awesome is that
and that's not even all that we have for
this tutorial yet because I want to show
you guys something else okay because we
didn't actually handle the output in
this function I can go ahead and use
this function a number of times so I
could make another new variable here and
I could call this variable oranges and
let's say I wanted oranges equal to
another two numbers then I could use my
add a function again and I could go
ahead and say five and six and so now
oranges would be equal to 5 plus 6 but
our function is actually handling all
this code for us so we're not having to
retype all of this code like we would
have to do if we wanted to add 12 and 6
together and 5 and 6 together and so on
okay and I could go ahead and do this
again I could use this function and one
last time and let's stick to calling
them fruit so we'll just say banana no
no and we'll set that equal to a des of
what two numbers can we put in here ten
and eight probably okay and now when we
echo this out we could echo out apples
and it's probably get better just to
append on some breaks yeah not a break
but space so apples oranges and put
another spacing yeah it's probably
better actually that we put in a break
rather break break and we'll append on
the last one which was banana spelt a
little bit funny okay and now when we
save this and click refresh you can see
we've got 16 11 and 18 so what we've
effectively done here is use the same
code in a function three times so
instead of typing sum is equal to this
and that and the sender three times we
actually just used the function and I
know this is just a really simple
example but this is gonna come in handy
a lot later on because we'll be able to
reuse code very complex code that we
write in a function a lot a lot of times
or a few times I don't know okay
well this isn't an English tutorial it's
a coding tutorial so if my language is a
little bit funny then forgive me but
that's actually all I have for you guys
in this video so obviously don't forget
to subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share the video it's
really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys on the social networks
don't forget to add me on Twitter and
