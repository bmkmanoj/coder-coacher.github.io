yeah and welcome to my video on bad
reasons people choose to become
developers and yeah let's face it you
are going to be asked this question at
some point in your life if you're
choosing to become a developer it might
be before a job interview it might be
before getting into a college or getting
in getting a bursary for a college or
something like that people might ask you
why do you want to be a developer and if
you answer with some of the reasons that
I'm about to mention now those are bad
answers and I'll tell you why okay so
the first answer or the first bad reason
is money right everybody wants to make a
lot of money these days I think like
we're all kind of programmed Society and
program that's this way that we all want
to be rich and we all want to be at
least fairly well-off I get it but if
you choose money as the reason you want
to become a developer that is a little
bit of a problem right because first of
all you can make a lot of money doing
pretty much anything you wanted these
days I mean you could make a lot of
money being a lawyer a doctor a youtuber
an artist whatever there are so many
different ways to become a millionaire
why would you choose development there
kind of needs to be another reason other
than money and hopefully that reason is
that you like being a developer that you
enjoy coding and you enjoy sitting
behind your desk because that is all
part of becoming a developer yeah the
reason why I'm choosing money as like
the main reason you want to become a
developer is a bad thing is because you
might start the job or start the career
as a developer or even you know start
studying and realize you don't actually
like it and it's kind of boring or
uninteresting
and then you've wasted like a lot of
money trying to study or you've wasted a
lot of your time focusing on a career
that is not going to make you happy and
at that point you're probably going to
get a little bit depressed with your job
and not want to go to work
and these things happen right - to a lot
of people and yeah you're just not going
to live a happy life which means that as
soon as something better or better comes
along where somebody offers you a little
bit more money to do something else
you're going to immediately switch
careers and chase the money to do that
thing which means you're not really
going to grow in your in your field
you're not going to be able to grow and
move from being a junior developer to a
senior developer or something like that
and like a pretty good example of this
is in the past I've asked people hey why
do you want to become a developer and
then they'll tell me well my aunties
uncles brother is a developer and you
earn X amount per year so I'd really
like to earn that much - and that kind
of stuff like is really really not a
good thing because like the difference
between you and that guy who's earning
$10,000 a year whatever is that they're
interested in their job they like their
job and you're just chasing it because
you wanted the same amount of money as
that person or you're just interested in
in it because you want to live the same
lifestyle that that person lives and
like yeah you're chasing the money and
the stuff or the things but you're not
actually chasing the job and if you're
doing that job in your heart's not in it
you are going to miss all those
promotions your employers will see that
you're actually not interested in doing
the stuff that you have to do so yeah
you might miss out on a promotion you
might miss out on becoming a team leader
or a manager or moving up the ladder the
corporate ladder at some point so yeah
so I guess at the end of the day what
I'm trying to say here is there is still
an entire month between this salary and
this salary so everything in between all
of that time that you have between
paychecks you're gonna have to spend
doing something that if you don't like
doing any of that stuff yeah you're
probably not going to be a very happy
person you're not going to be a very
happy employee and it's not even gonna
be related to your salary it's going to
related to the fact that you don't like
what you're doing reason number two is
yeah you're just you've just watched a
movie you've just watch a video of
something and you're really really
excited you're inspired to become a
developer I mean look I get it you've
just watched Mark Zuckerberg go from
being a student in a dorm room to being
a multi-billionaire at the end of the
video it's exciting because you kind of
also want to invent something and you
also want to be a multi-billionaire you
want to be rich and it's going to be
super exciting to have like a million
people use your platform and like people
get really excited and they kind of
message me in that moment and often I
have to shut people down and be like
listen I'm not going to help you build I
think is it already exists and a lot of
the time it does and I guess the
underlying premise of this is that most
people are still more excited about the
money and trying to become a billionaire
then you know actually building
something or inventing something so that
excitement kind of fades away of the
time after you realize that it isn't as
easy as the movie makes it has to be and
in a lot of cases people have overlooked
the like fact that their idea or
original idea already exists I can't
even tell you how many times people have
contacted me not even just for YouTube
but actually through the company that I
work for with an entire brief of what it
is that they want to make and I look
through the brief and I'm like did you
know that this is exactly what LinkedIn
does what's going to make your website
different from LinkedIn and they're like
oh no but our website does this and I'm
like well LinkedIn does that exact same
thing and so often yeah in that
excitement because you've just watched
some inspirational video you haven't
really taken the time to consider then
your idea isn't actually your idea
you're kind of just stealing it from
some way and you're gonna need kind of
something else behind that to make it a
little bit more exciting or you know a
little bit more original so that people
would actually use your product and I
guess another point I can make here is
if you don't really
know anything about being a developer
but you're getting excited by videos
like the social network or code.org
YouTube videos which finally that really
inspirational and they're really good
it's just that I think some people get
inspired by the wrong stuff when they
punch out video so you like you get
inspired by that video and then you get
to the point where you actually have to
do the work and you're like oh no it's
actually kind of difficult isn't there
an easier way and you try be a little
bit lazy about doing the work and so
yeah you land up trying to just like
push the work onto other people because
you weren't actually inspired to become
a developer because you wanted to do
development you were inspired to become
a developer because you wanted a nice
salary or you wanted free lunch at
Google or you wanted to work in an
office that has like awesome graffiti on
the walls at Facebook or something like
that right but here's the thing if you
watch a video and you do get a little
bit excited and you do feel inspired to
become a developer then I'd say like
watch some free tutorials online take a
coding class learn what the difference
is between an if-statement and a switch
statement learn what a variable is learn
what a function is learn what objects
are and learn the difference between
certain languages or learn the
difference between JavaScript and PHP
and Ruby and Java like don't confuse
Java and JavaScript at the beginning and
yeah once you know the the difference
between all of these things and you're
still excited to be a developer then
maybe being a developer is your calling
but if you're only excited because the
money and you get to the hard stuff and
you're like ah actually I don't want to
do any of this
that is a bad reason for being a
developer and reason number three you're
good with computers right so I can't
stress to you how much of an
acquaintance this kind of topic is to me
but often people will ask me hey Quinton
what do you do for a living I'll say I'm
a web developer and if they have and
have no idea what that is they'll just
be like oh yeah you're good with
computers you can help me fix my
computer later or whatever
it's super annoying because computers as
it were is a very very large topic quite
a broad range of things so to say to
somebody like oh you're good with
computers can be quite annoying but yeah
if some other people are like
encouraging you to be a developer
because you're good with computers like
there is a difference between being able
to build your own PC and put in a
graphics card and be able to set your
computer to the correct graphics for a
certain game like there's a difference
between the hardware stuff and playing
games and actually being a developer so
just because you are good at hardware
and just because you are good at setting
up your computer for a game doesn't
automatically make you a good developer
and so like you kind of need to know the
difference between those two things so
this is something I see quite often
whether it be parents selling high
school kids or family members selling
nieces and nephews or you know just
people in general telling other people
like you're good with computers you
should try to take a look at development
you know like I think at some point if
you were really interested in doing it
you would have already started learning
you wouldn't need somebody to tell you
you're good with computers you should do
this and I'm not saying that this is
like an extremely extremely bad thing
I'm just saying that if people if you
give your reason when trying to get into
a college for this kind of thing or when
your reason for trying to get a job for
this kind of thing is I'm good with
computers that's a very very bad reason
because you need to have at least tried
it out at some point I guess what I'm
trying to say at this point is try the
free stuff first like try all the free
resources like YouTube and some of the
free resources on the internet and
decide if you actually like programming
or not decide whether it's for you or
not do this for about a month or so and
if after a month you decide that you
like it and you actually want to do it
then
invest time and money into actually
getting a job or growing a career in the
field but don't just like walk in to a
company store and try and get a job as a
programmer without actually having pride
at first I think that's one of the
greatest things about becoming a
programmer is that there are so many
free resources online and it's not
something that you really have to invest
a lot of money into to cry out before
you actually you know try getting into a
career and I think I'm going to end this
video off with maybe one good reason why
you should become a developer and that
is because you have tried it and you
liked it right like you should enjoy
doing the job and enjoying being a
developer involves first of all solving
problems so you're going to have to be
one of these people who like to solve
problems and by that I mean you need to
be one of these people who isn't just
going to give up when something gets
difficult because programming stuff can
sometimes be a little bit difficult and
if you're one of these people who simply
just wants to throw in the towel and
give up access again the work gets hard
then you kind of don't really have what
it takes to be a developer and also yeah
you have to be one of these people who
when you cannot figure out a problem you
have to be able to be one of these
people who enjoys spending a few hours
researching and learning stuff online so
that you can figure a problem out I
think there are quite a few people who
watch my videos who start learning how
to do something and then kind of just
throw in the towel and give up without
actually doing any research and as a
developer that is going to be one of
your biggest most important parts of
your job is learning and researching
stuff but you can figure out a problem
and yeah that is what I have you guys in
