here and this is tutorial number 30 and
in this tutorial I am going to speak to
you guys about linear gradients with
css3 now this is again something that is
new to css3 so if you're trying to get
this to work in an older browser then
it's more than likely not going to work
but as long as you're using this in
something that is up-to-date so if it's
Google Chrome or Firefox or the latest
version of Internet Explorer then this
should work just fine
okay so to save time I'm actually using
code from the previous tutorial which is
just a div with a class of rounded box
and it has the word apples inside of it
okay so not too difficult there and then
again
I've gone ahead and styled my div so
I've selected it by class which was
rounded box I gave it a width of 200
pixels I set the text to be aligned in
the center a padding of 50 pixels on the
top and on the bottom and then zero
pixels on the left and then again on the
right okay and border radius was
something that we learned about in the
previous tutorial which was just how to
round off your corners okay so basically
if you are if you have all of this code
written down then you should land up
with something that looks kind of like
this so run in Firefox oops
I ran my CSS sheet sorry run the HTML
page and there we go we've got the word
apples but I don't have a background
color okay so let's go ahead and just
throw in a random background color over
here and if you're going to use
gradients I would say that you guys
should probably just add in a background
color
for all the browsers that maybe don't
support gradients at least there's some
sort of a background color showing okay
so we can just set this equal to some
color blue I've got this in Photoshop
over here we'll just go ahead and grab
some light blue color and basically as
long as the browser doesn't support a
linear gradient you've at least got that
color showing so when I click refresh
over here you've got this light blue but
if we want to go ahead and make use of a
linear gradient then I'm going to go
ahead and say background image and then
we'll say linear gradient and like I
said this is new to css3 and this
actually takes a few properties okay the
first property is which direction you
want your gradient to go from okay so in
other words we can have a gradient start
at the bottom and work its way up to the
top or you can have the gradient start
from the top and go down to the bottom
so there are two different values you
could put in yet you could put two top
or two bottom okay so I'm going to go
ahead and actually just say a to top
because that's the direction I want to
go from the bottom to the top okay and
then I have to put in a bunch of colors
that I would like this gradient to have
in side of it okay so in other words we
want to start from a really dark blue
down here at the bottom so I go over to
photoshop again and just grab some
really dark blue and that should be fine
so let's go ahead and paste that in with
the hashtag don't forget about that and
then I will go ahead now and grab a
really light blue so let's grab that
and when I go over to Firefox or not
Firefox but notepad plus plus and just
paste that in we now have a gradient
that'll start at this really really dark
blue and then move over to that really
light-colored blue so let's go back now
to Firefox and click refresh and I hope
you guys can see this but we now have a
gradient that starts as a really dark
blue down here and fades up to a much
lighter blue okay and something I want
to show you guys about this is we can
use multiple colors so right now we've
only gone from a really dark blue to
really light blue but I could add in a
few other shades of blue in the middle
and get that gradient really looking
like a lot better so I'll go ahead and
grab a sort of medium colored blue and
then go back over here and before my
light blue
I just want to paste in that like medium
colored blue and we could probably
overdo this a little walk get somewhere
in between the in-between values and go
over here again and paste that just
before our light blue okay and now we
should have really dark blue kind of
lighter blue lighter and then the
lightest blue there is okay so if we go
over to Firefox and click refresh now oh
it changed the little not that you guys
might have seen that but it is possible
to do that so I just wanted to show you
guys that that was possible and
something else you can do with this as
well is you can decide well how much
space do you want each one of these
colors to take up okay so if I went to
my first my first color over here and I
set this equal to something like 50%
that means that this color will go up
50% of our box and then only start
fading in to the next color blue so if I
go ahead now and go over to Firefox now
and click refresh you can see we
definitely have quite a bit of a line in
here and that's because our dark blue
has gone from the bottom up to 50% of
the box and then only started fading to
the lighter blue okay and let's go ahead
and make this even bigger so let's make
it 80% and you'll probably see a very
definitive line so there we go now
you've got a much clearer line okay and
it's probably best if you're actually
just going to give that maybe like a
value of 20% and then this a value of
something like 40% and maybe this a
value of another 40% so 40% and the last
value you could leave something like 100
percent or something and it basically
takes up whatever space was left so we
have our first gradient go up 20% then
our next gradient and so on but of
course you guys can fiddle with those
values to get something that looks
really good I'm just going to show you
guys basically how to use the Selenia
gradient so that's all I have for you
