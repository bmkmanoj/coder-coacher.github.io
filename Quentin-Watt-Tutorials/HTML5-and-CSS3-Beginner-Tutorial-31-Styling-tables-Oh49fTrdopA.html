to tutorial number 31 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to show you guys
how to style your table so as you can
see I'm starting off with the exact same
table that we've had in the previous
tutorials and what I'm gonna do now is
I'm just gonna start off by removing
this border attribute because we can use
CSS to style that later and now I'm
going to click Save and we can actually
run this in Firefox just so you guys can
get an idea of what the default table
looks like so that's what it looks like
completely unstyled and now we can go
over to our CSS which i've already
prepared a CSS sheet over here and what
we can do now is obviously start styling
our table so we can go ahead and install
that and the first thing I actually want
to show you guys is how to add the
border in with CSS rather than using
that attribute so let's go ahead and
just add border and we'll set that equal
to one pixel solid and black awesome and
you could probably use whatever color
you want but it doesn't matter and now
the reason I wants to show you guys this
first is because borders don't actually
inherit down so there's not actually
going to be a border around every single
cell on our table we're just gonna have
a border around our table so watch this
BAM
okay so we only have a border around our
table as you can see it hasn't made a
border around every single cell which is
kind of annoying because when you look
at a table you do sort of wanna separate
each row or at least each cell so that
it's easier to read so what we could do
now is go back to notepad and because
we're using table data okay well here's
table data and there's table headers
okay we're gonna have to apply the
border to both
those cells and to do that we can just
go ahead and say table data and then
comma and table header and that will
apply the style rule to both of those
elements and we can probably just copy
that paste save and when you go back to
Firefox now and you click refresh now we
have this awesome table cell around
every single one of ourselves we've got
a border around every single table cell
sorry okay so that's pretty awesome and
it's kind of annoying though that
there's like this little gap between
each cell so what you can do now is if
you go back to your CSS and underneath
your table over here we can use the
border collapse property so border
collapse and if you set this equal to
collapse just like that and then save
this and go back to Firefox you can see
what happens now when I click refresh is
that little gap is actually going to
disappear so let's go ahead and click
refresh and as you can see we now have
just one solid border all the way around
every single one of our cells and that
is pretty cool but as you can see I've
got this a little bit of an issue here
and I know why this is it's because I
set my array span to 99 and the table is
not 99 rows long so let's go back here
and a row span we can just go ahead and
set that equal to two and we're gonna
save that and refresh you can see we now
have the border closing up properly
which is awesome okay so what you could
also do is use classes to make every
second row a different color and that
would make the table a little bit easier
to read for the user so what we can do
is go back to CSS and we can make our
two different classes so much
this class can just be yellow and was I
set the background color to yellow
and I'm actually just gonna copy this
and we'll just set the other one to
orange so the cutters are like sort of
similar but not the same let's go ahead
and save that and now we can go back to
Firefox wait I'm lying we have to go and
apply those classes to each row so we've
got our first row over here and we can
set this class equal to yellow and we
can set this next class equal to orange
and obviously we'll change again and
we'll set the next class equal to yellow
again and when we click Save and now we
can go back to Firefox and click refresh
and as you can see we now have rows that
now alternate in color so we've got like
a yellow growth in a orange row and it
would probably look better if these
columns weren't spanning over multiple
rows and then over the yellow row again
so that's just a one way of how to make
your table a little bit easier to read
for the user and that's pretty much all
