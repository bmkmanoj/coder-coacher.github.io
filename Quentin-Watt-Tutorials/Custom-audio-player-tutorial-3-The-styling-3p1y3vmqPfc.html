ania and welcome to tutorial number
three a hand in this tutorial we are
going to be taking a look at how to
create a heart of style our custom audio
player so right now we've got all this
contents over here and I realize you
guys probably can't see that because my
face is somewhere in this corner so let
me just hit enter there and what we need
to do now is actually go ahead and start
styling all this content so that it
looks like my example so this is pretty
much what my example looks like and this
is what our code looks like our content
looks like at the moment so we need to
get some styling rules in here to make
these two audio players look exactly the
same so let's go back to our CSS file
and as you can see mine is blank and the
first thing I want to do is start
styling my body and I want to give this
a background color of hashtag ten ten
ten and that is a background color that
is so dark gray that it almost looks
black so we land up having that very
dark background okay then I'm going to
select my wrapper and I'm still not
talking about jay-z or 50 cent by the
way we're actually talking about this
div tag over here which has an ID of
rapper and I'm going to give that a
width of 640 pixels and then I'm going
to give this a margin of 10 pixels Auto
okay and what this means is that we're
going to have a width of or yeah width
of 640 pixels for this entire rapper
which is the same size that I want my
audio player to be and then a margin of
10 pixels Auto just means that we've got
10 pixels on the top 10 pixels on the
bottom
so we've got that like spacing and then
left and right doesn't really matter
what goes on there as long as it's in
the center so just automatically give
them a margin that will ensure that this
wrapper is in the center okay so net
body wrapper the next thing we need to
do is style our nav tag so our nav tag
is is this tag over here and the reason
why we're going to be styling this nav
tag and not our audio tag is because
this audio tag doesn't even show up it's
like we don't see it it just loads this
file into here and we're going to use
JavaScript to play and pause this file
but we're going to use our navigation to
actually create our buttons etc or
create our custom audio player so let's
go ahead and actually style the snap and
the nav is basically what gives our
audio player this light background so
this light very light background there
that is our nav tag so we're going to
give that a background color of RGB 252
whoops 250 250
okay and that is the very light gray
almost white color that we see as our
background then I'm going to give this a
width of 640 pixels okay I'm also going
to give it a padding on the bottom so
padding bottom if I can spell correctly
padding bottom three pixels and what
this does is just give it a little bit
of space for our buttons so if I come
back here and click refresh you can see
we now have our dark background we've
got our light background for our nav and
we've got this little bit of padding at
the bottom of our buttons over here just
for that little bit of space you know
just so that our buttons on
pushed all the way to the bottom of our
nav okay then the next thing I want to
do now is style my default bar so if we
take a look at my example my default bar
is this dark grey bar at the top of our
navigation okay
so a default bar let me go ahead and
grab that
so default bar and I'm going to give
this a width of 640 pixels because as
you can see it stretches the entire
audio player it stretches the length of
the entire audio player so that is the
reason why I wanted to be 640 pixels
it's also going to need to be 640 pixels
because that is the measurement we're
going to be using in JavaScript later on
okay then position I'm going to set to
relative and relative is actually the
default positioning for this so it
doesn't matter it's not going to
actually change any display but the
reason why we're doing this is to avoid
a problem later on because whenever I
style my progress bar which comes after
this I'm going to change the positioning
of that so because the default bar is
the parent element I just I really don't
want to create problems for myself later
on so to avoid a problem I'm going to
just give this a position of relative
okay
then I'm going to give a background
color of 60 60 60 so 60 60 60 and I also
want to give this a height of 10 pixels
so probably should have done that a
little while ago and that is it okay so
if I come back and click refresh
now our an audio player is starting to
look a little bit more like this one
because now we have this default bar
here at the top okay the next thing we
want to do is start styling our pro
whereas bar so progress bar and if you
guys are unsure of what that is that is
the bar over here inside of our default
bar and that's actually the blue bar
that's going to move up as the video
plays so how are we going to style this
well oops we're going to give it a
position so position of absolute and the
reason why we're doing this is so that
we'll be able to dynamically change the
size but make sure that it's going to
stay within its parent and not actually
start like trying to move anywhere else
on the page or anything like that okay
so position absolute height we're going
to give this ten pixels and that means
that it is the same height as its parent
which is the default bar and then we're
going to also give this a background
color so background color of three four
oops
hashtag three four nine eight DB and
that is just a very like light ish color
blue and we can't see that at the moment
so let me go ahead and give this a width
of ooh oops a width of 100 pixels okay
and what this is going to do is just
make this blue bar appear for us over
here so that's where our progress bar is
going to appear and as it grows in
length or as the audio player audio file
plays then this is going to grow in
length or we might want to make it
shrink in length or something so we just
want to make sure that that's going to
appear but I'm going to set that back to
zero pixels
and click Save and when I click refresh
it now disappears so in other words it's
not going to show up until the file
audio file starts playing ok so now
we've got a few more things that we need
to do here and the next thing I want to
do is start styling my buttons so those
are these two buttons right here and I
want to get rid of that default color
that they have so let's select the play
button first okay and it has a default
background and we want to get rid of
that so I'm going to overwrite that by
giving that a background color that is
the same color as our navigation so
background color RGB 250 250 250 and I
left the zero out there so let's just
make sure that it looks the same as the
background we also want to get rid of
the border so border none' just to make
sure that the borders by default a
button has a board and we want to get
rid of that so we just want to make sure
that there's no border then we also want
to give this a height of 32 pixels and a
width of 32 pixels so that's the size of
our button lengthen width or height on
width okay then I want to give this a
background image so background image and
this is where things kind of get a
little bit tricky again because we're
going to be loading our image in from
this images folder over here and here is
my CSS file so because we're doing this
from CSS I need to go relative to where
my CSS file is so my CSS file is here
and you go back one file down the images
folder and select my image so to do that
it's going to be similar to our previous
video which was dot
dot slash which is back then we're going
to select the images folder and then I'm
going to select the image that I want to
use which is going to be play dot ping
okay and yes that's our background image
but by default background images tile
and we want to get rid of that so I'm
going to duplicate well actually no I'm
wasting my time doing that background
repeat' is what I want to get rid of and
I want to set this equal to no-repeat
okay and then I also want to grab my
background and change the positioning as
well so background position Center and
this is just going to make sure that the
background image is going to be in the
center of the actual button so now when
I come back here and click refresh you
can see I now have my play button
appearing exactly how I want it to be
and the mute button is basically going
to be a very similar kind of thing so we
can actually probably just copy that and
change this to mute and then I'm going
to just change the image that appears to
a speaker PNG instead of played or PNG
seeing as they are located in the same
place which is this folder right here so
speakers there and play is there come
back here now click refresh and voila
our our our navigation or our video
player is now pretty much complete
because do they not look exactly the
same
I'm not sure there's a little bit of a
margin margin difference there but
otherwise everything is fine but there
is one thing that we can share
change right now which is just as I
click on the button you will notice that
this button goes down to pixels and then
it goes up again so watch when I click
on the mute button as I hold it down it
changes position and that just really
makes it look or it really gives the
user some feedback like okay you're
pushing this button we can see that
because it's going down so yeah it just
adds to the user interactivity and the
way I'm going to do that is I'm going to
just select my mute button mute button
I'm also going to select my play button
so play button and I want to style them
both at the same time so I'm going to
have a comma over here but I want to
select them while they are active so I
need to make sure that I put my
semicolon and the word active and that's
just going to select them only while the
user is clicking down on them and we're
going to give them a position or
relative and a top of two pixels so this
just means that every time the user
clicks on a button it's going to bounce
down two pixels and then bounce back up
as soon as they let go of their mouse
okay and that is actually all we have
for this tutorial so yeah thank you guys
