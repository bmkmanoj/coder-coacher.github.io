here and this is a tutorial number eight
and yeah in this tutorial we are gonna
be taking a look at how to make our blue
bar jump from location to location so
whenever I click somewhere over here
I want that blue bar to move there and I
also want the audio to start playing
from there again if I want to click over
there then we want that blue bar to jump
back and start playing from back there
as well so to do that we're gonna have
to jump back over to JavaScript and I'm
gonna add an event listener so this
variable right here we didn't actually
need it in the previous tutorial but we
are gonna use it now so I'm gonna grab
that bar right there and I'm gonna add
an event listener to this so add event
listener and as always we're going to
listen for the click and I should
probably scroll that up so that maybe
this picture of me down here in the
bottom is not in a way okay so we're
gonna listen for the click then we're
going to call a function which I'm gonna
call clicked bar and then we're gonna
have the last argument set as false and
it pretty much is always false like I
said so don't worry about that and now
we're gonna scroll all the way down to
the bottom here and create our new
function so that function is clicked bar
because that's the function we're
calling here in that event listener and
obviously this is gonna be called
whenever the user clicks on that bar so
we're going to create this function now
and this function is going to take an
argument of E and don't worry about the
year yet okay I'll explain that in just
a second but let's take care of our
logic here and what I want to do is just
create an if statement to check if our
video is not ended yet so we only want
to call this function while the video is
playing so what if my track dot ended is
false so if my track don't ended not so
if my track has not ended yet
then let's go ahead and create some more
variable so I'm gonna save our mouse X
and this is gonna get the x position on
that bar wherever it was clicked so in
other words Y is up-and-down and X is
left and right so we're looking for
wherever the user clicked on the spa but
only the x value we don't need the Y
value okay so we're going to be grabbing
that over here so VAR a mouse X and
that's going to be equal to e dot page X
so this e variable over here this e
argument is actually going to bring
through a whole bunch of data and we're
not going to need any of that we're just
going to need the X or e page X okay so
even though it brings through like a
whole bunch of data the only value we're
using here is e page X and we're going
to subtract bar dot offset left okay and
the bar as you guys know is actually
this bar right here the dark grey bar
and this property offset left is
actually a property that belongs to this
bar and it's basically how far this bar
is offset from the end of the browser
over here so in other words it just
helps us determine that if you clicked
right here at the beginning of the bar
you would be clicking on zero because if
we didn't say - bar offset left you'd be
clicking like somewhere in the middle of
the page and we don't want
like a value that's somewhere in the
middle of the page we want our bar to
start at zero and then we want it to end
at 640 which is the end over here and
yeah like basically whenever whenever
we're looking at this bar we're looking
at a position of 0 over here and a
position of 640 over there and somewhere
in the middle would be like 320 or
something okay so just to get that clear
to you guys and then we're gonna create
another variable and I'll call this a
new time and new time is gonna be the
time that we want to jump to in our
audio track okay so we're gonna set that
equal to mouse x times my track dark
duration divided by bar sighs okay and
again this is sort of a mathematical
equation that's just going to determine
a new time for us so it's going to take
the track duration and divide it by the
bar size which is kind of going to give
us a percentage of where in time our bar
should be or our audio should be and
obviously we're just times in it by
mouse X so that's gonna give us our
actual time and then I'm going to take
my track dot current time so we're gonna
change the current time in our track
which means we're actually going to you
know skip through some time and we're
gonna set that equal to our new time
variable which we just created so we
found a new time that we have to set our
bar to and then we set our audio to that
time okay and the last thing we're gonna
do is progress bar dot style dot width
okay so we're just going to make that
blue bar all
so jump to the same point in time where
it should be and we're gonna say is
equal to Mouse X plus px and that has to
be a string so get those quotation marks
in there and this should work now so if
I just tidy that up a bit and we go back
over to Firefox click refresh I'm gonna
click play and now my song is playing if
I click on the end I have a bug okay
awesome so let me figure out how to fix
this and I'll get back to you guys okay
so I found the problem it was kind of
damn this my track dot current is
supposed to be my track current time I
was just talking to you guys so much
that I obviously didn't type the right
thing so yeah my bad click refresh here
play okay now let's try skip to the end
and now we skip to the end if we jump
back here then we'll jump back there so
we're able to jump around and if the
tracks paused we can still jump around
wherever we need to go so that is how we
create the the function for clicking on
our bar and actually changing the time
that way and that is all I have for you
