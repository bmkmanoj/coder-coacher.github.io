here and welcome to tutorial number two
and in this tutorial I just wanted to
give you guys a quick introduction to
cPanel so hopefully you followed along
with my previous series and you bought
shared hosting and you logged in to
cPanel and it looks something like this
if cPanel doesn't look exactly like this
you can switch themes so just make sure
that you're using the paper lantern
theme and then it looked it should look
mostly like this if for some reason
paper lantern is not available you're
probably using an old version of cPanel
so you might want to get your hosts to
just upgrade your version of cPanel or
move hosts to a better one or something
but yeah this is cPanel and you can see
on the sidebar over here we've got this
a bunch of different stats right and
these are stats that we are not really
going to care about we're not going to
come look at them every day but it's
just stuff to take note of right so disk
usage I mean if we reach our limit here
we're not going to be able to upload any
more file so we just need to make sure
that we monitor this when we're
uploading files that we're not you know
trying to upload too much stuff so that
our server space is full then we've also
got a counter for email accounts and
subdomains and SQL databases etc so this
is kind of just everything that you paid
for in your package should be showing up
over here and you can see that my domain
also appears so this is a domain that I
bought specifically for the series and
if you guys go to it right now it just
says Josie Corp com with this coming
soon page and depending on when you
watch this this page might actually
disappear we're going to upload
something there later on in the series
so yeah that is the sidebar explained
now let's take a look at all these
different panels
and some of the stuff is obviously
really obvious and then some things can
be a little bit confusing especially if
you're a beginner so you can see that
the first panel talks about files and
sometimes this might not be the first
panel because you can swap them around
and change them if you want to so I just
wanted to show you guys that but yeah
this is my file manager and file manager
is what we use to upload download zip
files and monitor files on our sites so
if you ever want to do anything with
files you'll go to the file manager and
I will be taking an in-depth look at
this in a future tutorial then you see
images over here and you think okay
that's where I would go to see my images
but no you actually see those in your
file manager anyway so images is really
just there to create thumbnails and
stuff not that I would ever use that I
don't think you guys will ever use this
either but it's there if you want it so
yeah and then I'm going to skip over
some of the stuff because directory
privacy just means you can block certain
directories or certain folders with a
password so you can password protect
them disk usage you can kind of see that
over here it's just how much usage
you're using or how much space you're
using and then I want to take a look at
FTP accounts and FTP connections so FTP
accounts if you guys don't know what FTP
stands for it's File Transfer Protocol
and this is what web developers used to
upload and download files more often
than we use the file manager just
because FTP is so much fast faster and
we don't have to like go through the
trouble of using the browser because
sometimes these things have like a max
upload size and you want to upload
something a little bit bigger or you
want to have the upload running in the
background then you can use an FTP
program like FileZilla and I'll talk
more about that when I get to that
tutorial but yeah FTP is actually the
real file upload and download
application or process that we will talk
about and then I've got some backup
Wizards and backup options so I can just
make backups of what's currently on my
server and then restore from that backup
if anything goes wrong like my website
gets hacked or something like that
then you can see we've got databases and
databases are something that we need for
WordPress and Joomla I don't think I've
ever explained databases to my audience
but I know a lot of you guys will
probably already know so yeah PHP
myadmin is the section where we get to
manage all the sequel stuff so we will
run queries or create tables and
everything like that in PHP myadmin
MySQL databases is just where we set up
a database and we could use the wizard
but I'm going to show you guys how to do
it the proper way with just this MySQL
database tab and we'll be doing that in
a future tutorial then we've got remote
MySQL and this is if you ever wanted to
set up a database on a different server
and then connect to it through here then
you could do that but to be honest you
get at an SQL or a sequel database with
your hosting package so most of the time
we're not going to make use of remote my
sequel then we've got email accounts and
this is where we get to set up new email
accounts set up email forward is like if
someone goes out of the office and you
want to set up a forwarder for Jon's
email to go to Sarah well John's on
holiday something like that is what you
would use in forwarders autoresponders
is like again when you're out of office
and you just want to let people know
you'd set up an autoresponder and we can
also set up a default address for when
somebody sends an email to an email
address that doesn't exist on your
domain so if someone try to send an
email to not exist at Josie Corp comm I
could
send that somewhere like I could forward
it to my own email address or something
like that okay I'm not going to worry
about track delivery and calendars and
so I know you guys will be able to take
a look at all of that but subdomains is
something that I will be taking a look
at in the series and subdomains if you
guys don't know what they are is just
kind of a domain added onto your domain
so you can see that I've got Josie Corp
comm but a subdomain might be something
like forum dot Josie Corp comm so if you
ever want to set up a sub domain that's
pretty much how you'd set it up you go
to that little subdomain section over
here redirects you can redirect your
subdomains to another URL metrics is a
complete waste of time
so metrics give you stats about visitors
and bandwidth and so on but the visitors
thing is really not accurate at all and
neither are the all stats so if you
really want to get statistics about
people visiting your site you should use
Google Analytics and that is a tracking
thing by Google which again it would
have to be a series on its own
but yeah that's just how you would track
visitors to your site it's like the
world standard everybody would use
Google Analytics or something similar
but yeah most people just use Google
Analytics because Google's Google and
they own the world but yeah that that is
the old stats we're not going to take a
look at those
then we've got security and here you can
see we can block IPS so if you have an
IP range or a bunch of IP addresses that
keep doing funny stuff to your site you
can block their IPs and I'll show you
guys how to do this but it's not
something you would use very often
especially because it isn't very
effective if someone's trying to hack
your site from one IP they'll just move
to another one once it's blocked then
you've got a hotlink protection and
leech protection and so on and I'm
actually not going to talk about and
of this other stuff insecurity mostly
because it's not something we use every
day it's not something that needs to be
used every day but it's there if you
guys want to take a look at it
then we've got software and this is just
going to give me if I click on PHP some
specs about the server so I'm going to
be able to see language options that's
all turned off but I think the most
important thing here is resource which
is your memory limit and your file
upload size so this is kind of where you
can see what your max upload sizes to
mix you could increase that if you
wanted to but again on the web we
usually try keep all these files really
small so that it doesn't make the page
load really long so if you are uploading
a file that's bigger than 2 Meg's you've
got problems because your website's
probably going to load really slow
resource limits sometimes people get
this this memory limit issue in that PHP
and then you have to bump up your memory
limits or your memory size so right now
it's at 64 which you know isn't bad and
then max execution time and max input
time sometimes give PHP errors so you
guys can just take a look at them here
but we can't actually change them we
have to contact the hosting provider and
ask them to change these kind of things
and then I'm not gonna go into any of
this other stuff but yeah that's just if
you wanted to guys if you guys wanted to
get some information about your server
you'd look under the software tab over
here then we've got advanced and cron
jobs under advanced is something that's
kind of cool
because you can set a cron job to run
like every hour or every day just to
update something on your site so if
you've got a PHP script that you want to
run every day you can go into cron job
set that up and it'll run and then
there's things like error pages which
would be your 404 pages and so on and
that's something that we'll probably be
taking a look at
but a Miami types and Apache handlers
it's not something we use every day
especially as beginners so I'm going to
kind of skip over those then preferences
I'm not even going to explain this
changing language and changing password
you guys can do that on your own but
yeah if you guys ever get hacked you
might want to change your password so
there we go and then there's the last
tab Softaculous apps installer this is
something that you guys might not have
access to on your server it's not
available on all cpanel packages but if
it is they're basically what it does is
it allows you to quickly install a
package of some like very often used
software that was probably not good
english some software that is used very
often so yeah you can download and
install wordpress joomla 2.5 which is
the old version of joomla so if you want
to get the new one that's really that
version of Joomla over there and we've
worked with PrestaShop before so you
could also use a here download quick
install thing from Softaculous for
PrestaShop as well and yeah now we're at
the bottom and we're pretty much covered
everything so thank you for watching
