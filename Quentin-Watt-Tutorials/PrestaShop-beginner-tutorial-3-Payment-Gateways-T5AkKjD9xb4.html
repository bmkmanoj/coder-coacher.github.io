here and welcome to pay PrestaShop
tutorial number three and in this
tutorial I am going to show you guys how
to set up a payment gateway and I'm
actually going to be using PayPal so
some of you guys are probably wondering
like okay why didn't he run through the
tour and the reason for that is the tour
is something that you guys could really
easily run through by yourself it's not
something you need a tutorial on and
secondly once you guys have finished the
tour you're gonna need to know how to
find everything in the actual PrestaShop
back-office so you're going to need to
know how to use this menu so instead of
running through the tour and like
showing you guys something that you're
probably only ever going to use once I'm
going to show you guys the full on or
the proper way to find everything in the
menu that way you can always go back and
find it again whenever you want to
change stuff so you'll see that right
now I'm logged into PrestaShop and this
is actually my demo or my test version
of PrestaShop so it's not one of the
versions that I set up in the previous
tutorial but over here I have a payment
gateway setup for PayPal and I'm going
to show you guys how I set that up and
what you need to do is go over to the
side menu over here and under modules
there is actually a payment link so you
can go ahead and click on that and this
is going to take you to all of your
payment gateways so there's a couple
that you could choose from over here
although PayPal I think is probably
going to be the easiest to implement and
probably one of the most useful so it
should actually be at the bottom here
and recommended payment gateways and
then you can go ahead and install it and
configure it over here but for some
reason I noticed that in one of my demos
that I
I tested payment this PayPal gateway was
not available so if it isn't then I'm
gonna leave a link in the description
below
and you can go over to the PrestaShop
add-ons website where by the way you can
look for like any plugin that you're
kind of looking for you can maybe find
in the add-ons shop over here but this
PayPal gateway is actually free and it's
developed by PrestaShop so I do trust it
and I would use this so I'm going to
leave a link in the description below to
this page where you can download this
and if you want to install that after
you've downloaded it then you just need
to go over to modules in the side menu
here and well there's the button in the
top corner it says add new module so
that's probably still going to be no
it's not okay so you have to be on the
modules page to add a new module go
ahead and click on that button and
you'll have to find wherever you whoops
you'll have to find wherever you
downloaded that file so mine's just in
my downloads PayPal first kind of PayPal
and Canada open that up hit upload it's
going to install the plug-in and you can
use it okay
but since mine's already installed here
it is of here I'm just going to go ahead
and hit configure and by the way when
you finish installing your plug-in
you're going to be able to configure it
anyways and that's going to take you to
this page where you've got some PayPal
logos and some information about the
benefits of using PayPal etc but if you
scroll down to the bottom you can choose
a PayPal product so a PayPal package
basically and I'm just going to be on
the PayPal standard but you could really
choose any one of these you want it
although you know PayPal standard works
for me and it's free so yeah just saying
and then at the bottom of the page we've
got our PayPal API settings and this is
what we use to connect our PrestaShop to
PayPal's websites so they need to be
able to talk to each other and that is
where you get these settings from all
these PayPal API accounts
to get this information that you fill in
over here you're actually going to have
to go to PayPal website itself you can
have to log in and there's like a
specific bunch of links you need to
click to eventually arrive at the page
that gives you your PayPal settings so
I've got a website that explains all of
that well it's not my website but I've
got a link to a website that explains
all of all of this so I'm going to leave
this link in the description below but
basically you need to log into PayPal
click on my account
then under my account you're going to
have a profile link so it's all in the
screenshot over here go ahead and click
on profile then you're going to have
settings so go ahead and click on
settings and then there should be an API
link in there that'll take you to your
API information once you've got that you
can go back over to press the Sharpe and
then put all your details in and hit
save so as you can see mine are filled
in already paypal username and password
etc and it's already saved and
everything so if I go to the front end
of my store now I can actually test this
out by buying something but I wouldn't
buy any of these demo products i
wouldn't test it on that because for
some reason paypal gives an error like
there was an incorrect pricing issue or
something so don't test it on one of
these demo products you and i have to
setup your own product to test your
payment gateway so i have a product over
here which i set up and i'm going to hit
add to cart and well now i have two of
them in my cart we're just going to have
to say proceed i've already filled all
the stuff in so next and next yeah in
terms of conditions my bad
proceed okay and there we go now i've
got my product and i can check out using
paypal so if I click on this that will
take me to PayPal and if PayPal is set
up correctly it is going to ask me or
tell me what the price is and just ask
me to check out
with my details so take a look at that
all I need to do is put my parse with
password in and I can then check out but
I don't really want to pay myself to buy
a dummy product so I'm not going to
continue from here but that is the
essential or that is what you're going
to be doing if you want to set up a
gateway like this so that's all I have
for you guys in this video and as always

channel grow and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
