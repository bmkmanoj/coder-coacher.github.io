here and welcome to tutorial number
eight and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about the not operator
which is kind of like the and and the or
operators that we looked at about two
tutorials ago except this is the not
operator and I know it sounds kind of
confusing but let's just jump into it
and it won't be confusing anymore so
let's start off with the users table so
go over to PHP myadmin and then go over
to the user table and then click on the
sequel tab and let's type in a query
over here so I want to type in just a
normal query so let's type in select and
in this case let's just select the
username of the of all the people in our
database and let's say from the users
table of course and of course we know
that if we run this query as it is it's
going to select everything from the
users table and I can see that I have
Quinton 92 as a user and then I've got
all these other users but Quinton 92 is
the important one because I'm about to
make that one disappear do a magic trick
okay so let's go over the the sequel tab
again and yes to make that Quinton 92
disappear what I'm going to do is add in
a what do you call this condition so
let's add an away clause and then let's
add in the not operator so essentially
what we want to do here is add we're not
and then add in a condition so whatever
condition you want to put in that's a
condition that will alter your result
and in this case to make my name
disappear from the users I'm going to
say where username is equal to Quinton
92 right so basically let's select
everything from the all user names from
the
table where the username is not equal to
Quinton 92 and hit go and there we go
those are my results so you can see that
Quinn's in 92 which was actually the
first result is now no longer showing up
right and I know that somebody's
probably going to leave a comment asking
this question so yeah there isn't really
much of a difference between using we're
not username equal to Quinton 92 or if
you just completely removed the knot and
then use not equal to over here this is
pretty much the same query it's going to
do the same thing it's going to give you
the same result but it really depends on
where you want to use the not operator
or whether you want to use the not equal
to operator either way you can see I've
gotten the same result but I've used two
completely different ways of getting
this result and the funny thing is
sometimes you can uses both of these in
conjunction with each other and just get
like a really direct result as well so
in this case I'm going to select all I'm
going to select all user names from the
user table where the where the username
is not equal to not Quinton 92 and
because that's a double negative it
obviously becomes a positive which will
then make Quinton 92 the only user name
that gets selected so yeah I guess that
last one might be kind of confusing when
you're using not and not equal to
together but in fact it becomes really
direct when when you make use of
something like that and I don't mean to
confuse anybody by ending off with that
one it's just I thought it was kind of
funny to do that right so now that you
guys have learned about the not operator
