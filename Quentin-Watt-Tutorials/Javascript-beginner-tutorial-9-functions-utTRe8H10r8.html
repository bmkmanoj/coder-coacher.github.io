here and welcome to tutorial number nine
and in this video I just want to talk to
you guys about functions so up until now
all of the code that we have been
writing has consisted of pretty random
statements that all just get executed
one after the next after the next but
wouldn't it be great if we could group
all of the related statements together
in a group and then only call them when
we need them well my friends this is
what we use functions for so for example
let's take a look at a website like
YouTube and you can see that at the
bottom of the video we've got this play
button over here and when I go ahead and
click this play button then you can see
the video starts playing the counter
starts going and the play button has
turned into a pause button so all of
these statements or all of these things
all happen at one click of a button and
that is because I obviously call the
function that's all YouTube okay play
the video change the pause button or the
play button and you know all that kind
of stuff and now when I go ahead and I
click it again then I've obviously
called that function again and told
YouTube okay pause the video change the
pause button to a play button stop the
counter all of that so that's basically
one example of the function on YouTube
and another example could be the like
button over here and as you can see if I
were to click that then obviously what
I'm doing is I I told YouTube to call a
function again that obviously adds one
to the number of likes so instead of
having 24 likes I could have 25 likes so
that's basically what functions are used
for and know now that you know why a
function is you
useful let's take a look at how to
define a function in JavaScript so back
to notepad plus plus and basically when
I say define a function in JavaScript
what I really mean is just how to make
the function okay so what we have to do
is we first start off by selling
JavaScript okay JavaScript I want to
make a function and to do that you type
in the keyword function and now
JavaScript knows okay you're trying to
make a function and then you go ahead
and you give you a function and name and
you can name it pretty much anything you
want so for example I could name this
apple pie although I don't really want
to it's probably best if you name your
function something useful or something
that is related to whatever the function
has to do so let's make a function that
alerts out you are awesome on the screen
so I'm going to name the function make
awesome using camel caps like that and
after the name of my function what I do
is I add in these two parentheses and
I'm actually going to go over what these
parentheses mean in the next video but
for now just go ahead and include them
and you'll learn what they do in the
next video and then what we can do is go
ahead and add in these two curly braces
okay
now basically what this first one means
is okay my statements are going to start
here and then the second one means that
is the end of my function so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to hit enter
twice and inside here that is where all
of the statements that I want my
function to perform when I call it must
go so basically all my code has to go in
here code in here and like I said all
my function to do is alert out something
onto the screen so it's going to alert
out you are awesome awesome okay cool so
let's go ahead and save this and then
I'll explain this function one more time
okay so what I've done is I've said okay
JavaScript I want to make a function the
name of my function is called make
awesome and right now there are no
parameters so you don't even know what
these are brackets mean a via these
parentheses but we're going to go over
that in the next video and then
basically when my function is called
what do I want to happen
I just want to alert out you are awesome
on the screen so now that I've made my
function all there's left to do is
actually call my function because right
now this isn't going to run until I
actually say to JavaScript okay you need
to run make awesome so what I can do now
at the bottom of my code is just go
ahead and write make awesome my two
parenthesis over there and then we end
that off with a semicolon and this is
basically called calling a function and
what that does is it just says okay
JavaScript run this function so if we go
ahead and run this in Firefox then you
can see our program runs and we get this
little alert box that pops up that says
make you are awesome okay and that was
printed out because of this function so
that's pretty cool but this means that
our function is now running as soon as
we open our page but didn't I say that
we can call our function whenever we
need it
well now we can go ahead and combine
this with events which is something we
learned about in the previous video and
if we go to the body and just make a
form
a form not a forum and in the forum and
we go ahead and put an input in here of
type button and we can just call the
value the value can just say click me
and we can go ahead and say unclick so
we're using the on click event handler
so unclick what we want to happen we
just want to call our function make
awesome so let's go ahead and we'll cut
that out of there and we'll put it down
here rather and now when we go ahead and
save this and then refresh this in
Firefox so we can go back and just click
refresh you can see we've now got this
button on our our screen and when I go
ahead and I click it you can see we've
called our function again that that
prints out or alerts out you are awesome
ok so let's go ahead and just click that
so that's pretty much all I have for you
