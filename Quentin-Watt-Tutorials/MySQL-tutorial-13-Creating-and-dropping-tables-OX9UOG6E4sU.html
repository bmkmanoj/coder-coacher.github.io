and welcome to tutorial number 13 and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to create and drop tables from your
database so I know this is something
that a lot of you guys have probably
been wondering and probably wanted to do
since the first tutorial but because I
showed you guys how to import a database
so in the first tutorial we imported a
database with all of these tables I know
that a lot of you don't really know how
to create a table just yet so let's
cover that real quick and before I
actually jump into actually writing any
query I just want to take a look at one
of the other tables as an example
because over here there is a lot of
useful information so if you click on
one of the tables and you look at the
structure you can see that obviously
we've got each column and each column
has a name so ID username password and
so on and each one of these columns also
has a data type so that's very important
because when we create a table we're
going to have to declare what data type
we want any of these fields to be and in
this case for ID we pretty much always
just use an integer because it's going
to count from 1 all the way down to
however many entries we have in our
database so we're always going to use an
int and then for most of the things that
are small text characters like a
username we'll use something called
varchar' and there are other data types
available so we're not only going to
stick to these but you know you get the
point we do have to work with a data
type then correlation I'm just going to
skip over this because this is going to
be filled in automatically for you
depending on what collation you
originally set the database up as and
then the one important thing is to have
a null or not null constraint declared
so in this case this is called a
constraint and you can see that some of
these are set to no and that means that
they're not allowed to have no value so
if something is not allowed to be null
it basically just means that it cannot
be empty there needs to be
thing folding in the space so these ones
are all set to not know and then the
last the first name in the last name
I decided those are necessary so those
are fine if they are sits to a null
value and then the last thing we can see
here is my ID has been set to auto
increment and this is something I have
mentioned in previous tutorials but yeah
because you want to always have an ID of
course you don't want that no but you
also don't really want to have to fill
in an ID every single time so you might
as well just set that to auto increment
and let your database do the filling in
of the ID for you right so now that
we've covered all of that let's take a
look at how to create a new database I'm
going to go over to the SQL tab well not
a new database just a new table so I'm
going to go over to the SQL tab and
let's type create table and that is the
command that we use to tell SQL that we
want to create a table and then you want
to put in a table name so in this case
let's give my table name something like
reviews and this could actually be
anything you want it to be it doesn't
have to be what I type in here but I'm
just thinking we have an addresses table
we have an orders and a product table
and a user's table so we might as well
give users the ability to review a
product and we'll keep all of those
reviews in a review table right and then
I'm going to open up some brackets and
I'm going to jump down a couple lines
and this is just the way I like to write
my create table queries because it means
that I can put basically a different
column on each line and I'll be able to
keep track of everything it's just going
to keep everything nice and neat and
tidy if you wanted to write this all on
one line you could right so now that we
have done that let's put in our first
column for this table and our first
column needs to be an ID of some sort
because we need to have a primary key
and every single one of our tables
that's very very important so let's
create an ID or a column called review
ID that's going to create our IDs then
I want to give that a data type of int
because it's going to be a number from
one to however many I review that we
have inserted into the database and then
for the last thing I want to put in here
or actually the second last thing I want
to put in here is not null so that is a
not null constraint it is called a
constraint but basically this just means
that our review ID is never allowed to
not be no and then I also want to give
this a value of Auto increment and
that's just going to mean that of course
the ID is going to keep counting it's
always going to fill in a new number for
us we won't have to fill that in right
so review ID is done that's our first
column done now we can create our second
column and this again could be anything
you want to store in your database so
let's just say I wanted to have a review
title then that would be the review
title and this can be a varchar' or just
a char data type and if we put brackets
in here I can put this or set this equal
to 255 let's make that varchar' of 255
and basically this just means that the
user is allowed to enter a title that
can be text so basically anything that
they want to write on the keyboard can
go into the database but there are only
allowed to enter this make it 255
characters long it cannot be longer than
255 characters and then we can also set
this to not know because of course we
don't want our title to other of our
review to be blank so just set that to
not null so that the user has to fill
that in right and an important thing to
note right now is if you do want the if
you don't want the value to have not now
you could just not put not null in as a
constraint and automatically it will
allow the user to enter a null value but
I'm just going to put in no over here
because we do want that to be filled in
the next thing we're going to want to do
is put in
a description this is where the user can
type something about the products are
there their actual review so let's give
this a value of review descript
shin and this can be a value of text or
a data type of text and will let them
enter in a thousand characters so text
just allows the user to fill in more
than a varchar
if you are using the VAR char data type
there is a certain limit as to how many
characters people can put in here but
text it just allows us to have a few
more characters so in this case I'm
letting the user type in a thousand
characters and of course we do want them
to have a description so let's set that
to not know but again if you wanted that
to be blank then don't declare not know
over here right and I hope you guys
aren't noticing that I'm ending each one
of my lines off with a comma because
yeah it's one one column then another
column then another column and all of
those columns are separated by a comma
right and yeah for the last two things
that I want to mention and this is
probably something that you're not
really going to be too familiar with
just yet because we haven't dealt with
linking tables yet but usually you want
to link your table you might want to
link one table to another table so in
other words because this is a reviews
table I might want to link my users
table to the reviews table so I can see
who lifts that review it would be really
pointless if I just copied all of this
data that's in the users table and put
it here so something that we do do in
place of that is just make a value that
can link to this table so in this case I
can grab the users ID and I can set that
in as an int value and said that does
not know and basically we'll always fill
in a user's ID so we'll take a user's ID
from this table and put it here and then
also we want to know where this review
fits in with the product of course we
need to know what product this review
Long's too so we can do exactly the same
thing here I grab the product ID set
that to end and not know and whenever we
add a value to this database we'll pull
in a product's ID right and then the
last line and you need to put in
whenever creating a table is to set a
primary key so go ahead and type primary
key open up some brackets and you need
to grab whatever you want your primary
key to be and put that in here so in
this case I'm going to be using the
review ID as the primary key and yeah
that is our query done so let's just
make sure that I ended if everything off
correctly yeah that bracket there and
that bracket there cool let's hit go and
you can see that my query has now been
successful so MySQL has returned an
empty result set that's because the
table has been created so reviews has
been created and it's yeah it's just
completely empty there's nothing in it
right so now we have created a table and
that is how you go about creating a
table now let's go ahead and take a look
at how to drop or delete a table and I
feel like all my hard work is just going
to go away because I'm going to type in
drop table and then what you want to do
here is put in a table name now it is a
good idea whenever you do this whenever
you decide to drop a table maybe just go
over to the table click export and
export a backup it's really really
important that you export a backup
because you don't want to lose data that
you actually might want to use again but
in this case I know that my reviews
table is empty so I'm just going to go
ahead and drop the table reviews and
again this is a very dangerous query to
run because you might accidentally
delete data that you didn't mean to
delete so again it's always good to make
a backup but I am confident that this
table is empty so I'm just going to go
ahead and hit go and drop table reviews
you can see MySQL has
turned an empty result set so the table
has been emptied and if i refresh my
page so you have to do a complete
refresh you're going to notice that if
you check out the database again the
reviews table is now gone it's no longer
there and that is how to create and drop
tables in my sequel and before I end of
