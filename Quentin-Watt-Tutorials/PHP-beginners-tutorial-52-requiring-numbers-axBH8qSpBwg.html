here and this is tutorial number 52 and
in this tutorial we are going to
continue looking at form validation but
we are more specifically going to be
looking at how to require numbers from
the user so in other words let's say we
ask the user for their age then we want
them to place or input a value that is a
number so in other words if the user was
22 we want them to put the value of 2 to
not type in the words 22 okay so that's
pretty much what we're going to check
for and I hope you guys are noticing but
this code is basically all the standard
code and that we've been using so far
except the form is just a little bit
different it is submitting right back to
the exact same page that we are on like
I did in the form validation miniseries
which you guys hopefully should have
watched okay so let's go ahead now and
just ask the user for their age so input
type of text so that they can place
whatever they want to type in here and
then we'll go ahead and give this a name
of age okay and because they're
submitting this page back to itself
because there's no action here in the
opening form tag we can go ahead and
write all the code to handle this form
up over here and the first thing I want
to do is check if age is not empty so
let's go ahead and say if not empty and
remember we checking for not empty with
the exclamation mark and the word empty
and we'll go ahead and throw our
dollar underscore post a value in over
here and this is gonna check if H is not
empty so if H isn't empty let's go ahead
and now check if H is indeed a number
okay and to do that we're going to use
another if statement so if and I'm gonna
use a function here called is numeric so
is underscore numeric and this function
will take an argument in the parenthesis
over here which will check if age is
actually entered in as a numeric number
or just like text okay so if it's text
then it's gonna be a string okay and the
value that we can place in here is the
same thing we've got up here control C
control V and then we can go ahead and
if H is numeric echo out yes that is
numeric otherwise we can say else and we
can echo out no that is not numeric no
is not numeric please enter a numeric
value okay and that way whenever and the
user puts in a valley we can check
whether the age is numeric or not so let
me go over to Firefox over here click
refresh and you can see I was checking
up stuff on the PHP manual but hey hmm
why am i getting a yes that is numeric
message already tutorial 52 okay yeah
sorry I was practicing this beforehand
and I just
the code but let's go ahead now and
actually test if this works so let's put
in a value of 20 to click Submit yes
that is numeric let's go ahead now and
put in a value of 22 so we type the
value in click Submit no that is not
numeric please enter a numeric value
okay so we basically now know how to
check if a number is numeric or not and
that's all I have for you guys in this
video so I hope you guys will be able to
use this in a future video or I'm gonna
use it in a future video but I hope you
guys are able to use it in the future
just to check whether the user has
entered a number or not and that's all I
have for you guys in this video so I
will see you guys next time but as
always don't forget to subscribe please
feel free to leave a comment like or
share the video it's really gonna help
my channel grow and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
