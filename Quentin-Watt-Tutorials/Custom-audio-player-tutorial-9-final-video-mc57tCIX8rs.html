here and this is a tutorial number 9 and
this is actually the final video so I'm
so glad that it's the final video
because I'm running out of fingers to
show you guys at the beginning of the
video whenever I count and yeah what
we're going to do now is just take a
look at our audio player again and I'm
going to show you guys a few
improvements that we could make because
right now everything is working it's
still a good audio player the way it is
but there are just a few more things
that I think we can add and make it and
you know pretty good so you'll notice
that the first thing I did was I've
taken out this controls attribute so
we've been working with those controls
attribute here the entire time showing
those controls but oops I just took
those out so just get rid of that
because we do not need them anymore our
audio player works and when I click play
it plays when I click mute it mutes
we're able to skip through the track
which is cool but one thing that I think
we can improve on over here are these
seconds so right now we're displaying 0
: 6 as the time but whenever we're
working with time we're usually going to
be displaying 0 : 0 6 if this were 6
seconds right so let's see if we can
better ourselves and just make that 0 :
0 6 instead of 0 6 ok so to do that I'm
going to jump over to JavaScript and I
am gonna make my own function to pad
that extra 0 in there so I'm going to
make a function here and I'm going to
call that pad and I'm going to make it
take an argument called D and D stands
for digit in this case and we're going
to return something in this function so
I'm going to say return
and I'm about to use something called a
ternary operator which I've never
explained in any of my videos and I
think the simplest explanation I can
give you guys is that a ternary operator
is an if statement for one line so we're
able to check for a condition and send
through one value for true or one value
for false depending on what our
condition evaluates do so it's an if
statement that can be done all in one
line and to do that we're going to open
up some parentheses we're also going to
use a question mark and we're going to
use a colon so this looks a little bit
confusing right now but here's what
happens our condition goes inside here
and if that is true then we return
whatever is over here so if it's true
then we return this and if it's false
then we return whatever goes over here
so whatever's over after the colon gets
returned if it's false
whatever's after the question mark gets
returned if it's true and over here in
the brackets is where we put our
condition so I'm going to be checking if
D is less than 10 because if it's less
than 10 when we need a send back zero
plus the number and if it's more than 10
then it's fine we can just send the
number straight back so what I'm going
to do here is grab our we're going to
grab our digit so we're going to send
zero back as well so zero plus d2 string
and that is a method so it needs
parentheses okay and what we're doing
here is we're sending back zero plus
whatever number we sent to you so if we
sent zero one then we're sending back or
if we sent one through yeah we're
sending back zero one sorry the dog was
barking and if we send a
you through here then we're going to
send back 0-2 and so on but if we send
through a value like 11 then 11 is not
less than 10 so this is going to
evaluate to false and all we want to do
is send back B to string so we don't
want to add that zero that we're adding
over here okay and this should work 100%
so d2 string great awesome now what we
need to do is actually use this function
on our seconds so up here in my update
function there are two places that I
could call this I could call this in
this line over here so maybe let's just
space this out of it
but I could call it here where I'm
printing the time out and just pad my
played seconds over here but what I'd
prefer to do is actually whenever I'm
creating my played seconds I want to pad
them over there
so we're basically padding and parsing
anything and everything all at once over
here and I'm going to scroll even
further up the page to where our
duration is and like I said I could pad
these seconds here well I'd rather do is
actually pad them when I'm creating the
variable seconds just like that okay
and now if we save this and jump back to
Firefox and click refresh we can test
this out so I'm going to click play and
as you can see we now have zero colon
zero four zero colon zero five etc so
our seconds are showing as two digits
which is exactly what we wanted and that
is awesome and it'll do the same thing
for the minutes as well if we change the
track so now we've pretty much fixed
everything we can one thing I want to
show you guys before we end off is how
well this audio player will actually
turn into a video player because it
works pretty well
and I'm going to just jump back over to
notepad I'm going to go over to my index
file and here in my audio tag I'm
actually just going to change this from
audio to a video just like this and I'm
going to give this a width because I
don't want my video to be displaying too
big and we're going to set that equal to
640 pixels okay I'm also going to give
this a height and we're going to set
that equal to 360 and I think when
you're setting them like this they don't
need the PX okay
and one thing I want to do is grab a
different source because right now we've
got an mp3 here whereas we need a video
so back in my directory structure I've
got a video folder that has a video
inside of that and that is relative to
my tutorial code in the sense that it's
one folder back into the video folder
and then into lowell gameplay so what we
need to do here as we need to go one
folder back which we're doing for this
audio as well but then I need to go into
the video file Oh video folder and I
need to select my video called lull
gameplay dot mp4 and the type should
probably be set to something else which
I can't remember at this moment in time
so I'm just going to leave that out and
we can jump back here click refresh and
yeah basically we now have a video over
here and we've got our video player at
the bottom so our audio player can be a
video player as well and we've got our
time sharing as one minute and 16
seconds we've got our play button our
mute and all of this stuff and watch
what happens when I click it I click
play and yeah sorry you probably heard
my voice twice but I click play and my
video plays I jump to the
end of the video and the video jumps to
the end as well
if I mute then everything is muted and
if I unmute
then we can hear the sound again so our
controls work perfectly with a video tag
as well and that's just something I
wanted to show you guys and I'm going to
end this video off in a really cool way
so this is what you have to do whenever
you're finished a big project and that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this tutorial so don't forget to
