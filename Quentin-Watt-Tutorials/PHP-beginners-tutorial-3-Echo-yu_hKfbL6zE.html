here and welcome back to tutorial number
three and in this tutorial as promised
we are going to use PHP to print
something out in the browser so
hopefully you guys have followed along
with the previous tutorial and hopefully
your PHP is up and running so that you
got this screen or all of this
information print it out when you typed
that function in okay but let's go ahead
and delete that
okay so printing something out in PHP is
obviously very useful and we're probably
going to do it in almost every single
program that we write okay so to print
something out in the browser you're
going to go ahead and type the word echo
so ii CH o and then you're going to want
to put in two quotation marks okay
now inside of these quotation marks that
is where our sentence is going to go
that is where whatever we want to be
printed out on the screen will go so
let's go ahead and type in hello world
because that's pretty much what every
book ever teaches you to print out is a
hello world for the first time okay so
let's go ahead and save that now and
click refresh and as you can see we've
now got the words hello world printed
out on the screen so we've actually used
PHP to print something out in the
browser okay now this word over here
echo is actually it's not a function but
it's a built-in language construct of
PHP so whenever PHP sees this word echo
then it knows okay I'm going to have to
print something out on the screen and
whatever is after that word is what I
have to print out okay so now that we
know how to print something out you
think okay well
I can just go ahead and type whatever I
want in here and it's going to work but
it's not actually that simple because
there are a few complications okay
so let's say I wanted to print out like
a quotation or a saying in the browser
okay then I'd go ahead and let's just
try type something like a he said and
then you know whatever he said inside
quotation marks I would like and I
scream now as you can see there's
already a bit of a hint as to something
being wrong here because this text is
all black and the rest is gray so let's
go ahead and save this and see what
happens
okay when I click refresh you can see
that we've got this past era
it's a syntax error unexpected I so why
did that happen well whenever we put a
sentence like this inside quotation
marks in programming that means that
this is now a string or a string of text
okay so the only reason that PHP knows
that this is a string is because it
starts with a quotation mark and then
has to end with a quotation mark okay so
what we did was we accidentally started
our string and then ended our string and
the next letter immediately after that
was the letter I and PHP reached that
and it was kind of like what the heck
what is this I supposed to be and so
threw us an error okay and that's why
you get unexpected I because PHP wasn't
expecting that okay so in order to fix
this there are actually two solutions
okay we could surround our echo
statement with just single
quotation marks like that and then use
the double ones in the middle okay and
that will actually work so if we go
ahead and save this and refresh
we've got hey he said I would like an
ice-cream okay so it works but then what
happens if we have a sentence that kind
of has a that has a single quotation
mark in it so let's say it it said he
said hey that's my bike okay as you can
see we've got single quotation marks on
the outside and then we've used a single
quotation mark here so it doesn't
actually matter which quotation mark we
use if we try to use a double quotation
mark it's still going to break out of
the string somewhere so now we're kind
of stuck and this is where something
called an escape character comes into
use okay now the escape character in PHP
is a backslash so it's this thing right
here next to the Enter key
okay and what that does is immediately
escape the next character after it so if
I go ahead and I put my backslash over
here now what happens is it tells PHP
okay ignore the next character after me
which is this single quotation mark so
that means
okay PHP this is part of the string just
ignore it okay and now we can go ahead
and save this and refresh this in
Firefox and you can see it works and hey
that's my bike and there is our single
quotation mark it actually shows up in
the browser okay now we could also do it
this way
so we could also have double quotation
marks on the outside and then instead of
escaping that single quotation mark we
could escape these double ones over here
so that one and
that one whoops that one okay and
that'll work and print out the exact
same thing as well so if I click refresh
nothing changes but at least we don't
ever error so that's basically what the
escape character does so I think that's
actually a good place to end the
tutorial and guys please come back in
the next tutorial and we'll talk about
string concatenation and statements as
well because I haven't explained that
yet so thanks for watching don't forget
