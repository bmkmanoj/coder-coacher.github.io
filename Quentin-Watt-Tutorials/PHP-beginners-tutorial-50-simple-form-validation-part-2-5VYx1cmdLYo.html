here and this is tutorial number 50 in
the series so can you believe it 50
tutorials that is definitely my longest
series so far my PHP series so that's
crazy but let's go ahead now and
actually continue working on this form
so if you guys watch the previous
tutorial we are talking about form
validation and I set up this form in the
previous tutorial which we're now going
to go ahead and just try and validate
any data that the user falls in here
okay although I did make one mistake in
the previous video and that is with
these radio buttons over here I didn't
give them a value so for the male radio
button I'm going to go ahead and give
that a value of you guessed it male and
for the female radio button I'm going to
go ahead and give that a value of of
course a female okay so now we have our
male and female radio buttons all set up
now we can go ahead and get started on
the actual PHP code so we can get this
site up and running and working okay so
just for any of you guys who can't
remember what the site looked like we
basically had this form over here that
the user could fill in okay now let's go
ahead and just make sure that the user
doesn't fill in empty form fields
because that's the first part of
validating your form you just want to
make sure that they they did indeed
enter a username and they did indeed
enter a password and a password again
and so on okay so to do that we're going
to make use of a function called empty
in P
HP and what this does is it checks if
the argument that you typed into here in
these parentheses is empty and obviously
we're going to be using dollar
underscore post square brackets and then
you know username will go in here for
username then password for password etc
but we're going to do this all inside
one big if statement so I'm going to go
ahead here and say if and I don't want
to check if the values are empty I
actually want to check if they're not
empty so in PHP this exclamation mark
over here means not okay and then I'm
going to type in my function name which
is empty and my parentheses over there
so basically this is reading if not
empty whatever value we put in here so
let's go ahead and say dollar underscore
post and then we'll type in username so
if the username is not empty let's go
ahead and do something and I'm just
going to show you guys what this
function does for now with just the one
value but we are going to place in a few
extra values into this if statement in
just a moment so let's go ahead and say
if the value of username is M not empty
then we can go ahead and create a
variable called username and we'll set
that equal to dollar underscore post
username so that whole thing right there
and then we can just echo out something
like okay your username is and then
append on username okay or we could go
ahead and say else you need to fill in a
username so echo and then you
need to fill in a username because we
don't want them to have no username at
all okay let's go ahead and save that
now come here click refresh
okay so already it says you need to fill
in a username just because of the way
we've actually set this form up but
let's go ahead now and pull in a
username so Quinton okay go ahead and
click Submit and it says you want to
user name is Quinton but now if I go
ahead and try and submit this with no
username it asked me to fill in a
username again so that is like the basic
concept behind checking if a value is
empty or not but you know we want to
check for all the different values and
to check if they're all empty or not
okay so we can go ahead and just get rid
of this echo line over here and that
echo over there and we're going to check
now for a bunch of different values so
the first one we want to make sure of
that's not empty is username but then
we're also going to want to make sure
that password is not empty so I'm going
to say and which is that double n
percent and then we're going to say not
empty and I could probably just copy
this exactly like that oops
I cut it instead of copying but doesn't
matter control-c control-v so n not
empty password and we're just going to
keep adding stuff here and not empty so
let's go ahead and paste this in again
and not empty password again so you
could copy left and just place that in
there and again not empty oops
should have not got rid of this from my
clipboard
and not empty the next value that we're
working with here is gender so we want
to make sure that gender is not empty
and then again and not empty the last
value that we're working with is this
text area over here which is called info
so just make sure that info is not empty
go ahead and click Save here and for
this else statement now we could go
ahead and echo you need to fill in all
fields so you need to fill in all fields
okay go ahead and put in our semicolon
over here and we're going to work with
this in the next tutorial so I'm just
going to say continue in next tutorial
okay so we're going to jump back into
this code in the next tutorial but for
now let's go ahead and actually test
that our if statement is working so I'm
going to go ahead and click refresh over
here it's fine we can resend the data
it's okay okay so we've got an empty
field here and if I try and click Submit
while it's empty it says you need to
fill in all fields but if I go ahead and
I put in a password I mean a username
and a password and make sure that we've
got a password again let me just leave
out male or female so I'll leave that
empty and I'll leave this empty go ahead
and click Submit we still need to fill
in all fields again we can go ahead and
put that in we'll leave our password out
let's fill in a gender of male and info
or something just something that's in
our info box over here click Submit
again you still need to fill in all
fields so it doesn't really matter what
the user leaves blank over here
something something if as long as
something is blank
we're going to just echo out you need to
fill in all fields but now let's go
ahead and actually fill everything in
so just pass for password mail and tell
me about yourself well I'm really cool
or I like to think so just kidding
I'm not vain like that but go ahead and
just get rid of this thing now you can
see we're no longer prompting the user
to fill in all fields because they
already have fold in all the fields now
it is our duty over here as a programmer
to go back and just make sure that we
can make sure that we can work with this
data that they did indeed fall in but we
are going to take care of that in the
next video so that's all I have for you
