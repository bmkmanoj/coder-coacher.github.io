here and in this video I am going to
show you guys how to start building a
website with WordPress so we've taken a
look at the interface and we can kind of
navigate our way around WordPress but
now we're going to change some content
maybe add in a menu and add some static
pages so let's take a look at how to do
all of that and the first thing you need
to do is obviously login to WordPress
and from here I'm going to add a new
post so let's go over to posts and right
now you can see for this hello world
post which is what is showing up on our
home page and this is default WordPress
behavior whenever you set up a new
WordPress site all of your posts are
going to show on the home page and the
way this works is it'll always show the
newest post first so if I add a post to
WordPress now it's going to show up
above that the hello world post so let's
add a new post and I'm just going to
call it another blog post and I'm
actually just going to copy/paste a
bunch of content in here to save time
but yeah this is just some lorem ipsum
and if I wanted to I mean I could carry
on adding content I could switch to the
text editor and actually edit in HTML
instead of just pasting text you know I
could put in some actual HTML tags where
I want to have my paragraphs give me a
little bit more control over certain
things come on how do I keep missing the
key great so that is pretty much editing
done but there are a few other options
on this page that I haven't mentioned
which are the format so I'm going to
leave this at standard format but if
you're pasting a video link in here then
you might want to choose the video
format it's just going to display a
little bit differently all of these
displays will be slightly optimized
towards the type of content you're
adding but this feature is only
available in certain themes so it's not
going to be a veil
in every single theme that you put onto
WordPress or install onto your WordPress
installation so if these options are
right here it means your theme has no
support for these formats great so there
is also a screen options button at the
top of the screen if you click on that
it's going to drop down a bunch of
different options that you can add to
your page so right now I've got formats
and categories and all these things
ticked but if I go over to discussion
and I tick that you'll see it adds a
little block over here with some options
for adding comments and Trackbacks so if
these boxes are ticked it means that
WordPress will allow people to comment
on my blog post and that is default
WordPress behavior if you ever want to
turn it off you can just uncheck these
boxes and that will turn off the ability
to add comments on to this blog post but
only this blog post okay so let's go
ahead and hit publish and now let's go
back over to the front-end of my site
and if I hit refresh you can see I now
have my new blog post appearing at the
top and the same content that I put in
here we've got today's date and we've
got the option to leave a comment also
if I click on the blog post I can go
through to the actual blog page and here
is the comment form but like I said if I
come back here and I uncheck these
options to allow comments and Trackbacks
and I hit update and I come back and hit
refresh
you can see that that comment box falls
away and now I can just go back to the
previous blog post but this one I
haven't disabled comments on this one so
this still allows people to comment and
will show any comments that are or have
been made on the site okay so let's go
back over to the home page and there's
something else I wanted to add to this
blog post which is just a featured image
so I'm going to go to the featured image
box at the bottom corner of the screen
over here and this opens up WordPress is
media library and
here I can upload an image so I got a
bunch of different images of me and I
think let me just pick that one and hit
open and that's going to upload the
image to WordPress this is actually kind
of a big file so it took some time to
upload but if I hit set featured image
that's now set here is a featured image
and when I hit update it will also
display on the home page or on the blog
post so if I ever go through to the blog
you can see that the featured image
shows up above the text and also above
the blog details great so that is how to
add a blog and that's how blogs kind of
behave or blog posts behave now let's go
back over to the home page so I just did
that by clicking on the sites title so
there are a few other things we can do
over here because having blogs or blog
posts appear on the home page is nice if
you're a blogger or if you're a news
website or something like that but if
you are developing a website for a
company they might not want their blog
post on the home page they'll probably
still want to blog somewhere but not on
the home page so you might want to add a
static page as your home page so I'm
going to show you guys how to do that
and you just need to hit customize which
is this little option at the admin bar
and then under static front page you can
choose whether you'd like to have your
latest posts show up on the home page or
if you'd like to have a static page on
the home page and then you can see we've
got these two different options that
have been added so one of them is a page
that you want to use as a blog and right
now I don't actually have any pages set
up for this so I'm going to leave that
one blank but the other one is what page
you want to use as a front page so I'm
going to choose WordPress is sample page
that was set up by default and now you
can see that my home page has actually
changed it's no longer showing my posts
it's showing a static page that I can
edit
and I can always control what
information is going to be seen first by
the viewers so let me hit save and
publish and I'm going to just leave the
customizer so yeah we've got a static
page setup and there are a few things
that we might want to change about this
page but there are also pages that we
might want to add to our site because if
this site is for a business they're
going to need a Contact Us page they're
gonna need an about Us page and we still
need to add a blog somewhere around here
so to do that I'm going to add a few
pages and then we're going to take a
look at how to add a menu so let's go
over to pages and this again is quite
straightforward and works very much like
a blog post but if I hit add new I can
then add a Contact Us page because
that's something we might need and in
here you might want to give the user
your telephone number you might also
want to give them your address and maybe
an email I'm not going to put all that
information in here but this is just the
kind of stuff you might want to put on a
Contact Us page especially maybe a map
to find you as well and I'm going to hit
publish
and I'm going to go back over to pages
I'm going to create one more page which
is the about Us page and you can see
that some of the options like blogs are
still available here so if I hit screen
options I can check this discussion box
and I can see if comments are enabled
for a page by default they're not
because you know it would just be weird
for people to contact on your about Us
page right so by default we don't really
have discussion options set on pages but
we do on posts we can also set featured
images and those kinds of things but
it's a page and I don't really want to
set a featured image for this but I am
going to add in all of that lorem ipsum
again and for an about Us page I mean
you're probably being put content about
your company or about your
self if you're a blogger and I'm gonna
go ahead and hit publish if I want to
see what this page looks like right now
I can always hit preview changes and
take a look at the page but you know I
don't really want to just preview the
page I want viewers to be able to see it
so what I need to do is add a menu to
the top of my page so somewhere over
here I know that this WordPress theme
has the option to add menus to the page
so I'm going to add a menu by just going
over to the backend and then I'm going
to go to appearance and I'm going to go
to menus and from here I can now create
a menu and right now I don't actually
have any menu set up so you can see I've
got the option to create a menu over
here if this box is not showing up you
might have to just click create menu but
the only reason why you'd have to click
this is if you already had a menu set up
on your site so I'm just going to create
a menu here I'm going to call it main
menu and hit create and now adding menu
items is as simple as taking on all the
boxes that I want to add from my pages
and I'm going to hit add menu I can also
add blog posts to a menu or I can add
categories or custom links so in other
words if I wanted to add a Facebook link
or something I could just put the URL in
and then I could add the text Facebook
to this and that would appear in the
menu as well great thing about menus is
I can always drag and drop everything
where I need it to be so usually contact
us is like the last link on a page
Facebook we might actually have as a
child link so the nice thing is all
items menu items like this will show up
as parent level menu items so if I hit
save and I come back here and I hit
refresh I should have a menu show up
okay
reason why that didn't happen is because
I didn't take the menu location so
pending on what theme you're using in
WordPress you'll have different menu
locations and this theme has a primary
menu location and also a social links
menu but I'm gonna make this menu appear
as a primary menu and hit save now when
I come back over to the front-end and
hit refresh my menu shows up in the
primary menu location so we've got our
sample page which is also a home page we
might want to change this text we've got
our about Us page when I click on that
I've got the information that I put on
the about Us page contact us you know
this is the same information I filled in
on the contact us page so I know this is
working correctly and I've got a link
that would take me to Facebook so yeah
no need to see my my private Facebook
but yeah if you ever wanted to add a
link like that you could do that
I'm also going to just drag and drop
that one level below because then we can
have a child menu item or as you can see
it says it's called a sub menu items I'm
gonna save and when I come back here and
hit refresh
now Facebook appears as a child menu
item and the styling of how these menus
works will depend on your theme
obviously but yeah we've got support for
a sub menu and it's quite nice to have
that Facebook link appear under contact
us if you want to be able to link to
your social network most people don't do
it that way because we add social icons
to to link to menu items or to link to
pages but I will explain all of that in
a future tutorial so now that we've
taken a look at creating menus and stuff
I just want to add a few finishing
touches because I don't want this
Facebook link there but what I might
want is a blog posts page or a blog page
so let's go back over to pages I didn't
save the menu okay so let's go over to
pages and I'm going to hit add new and
I'm just going to add a blank page but
I'm going to give it a title of blogs or
blog posts or something
and I'm going to leave this blank but
then I'm going to go back over did it
not publish and then I'm going to go
over to the menu again and I'm going to
add the blog post to the menu I might
also want to change sample page to
something more convenient like home and
then I'm going to hit save and then I
need to go back over the front end and I
want to go over to the customizer again
because something we didn't set up was
this posts page so if we want to be able
to run a blog that isn't on our home
page we can select a page for our blog
post to appear and they're going to
appear on the page that I created which
is blog posts so let's hit save and I'm
going to close this now and so now I've
got my manual setup we've got a home
page which if you want to change this
title you have to actually do it on the
page itself over here so you'd have to
change this title right then we've also
got our about Us page our Contact Us
page and if they click on blogs or blog
posts they can see our company blog or
our personal blog so that is a quick way
to set up a wordpress site or just to
customize it in a way that you would
actually use a website and I hope that
