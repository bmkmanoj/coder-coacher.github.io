to tutorial number 29 and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you
about guys about table headers and
captions so to use the table header the
first thing we have to do is obviously
have a table on our website so let's go
ahead and open up our table and then end
our table of over here and inside the
opening table tag I'm going to add an
attribute called border and I'm going to
set this equal to 1 now that just means
that there's going to be a border around
everything on our table so usually when
you look at a table there are headers in
the top row that tell you what
information is going to be displayed in
each column so let's say I was going to
make a table about the music that I like
the first table header might be artist
and then the second table header might
be album and the third might be track or
something like that so let's go ahead
and just make that quickly so we'll make
a table row and that'll be the first row
of our table and inside here we'll add
in our table headers so table header and
I'll go ahead and copy that so like I
said the first one would probably be
artist and the second one would be album
and the third one would be track cool
awesome so now that we've got a table
with three different headers we might as
well just give it some contents that
actually looks like a table so let me go
ahead and power and copy that so table
row and ending table row let's go ahead
and put in some bands or artists that I
like and
I definitely think the first artist that
I really like is Gianna
Skye now she is awesome and okay I guess
we pretty copy this and she's got an
album which is called if I'm not
mistaken hungry and the song that I
think I really like of hers is walking a
way you know and well we might as well
just add in one more one more artist so
let's see ISO is another band that I
like ISO and they have a bear an album
called piece by piece piece by piece and
they have a song called no fire which I
absolutely love so now we can go ahead
and save this and run this in Firefox
and as you can see we now have this
really nice neat looking table with all
the headers at the top and you can see
that I have or you can see the music
that I like there's artists there's an
artist named Chiana sky and there's
artists or a band named I so and they
have albums and those are the songs that
I really like so that's pretty much a
nice neat organized table and that's how
you would use a table header on your
table in your website and now what I'm
gonna do is go ahead and show you guys
how to add a caption to your table and
it's actually really easy so go back to
your HTML and write offer after the
opening terrible tag on your table go
ahead and add in the caption
tag and you can end it off there too
caption whoops
caption and because this is a band of or
this is a table with famous South
African music I might as well just go
awesome si
music and if I save this and then go
back to Firefox and click refresh you
can see we get this cool caption at the
top of our table just to say what the
table is about so that's pretty awesome
and that's how you add in table headers
and captions onto your website so that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this tutorial don't forget to check out
these bands I'll leave a link in the
description below and I will see you
guys next time I would appreciate it a
lot if you guys really hit that
