here and in this tutorial we're still
taking a look at jQuery selectors and
I'm actually going to show you guys how
to select elements on your page by their
tag so let's start off by actually
adding a few elements to our page and
I'm just going to open up a paragraph
and end this off but we really could do
this with absolutely any element I'm
just using paragraphs as an example and
I'm going to set some text in here so
just some text and we'll duplicate this
a couple times so we have three
paragraphs all with the inner text
saying some text and I'm going to click
Save and now we can go over to our
script file which remember is linked
down here and our jQuery file is linked
over here so we should be able to use
jQuery and I'm going to select all of my
tags by the tag name so I'm going to add
in my dollar symbol and my parentheses
and then we'll add in the quotation
marks as well and in here all we do is
actually type in the tag that we want to
select so in this case I want to select
all these paragraphs so I'm going to
select by the P tag but we really could
use any tag we wanted so if it was a div
tag we could select d'oeuvres or spans
etc and what I want to do is actually
just change the inner text of all of my
paragraphs so right now the text over
here is some text for all of these
paragraphs so let's go ahead and
actually change that and to do that
we're going to append on the method over
here which is text and that is going to
have some parentheses and we can
actually end that off with the semicolon
because this is going to be just one
line and what it's going to do is select
all our paragraphs and change the inner
text to whatever we add in these
parentheses so
I'm going to open up my quotation marks
and we're going to type something like
hello there I am paragraph okay and now
if I click Save and we actually go look
at this in our index file you can see
that all of these paragraphs have the
text of some text coded into them in
HTML but if we actually run this in
Firefox you can see that even though the
HTML over here says some text the actual
paragraphs when they're displayed in our
browser has been changed by jQuery to
say hello there I'm a paragraph and it's
done there for all of the paragraphs so
we've selected all the paragraphs on our
page and actually changed the text and
if I actually minimize this and come
back here and I change our third
paragraph to be a span so let's change
that to span and we'll add in the s a n
so span now this third paragraph is no
longer a paragraph anymore it's actually
a span tag so if I save this and we go
back over to Firefox and click refresh
you can see that the first two change
because they are indeed paragraphs and
we selected by a paragraph over here and
then the third one which is a span tag
actually didn't change at all but that's
fine because that is actually a span and
it's now with out of the range that we
were selecting over here just keep in
mind though that if you're going to do
something like this and let's say you
had a paragraph on the page let's change
this bottom one back to a paragraph so P
and P and let's say you wanted this
third paragraph to be the same this
paragraph must not change like you
didn't
your jQuery to actually change this
paragraph since this is actually a
paragraph it's going to be within this
range so the problem they're probably
going to have there is if you run this
in the browser it actually changes that
paragraph because you're selecting all
tags by the paragraph or the element
name which is paragraph so if you have a
paragraph on your page that you'd like
to stay the same then you should keep in
mind a better way of selecting your
paragraphs will probably be to give them
all classes for all the paragraphs that
you'd like to change and then you could
leave the one that you don't want to
change alone by only selecting by class
and not giving that paragraph a class
and that's all I have for you guys in

help my channel grow and I will see you
