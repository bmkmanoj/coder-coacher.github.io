here and welcome to tutorial number 21
and in this tutorial I'm going to talk
to you guys about some child selectors
in HTML and CSS so in the previous
tutorial we looked at how to like
identify elements more uniquely by using
a class or an ID and sometimes you might
want to leverage a little bit more power
in CSS where you'll have a div and you
might give this to a class of something
like red text and you'll put a few
paragraphs in here so let's just say
this is a paragraph and we can duplicate
that a bunch of times I'm not sure if I
hit come on
oh d no or come on D huh come on shifty
ah there we go
okay come on shift deep duplicate that
line a few times and now we have
paragraphs within a div that has a class
of red text but we might also have a few
paragraphs outside of that div right so
now we can use a child selector to
select only these paragraphs right so
let's jump back over to the browser hit
refresh let's see what this looks like
so right now it's a bunch of unstyled
paragraphs and I'll just zoom in make
that a little bit bigger for you to see
and what I'd like to do now is style
those using a child selector so we know
normally if we wanted to style a
paragraph I might come here select that
paragraph with its elements and then
type in color red right but what that'll
do is it'll change every single
paragraph even the paragraphs outside of
the div red and so let's just actually
add that in here just so we can see more
clearly which ones are outside the div
although I mean we should all know it's
the bottom three
okay some save that we can see these
ones that are outside of the div still
display red because we've selected all
of them by paragraph right
but instead what we could do is come
back here and look for all divs or all
paragraphs within a div so let's do this
I'll type in div then I'll add a space
and then I'll add a paragraph tag so
maybe just zoom in a little bit here
about basically what this space does is
tell CSS hey listen up we're looking for
divs and then anything within sight
inside of that div that is actually a
paragraph we want to style all of those
ribs so let's save here and come back
and hit refresh and now you can see
these three divs I think I might have
zoomed in a little bit too much there
but these three paragraphs that are
inside of the div all got styled read
whereas the three that are not inside of
a div got no styling what save us
they're still black right but let's say
for instance I have another div on the
page but this one has a different class
of something like blue text and let me
end that off and go ahead and copy these
and paste them in here right now I've
got red text which I wants to be read
but I've got these ones at the bottom
here which I would actually like them to
be blue but because of my styling rule
div space paragraph selecting all
paragraphs within a div now all of these
are red right so instead of selecting by
element we can select by class as well
so in this case I'll take any div or
anything that is in a class of red text
so any paragraph that has a parent with
the class of red text we want to turn
the
right but any paragraph with a call a
class of blue text let's change that
blue right so let's come back yet and
hit refresh and now you can see we've
got red paragraphs and we've got blue
paragraphs because we're using or we're
selecting by class of the parents right
so in this case the parents happens to
be a div with a class of blue text but I
could even change this div to something
I don't want to say a paragraph I could
change it to another element let's just
call it an article maybe or a section it
doesn't actually matter
what element we use here because we're
selecting by class so let's come back
here and refresh you see we've got the
same result
right but in some cases you might even
want to get a little bit more
complicated with this or a little bit
more strict with this and say hey you
know what listen up I only want divs
with the class of blue text to have blue
paragraphs so if this is an article with
blue text I don't want or an article
with the class of blue text I don't want
those paragraphs to to turn blue and so
what you can do is specify div and then
don't leave any space ha just select the
class by adding that full stop and
saying okay now only divs with this
class or only paragraphs who have a
parent of a div with the class of blue
text should turn blue right let's come
back here and hit refresh and you can
see that now this has lost its styling
because if we take a look at this again
in the code this is an article with a
class of blue text right so if we change
this back to div and save this and come
the browser and hit refresh now we've
got these paragraphs displaying blue
again because we're looking for
paragraphs within the div that has a
class of blue text so that's you know
quite powerful if you think about it
when you have quite a large number of
elements that you want to style but you
want to get really strict and you you
want only one element with the class to
be styled or only one element with the
class that has paragraphs inside it and
you only want those paragraphs to be
styled and yeah I know this was a very
simple example but it is a lot more
powerful I just want to send a shout out
to my sponsors at their Mountain they
run a coding bootcamp with courses on
iOS development UX design and web
development and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
