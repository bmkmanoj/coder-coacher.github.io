here and welcome to this tutorial on 5
icons so in this video I just wanted to
show you guys how to create a favicon
for your website and also talk about
where it gets used and stuff so if you
take a look at my browser right now I
have a splash page that's open and I
actually coded the splash page yesterday
in a live stream so there were a few
viewers who joined during the live
streaming they got to watch me create
this live I will leave a link in the
video description below if you guys want
to check that out and also if you want
to download this code you can go over to
my patreon page I will also leave a link
to my patreon page and where you can
download this code in the video
description below so check that out and
yeah you can download the code and start
basically where I have started with this
this little bit of code they're actually
really isn't much here and then there's
a little bit of CSS as well to make
everything look nice and yeah from here
I want to show you guys how to generate
a favicon so if you guys don't know what
a favicon actually is it's this thing
here right a favicon is a little icon
that appears in the top of the browser
page when you have the website open it
also displays in the bookmarks toolbar
which is over here so those are already
two good reasons to have a favicon but I
bet some of you guys might not have
known that five icons can also be used
as app icons on your mobile phone which
means if somebody bookmarks your website
to their phone and they save the
bookmark on the desktop of their phone
then you can have your favicon display
as an app icon and when I click on that
app icon it will open up your website so
if you guys didn't know that then yeah I
am glad I informed you and if you didn't
know that well let me show you guys how
to actually create a favicon but before
we get started with the whole generating
a favicon thing I just want to send a
shout out to my
bonzer dev mountain so I'm going to
leave a link in the video description
below and I'll also leave a link in the
top corner as a card and you guys can
check out dev mountains website so dev
Mountain is a coding boot camp that has
courses on web development iOS
development and UX design and they have
campuses in Silicon of WoW silica Salt
Lake City Phoenix Dallas and Provo and
if you are not based in one of those
four locations I believe their package
price wherever it is actually includes
accommodation so if you want to take a
course you can go there take the course
I'll take the bootcamp have
accommodation and then once you're done
with the bootcamp go back home to
wherever you live or move on to the next
city and yeah either use your skills
that you've learnt at dev Mountain to
find a job or use the skills that you've
learned at dev Mountain to make a job
which is a lot more exciting in my
opinion and now that we have given them
a little bit of a shout out let's jump
back over to creating the stab icon so
right now you'll see that is a fav icon
showing up and that's just because I'm
using map and map then creates or
generates the favicon that displays over
here I want to replace that with my own
fav icon so I have a fav icon that's
already prepared or an icon that I've
already prepared and I'm going to show
you guys that in just a second but
instead of like photoshopping four
different icons because five icons you
basically need to have a few different
versions of them but instead of going
into Photoshop and creating all of these
versions I find it a lot easier to use
an online generator like this one so if
you Google fav icon generator I'm sure
you'll get like a few hundred results
but I think one that works really well
is this one which is real favicon
generator net so I'm going to make sure
that I use that one I will leave this
link in the video description below so
you can
ahead and check that out okay so once
you get to this step you are going to
want to select a favicon picture and you
can see that it says select a ping a jpg
and SVG or whatever as long as it is
larger than 70 by 70 pixels I'd probably
try something that's a little bit bigger
than that so start with something that's
like 200 by 200 the bigger the better
okay and now let's say select favicon
picture well here you can already see it
to select something that's actually 260
by 260 but now that I have clicked on
that button I've opened up my finder
window to find the image that I want to
use and I'm going to use this one so you
can see I've got a bunch of different
logos that I've been working on in Adobe
Illustrator and if you guys don't know
the difference between a ping and a JPEG
and a gif and all of this kind of stuff
I just want to give you a brief
explanation but you should probably
research this a little bit more so I
created my logo in Adobe Illustrator and
if I go say if I say file exports and I
export this as a ping image that's
exactly what I want to use the reason
why I want a ping is because it'll have
transparent background ping PNG right
it'll have a transparent background so
this is the one I want to use so let's
go ahead and say open right and that's
going to upload my ping image and now
you can see it's giving me a message
which says that my image isn't actually
perfectly squared so it's going to add a
little bit of space on each side and I'm
ok with that
I'm cool with that it's basically just
this little space here and this little
space here that it is adding right just
to make my image square and you know the
reason why I was talking about ping
images is because let's say you uploaded
a JPEG JPEGs don't support transparency
which means that everywhere where you
see these like gray square blocks that
would be covered in what
of a color your image actually was
whether it be blue or black or white or
whatever in this case because I'm using
a ping it's transparent which means
there is no background to this and yeah
if you guys want to fully learn like the
power of using a ping and having
transparent backgrounds and stuff you
need to learn about the difference
between pings and JPEGs and gifts but
that isn't what this tutorial is all
about so I'm just going to continue with
this picture
and now it's showing me a demo of what
it's going to look like across different
devices so this is iOS and on iOS right
now it looks kind of ugly because the
default background is black so let's add
a solid plain background for this one
and you know I could pick a different
color here like green or something but I
think I'm okay with it being white and
that's what it looks like now and
there's this option for margin size
which if you pay attention to what's
going on there in that demo it's
basically just making my icon a little
bit smaller so I think I'm fine with it
looking just like that right then I also
have what it will look like on Android
and I could probably just add a solid
background to this one as well but
actually looking at this it doesn't
round off the corners so I don't think
that this looks anywhere near as good as
the Apple icon when it has a background
so I'm going to leave the transparent
background as it is just like that and
then you could give it a app name or
something if you'd like and that's going
to be the text that displays underneath
the logo I think I'm just going to leave
mine blank or I could just put there
quinton something like that all right
does it say apply a shadow okay so I
think that actually looks better with
the shadow I think I'll leave it like
just like that right then there's also a
Windows version so I'm just going to
choose a green background and then
there's also a Safari version but this
seems to be broken for some reason
because I actually tested this sign up
before I started making this video and I
think when you're supposed to click
click in here there should be a color
picker which isn't appearing for me but
I'm just going to set this to all-black
and I think when I hover over the touch
bar that's going to have a black
background with a white Q and then my Q
will also be black in these situations
but I can't see a live demo of that
because this thing isn't updating for
some reason right and now when I click
generate five icons this is going to
generate a bunch of different 5 icons
that I can use across multiple sites so
instead of me having to photoshop
each one of these things I can just
click download the favicon package and
because Mac has a little bit of a bug
I'm going to have to pull this here
download save the file right and I'm
just going to save this to somewhere so
my desktop is ok replace you can see
I've actually already tested them out
because they are on my desktop back here
right and yeah that's going to then
download the zip file which you can
unzip and then you're going to get a
bunch of different fav icon so you can
see that this one's really blurry but
that is 16 by 16 pixels that's what most
5 icons look like then you have the
Android one which is actually a little
bit bigger 96 by 96 pixels and I think
there is a Mac one here Apple touch
uncom so that's what that one looks like
right but I have a bunch of different
versions of this and what I need to do
now to make these actually work is come
back over to this website and I need to
take this code and place it on my
website so right now I've got this code
in my index file and I need to paste all
of these links in here something that I
would say you need to pay a lot
attention to right now is this href
right so you can see right now it says
href /all touch icon pain right so that
means we're looking for a touch icon in
the root directory of our website which
means that if I want this these icons to
display they need to be if we go to
htdocs this is my local my website
directory they need to be in the same
location as my index file right if I put
them anywhere else I need to make sure
that I change this href so you just want
to pay very special attention to this
and I'm going to now take all of these
things in fact I don't actually think I
need all of them I just need the SV if
we set what's in our code I need the app
icon I need the file icon 32 by 32 the
16 by 16 okay well I do need quite a few
of these sooo let's take all of these
icons copy them and paste them in the
same directory as my index file
so let's paste all 9 items and now you
can see this looks really busy there's a
lot of icons over here but if I jump
back over to my browser hopefully I
still have that open somewhere and I go
back over to my original website and I
hit refresh
okay this also doesn't update
immediately but did I save this I find
that a lot of browsers
when you're generating a favicon it
doesn't always show up immediately
sometimes it gets the browser caches the
icon and then it takes a while before
displays you might need to refresh this
a few times but if you take a look at
the top corner of my browser window or
my browser tab right now you can see
we've got rid of the map icon and now we
have
this little black queue icon appearing
and if I create this as a bookmark can I
just do this just like that it should
also display my fav icon there so yeah
that is yeah basically if I save the
same website on my phone I'll have an
app icon which is making use of either
one of these two images and yeah I have
an icon that will display across
browsers mobile phones whatever right so
that is the end of this tutorial and
there are a few more things I just want
to say quickly before you go the first
