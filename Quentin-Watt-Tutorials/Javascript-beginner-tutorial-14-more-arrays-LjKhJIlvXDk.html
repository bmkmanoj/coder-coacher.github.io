here and welcome back to tutorial number
fourteen and in this tutorial I want to
carry on talking to you guys about a
raise so in the last tutorial I showed
you guys one way to declare an array
which was this line over here and then I
also showed you guys how to access each
individual element inside of an array by
typing the array name and then two
little brackets square brackets and the
array element number in between those
square brackets okay but let's just
delete this line for a second and I want
to concentrate on this line over here so
do you see how I declared my array which
was this part over here and then I added
in five different values inside of the
parentheses which was this part of it
here okay this is called declaring and
initializing an array but there are
times where I don't know when I'm
declaring my array what these values are
going to be okay like let's say I wanted
to ask the user what his five top
favorite cars are or her five top three
because I don't know what he or she is
going to fall in but what I do know is
that I only want to set aside five
spaces so that they only fill in five
cars okay so what I can do is I can
declare my array just like that but
inside these parentheses I'll just add
in the number five now this tells
JavaScript okay I'm only leaving five
spaces in my array and when the users
finish through those five spaces then
that's it okay so that's how we declare
in an array with a certain number of
spaces in the array now what we can do
is we've got these five spaces to fold
so let's say I've asked the user to fill
in his five favorite cause now what I
have to do is I have to assign each of
those values to an array element using
the array index okay so the array index
was this thing the array name and then
the square brackets okay so our first
array index starts at 0 if you guys can
remember and then we go on from there so
our first array index cause 0 well let's
say the user said his favorite car was a
Ferrari okay then we can go ahead and
fill that in like that okay now what I
want to do is I'm going to duplicate
this line five times because we're going
to fill in the rest of the elements so
I'm just going to put my cursor right
here in front of the line and then I'm
going to push ctrl D on my keyboard and
that duplicates that line so that was a
1 2 3 4 5 okay so we've got five
different lines here so you start at
array index 1 okay 0 1 2 3 4 ok cool so
the next thing I want you guys to notice
is that array index 5 never appears in
our array because we've set aside 5
spaces but we started counting at 0 so
we went 0 1 2 3 4 and that means our 5
spaces are full so cause 5 is never
going to be an element in our array as
long as we only have 5 spaces okay so
let's go ahead and just carry on filling
in some values here and we can say maybe
he's sick and favorite car was a Porsche
and his third favorite car was McLaren
and his fourth favorite car we could
pretty just say is a Mercedes and then
of course because I woke up in an oh god
I will just put got it yeah and one does
not simply wake up in a new Bugatti so I
don't know how that you did that but
anyways cool so now we've declared our
array with five spaces and we fold all
five spaces with this code over here now
what we can do is we can just treat this
array as normal and I showed you guys
how to print out a full array then I
also showed you guys how to print out
each individual element in an array that
was all in the previous tutorial so
that's you guys know how to do that
and yeah basically we've we've just
learned how to declare an array in a
different way okay but there's actually
still one other way that we can declare
our array so you see how I'm actually
just going to delete this quickly
control X okay you see how we've set
aside five spaces in our a but what
happens if we don't want to limit the
user to only five spaces let's say we
were asking the user to fill in any
brand of car that they decided they
wanted to buy or they were interested in
buying okay then maybe we don't want him
to just give us a list of five maybe we
can have a list of ten or eight or
twelve we don't know how many cars the
user might want to give us a list of
okay what we can do is then start off
with an empty array so you just go ahead
and say var cars equals new array and
you don't fill anything in on the
parentheses now that means we have an
empty array so there aren't there isn't
even one element in our
a as our code starts off there's nothing
there now what we can do is a if I paste
this back in we can start filling up
some spaces so when JavaScript reaches
this line of code it goes okay you want
to put in elements inside of this array
okay well now there's one element in the
array then it gets to this line of code
and says oh you want to put another
element in the array okay well now our
array is two elements long and then we
get to next one three four five okay so
now we'd have five elements in our array
but like I said it doesn't matter
actually how many we've got here so I
could duplicate that line again and have
six two four one two two and I guess
probably just put in BMW or something of
them cool and we could carry on going
for as long as we wanted and our array
would just keep adding a new element
every time okay so that's pretty cool
but then how do we know how many
elements that we have or inside of our
array like how can we keep track of that
well there is actually something called
a property which we have with our array
and the only property we actually have
when working with arrays is the length
property which basically counts how many
elements they are inside of our array
okay so to make use of this length
property what we can do is we just type
in our array name and then we put in a
full stop and then we type the word
length okay and that's how to use the
length property with an array so now
what I can do is I can actually print
out how many elements we have inside of
our cause array by just typing document
dot write and inside here I can put
cause dot
length okay so this is our array name
plus dot length on the end of it and
what that does is it'll print out
however many elements we have inside of
our race so let's go ahead and save this
and when I run this in Firefox you can
see we now have the value six printed
out on the screen and that means that we
have six elements in our array and to
double check that we can actually just
go back here and go one two three four
five six so I'm right or JavaScript is
right okay so that's pretty cool okay so
let's recap what we've done here for a
second okay
we've learned a new way to declare
arrays then we've also learned a new way
to insert values into our array and then
we also learned how to count or how to
keep track of how many elements there
are inside of our array by using the
length property and that's pretty much
all I have for you guys in this video so
I'm just going to close off with a quick
choke and now that you guys have learned
about arrays you'll finally understand
this because I've been dying to share
this joke and basically why did the
programmer quit his job because he
didn't get a raise haha I crack myself
up haha so funny
but anyways thanks for watching guys
don't forget to subscribe don't forget
to like my video and please don't forget
to visit my forum if you want any of
this code in the tutorial so thanks for
watching and I will see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
