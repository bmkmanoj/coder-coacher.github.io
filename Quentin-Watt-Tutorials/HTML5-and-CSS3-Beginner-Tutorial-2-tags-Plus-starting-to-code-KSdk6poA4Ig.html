name is Quinton and welcome back to my
second HTML and CSS tutorial and in this
tutorial we are finally going to start
writing some code so just go ahead and
open up notepad plus plus real quick and
if you don't have notepad plus plus yet
then check out my previous video and
download it so that you can follow along
with the rest of the tutorials okay so
the first thing I want to do is I just
want to save our file as the correct
file type because if you guys don't save
as an HTML file then your computer's not
going to read it as websites and your
browser is not going to read it as a
website and then your websites not going
to work basically so let's just go ahead
and click file save as and I'm going to
go to my desktop and Racha
in save as type I'm going to change this
to hypertext markup language and just
make sure that you choose hypertext
markup language and not anything else
otherwise you're not saving it as a
website and then I'm just going to go
ahead and name my file index.html and
it's probably important that you guys
just save your file as index.html as
well because and this will probably make
a lot more sense later on whenever you
guys want to try publish a web site or
something but whenever you have a home
page of a website whenever you want to
tell your server what the home page of
your website is you name your file or
your the home page of your website
index.html that's just so that the UM
whenever someone comes to visit your web
page they'll go to the home page first
which is the index.html file so just go
ahead and save that and if I go ahead
and take a look on my desktop now I've
got this little file here which is my
index file and as you can see my
computer knows that it's a website
because it's now going to use Firefox to
open it and that's because Firefox is my
default browser so if you
as default browser something else then
it's going to try open it with Internet
Explorer or Chrome or something so just
go ahead and double click this and
you'll see that we do in fact have a web
site here but it is completely blank and
that's just because I'll fall here in
HTML I mean in notepad plus plus is
completely blank so let's go ahead and
start writing in some information for
our web sites real quick but before we
actually start writing some code I just
want to show you guys a couple things
and and if you watch my previous video
you probably saw when I showed you guys
an example of HTML you probably saw code
that looked a lot like this where you
had a word and let me just go ahead and
type this okay so you probably saw
something that looks a lot like this in
the previous video we had like these
smaller than and greater than signs and
then you had like some word in there and
then you had some text in the middle and
then you had another smaller than and
greater than sign with another word in
there and forward slash now that's
because HTML is written in these things
called tags and these that's what these
things are right here this is a tag and
this is a tag so let me just go ahead
and rename that so it makes a little bit
more sense tag and tag and as you can
see they're not exactly the same either
we have what is called an opening tag
and then what we have here is a closing
tag so the reason why the closing tag is
a little bit different it's got this
forward slash in there that is just so
that the browser knows and that we know
that our tag ends here okay because if
you ever write like a really long
paragraph in HTML and you're going to
have like a whole bunch of text in the
middle here then you know okay my
paragraph started here and it ended here
okay so that's just why we have opening
and closing tags
but then we also have these special tags
called sing a little single tags so let
me just go ahead and show you what a
single tag would look like and that
would just be the same thing smaller
than greater than sign with a keyword in
the middle and then straight off da
keyword we have a forward slash okay now
this is what a single tag would look
like and basically um there are a few
special tags that use a single tag like
that which I think image is going to be
one of them and then we have break and a
few others but that's just what a single
tag looks like and that's what a double
tag looks like and you guys are going to
need to know that before we move on and
then again I need to tell you something
else and that is that you can't just
make up any mumbo-jumbo you want here
inside your tags you actually have to
use a whole bunch of preset tags so this
here where you see tag that's actually
wrong an example of a double tag would
be like P for paragraph so as you can
see whenever I use a real tag it
actually a notepad plus plus turns the
real tag blue and that's because notepad
plus plus knows what all the real or the
proper HTML tags are and therefore it
can turn in blue just so that we can see
them stand out amongst the rest of our
text okay so that paragraph would be an
example of a double tag and then I told
you image would be an example of a
single tag but don't worry about this
too much now
I'll go in-depth about these things a
little bit later but for now let's just
go ahead and start writing our website
and the first thing we have to do at the
top of every single website that we ever
write is we have to declare a doctype
and the reason why we do that is just so
that we tell Google Chrome or Firefox or
Internet Explorer or any of our other
browsers what type of websites to be
expecting because there's a bunch of
different
versions of HTML so it could be
expecting a number of documents but just
to tell our browser that it should be
expecting an html5 document because we
are using html5 because that's just the
latest version I'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to use my smaller than greater
in size and then inside here I'm going
to type in exclamation mark and all caps
doc type and I'm going to leave a space
and in small letters of U or lowercase
letters I'm going to type in HTML okay
so this just means that we are using an
html5 document it's not very hard to
remember that you guys just after you
type this in every single time your ever
write a website you just have to
remember to include that in the top just
so that the browser knows what web page
to be expecting and then the next thing
you have to do is create your website or
start writing your website and to tell
your browser where your website is going
to start an end we use a tag called an
HTML tag so that is this thing right
here smaller than greater than sign and
then HTML and I'm just going to go ahead
and end that off right now so forward
slash HTML and that just means that our
website is going to start here and end
here and anything in between here is
going to be part of our website so there
we go we actually have the beginning of
our website now what we have to do is we
actually have to split our website into
two parts because every single website
that you have ever been to and every
single website that has ever been made
is actually made up of these two parts
and these two parts actually called the
head so let me just go ahead and make my
head tags and then the second part is
called the body okay so let's just go
ahead and make these tags and I'll tell
you what they do now inside our head
we'll put in all the technical
information that our browser needs it
might not be any information that the
is going to see but it's just the
information that the browser needs for
your website to work you'll see when we
start writing our web page heads
actually going to be quite empty but as
we start making more advanced websites
or better web sites you'll see we're
actually going to start putting more and
more stuff into our head but for now the
only thing I'm going to put inside our
head is called the title but I'll come
back to that now and then in the body
that's basically where all of our
information that we want the user to see
go so if we have any paragraphs of
images and headers and stuff we want the
user to be able to read we'll put that
here in the body okay so let me just go
ahead back to our head and like I said
the one thing that we can put inside our
head for now is the title so let me just
go ahead and put our title tags in here
and I'm just going to go ahead and
indent that a little bit you guys can
have it all scrunched up on the end like
that if you want but I just I'm
indenting this a little bit so you guys
can read it a little bit easier and
follow along a little bit easier and
then the other thing is you guys can
have tags on multiple lines if you want
or you can just have them on one line
doesn't matter so I'm just going to go
ahead then make our title and for the
title of our webpage I'm just going to
write you this is the title exclamation
mark just so that you guys you know this
is the title anyways and then in the
body I'm just going to write some random
text here so just go some around okay I
cannot spell random text and oh let's go
ahead and save this and now you can see
if I minimize this and go back to our
blank web page that we had saved before
and I click the refresh button we now
have some content in our website so
we've got some random text over here and
then at the top here we've got this
thing it says this is the title and that
the title of our website so that's all I
got for you guys in this lesson if you
come back in the next tutorial we'll
obviously go over making our body a
little bit more cool because right now
it's quite empty and we'll learn what
the paragraph tags are with the header
tags are etc so that's what you guys
have got to look forward to but for now
