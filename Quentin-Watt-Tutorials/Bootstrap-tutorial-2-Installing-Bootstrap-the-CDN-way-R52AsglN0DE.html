here and welcome to bootstrap tutorial
number two and in this video we are
going to take a look at how to install
bootstrap on to our web page using a CDN
and if you guys are unfamiliar with the
CDN or if you don't know what CDN stands
for then CDN stands for content delivery
network and a CDN is basically a server
that hosts all of the bootstrap files
that you want to use and it hosts them
externally so you don't ever have to
worry about people editing your
bootstrap files or deleting your
bootstrap files by accident because they
are not on your server they're actually
on a CDN server and that's just one of
the advantages of using a CDN the other
advantage is that it's really easy to
implement bootstrap files or bootstrap
using a CDN ok so I'm going to show you
guys how to do that and in the next
video I'm going to show you guys how to
implement bootstrap on your local server
or on your localhost ok so let's take a
look at how to download bootstrap or
just how to get the CDN code and what
you want to do is go over to get
bootstrap comm and I'm going to leave a
link in the description below and when
you arrive on that website you should
have this big purple banner with a big
download button in the middle and that
is over here ok if for some reason the
bootstrap sign doesn't look like that
when you get there it's either because
you're on the wrong website hit or maybe
bootstrap has changed in between the
time that you're watching this video and
the time that I recorded it okay
so let's go ahead and click on download
and when you do that you should land up
on a page so that looks kind of like
this now the reason why I
had this page open was because my
internet is really slow and I wanted to
be able to get this code without waiting
for that twirly loading circle to load
for a hundred years okay so I just
figured it would be easier to open the
page before the video and that way I
don't have to waste a lot of time
waiting for the page to load okay
so you'll see that we've got on this
page a bootstrap CDN and a whole bunch
of links that we can use in our code
okay and the first link is a link to the
latest compiled and minified CSS so that
is the actual bootstrap file that we
want to use so we're going to go ahead
and grab that okay we also want to use
this optional theme so this is optional
you don't have to use it if you don't
want to it's just going to add all the
like bootstrap colors so I'm going to go
ahead and grab this theme as well and
it's just going to make sure that we've
got a few colors or I don't want to say
colors but yeah we've just got something
on the website
that looks like it's been styled instead
of just having some unstyled elements
because all this file is really going to
give us is the grid this first file over
here okay and the last file is
bootstraps JavaScript okay and that is a
minified javascript file that is going
to give us all the cool JavaScript
functionality like that bootstrap modal
that I showed you in the previous video
okay so what we want to do is actually
just copy all of this I'm going to go
ahead and say copy and now we need to
paste it in our HTML file so if I go
back over to my desktop over here you
can see that I've got a folder called
tutorial 1 implementing bootstrap ok and
that's the tutorial that we're doing now
it's actually not tutorial 1 its
tutorial 2 so quinton get with the
program and name your files right next
time okay and inside of that folder
we have an index.html file and yeah I'm
going to go ahead and open up my text
editor and because I'm using a Mac I'm
using sublime text so I know this looks
a little bit different because I've
always been using notepad plus plus and
now I'm using sublime but hey notepad
plus plus doesn't work on OSX so I had
to find an alternative okay and if we
take a look at this HTML file over here
before I paste in my links you can see
that I've got all the basic stuff that
you would expect to have in an HTML file
so I've got my doctype I've got my HTML
tags my header tag my body tag inside
them I made a tag to make sure that my
website's Unicode you always want to go
ahead and include that okay and then
I've got my title which is just optional
okay but bootstrap the CDN way it kind
of relates to what we're doing over here
and then I've got all these links over
here and as you can see the first link
says this is where we link the CDN CSS
files so I'm going to go ahead and paste
in those files that are downloaded okay
and I'm just going to go ahead and hit
tab and indent those correctly so the
first one like I said is bootstraps
functionality or CSS functionality the
second one is the actual theme so the
look and feel of bootstrap and this last
one over here's actually a JavaScript
file so I want to go ahead and remove
that for now and I'm going to paste that
javascript file or that JavaScript link
down at the bottom of the page and for
some reason I lost the link so let me go
over to here just ctrl C I think the
reason why is because I hit cut twice
over there and then I'll ended up
cutting a blank line okay
ok so let me and then that correctly and
that is our bootstrap javascript file
down here at the bottom but we need one
lost CDN file for all of this to work
and that is a jquery file now the reason
why we need that jquery file is because
all of this functionality that we use in
bootstraps javascript file actually
requires jQuery ok so I'm going to jump
back over to my browser and I'm going to
leave a link to this website in the
description but this is just Google's
CDN version of jQuery so go ahead and go
to this webpage click on jQuery it's
going to scroll you down the page to a
jQuery link and we've got jQuery version
one point eleven point two that is the
version we're going to want to take so
don't worry about version two it's not
that it's a newer version of jQuery it's
just that version two doesn't support
Internet Explorer eight or nine and I
don't think it really matters but I'm
just going to go ahead and grab this one
just in case any of you guys are using
an old browser and yeah let's go ahead
and paste that over here okay
and make sure that you paste your jQuery
file above your bootstrap javascript
file otherwise you're going to hit a few
errors and you're going to wonder why
it's not working and the reason is
because you probably mix these two
around okay you definitely need your
jquery file above the bootstrap J's file
so just make sure you do that and yeah
now we've got all our of our files in
place now we've got to do is actually
test to see if bootstrap and bootstraps
JavaScript is actually working so what I
want to do over here is replace this we
code here with some actual code that I
write
and what we can do just to test that
everything is working is actually add an
input or not an input but let's make a
button and in this button off and
sublime actually finishes the tag for me
I need to get used to that I still
haven't gotten used to that and I'm just
going to say click me and I want to give
this button a class that is equal to BTN
and BT in - success
and if bootstrap is working correctly we
should land up with a green button on
our website so I'm going to hit ctrl s
and let's go ahead and actually open
this up in Firefox so let me say open
with Firefox and this is probably going
to take a little bit of time to load
because my internet is horrendous
and I'm back and yeah this page is
actually still loading it's been about
two minutes this is why I made sure I
open up those other pages before I
started coding or before I started
recording the video but now you can see
that bootstrap is indeed working because
we do have this green button over here
and that is following the bootstrap
optional theme so if you guys didn't use
this optional theme you might not land
up with a green button that's all I'm
saying
okay and yeah now that we've got
bootstrap actually working what we can
do is actually test the JavaScript or
jQuery files over here and to test if
the jQuery file is actually working what
we're going to do is add an on-click
attribute so I'm going to say on click
just like that and we'll set that equal
to dollar brackets this dot hide and
open closed brackets X semicolon okay
and what this does is unclick it hides
this button okay so go ahead and save
that and refresh this in your browser
I actually went ahead and refresh this
already so now if we click on this the
button hides and that way we know that
jQuery is actually working so jQuery and
bootstrap are working and now we are
good to go and move on to the next video
so as always don't forget to subscribe

like the video and share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
