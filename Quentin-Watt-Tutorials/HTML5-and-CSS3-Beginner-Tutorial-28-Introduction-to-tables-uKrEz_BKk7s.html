to tutorial number 28 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to show you guys
how to add tables to your website so
making a table actually requires quite a
few different tags and they all have to
be nested inside of each other
correctly so the first thing that you
actually have to do when you want to
make a table is open up your table tag
and then you can end it off down here
and inside here we'll go all of the
content of our table but you can't just
go ahead and start typing in random
stuff over here because it's not going
to appear as a table you actually have
to divide your table up even further
so as you know tables consist of rows
and columns and if you break down those
columns and rows even further you get
cells okay and this is actually what we
use to make our website we use rows and
we use cells so the first thing we can
do is just go ahead and make a row so
that's how you make a row in HTML just
with a TR tag which stands for table row
and inside our table row we put in a
special tag called table data okay and
that is what makes up a cell in HTML so
this right here
that is one cell and inside the cell we
can probably just put like some random
content like okay let's just go ahead
and say Row 1 column 1 and right now
it's not going to look very much like a
table so we might as well just give it a
little bit more a few more cells so now
we have a table with one row and three
cells or three columns and we might as
well just go ahead and copy this so that
we've got another row and that's row two
awesome okay so if we save this now and
we
go back to Firefox and we click refresh
you can see we now have a table with two
rows and three columns even though you
can't really see it that's that's there
okay
if I highlight over it you can see now
we have this is one cell over here and
that's another cell and obviously that's
two rows and three columns so that's
just how you make a table in HTML and
obviously it would show up and look a
lot better if you added this attribute
so if you go to your opening table tag
and you add in attribute called boarder
and you set this equal to one that means
we'll have a one pixel border around
everything on our table so if we go back
here and we click refresh we now have a
table table that's a lot easier to read
and obviously a lot better looking just
because we have a border around each of
our cells so that's how you make a table
gap in HTML guys and don't forget to
check out my next tutorial where we'll
be doing a whole bunch of cool stuff so
