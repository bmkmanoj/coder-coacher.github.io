little bit too bright and I suppose you
can still hear the noise of the cars
what about here and background just a
little bit weird and the problem was
recording here by the window is that
it's like really bright for me so I mean
if you look in the reflection of my
sunglasses here we've got nice blue
skies it's bright it's sunny but yeah it
really hurts my eyes if I'm recording
without glasses on so I'm gonna be
moving jobs in the next month and yeah
I'm sorry I basically just gone through
the whole interview process I've landed
a job and it's probably a pretty good
time to share with you guys my five tips
on acing an interview because I've just
gone through the process myself right so
the first tip and most important tip I
want to give you guys is to find out
what your market value is so that's
point number one find out what your
market value is and unfortunately this
is going to be very different for a lot
of you guys because I think location
plays a pretty big role and how much
money you can actually earn and yeah
if you guys are based in the United
States there is a really cool website
called glass door so glass door helps
you find jobs but they also have a
pretty cool calculator on their website
so I'm going to leave a link to that in
the video description below you're gonna
have to sign up and then just put in a
bunch of details like your job title and
your location and then they'll be able
to figure out what your salary should be
and they'll give you a bit of an
estimate of what you should be asking
for unfortunately Glassdoor doesn't
really work all that well if you are not
within the United States I mean it's
great for the United States I think but
if you are not within the United States
you can try it pay scale and if you are
in the United States try pay scale as
well it's just good to try a bunch of
different websites because everybody's
got different or access to different
data and they'll probably give you a
slightly different result but yeah go
ahead and try pay scale out so it's
gonna work in a very similar way just
sign up put in your job title and your
location and
they'll be able to give you an estimate
on what they think you are worth based
on the data that they've collected I do
think that pay scale has given me a
slightly lower value than it should but
hey that's just the whole point of
trying a bunch of different websites
something else I can try if I'm in South
Africa so if you guys are in South
Africa there is a completely dev focused
website called offers then very similar
to Glassdoor and they'll also be able to
you know if you read some of their blogs
give you information on what they say
the average salary of a developer in
Cape Town or in Johannesburg is having
access to that information is extremely
valuable because when you go into that
job interview and you're starting to
negotiate a salary then you will really
be able to drive that conversation and
you will know if you're being underpaid
or if the job offer is going to under
pay you or not of course if you don't
have a job then at that time maybe take
the job but if you do have a job and you
want to make sure that you're not
getting underpaid of course you've got
access to the information that you need
to make sure that that doesn't happen
and I think another important topic or
note that I can make here is now you
have access to this info don't accept
job offers if they don't mention
salaries up front rather push for an
upfront salary before you actually go
into an interview because you don't want
to go like waste your time doing
interviews for jobs if you're not
positive that you are going to be
getting a market value or your market
value worth of a salary the second point
I'm gonna make here is to prepare for
taking a test because when you go into a
job interview a lot of interviews either
make you do a test at the time that
you're doing the interview or they'll
send you an email and ask you to
complete the test before you come for
the interview and I know a website that
has been used in the past is code ility
so I'm gonna leave a link to code ility
down below and code ility is a web
where employers can pay for certain
tests that can be sent out to a
potential employee and if you go through
some of the lessons on Codell ET you
will be able to pass the tests that you
get given also another website is Testim
does exactly the same thing but I've had
code ility actually being used in
interviews that I have done I just
haven't had test them used yet but I
think they are pretty good website and
yeah I guess if you just google
programming tests or coding coding test
you'll probably find a few hundred other
good websites to use as well one thing
that's worth noting about these websites
is they are really good at testing your
technical ability so they'll be able to
test whether you actually know how to
use arrays and functions and objects and
that kind of stuff what they aren't
really good at doing is testing your
practical ability at building something
right and this is probably a more
valuable skill to have is you know to be
able to practically build something and
that brings me to my next point which is
point number three have something to
show your employer or your potential
employer when you go into a meeting if
you don't have a computer or a laptop
that you can walk into a meeting with
then yeah definitely ask a friend or
invest in one buy a computer because or
buy a laptop sorry because yeah that way
you can go into the interview knowing
that the thing that you built that you'd
like to show these people is definitely
going to work because it works on your
computer it's going to work right and if
you've taken your laptop into the
meeting with you and you get to that
point where your employer your potential
employer is asking you you know what
you've built in the past and if you know
how to use laravel or whatever it is
that they want you to know you can then
pull out your computer and say here is a
project that I have done and it uses
laravel and Ajax and angularjs and this
is what it's capable of doing and just
show off all the features of this thing
that you built so if it can log people
in and has Ajax search and all of that
stuff that's going to go a long way to
helping you get the job and the amount
of people that actually walk
to an interview with something to show
the interviewer is gonna be such a
little amount of people like you are
gonna be in the minority if you can
actually walk into that interview and
show your interview with something and
yeah if they know what they're talking
about if they know programming languages
they'll probably ask you to show you
some of their code etc and I just think
that that is gonna put you miles above
anybody else who's actually applied for
the job and I could even say that it's
gonna guarantee that you get the job
because there are very few people who
actually walk in there with something
prepared and something to show the
interviewer tip number four that I want
to give you guys is to take a
personality test and I know a lot of
people look at that and go okay what the
heck a personality test for a job
interview why would I need that and I
guess depending on where you are in the
world definitely in the United States in
South Africa in the UK and a lot of
other countries when you go for a job
interview you you will be asked
questions about your personality and a
lot of people kind of hate that because
it's like why are you asking me
questions about my personality because
it has nothing to do with whether I can
do the job or not and it kind of does
right because when you go into a job or
into a working environment you're
probably gonna have to work with a team
of people and if you don't match or if
your personality doesn't really line up
with the rest of the team it might cause
a few clashes right so when you're going
to ask questions about what's your
greatest weakness and that kind of stuff
a lot of people look at those questions
and go it's just another test that I
have to pass maybe what I need to do is
take a strength disguise my strengths as
a weakness and answer the question that
way and like I look at that kind of
stuff and I'm just like now like what
what are you doing yeah you can answer a
question in that way but I think the
most important thing is just to remain
truthful and when you get asked what's
your greatest weakness you should know
when your weakness is all you should
know what your personality is and you
be able to describe that or at least
talk to an interviewer about that so if
you take a personality test I've done
the same personality test multiple times
and yeah on this website 16 personality
types
I often land up getting either the
commander or the debater but most often
the debater and I think that lines up
with my personality really well because
I do argue and debate a lot with people
sometimes not even because I think
they're wrong I just choose to take the
opposing side and see what they say and
see all the points that they make and
yep being the debater it does that's one
thing that's it's a strength but it's
also a weakness because as a weakness
I'm very argumentative and they'll say
that on the page here so once you've
done the test you will get a page with
your strengths and weaknesses and yeah
being the debater it does mean that I'm
really knowledgeable I'm very creative I
like to think of new ideas those are all
strong points of being the debater but
my weaknesses also as a debater
I'm very argumentative and sometimes I
can be a little bit insensitive to
people and I think that really hits the
nail on the head there that's exactly
who I am
so this personality test I feel does
describe me quite well but it also gives
me something to say in the job interview
right when somebody asks what's your
greatest weakness I can say well I'm a
very argumentative person because I'm a
debater and that doesn't sound so good
in the interview so yeah if I if I maybe
use some of the words that have been put
down in this result set of you know I
can talk about how being a debater is a
strength so it gives it means I'm
knowledgeable it means that I'm a quick
think it means that I'm original and
creative but it also means that
sometimes I can be argumentative and yet
when you describe that kind of stuff to
an employer or an interviewer they will
understand it that way as it's just part
of your personality there's also a whole
section on workplace habits and talking
about how you might behave in the
workplace as well so very interesting
read very interesting thing to do I'd
say even if you're not on the job search
maybe just do a personality test anyway
and see if you find out something about
yourself and tip number five is to
interview the interviewer so I know I'm
wearing a different shirt right now it's
the next day I don't think I hey
yesterday when I recorded this video I
don't think I did a good job at talking
about point number five
but yeah point number five that I want
to make is don't let the interview only
be about the interview while asking new
questions ultimately you're gonna go
into this job and spend about 40 hours a
week there I don't know give or take a
couple hours but you're gonna be
spending the vast majority of your time
that you're not spending at home in the
office and you need to make sure that
this is going to be a good job and a
good fit for you so don't you know go in
there all about the money and accepting
a job offer just on the money because
you also want to find out if the
employer is going to be a good employer
you want to find out if the team
environment is going to work well for
you so you should ask questions about
all that stuff and I think a few things
that I like to watch out for and you
know what you can't take this as 100%
truth but there are a few things that I
just like to watch out for because when
I see an employer asking for things like
loyalty and for you to be hard-working
etc I I think all of those qualities
should come standard like I know if I'm
gonna go work for a company if it's a
good company and they treat me well I'm
going to work hard and I am going to be
loyal to them but what I find is
companies who specifically state so
they're looking for somebody to be loyal
and they specifically state that they're
looking for somebody to heart be
hard-working it's because they might be
treating you badly or they treat other
employees badly in the past and
employees left the company and ran away
not because they weren't loyal but
because they were treated
danly and so yeah I just I just find
that companies who state that kind of
obvious stuff down is maybe not a good
company to work for
also sometimes companies disguise
positive thing or negative things as a
positive thing so something that
happened with me quite often in a couple
of interviews is employers tried to pass
this thing off as something that was
really positive they said come work at
our company because everybody is young
nobody is over the age of 35 so we're
all more or less the same age we all
know each other we all get along and
they pass that off as a positive and
maybe it sounds positive to you right
now but when you really think about it
it's like but what happens to all the
older people and what happens if I'm at
the company for like five years and then
I'm 30 and then you know do I have to
leave the company or do I just naturally
leave the company or like what's going
on here like wow why are there only
young people at your company and you
know thinking about it and looking at
the salaries they offer I think for the
most part it's just because they want to
pay young people less and they
understand that as a young person it
might be only your first or your second
job in your lifetime and you probably
don't have all these adult things
figured out yet so you're not paying off
a house so you don't even know what it's
gonna cost to buy a house just yet you
probably have infected in medical care
into your salary especially if you're in
a country where medical care isn't like
standard so that kind of stuff you
haven't factored into your salary yet
and yeah because of all of that stuff
maybe you're willing to work for less
and so they will just pay you less even
though you can do exactly the same job
as somebody slightly slightly older who
has a family or who has a house and
these other types of expenses that they
sort of require a higher salary for you
could do the exact same job as them so
you technically you should have the same
money as them but just because you're a
younger person they want to pay you less
but don't take that as an absolute rule
I think you know you can still use that
that's time to interview the interviewer
well ask them a bunch of questions
and find out why everybody is young
maybe they got some good answers for you
it's just something that I personally
would watch out for especially when you
talk about salaries at the end of or
yeah somewhere in that meeting when you
talk about salaries if they're offering
you less and they've said that then you
know it's kind of the only reason why
they're hiring young people is because
they can pay young people this and look
this is by far not the only negative
thing that gets passed off as a positive
thing I think companies can do this a
lot with other stuff as well but yeah
just the one thing that really stood out
for me and I guess it's because I'm a
young person is I noticed that this was
happening and yeah like I know when I
want to go into a company in future that
I want to go into a company where I have
a long-term future I want to go into a
company where I know that if I work
there for long enough I can afford to
buy property I can't afford to buy a
house because yeah I mean that's one of
the major things that people look for in
determining whether your life was a
success or not if you were able to buy
property and I think if you go into a
company and then you realize that
everybody's young and everybody's
renting and nobody has a house yet it's
probably because we can't afford houses
and like if a company if everybody at a
company is young the reason why they're
all young is because the older people
that have stayed there for some time
realized that they needed more money if
they wanted to buy a house and they had
to leave the company to get that more
you know that bit of money that they
needed and before I end of this video I
just want to send a huge shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain so if you guys
don't know what dev Mountain is it is a
coding bootcamp and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to be an iOS
developer a web developer or a UX
designer so if you're looking to make a
career change or if you've just finished
high school and you are looking to get
into a career you should really check
out their website and take a look at
some of their courses because they'll
teach you everything you need to know in
the 13 weeks now I have heard some
people say that 13 weeks is a really
long time to go without a salary while
you're learning how to code but in
hindsight you know studying at a
university is going to be a
couple years so I think 13 weeks is
incredibly fast timeline especially
since it allows you to change careers
after 13 weeks which is good and yeah
there are a bunch of cool perks that
come with studying with them because
you'll have free accommodation while
you're studying and you will be able to
get a job at the end of the course so
they've got a placement program where
they'll help you find a job which is
it's pretty cool and yeah that's all I
have for this video but don't forget to
subscribe leave a comment like and share
this video because all of that stuff is
gonna help my channel grow and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
