number 19 and in this tutorial I'm just
going to talk to you guys about the div
and span elements in HTML so let's just
go ahead and make a div element over
here real quick so that's what a div
element looks like and below that let's
just go ahead and make a span element so
let's go ahead and go spin okay so span
and div elements are a little bit
different to most of the other elements
in HTML because they were designed
specifically to be used with CSS so
unlike any other elements on your
website the div and span tags don't make
any visual changes to your website
unless you actually use CSS to style
them
so the div and span tags are basically
just empty boxes and so you actually use
CSS to style them and make them a little
bit different so what we can do now is
you can just make like some random
little website just for me to show you
guys what's the div and spandex do so
let's just go ahead and open a div tag
like that and inside out of Teck let's
go ahead and put a few elements so let's
just go h2 ending h2 and we can call
this the Fox and below that what we can
do is add a paragraph and let's just hop
the quick red fox jumped over the lazy
Brown dogs back awesome so there we go
now we have a paragraph but we have to
incorporate span tags some way Nia so
let's just go ahead and put a span tag
around the word red and we can put
another span tag around the word Brown
oops start a passband to ignore the end
let's go and then we'll end the span tag
over here and what we can do is we can
just give this cloth the span tag across
equals two round text and we'll set this
span tag to have a class of red text
now the reason why I'm doing this is
because we're going to use CSS in a
moment to go ahead and style these tags
but for now let's just go ahead and view
this in Firefox and then you guys can
see the difference so what we can do now
is quickly just go ahead and run this in
Firefox and as you can see like I told
you the div and span tags don't actually
make any visual changes to our web sites
until we actually style them so we've
actually got a span tag over here and
over here but you can't see them because
we have installed them yet and our div
tag everything is wrapped up in a div
tag and obviously you can't see that but
now let's go ahead and go to our CSS and
just go ahead and style this so first of
all what we can do is we can start a lot
of tag by just ending div like that and
we can set the background color of our
div background color to be yellow I
guess yellow and we can set a border of
one pixel solid red now if we go ahead
and save this and go back to our website
over here when you click refresh what
should happens we get a nice big yellow
box with a little red border all the way
around the box so that's actually what
our div tags therefore it's just to be
used as like a box for all of our
content that that will go inside and as
you can see it is a block level element
and then what we
do now is go ahead and start our spandex
and like I said we've we've given our
spam tags a class over here of red text
and brown ticks so what I'm going to do
now is actually just go ahead and style
those classes rather so red text and
what we can do over here is just set the
color to red and brown text same thing
and if you don't know how to use classes
then go back and watch my previous
tutorial and then you can go ahead and
see how classes work okay save that and
now watch what happens when I click
refresh the word red is going to change
red and the word Brown is going to
change Brown BAM okay so you can't
really see it very well because the
yellow background but you can see that
it has changed so that's just what you
use a span tag and a div tag to do it's
just there for anything that you might
want a different word to be you can use
a span tag just to have a different
color in a sentence and obviously the
div tag just to make a box all the way
around your content so that's how to use
div and span tags guys thank you for
