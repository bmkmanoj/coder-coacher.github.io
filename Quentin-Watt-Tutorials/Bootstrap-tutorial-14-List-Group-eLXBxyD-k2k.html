here and welcome to tutorial number
fourteen and in this tutorial i am a
start showing you guys how to do a few
really cool bootstrap things using some
bootstrap components so in this video
specifically we're going to be looking
at the list group component which i
think is really awesome and basically
what this does is just allow you to have
a list that's like enclosed in a box in
each item basically has a border and
stuff so it kind of looks almost like a
table except not really and there's some
really amazing uses for this so I'm
going to just show you guys how to make
it and you'll notice that I'm starting
this tutorial off with a container or a
div class of container I've got my row
I've also got a column that is said to
take up the full width of our grid okay
and inside of here
I'm going to go ahead and add my
unordered list so open up this list and
then go ahead and close this list and
then I'm going to add in a class so
class and when I give this a class of
list
- group so in other words where this is
not going to be an unordered list with
bullet points or anything like that
we're actually going to make it into a
list group then I need to add in a list
item and I'm going to end that list item
off and I'm going to give this list item
a class as well so let's go ahead and
say class is going to be equal to list
- group - item so each list item has to
have this class to look good I guess
well yeah it's not going to carry
through the styling if you don't give it
this class and then we can go ahead and
add in some random things so let's just
say this is a he list of fruits I'm
gonna go ahead and copy this now and
just paste it a cup
times and I'll change this to apples
oranges and bananas okay so now we've
got our list of fruit and each one of
these list items has a class if I go
ahead and save this now and we jump back
over to the browser you can see as soon
as I hit refresh I have my list group
show up and each one of these list items
has a border around it which is pretty
cool so this is kind of like a little
menu almost and there's some really cool
stuff we can do with this so let's just
say I shortened the parent container to
about three columns or so so that it
would just be on the side of your
website you can still have content over
here I can go ahead and add a badge to
each one of those list items so if I
take a look at how to do that you just
add a span tag and then we're going to
say ending span okay and inside of the
span tag we can you know add whatever we
want in our badge like the number 14 or
the number two or whatever you really
want to add there and then you just need
to give the span tag a class of a badge
just like that and if I break this down
a line maybe just tidy up my code
slightly just like that and if we come
back here you can see that now we have a
badge
next to excuse me we have a badge next
to our list item which is pretty awesome
okay and that's one cool thing we can do
we can also give each one of these list
items a contextual class or a disabled
class so I'm going to say active as this
class and on my second list item I'm
going to give this a class of disabled
and I might as well just give the last
one a cloth
loss of success I believe is the right
one and that should turn it green so I'm
going to hit save now come back here and
hit refresh and you can see that our
active list item has now turned blue and
our badge changed somewhat we've got a
disabled list item which you can see the
cursor is now different as well so we
now have a cursor with that like
disabled sign and yeah this this list
item is disabled okay I was wrong about
that success class unfortunately it is
going to have to be list list - item -
success and Wow it's actually quite a
long loss its list
- group - item - success and you can use
this kind of class to add in any one of
those contextual classes so a list group
item success is going to turn it green
then you know danger will turn it red
warning would be that orange color and
so on info would be the blue the light
blue so let's go back here and take a
look and you can see that now I've made
a green list item just like that and
like I said you could use any one of the
other colors as well so a danger we'll
make it red just like that
awesome so that is how to use the list
group component in bootstrap and that is
all I have for you guys in this video so
