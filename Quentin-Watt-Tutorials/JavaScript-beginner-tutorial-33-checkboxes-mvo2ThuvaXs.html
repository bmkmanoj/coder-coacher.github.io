here and welcome to tutorial number 33
and in this tutorial I'm going to speak
to you guys about form validation using
check boxes so check boxes work very
similar to radio buttons and if you guys
watch the previous video and then went
ahead and watch this video you're
probably going to notice quite a few
similarities between the code in this
video and the code in the previous video
okay
so to get started let's actually put
some checkboxes on to our webpage now
the way I'm going to do this and this is
kind of just the practical example of
where you would use a check box in on a
website in the real world let's say we
were we had an online store and we were
selling different items but they could
be put under categories like electronics
tools sports etc okay we give the user
the option to tick like sports or
electronics as like something that was
an interest to them and we could send
them a male based on just what they're
interested in hearing about instead of
sending them a mail unlike everything
that we sell okay so let's go ahead and
just add in a paragraph over here and
I'm just going to say please select the
category that you're interested in or
some categories
okay and then we'll go ahead and give
them some categories that they can
choose from so like I said one could be
sports another one could be electronics
and one could be tools or something okay
and now what I'm going to do is we need
to actually add in our check box so that
would be an input element with a type of
check box and then we're also going to
give it a name a value and an ID now
these are pretty much all the same
attributes that we worked with when
working with radio buttons and we
actually do we actually use all these
same attributes for the same reason that
we used in the previous video so name
would obviously go ahead and put them
all in a group and also it would be a
way to send that value to the server
with a name okay so let's go ahead and
give it a name of interests and a value
of sports and then an ID of sports as
well okay then I actually just want to
add in a break tag at the end of this
just for readability or just make it
neat okay and now I'm just going to copy
this and paste it a few times now for
electronics our value will be
electronics and our ID will be
electronics tools same thing we'll just
go ahead and copy and paste those and
now we can go ahead and save this and if
we run this in Firefox to take a look at
what this looks like you can see we've
got our question at the top here and
we've got some check boxes now here's
the main difference
between a checkbox and a radio button a
checkbox when they were all grouped with
the same name then we could only select
one radio button but a checkbox when we
tick it we can tick all of the check
boxes on the page or we can just take
two or one or whatever like we can check
as many as we want but radio buttons you
could only check one okay no matter how
many were there were no matter how many
of them there were
you could only check one that was kind
of a tongue twister okay so let's go
ahead now and use JavaScript to
determine whether a checkbox has been
checked or not okay so what I want to do
is I'm going to go ahead and use this
function over here
seeing as it's already here in my code
from the previous tutorial the function
is checked and we'll go ahead and check
if something is checked so we'll make
three variables I'm going to call one
sports and I'm going to set that equal
to this element so we're going to go
ahead and say documents dot get element
by ID and obviously we'll grab this idea
over here which is sports and I don't
want to work with the entire input
element I just want to know has this
input element been checked or not
checked okay so I can work with this
property called checked and that will
return a value of true if it's checked
and false if it's not checked okay so
sports will be true if this element was
checked and sports would be false if
this element was not checked okay
now let's go ahead and we'll make a
second variable and that one will be for
electronics
I don't know if I spelled them the same
I get added and obviously that'll be
equal to this line over here but instead
it would be electronics oops sorry I
want to push ctrl C not control V okay
and I think I'll just copy this entire
line again paste that and we'll go say
tools and tools okay so now we've got
three variables and they'll return
whether our checkbox has been checked or
not checked so let's go ahead and create
an if statement to find out if they
haven't been checked okay now if all
three of these checkboxes are not ticked
like they are not ticked right now they
will all return false so our variables
will be false so let's go ahead and
check if all of them are false
if sports is equal to false and if
electronics is equal to whoops
false and tools equal to false okay so
if everything is false then let's go
ahead and just tell the user hey you
need a at least select something I mean
we don't want to let you through to our
submitted page if you didn't even give
us any data to submit okay
so let's go ahead and just alert out
please check a category and we'll also
return false just so that the user can't
go through to the submitted page unless
they actually tick something and then we
can go ahead and say
else and this owl statement will only
run if at least one of these boxes has
been ticked okay so let's go ahead and
just say return true and we'll obviously
just use leave it up to the server to
decide or to store these values but
we'll have to learn a server-side
programming language for that so don't
worry about that just yet but let's go
ahead and refresh this in Firefox now
and now as you can see when I click
Submit I've got this alert box that pops
up and says hey please check a category
okay you can't not have something
checked because that's like you know we
don't want to have you submit no doubt
at all to our page you go ahead and
click OK and you stay right here you
don't go anywhere and then when you go
ahead and click or tick sports and tools
and then you click Submit then you go
through to the submitted page over here
and we've got thank you for submitting
your data and if we check in the top of
the URL okay I've got interests is equal
to sports and interest is equal to tools
so now we know the user has selected
sports and tools but we have to actually
use like some server-side programming
languages to actually take these values
and store them in a database or
something like that you know trying we'd
have to have a server-side programming
to do something useful but that's all I
have for you guys in this video and
thank you for watching please don't
forget to subscribe and please feel free
to like and comment below on the video
and I will see you guys in the next one
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
