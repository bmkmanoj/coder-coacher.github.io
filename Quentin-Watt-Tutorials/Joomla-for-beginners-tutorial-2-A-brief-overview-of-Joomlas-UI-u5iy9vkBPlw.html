here
and welcome to my second Joomla video
and in this video we're actually going
to take a quick look at the backend of
Joomla so I'm just going to explain
basically what all the links are and
where to find everything in Joomla and
after that we should be good to go and
start creating a website so first thing
you need to do is log into the backend
of Joomla which in case you guys didn't
know you just go ahead to your wherever
you're hosting your site so mine's
localhost in a folder called Joomla 33
and you're going to type in
administrator ok and that's going to
take you through to the back end of your
site of course you're going to have to
log in so whatever username and password
you set up whenever you were setting
Djem lab that is what you're going to
have to use to log in and then you will
go through to this page over here which
is the Joomla control panel so whenever
you log into Joomla then it's going to
take you through to the control panel ok
and if we take a look at this control
panel real quick you can see we've got a
menu along the top of the page over here
then we also have a menu along the side
of the page and this menu is actually
only here on the control panel so when
we go through to any other page within
the backend of Joomla this menu is going
to disappear and we are going to use the
menu here at the top ok
and then towards the right of the screen
and also the middle of the screen you
can see we've got a whole bunch of
messages over here so this is just some
messages about post installation of
Joomla
we also have some logged in users which
just so happens to be a super user which
is me actually so you should at least
see one user there and that will be you
if you see more than one user right now
you've got a little bit of a problem
unless you logged in twice with two
different browsers or something like
that ok
then we've got
popular articles and some site
information so the rest of the stuff
really isn't too interesting but let's
take a look at what this menu does or
where this menu will take us okay so
first of all we've got the little Joomla
logo over here and if you click on that
that's going to take you right back to
where you are which is the Joomla
control panel so whenever you click on
that logo it's going to take you to the
control panel okay if we click on system
that's going to open up a little
drop-down menu and we've got a bunch of
different options to choose from over
here so we can go back to the control
panel which we're already here we can
also go check out global configuration
and there's actually a bunch of settings
that will probably change in here later
on so when we start creating our site
there are probably some default things
that we want to turn off and we'll do
that in the global configuration global
check-in you don't have to worry about
that
it's a little bit of boring thing then
we've got clear cache and that is just
if there are problems with your site in
other words like images on loading or
you've got old images that are loading
or something like that you might want to
clear the cache so we've got that button
over there or that link rather purged
expired cache same thing really system
information will obviously give you some
information about the system that you're
running Joomla on uses now you guys
probably aren't going to have to deal
with this for now but this is where
you'll be able to create a new user or
manage existing users you'll be able to
create user groups or access levels for
different users okay and like I said
right now you should be a super user so
if you set Joomla up on your computer
then you should be a super user if you
want somebody else to have all the same
permissions as you then you can go ahead
and add a new user and just make sure
you add them as a super user you can see
you've also got an option
to mass email clients or mass email
users and you should be able to do that
whenever gathering an email list so if
you have users that are signing up on
your site already you can email them
straight from Joomla but we're probably
not going to work with any of this for a
little while first we want to actually
learn how to create a website in Joomla
and then we'll come back to all of the
stuff okay then let's take a look at
this menus button and all this menus
link rather and this menus link
basically takes us to the menu manager
now over here we can add a new menu or
if we go to the menu manager we'll be
able to edit existing menu so you can
see we've got two menus here which our
main menu and use a menu and we actually
have shortcuts to those menus over here
okay and these menus are menus that will
show up on the front end of our website
so if I come back to the front end of my
website over here you can see I've got
one menu which is actually over here and
right now it only has one menu item
which is home but if you wanted to make
another page or a link to another page
you could go ahead and carry on adding
links to this main menu and they will
appear in this this little section of
the website okay I'm not sure if we're
actually using this menu user menu I'm
pretty sure that's not being used at the
moment so that's why we can't see that
okay now let's take a look at content
quickly and content is basically just
content that's on our website so
articles which will be these stories
over here and believe it or not these
can be more than one article showing on
a page at a time so you'll notice that
if we go visit our article manage over
here we might have more than one article
nope okay so we only have one depending
on what content you chose when you were
setting Joomla you might
have some different articles here but
because we chose default English we only
have one article okay we can also add
new articles and we'll be able to edit
articles and stuff from here okay
categories just means we can categorize
these articles and that's nice for
making blogs and things like that or
news websites okay featured articles are
basically just articles that'll have
this yellow star next to them and that
means that they will appear on like
every page or if you have a featured
page for only featured articles let's
say you wanted to feature all your
latest articles then you could go ahead
and add all those articles into the
featured articles section and those will
be the first articles that show up
whenever a user visits that specific
featured page media manager is just
where we can go to upload images and
stuff like that so if you want to add
images or videos or any other files to
your website you could do so in the
media manager okay let's go ahead and
take a look at components now and
components are basically where we would
manage plugins and things like that that
we actually added to Joomla so we'll get
more or we'll learn more about plugins
in the future but basically if we want
to add a feature to Joomla that doesn't
already exist in Joomla there are ways
that you can make a plug-in and there
are plenty people out there that already
made really really good plugins that we
can go ahead and use and so we'll
install those plugins and they'll
probably appear over here in the
components section right now these are
just some default components that Joomla
has then if we take a look at extensions
and if we click on the extension manager
this will take us through to a page
where we can install plugins or install
extensions so exact
what I was talking to you guys about
just now where we can go ahead and
download an extension from a page
something that we might think we want on
our website that Joomla doesn't already
do by default and one example of this
would be if we wanted to include an
image slider or something like that it's
not that functionality doesn't exist in
Joomla by default but there are plugins
that can do something like that we can
go ahead and download those files and
upload them to Joomla and actually add
that functionality to our site module
manager would be certain modules and
these are Joomla is actually made up of
modules so we can go ahead and make
different modules for different sections
of our website and you'll notice that if
I come back here this popular tags
section over here that's probably a
module latest articles that's probably a
module this login form I'm sure that's a
module and this logo is probably a
module as well so if we go back here to
your module manager you can see that
we've got a module for our menu we've
got a module for popular tags latest
articles login form pretty much
everything I just mentioned at the front
end of the site over here so basically
if you want something to appear
permanently on a lot of pages or more
than one page you can go ahead and make
it once in a module and then that module
can be set to which pages you want them
to show on and we can have those modules
appearing on the pages that we want them
on okay so that's pretty much what
modules are plugins again I was under
extensions template manager now this is
something that's really cool okay you'll
see that right now are we using this one
or this one and ok we're using one of
these templates I think Isis is for the
backend and Prostar is what we're using
in the front but basically Joomla is
made up of different templates and it's
plate is basically just the skin so I
can go ahead and change my skin to
Hathor and you can see that the entire
back-end of Joomla has just changed so I
was actually changing the administrator
skin so if I maybe just find my way back
to template manager okay I actually
change the backend template so let's go
ahead and change that back to Isis and
this is default the default joomla
template and we might as well just leave
that for the backend just like that
let's go ahead now and we're going to
change the front-end skin so right now I
think the front-end is using Pro star so
here you can actually see the locations
we've got administrator and
administrator these will be back-end
skins for the backend of Joomla and
sites will be front-end skins for the
front-end of Joomla in other words this
page over here so right now we're using
Prostar we can go ahead and change that
to B's 3 and that's going to change the
entire skin of the front-end of our
sites a year you can see that our
website has indeed changed in fact the
side menu that was on the side over here
is now actually on the left and we put a
different picture over here we've got a
whole different menu so yeah that's
what's really cool about Joomla is we've
got the ability to actually create these
templates and we're going to learn how
to create a template later on in the
series but basically this template will
then change the front-end look of the
website but it's not going to get rid of
any of the content so you'll still be
able to keep pretty much all the content
that's already there which is this
article and all of these modules and
stuff I got okay
so let's change that back and we can
look at the next thing which is just the
language manager which I guess isn't
really important because we're going to
be working in English in my tutorials
if for some reason you want to work in a
different language you can go ahead and
maybe look at that yourself help there's
basically links to joomla forums and
things like that
and this will take you to basically
places where you can get a lot of help
if you don't know how to work with
Joomla although this is why you got my
tutorials I'm going to continue making
tutorials for you guys and that way I'll
be helping you as well okay and if you
ever want to log out of Joomla you can
just go ahead and click on the skier
icon and click log out or you could edit
your account and that is pretty much all
I have for you in this video so don't
forget to subscribe and please feel free
to leave a comment like or share this
video it's really going to help my
channel grow and I will see you guys
