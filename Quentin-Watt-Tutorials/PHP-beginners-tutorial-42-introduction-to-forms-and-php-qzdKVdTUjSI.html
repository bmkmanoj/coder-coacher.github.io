here and welcome to tutorial number 42
and in this tutorial I'm finally going
to start talking to you guys about how
to work with forum values and PHP okay
now I realize I haven't uploaded a video
in quite a long time so I'm pretty sure
a lot of you guys have been waiting for
this video and I'm sure that even more
of you if you guys haven't been watching
these videos as I uploaded them have
still been waiting for this video just
because now we are finally going to work
with HTML elements or HTML controls that
can send data back to the server and we
can make a much more user interactive
program okay so if you've been like if
you're a developer this is pretty much
what you've been waiting for now in
order to do that we're going to have to
make use of forms which are an HTML
element so I've gone ahead and just put
in some basic HTML 5 code nothing that's
complicated if you guys don't know what
this code is you need to go back and
watch my HTML series and again if you
can still know what forms are I do
explain forms in quite a bit of detail
in my old HTML series so go back watch
that and you should be good to go with
this series but let's go ahead and add
in a form and I'm going to go ahead and
end that form off and in here if you
guys know about forms then you know that
we can include input elements and then
we can use these input elements to get
information from the user so I'm going
to go ahead and say input type equals
text and this will appear as a text box
where the user could type in their name
so let me go ahead here and just type in
the word name and colon just so that
whoever gets this program would pretty
much know what that text box is for and
then let's type in input
type equals submit and this is going to
give us a button that the user can click
on to submit their data once they have
finished typing in their name okay and
we'll give this a value of submits now I
noticed in my HTML series and in my
JavaScript series and a lot of guys ask
me why am I using a submit button when I
could just go ahead and type in the word
button and still get a button show up in
the browser now the reason for that is
because a submit or an input type of
submit will actually submit the data
that's in this form so it's actually
going to send the data somewhere if I
went ahead and just typed in the word
button then it's not going to send my
daughter anyway I'm going to click on it
and just carry on clicking on the button
forever and ever
and so I actually program something for
that button but by default a submit
button has something that it has to do
which is submit the data but again all
of that was actually covered in my HTML
series so if you guys don't know about
this then just go back and watch that
otherwise let's continue okay so
whenever you guys click on this button
let's actually go back to Firefox here
and click refresh okay this is pretty
much what you should be seeing I know I
cheated a little bit and I actually ran
this before showing you guys but this is
pretty much what you guys should see
okay and whenever you click on this
button it should go through to another
page okay so there's two things that are
supposed to happen you're supposed to
send the data that was filled in in this
form somewhere so basically to another
file on your server somewhere where you
can write code to manage basically what
has been typed in here
okay so to do that you're going to make
use of an attribute called action and in
here you're going to put in the file
that you would like to send the data to
okay so this would have to be the actual
full file location but I'm just going to
go ahead and create this file called
handler dot PHP in the same directory as
my index dot PHP okay but I haven't
created it yet so don't worry if you
guys don't know what that file is I
haven't made it yet we're going to do
that in just a second now I want to talk
about the second attribute that we have
to put in here and this is the method
okay and the method is basically how do
you want to send the starter I was
filled in you how do you want to send it
to handler dot PHP so there are two
different options that you could put in
here okay you could put in get which
sends it the get method or you can send
it via the post method which is this
word post okay now I'm going to explain
the difference between get and post in a
future video probably in the next video
so if you guys don't know what the
difference between those two are don't
worry we're going to talk about that in
the next video but let's go ahead and
just keep that method as get for now
okay and let's go back to our browser
and click refresh and when I click on
this button now it says object not found
so we're going through to handler or PHP
or we're trying to go through to handle
it our PHP but it doesn't exist so let's
go ahead and make that file now so I'm
actually going to just copy all of this
code and then say file new and paste all
over here and save this in the same
directory as my index folder call it
Handler dot PHP
done okay and now let's go ahead and
just get rid of those elements and just
put in an h2 element and ending h2
element and this can say something like
handling your daughter okay and
basically now when we go back here and
click on this button
well let's click refresh quickly click
on this button we go through to our
handler PHP page and it actually exists
okay so all we've done here is just
setup a basic template that we are going
to work with for the next few tutorials
on just submitting data from one page to
another okay so that's what I have for
you guys in this video don't forget to

really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
