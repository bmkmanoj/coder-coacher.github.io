to tutorial number 32 and in this
tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about fixed positioning so to
demonstrate that I'm actually going to
make like a little mini website that
we'll be working with over the next few
tutorials and what we can do now is just
go over to our body and as you can see
I've ripped everything out of the body
so I'm starting with a clean body and
what I want to do now is I want to add
in three divs so that's tip number one
right there and then you and I'm
actually going to copy this so that's
the one two and three and for our first
div up at the top here I'm going to give
this stuff an ID of header and the
second death I'm going to give an ID of
main section and then the third death
I'm going to give an ID of footer and
that's just the three different sections
of our website we're going to have a
header in our website say a main section
or a main article and then a footer and
inside my header I'm actually going to
just be boring and add in one heading
one and I'm going to say this is the
header you know that's pretty boring but
anyways and in our main section I'm
going to add in an article header so we
might as well make that slightly smaller
heading to and this is the article and
now we'll obviously have to make an
article with some content so we can
probably add in a paragraph over here
and inside this paragraph we can say
this is the
we could say this website rocks my socks
off cool that sounds a little bit more
interesting and probably gonna have to
copy this quite a few times so awesome
and then I'm I'm gonna need a few more
paragraphs I want content enough content
to be able to scroll so there we go that
is quite a few paragraphs and now what
we can do is go over to our footer and
inside our footer generally you probably
put a lot more content in here but I'm
just going to go ahead and add in an h3
and we can partly just say this is the
footer cool
sweet so let's go and check out what
this looks like in Firefox okay and as
you can see we have a website with the
header and a little article header and
then enough paragraphs that we can
actually scroll up and down and that
probably look really crazy on YouTube so
that's just what I needed and now we can
go over to the CSS side of things and
just style this to look a little bit
better so for the first thing that I
want to do is actually want to take away
the margin and the padding away from
everything and to do that you use the
little asterisk sign and that just
refers to everything on my website
whatever is there and what I want to do
is just say margin is equal to zero
pixels and padding is equal to zero
pixels awesome okay so that's going to
remove all the padding and the margins
and now what I want to do is okay well
probably after you start our header and
we're gonna we're gonna have to style
all three of these things so main
section and the footer
oh sure there we go
cool so for the header I want to add in
a border and that's gonna have to be
enough be big enough for you guys to see
so we'll make it four pixels solid and
red sweet and padding of ten pixels just
to give it a little bit more space and
look a little bit more tidier and margin
for the header I'll start that off with
zero pixels so that's zero pixels on the
top and the bottom and if I have in the
second at property then that is ten
pixels on the left and the right so zero
on the top and the bottom and ten pixels
on the left and the right and we can
probably just copy this oh okay and for
the main section we'll just change the
border to green and I want my margin to
be ten pixels and we can probably copy
that and then put that in the footer and
then the footer can just have a blue
border so let's go ahead and save that
and we can refresh this in Firefox now
and it'll probably look a little bit
more different awesome so now you'll be
able to see the difference between our
header and our article and our footer
and now what I want to do is show you
guys how to use fixed positioning so
let's go over to well if you guys have
ever seen websites like Twitter and
Facebook and Pinterest which I'm pretty
sure all of you guys at least have an
account on one of those things you'll
know that the header is usually at the
top of the page and when you scroll it
usually stays at the top of the webpage
it doesn't like disappear when you
scroll down so that's what a fixed web
that's what a fixed element on your web
page would look like and that's what I'm
going to show you guys how to do now so
let's go over to our CSS and
our header we're going to add in this
attribute called position position and
what we're going to do is set this equal
to fixed and then I'm going to add in
another two attributes and that's going
to be top zero pixels and lift zero
pixels and this just specifies what
position the box must be in on our
websites and that's just going to be the
top left hand corner so let's go back to
Firefox now and click refresh and okay I
should probably put a background color
in there so let's go ahead and add in
background color is yellow yellow so as
you can see quite a lot has actually
changed on our web page with just those
four lines of code and very obviously
the first thing is that we now have a
yellow background inside of our header
which was what we just did lost and then
the second thing is as you can see our
header has gone from being the whole
page wide to only being as wide as the
content inside of our dev and that's
because when you position an element
like this then that's that's what
happens so you can fix this by actually
adding in fixed width if you go back to
your CSS and you add in a width property
you could go ahead and then make your
header as long as you want it to be and
then the next couple of things you can
see is that our element has actually
been pulled out of the flow of the
webpage so instead of having the space
at the top of our webpage where our
header can be we now have the header
floating on top of everything well I
don't want to say floating because it's
not really floated but it's now above
everything like on an on a higher layer
and it's actually fixed so when we
scroll up and down you can see the
header stays at the top it doesn't move
and
all of the other content behind our
header has now moved up to fit the space
where the header would have been if it
wasn't in a fixed position so that's
pretty much what the fixed property does
and if we go back to our CSS then I can
show you guys exactly what the top and
left properties will do if we wanted to
we could probably set our top property
to about 20 pixels and our left property
to about 200 pixels and when we save
this and then go back to Firefox and
click refresh you can see our header now
is 20 pixels down and 200 pixels across
so that's just how the left and the top
property are able to be used just to
position our elements and yeah that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this tutorial so I will see you guys
