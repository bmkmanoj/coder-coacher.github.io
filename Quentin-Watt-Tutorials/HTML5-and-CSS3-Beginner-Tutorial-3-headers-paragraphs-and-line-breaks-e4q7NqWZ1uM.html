to tutorial number three and in this
video I'm just going to show you guys
how to make some paragraphs line breaks
and headers so if you guys watch the
previous tutorial we just left off
having some random text here in our body
but that's not the proper way to do
things so you guys probably noticed if
you played around a little bit off to
that tutorial that it's quite hard it's
not as easy to make a paragraph as you
might think you can't just come in here
and just type in this is a paragraph and
I'm going to spell this wrong
that's paragraph one and okay number two
so you probably noticed if you try to
make a bunch of different paragraphs
like this where you into a paragraph 1
and then paragraph 2 and you save that
and launched it in Firefox yeah you
probably noticed that everything all
appeared on one line even though you
took all the time to hit enter here and
lack space that are all quite nicely in
notepad plus plus when you viewed it in
your browser you still got it all on one
line and that's quite annoying for some
of you but like I said that wasn't
actually the proper way to do things to
make a paragraph in HTML you actually
have to tell HTML that you are going to
make a paragraph and that's just because
HTML is whitespace insensitive so that
just means I could have as much white
space between my two paragraphs as I
wanted every time I come back to Firefox
I'm still just going to get everything
on one line so like I said we actually
have to use a paragraph tag and to do
this we just go smaller than greater
than sign and then we use the key word
which is P and to end it off again just
/p and there we go now we have one
paragraph so our power our first pair
ruff starts here and then it ends here
and then this is our second paragraph so
let's just start it and then end our
second paragraph of yeah oops okay so
there we go now when we go back and
refresh this in Firefox we get two
beautiful paragraphs how would how do
you like that awesome okay so this is
paragraph one and that's paragraph
number two so that was pretty easy all
we had to do was actually just surround
our text with the correct tag and we got
two paragraphs pretty awesome but what
if we wanted instead of having two
paragraphs we just wanted it to skip
down a lot so pretty much what I'm going
to do here now okay so what we had when
we didn't have any tags it was appearing
in one line like this on our browser but
what happens if we wanted it to be two
lines so we wanted to go this is
paragraph one and then hit enter
and then go to this is paragraph two
okay you probably noticed that if we
just try to run it like this we'd get it
all back on one line again so again hTML
is messing us around a little bit but no
worries because all we have to do is
again just use the correct type of tag
and the tag that we have to use which
would be the equivalent of hitting the
enter key and moving it down a line is a
the line break tag and to make a line
break tag obviously it's the smaller
than greater than symbols and then BR
and this is actually one of those single
tags that I was telling you about so we
don't have to have two of them we just
have one and we put it exactly where we
want our interspace to be which would be
over here and like I said when you close
off a single tag you have to have the
forward slash inside the tag but after
the keyword so here it is yet inside the
tag and after the keyword okay so let's
go ahead and save that
and come back and use this in a browser
and as you can see we've got our first
line and then at all bumps down a line
and starts on the second line so that's
pretty cool
that's exactly what we wanted and so now
because we still got a little time and
uh gasps I promised you guys that we
would make a header let's go ahead and
make some headers but the first thing I
need to tell you is that in HTML we
actually have six different types of
headers and they range from the biggest
to the smallest so let's go ahead and
make our first data and to make our
first data we go again we just use the
correct tags which is smaller than in
greater than so on and inside that we
have h1 for 801 and then ending h1 and
like I said they go from the biggest to
the smallest so h1 is going to be the
biggest theta and let's just copy-paste
this a couple times whoops
okay cool let's go what's that one hit a
2 a 2 3 4 5 and hit a 6 cool and like I
said their range from the biggest to the
smallest so then this would be the
smallest header smallest this is a
smaller setter and then these ones will
just be okay well I'm just gonna say
yeah the second biggest hitter third
biggest header medium and second
smallest hitter okay so now we have got
our six different hitters and I can just
go ahead and save that and go back to
Firefox and when I push refresh we get
our six headers and like I said they
would go from biggest to smallest so we
start off with the biggest header which
is header one and then headed to which
is the second-biggest and so forth until
we get all the way down to the header
six which is the smallest data but as
you can see all the headers are bolded
even the smallest one that is is still
bolded because it's a header and it is
more important than the normal text but
that's all I've got for you guys in this
tutorial so feel free to join in on the
next tutorial where we will learn some
more cool HTML but for now thank you for
