and welcome to tutorial number 12 and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about deleting stuff from your SQL table
so we have taken a look at inserting and
updating and yeah now it is finally time
to learn how to delete some stuff from
your table but I do kind of want to
stress and I probably should have
stressed this in a previous video as
well with the update video that there is
a chance you could lose everything in
your table so yeah if you do this if you
do do this delete thing and you do it
wrong you make a mistake somewhere along
the line it is possible that you could
delete everything in the table and that
would be a very very bad thing so of
course you want to do that which means
that it's always best practice to just
go over to your table and make sure you
click export and that will give you the
option to export an SQL version of the
table that you have selected and that
way you can always just restore from a
backup by importing that back into my
PHP myadmin right but now that I've
gotten that out of the way let's take a
look at our table again and I just want
to yeah basically get you guys to
familiarize yourself at the table so in
this case before you delete something
from the table you probably just want to
just check over it and see what
information you're actually deleting and
then jump over to the SQL tab and here
is where we finally get to write our
query and this is very very important if
you don't want to lose the data within
the table you need to make way if you
don't lose all of the data you need to
make sure to type this query really
carefully so the first thing you want to
do is type delete from and then you're
going to want to put a table name so in
this case users and yeah basically this
is the part that I've been stressing
about if you run a quit this query just
like this it's going to delete
everything from the table of
course you don't want to do that so the
very important part here is to make sure
that you add a where clause and then add
in a condition that makes a lot of sense
so in this case if you only want to
select or if you only want to delete one
user then let's go by the user ID so
hopefully you know which what the ID or
user ID of the user is that you want to
delete and then just go ahead and say
where that ID is equal to the ID that
you want to delete in this case I think
I will go with 16 and let's hit go and
that query should run and you can see
that we have now deleted one row but
again if you ran that without a good
where clause if this clause didn't make
sense you might have actually actually
accidentally deleted your entire table
but let's go ahead and take a look and
you can see that we now no longer have a
user with the user ID of 15 he's gone
that was a user that we created in the
previous tutorial called Brad we can
test this out a little bit more so I can
go ahead and delete somebody else from
my table let's try and delete Kenny from
South Park so let's jump over to the SQL
tab over here and I guess we can run the
same query I just need to make sure that
I know what that ID was kind of totally
forgot it
Kenny Kenny was ID 11 so let's jump over
here put that query in and then delete
it where the user ID is equal to 11 and
that will delete Kenny so now he's gone
all right so if we browse that you can
see Kenny user ID 11 is now dead he's
killed from the table so I killed Kenny
anyway now that he's dead I suppose it
is a good time to just talk to you guys
about why I was using the ID in my query
so again I want to make sure that when
I'm deleting something from the table
that I get very specific so I'd rather
use an ID because if let's say I said
name is equal to something like John or
Quinton and I had like five or six
John's or five or six Quinton's in my
table I might accidentally delete too
many people that's why it's a good idea
to just whenever you're deleting a row
delete by a primary key
like ID anyway now that we have got that
out of the way and now you know how to
delete things or rows out of your table
one row at a time go ahead and give it a
try make sure to always have that way
close in there because you don't want to
accidentally delete everything from the
table and yeah
