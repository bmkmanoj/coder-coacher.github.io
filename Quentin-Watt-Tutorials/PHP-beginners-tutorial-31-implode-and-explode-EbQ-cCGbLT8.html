here and welcome back to tutorial number
31 and in this video I am going to start
talking to you guys about some really
cool array functions that we can use in
PHP and we're probably going to be
talking about these array functions for
the next few tutorials so just stay
tuned and there will be some exciting
stuff to learn okay but in this tutorial
we are going to be specifically taking a
look at the implode and explode
functions okay so let's take a look at
the implode function first and basically
what that does is take an array and then
implode it into a string so it basically
joins all the values in the array into
one long string so let's take a look at
how to do that but obviously first we
have to make an array so I'm going to
make an array called people and
obviously we going to set that equal to
a row and we'll put in four values yeah
so 1 2 3 4 and I think the first one can
be me we did it's about time I put
myself in my tutorials again and then
we'll say Courtney and then the next one
can be Samantha and the last one will be
Shawn so all of them just good friends
of mine and now we can take a look at
using this implode function so obviously
you're just going to type in the
function name which is implode and this
function takes two arguments
okay the first argument is am the
joining character or like the joining or
joiner so this is basically when you
join Quintin onto Courtney what do you
want to join these two words
in the string okay so I'm just going to
go ahead and use a space so now there
will be Quinten space Courtney and then
Courtney space Samantha and Samantha
space shorten so that's basically the
just the joiner that's going to be in
our string and then the next thing is
obviously the array that we want to
implode so since we made this array
called people let's go ahead and use
that now of course I should probably
save this result in a variable so let's
make a variable here we'll just call it
new string okay so new string is going
to be equal to a string that is made by
this implode function now let's go ahead
and just echo out a new string okay and
when we do this go back and click
refresh we now have quinton space
courtney space Samantha space Sean okay
and just to give you guys a better idea
of what this first part does if I go
ahead and put in like a semicolon or a
colon rather in here and then save it
and click refresh now we've got our
colon dividing well two spaces a space
colon space okay so that's basically
what joins our array elements when they
get converted into a string that's what
this is over here okay so that's how to
use the implode function now let's take
a look at how to use the explode
function so basically what that does is
take in a string and then explode it
into an array so that we might as well
just copy
I mean comment those out because we're
not going to use them right now and
let's make a new string over here or
just a string rather and we'll set this
equal to
some random string the key to
immortality not dying first person to
guess where that is from gets a thumbs
up from me okay so now let's go ahead
and use this explode function and
basically what it's going to do is
explode all of these words into an array
okay so to do that we obviously type in
the function name which is explode and
then we've got to put in our parentheses
okay and this our function also takes
two arguments and the first argument is
going to be where do you want to explode
the string so if I go ahead and I use
the spaces that means my first array
element will be the my second array
element will be key the next one will be
two etc so if I go ahead and just use
the space as the place that I want to
explode this completely forgot was what
I was going to say but if I use the
space to explode the string then we'll
get each word in its own array element
okay then the next thing is obviously
the string that we want to explode so
string and again we should probably be
storing this in a variable so I'm going
to go ahead and just make a variable
here and we'll call it a new array man
don't you just love my naming
conventions they're just so good okay
okay so now let's go ahead and just echo
well we can't just echo out an array so
we're going to have to use a for each
loop okay
and obviously this for each loop we'll
take in the new array as value and then
in here we'll just go ahead and echo the
value out okay so if you guys don't know
how to go how to watch for each loops
you go back and watch my previous
tutorial and I explain all of that okay
but basically what we're going to do now
is just loop through the array and print
out each element so we should get this
entire sentence and now that I'm
actually looking at this I should
probably just put in a break tag so that
everything appears on a new line so
let's go back here and click refresh and
now we have the key to immortality not
dying I'll print it out and they're
actually printed out as array elements
just like that so that's how the implode
and explode functions work obviously the
implode making a string out of an array
and explode taking a string and turning
it into an array so that's all I have
