Quinton here and welcome to tutorial
number nine in this PrestaShop series
and in this video I am going to show you
guys how to set up a courier so you can
send all of the stuff that customers
have bought on your store to their door
and yeah it's quite simple so the first
thing you've got to do is log into
PrestaShop which you can see I'm already
logged in and I'm logged in to the cloud
version this time so if you've been
watching along with the series I have
been using my local host for the vast
majority of all the videos in fact it
was pretty much all of them until now
and the only reason why I decided to use
the cloud is just because this is
slightly more up-to-date but now that
we're logged in I can go over to
shipping and of course that's where I'm
gonna set up a carrier so you can see
the first menu item over here is for
carriers so I'm going to click on that
and that's going to take me through to a
page where I already have to demo
carriers setup so one is the option for
a client to pick their product up in
store and the other one is delivery next
day and you can take a look at these
carrying carrier options if you want to
but I'm gonna just go ahead and add a
new one by hitting this add new button
up here in the corner and that's going
to take me through to a page just
basically explains what I need to do
with my carrier so needs to have a
proper carrier registered in PrestaShop
blah blah blah you can read all three
read through all of that when you get
the chance but I'm gonna hit add new
carrier and that's going to take me to
this page where I get to fill in all the
information so you'll notice that on the
side over here we've got an option for a
logo to show and that logo is what
we add using this input box but let's
take a look at giving our carrier a name
so I'm just gonna say Quinton's carrier
transit time however at many hours it's
going to take to send this to a client
so let's say 48 hours two days
SpeedGrade let's just give that a B
since there's already a Next Day
Delivery and that would be speed a I
guess we could look for a logo but I
don't have one and it is optional so I
think I'll just leave that for now and a
tracking URL if you have one you can
place over here okay so let's go next
and grade is invalid okay
oopsie what do I have to do grade two as
a does it have to so it has to be
numerical I assume okay then let's take
a look at shipping locations so this is
where your carrier can ship to and also
you want to add handling costs or do you
want this to be free shipping so let's
go free shipping yes handling costs
we'll leave and then where do we ship -
I'm gonna say Africa and we can always
add a new range or add tax depending on
way you are how tax applies so I guess
this is kind of different for everyone
but let's go ahead and say next okay
size weight and group access so this is
like your maximum package height or your
maximum package dimensions basically so
you don't want to send a package that's
too big with the wrong career and that's
why you've got these little options to
fill in
you can also set group access and I'm
gonna say like if you have an online
shop
the chances of letting visitors and
guests buy stuff without
logging-in means you don't have their
details and stuff so generally I
wouldn't let them buy anything and I
wouldn't let them ship in anything
either so we can just take those access
or rights away from them by doing that
and we can say next and finally we have
some little summary about our carriers
we can see that the name is Quinton's
Korea it's free deliveries announced in
48 hours basically everything that I
just filled in and I can set this to
enabled yes or no and I'll leave it as
yes for now so we can take a look at
this in the front end okay so now that
that's set up I can go over to a product
and I should be able to check if it's
all working if I just click on one of
these products and hit edit and let's go
to shipping we can assign a carrier to
this so there we go
coincidence carrier is set up and I can
actually assign this carrier to a
product of my choice so how cool is that
that's how to setup a carrier in
PrestaShop and that is all I have for
you guys in this video so don't forget
to subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like and share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
