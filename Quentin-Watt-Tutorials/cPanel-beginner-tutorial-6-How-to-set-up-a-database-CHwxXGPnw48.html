here and welcome to tutorial number six
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to set up on my sequel
database and you could do it in two ways
in cPanel so you could use the my sequel
database option or you could use the
wizard so the wizard is just going to
break everything down into a step by
step process but I'm going to show you
guys in this tutorial how to use this
method and it's the same thing and I'm
going to explain it step by step as if
we were using the wizard but yeah you'll
have to make sure that you don't skip
any steps where the wizard will make
sure itself that you don't skip any
steps so let me just click on my sequel
databases and actually I want to open
PHP myadmin as well so I'm going to open
that in a new tab and then let's go to
MySQL databases and then gives us a
chance to load so right now you've got
my sequel databases open and we've got
the option to create a database so I
just need to give my database and name
and that will create the database when I
click this button but let's take a look
at PHP myadmin first and you can see
right now there is nothing here so like
I said in my introduction video PHP
myadmin again is it's like a tutorial
series all on its own it's such a wide
topic but this is where we will manage
our databases so we'll create tables
delete rows and so on through phpMyAdmin
and we can modify databases here but in
cPanel we have to create our database on
this page so right now you can see that
we don't actually have anything in this
column we've just got information schema
which is something that's going to be
there by default and you should not
change or try and delete this ever so
it's always going to be there and I
don't think you can actually delete it
but yeah just give you a heads up don't
try yeah so now we have this page open
and I want to create a database so I'm
just going to call it Joe's eBay
a Quinton and I'm going to hit create
database and that is going to create the
database so I've got a success message
here the database has been created let
me go back and now you can see I've also
got a warning that I'm using the maximum
amount of my sequel databases because I
only have one and I just created it but
you'll see that the database right now
has a size of zero because it's empty
and we also have no users assigned to
this database and if we want to actually
use this database we need to create a
user so let's scroll further down the
page and here we have the form to fill
in for users so I'm going to create a
user here and let's just call it
jozek bae user password is i'm just
going to use the password generator so
i'm going to copy this tick that you've
copied it and saved it in a safe place
and you should actually copy this and
save it in a safe place I don't intend
to use this password which is why I'm
not saving it but anyway let's click
create user and now you'll see that I
have successfully created my user so
let's go back and now you'll see under
current databases we've got the database
but we still don't have a user here so
we actually still have to assign our
user to the database so scroll further
down the page pretty much all the way to
the bottom and we've got add user to
database you need to select the user and
then you need to select the database
right now I only have the one user and I
only have the one database so let's hit
add and that is going to add Jozy user
to the database
Josie Baek Winton and it'll only give
them the privileges that we tick so we
can take certain privileges only but if
you're trying to set up a wordpress site
or a Joomla site or I mean if even if
you're creating your own PHP site you
generally going to need all of these
privileges so let's just hit all
privileges and make changes and there we
go now we've assigned
the jozek Bay user - jozek Bay Quinton
database and let's go back and now we
have my database and we have a user and
I can always remove this user from the
database by hitting that trash can if I
scroll further down the page all the way
to the bottom again current uses if I
forget my password I can always change
the password over here or rename the
user or delete the user but I'm not
going to worry about doing any of that
so now we've actually set up this
database and we've set up a user if I
were installing WordPress or Joomla now
I would have to take my database name my
username and the password that I created
and put that all into WordPress or
Joomla and run the installation and then
Joomla and WordPress would obviously
create their own tables and place them
in PHP myadmin
but since I haven't done that if I come
back to PHP myadmin now and just hit
refresh I should have a database here
sorry let's just let's go back to the
main cPanel page and click on PHP
myadmin again so we make sure that it
reloads it afresh and there we go I have
my user or I have my database sorry and
my user is assigned to this so it could
start making changes but right now the
database is still empty and I'm not
going to show you guys how to manage and
create databases in this series but I
probably will make an SQL or sequel
series in future so for now that's all I
have for you guys in this tutorial don't
