here and welcome to tutorial number 12
and in this tutorial I am gonna show you
guys how to manage orders in PrestaShop
so we're actually going to be walking
through the entire like sales process
and there are certain things in
PrestaShop that only become available at
certain points if that makes sense so
like you can only refund somebody once
they've already paid and a whole bunch
of like other options I got and these
are things that we are going to be
covering in this tutorial so let's go
over to the orders tab in the side menu
over here and if you click on that it's
gonna show you another orders link kind
of confusing that there's two of them
but click on the second one and that's
gonna take you through to a page that
actually has a list of all your orders
and yeah from here you can see that I
have 13 orders these five you guys
should have by default those are kind of
just set up so you can see what an order
looks like and PrestaShop and then these
others was kind of like me just testing
all these others were me just testing
that's probably better English and from
here you can see that my most recent
order is okay an order by me for 58
dollars and 85 cents and that is an
order that I created here in the front
end so I just picked the product place
the order and then like chose Bank wire
payment and so over here I am now
awaiting Bank wire payment from for this
product or for this order so from here I
can then click on the view button or I
can click on the product column and that
is going to take me through to the order
page with all the information about this
specific order and this first box over
here as you can see has the option to
print an order
there's no invoice available at the
moment because the client didn't pay yet
we're awaiting payment and then there's
also no delivery
you slept just yet because the product
is not delivered right we can always
cancel the product from here and this is
like if you the orders been sitting for
a few days maybe even weeks and you
decide you want to cancel the order you
can go ahead and do that or if the
client phones you and tells you hey I'd
really like to cancel that order
go ahead and do that but hopefully that
doesn't happen and then below that we've
also got the order status so the order
is currently awaiting Bank wire payment
and I could change that to payment
accepted if I can see payment reflecting
in my account or there's a whole bunch
of other options which will run through
during the tutorial documents this is
where we would see invoices and delivery
slips so we can see them they're on and
also underneath the tab then we also
have information about shipping so this
is when the product was ordered which
was actually about 20 minutes ago that
was me
then we have a type which is obviously
delivery so it's not a gonna be
collection or anything like that that's
not what the customer chose then my
carrier who or the carrier that the user
chose when they decided to purchase the
item and the weight is obviously one of
the product attributes that you have to
put in and so on actually I don't know
why I'm running through all of this but
yeah like that's where all that
information comes from and we can add in
a tracking number but I would only do
that once the products out for delivery
okay cool so below that we have a box
for payment and right now it's empty
because the product has not yet been
paid for but we'll take a look at this
in just a second
when we do add a payment option or when
we do add payment then below that you
can see the products that were ordered
on this order and we can actually edit
this so I can change the quantity if I
wanted to or something like that and
then on the other side we've got
information about the customer so this
is who ordered the product which was me
and I registered my account during that
time I've placed five orders before and
I've spent 290 dollars and 13 cents at
my own store can you believe it and then
below that we also have an option for
messages so there this is like if you
ever have a delay you can let the
customer know that there was a problem
and that will all show up if they click
on this order number over here or in the
details button to see details about the
order okay so once our order has been
placed we can then check to see whether
we've received payment or not and if
payment has been received we can update
the status over here
and updating the status to payment
accepted can be done in one of either
two ways we could just change the status
over here to payment accepted and that
is going to then create a payment over
here of the exact amount that the order
was placed for which is 58 dollars and
85 cents but if you guys want a manually
place in the number you can also place a
payment method in over here and place in
the amounts so that's maybe if the
client has underpaid or overpaid you do
have the option to put that in here and
then it'll let you know that the client
is a paid or underpaid but yeah if
they've paid the exact amount and you
know that they've paid the exact amount
this is a little bit easier just go
ahead and change that to payment
accepted hit update status and that is
going to change the status to payment
accepted which is green and if we go to
the front end of the site you can see
that I've got this order that's awaiting
payment and if i refresh it should
change to payment accepted and one thing
you'll notice is there's now a PDF
invoice to download so the client has
the option of viewing the invoice and we
also have the option of viewing the
invoice now over here and that is only
because payment has been accepted so we
now have an invoice great so from there
we also have the option to add a
standard refund or a partial refund
let's say if something goes wrong with
the invoice or the customer doesn't
decides I don't want their product
anymore
and go ahead and do that and those are
the two new options once that the status
has actually been updated to payment
accepted but I'm gonna go ahead and
update the status now to shipped because
I've packed the product and I'm sending
it on its way to the clients so I want
to ship the product and what I want to
do is actually add in a tracking number
over here as well
so let's hit update and yeah I seem to
get that error a lot an error occurred
while sending the email I don't know if
I've set up my email settings in
PrestaShop so yeah there there is an
auto number but I still need to check or
change the status to shipped so let's go
ahead and update that and now it should
send all that information to the
customer anyway and then from here in
the front-end I can then view the status
of my order again so let's just hit
refresh and now instead of being a
payment accepted it is shipped and I can
click on details and that's gonna open
some details down below so I've got some
details about the order and the most
interesting part I wants to show you
guys here now is that we have a tracking
number which is the tracking number that
we added in down there great so the
client can see their tracking number and
track their order with a courier or
carrier and another new option item I
guess is that we have a delivery slip
now so now that the product is out for
delivery the customer needs to receive a
delivery slip so that is available and
we can go ahead and print that if we
want to and those are also ended
documents so we've now have our delivery
invoice and a delivery slip
and yeah that is pretty much what
becomes available once the product has
been shipped then we can also change the
product to deliver it so when I know
that the client has received their
product and I've received a sign that
delivery slip or something I can go
ahead and update the status to delivered
and now I know that the client has their
product and ideally like this is where
the chain ends so if you make it this
far and there is a problem and you need
to manage returns then PrestaShop has
all of that covered too so just make
sure that you go over to the menu over
here and choose the merchandise returns
page or click on that and that is going
to take you through to a page where you
can enable returns so by default this is
turned off in PrestaShop and you
actually have to turn it on
and then you also need to add in a time
of validity so this is how long you are
willing to do returns for the client if
it's 14 days then you know that's up to
you or if you are on it to be like 31 or
whatever just go ahead and add that in
there and once that has been enabled and
you've added your time of validity and
saved then the customer should be able
to go over to a order click on details
and when all of that loads down here at
the bottom they should have this make
RMA slip button appear so if it didn't
appear before then you that's why
because that was not enabled so go ahead
and enable it and then the customer is
able to make an RMA slip so this is kind
of just a slip to let you know that they
want to return their product and that
you need to accept or deny their return
request so yeah I totally made a mistake
over there let me go back to my account
and older history again and yeah
basically I need to first select my
products before I hit that make RMA slip
button so back to details and if I
scroll down here okay so I've got a
product that I want to return I need to
tick the box and then I need to give a
reason so I need to say products are
damaged or whatever
hopefully the customer doesn't make the
typos that I do click on the make RMA
slip and that should make your return
slip so there it is waiting confirmation
so if I come back here and i refresh
this merchandise returns page it should
load a new return hopefully one day
great see here we have a return waiting
confirmation if I go ahead and click on
that I can change the status so I can
see that the product is a dress and the
reason for return should be on here
somewhere are they we got ok products
are damaged that was my explanation and
yeah there's not much else to it there's
just some information about this so I'm
gonna change the order or the status of
this to waiting for package and that
just means ok I'm confirming that the
package can be returned and we'll have
to arrange couriers to or carriers to
fetch and carry the stuff back to me
once that's done we can go to the next
step which is package received and then
I can decide whether I want to return
come complete the return or deny the
return so let me just go ahead and
complete that let's just say there was
actually a problem go ahead and save
that now the return is completed and I
can
back to my orders and what I would
probably want to do here is offer the
clients the choice to either have a
voucher or a refund so I'll go to the
order over here and they can then choose
do they want a voucher or do they want a
refund and like there is option you
could kind of give them both but why
yeah so yeah it's just up to you I guess
but let's change the status to refund
and they can get refunded and I'm going
to go ahead and update that hopefully it
loads and from here I can then click on
this return products and that will
return the products that I choose so
let's say that both dresses were damaged
or something I can then add in the
quantity of products that I'm going to
return one or two or whatever and from
there the information is actually all
the way down here in the bottom so it's
quite a big jump from there to here it's
also difficult for my eyes to see that
big gap but yeah I can then choose do I
want to restock the product but if it's
damaged I wouldn't really want to
restock it so might leave that box on
ticked generate a credit slip yes we
need to do that because we're refunding
the client and we can repay the shipping
costs as well and if I wanted to I could
generate a voucher by taking this box
but if I'm already refunding them their
money then there's no point in
generating the voucher so you kind of
need to choose do you want to credit
them or do you want to make a voucher
it's up to you then let's go ahead and
hit return products and yeah that should
have sorted all of that out so under
documents we now have a credit slip
which we can then download and take a
look at or file somewhere so you might
come to the point where you want to add
an order for a customer
from the back end and you can do that
with PrestaShop if you go to the orders
page and you click on add new or add new
over here this will take you through to
a page where you get to actually create
an order from the back-office
for a specific customer and once that
has loaded you should have a search box
over here where you get to choose a
customer so I'm going to add in my name
and there we go you can see presto shops
found me so I'll choose that and from
here I have a few options as well
because I could search for products and
just add products manually to this order
or I could use one of the clients carts
so this is like my card history the four
previous carts that I had and I can go
ahead and just choose to use one of
those and I'm just gonna use the most
recent one I can still add products
manually to this order afterwards if I
decide that the client is missing
something that they need and of course
if I have their content I guess and then
from there if I scroll further down I
have the option to search for a voucher
or add a new voucher for this customer
so if you guys want to create a voucher
let's go ahead and just click on that
button and this is going to load a modal
window where I can give my voucher a
name so let's just say Quinton's
voucher description I could go ahead and
put the description in the code I'll
generate one and I'd say the rest these
options are fine like you get leave her
to you to decide if you want to add
priority or partial use to this and so
on partial use I'm just going to leave
that as yes actually so I kind of need
the ones total available one and I need
to limit to a single customer I want to
do that yes so just add Quentin
there we go cool so I can limit it only
to me so that not everybody can use this
code minimum amounts I'm just gonna say
like okay
as a condition the customer has to spend
at least ten dollars to make use of this
pouch and then actions this is necessary
we don't have to do free shipping or
gifts or anything but we need to apply
some kind of a discount or we could do
free shipping but yeah I'm just gonna do
the discount and we'll say 15% discount
if they spend $10 or more go ahead and
apply discount to order without shipping
yes that's good go ahead and save
obviously you can choose whatever
options you want to I'll let you guys
decide the reduction percent is invalid
interesting it might have been because I
put the percentage sign in the actual
action sorry
now I have to a follow this to load okay
safe
great awesome so now I can choose to use
that voucher if I want to or send the
code to a customer go ahead and close
this now and yeah that was how to create
an order and create a voucher and when I
create the order here at the bottom it's
going to create an order and the
customer can then manage payment and
we'll go from there
so yeah you kind of run through the rest
of this process already and I that's all
I have for you guys in this tutorial so
