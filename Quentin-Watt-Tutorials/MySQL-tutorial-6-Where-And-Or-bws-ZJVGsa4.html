here and welcome to tutorial number six
in my my sequel series and in this video
I'm going to talk to you guys about the
and and the all clauses in my sequel so
if you guys haven't watched the previous
tutorial on where clauses you need to go
back and watch that because yeah we make
use of the where clause in this tutorial
as well and yeah basically what the end
and the all clauses allow us to do is
add some extra filters to query so
basically get to add a little bit more
search power to our query alright so to
start this tutorial off it's probably
going to be a lot easier if you just
familiarize yourself with the addresses
table so we have a couple of fields in
this addresses table so we've got
address ID user ID address lines one two
three city states underscore province or
zip so these are the columns and if you
want to browse the table you can see
that we've got a couple results in here
and yeah now that you've seen that let's
go back to the sequel's hab and actually
start writing some SQL right so I'll you
I should already know that if we want to
search through some search for something
in our database we can run a select
query so let's select and let's select
everything from and in this case I want
to make use of the addresses table but I
don't want to select everything from the
address the table because it's kind of
boring so let's add in a folder over
here and I'm going to add in a where
clause which you should have learned
about in the previous video but let's
filter by the state of the province so
let's say where the state or province
state underscore province in these
addresses is equal to Western Cape and
you guys should know from the previous
tutorial that this is just going to
return some results of whoever lives in
the Western Cape but let's hit go just
so we can see the results and you can
see that there are to be
we happen to live in the Western Cape
and I'm thinking that this is way too
many results what happens if I want to
narrow down the amount of results that
I'm getting by adding in an extra filter
well that's where the and clause comes
in handy so let's go back to the sequel
tab over here and put that exact same
query in Fortune Gear copied and pasted
it and yeah what I'd like to do now is
add in an end clause and what the end
Clause allows us to do is add in a
second filter so we get to add in a
second one of these things basically a
second rule that has to be met in order
for our query to be true and yeah if
that rule is met maybe we'll get to
narrow down some results in our search
query so instead of filtering by state
or province which we've already done
let's now search by city and I want to
find out who lives in Cape Town and also
has a province set to the Western Cape
right so let me just copy that and head
go and yeah you can see we now have
narrowed down our search results so
instead of having to search results by
putting a one search result there's only
one person who happens to live in Cape
Town in the Western Cape
so the and flaws allows us to get really
really specific about who were searching
for by just adding in an extra field and
the great thing about this is you can
use as many and clauses as you want
so let's go back here
but let's clear out some of these fields
let's search through a database for
everyone who lives in California and
yeah I'm just going to hit go and see
what happens all right okay so we have
two results over here these guys both
happen to live in the province of
California so if I run my query again
but add in an and clause so let's say n
and add in a value over here
so the previous query that we did was
where the city is equal to something so
let's search and see who lives in South
Park City all right copy that and hand
go and you can see we've got two results
again it's the same two guys I'm really
not knocking anything out by filtering
by the city as well so let's see what
other field could I search by while I
can search by the address line one so
let's copy and paste that same query
back in here and I'm going to add in a
third field so I'm just going to hit and
or type in end and we're address
underscore line underscore one happens
to be equal to something and I know
let's just say at this point I know the
specific address of the person I'm
searching for I can add that in as a
third feet falter and now we have three
filters so we've got where the province
is equal to California and where the
city is equal to South Park and where
the address line 1 is equal to 28 201
ebin and the street which I think
happens to be Kenny's address in South
Park and let it go and there we go we
only have one person returned in our
query so yeah the and Clause allows us
to get really really really really
specific by just adding in more and more
and clauses and yeah if these are true
and our query runs we'll hopefully knock
out a few of the unnecessary results but
yeah now that we know how to use the and
clause and we know we can just keep
adding and closes in as much as we like
let's take a look at how to use the or
Clause
so yeah the or Clause works in pretty
much the same way so I'm going to write
in a new query over here and let's
select everything from addresses again
this time let's add an away clause for
where the state underscore province is
equal to and in this case let's search
for everyone in California again right
and we already know what happens if I
run this query but let's hit go and yeah
you can see we have these two guys from
South Park but sometimes like using the
end clause in this case would only
narrow down our results sometimes we
have the we want we want to have the
ability to add more results to our query
so our query is to specific right now
we've only got two results I want to
maybe add in another query over here so
let's search for anybody who lives in
the state or province of California or
anybody who happens to live in the state
province state or province stink
province of the Western Cape so we have
a relative to Western Cape and now
instead of having two results I should
have four results so they take go and
yeah here we go we have four results now
so we've got the guys who live in
Western Cape and we've got the guys who
live in California and yeah that is
pretty much how the query the or Clause
works is if you find that you are
getting too few results then you might
want to just not be so specific and you
can add in an or clause and yeah use
that to add in some extra results which
is nice for like a property website I
guess if you were looking for anybody
like if you were looking for one suburb
or another close suburb doesn't really
matter anyway hopefully this tutorial
was helpful and you guys now know how to
use the and and the all clauses in my
sequel right so that is the end of the
