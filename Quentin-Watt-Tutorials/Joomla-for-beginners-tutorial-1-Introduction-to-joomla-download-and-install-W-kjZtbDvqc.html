to my very first tutorial on Joomla and
in this video I'm going to show you how
to download and install Joomla on your
localhost and over the next couple of
videos we're actually going to take a
look at how to use Joomla and also we're
going to learn what Joomla is capable of
doing so first of all what is Joomla
Joomla is one of the most popular CMS's
in the world and CMS stands for content
management system this means that we as
developers can build this really super
awesome website and then go ahead and
sell it to a client and they can easily
update content on their website with
very little knowledge of HTML in fact
the client probably won't need to learn
HTML at all and they will still be able
to update content on their website so as
a result if you want to get a job
anywhere as a developer you will notice
that Joomla is almost always going to be
one of the requirements and that's
actually why I decided to make this
tutorial series I really thought it
would be great to equip you guys with
the skills that you need to get a job as
a developer okay
so my next thing I want to talk about is
why would we use Joomla now other than
the fact that it's really easy for
clients wow this phone is going crazy
let me just get rid of it okay I threw
it across the room now
where were we okay so why would we use
Joomla other than the fact that it's
really easy for clients to update their
websites themselves after sales Joomla
also has a bunch of really cool tools
that can make our lives as developers
much much easier and this allows us to
do our job
a lot faster so now let's talk about
what you need to follow along with the
series and the first thing you're going
to need is a good browser I'm going to
use Firefox but if you guys want to use
Chrome then that's perfectly okay with
me chrome is going to work just fine
okay then you're going to need a good
text editor and as always I'm going to
use notepad plus plus that is my trusty
text editor I love it I love to use it
but if you are on a Mac then you can't
use notepad plus plus so I recommend
that you switch over to sublime text and
I'm going to leave some links in the
description below so you can check those
out okay now since I'm going to install
Joomla on my localhost
I also need to install some sort of
Apache and PHP software now for my
tutorials I'm going to be using xampp
and i'm going to leave a link to this in
the description below and I'll also give
you a quick run-through of what you need
to do to install xampp later on in this
video okay then the last thing you're
going to need to do is download and
install Joomla and that is something
that we're going to cover in this video
as well so first of all let's take a
look at how to download and install
xampp
okay you're going to need to go over to
the Apache friends org website and
you're going to find a link a download
link to download xampp
you can go ahead and click on that and
actually just download xampp and if you
guys want more details on the
installation I do have a video that
covers that and I'll leave a link to
that in the description below but once
you're finished downloading and
installing xampp you should land up with
a program that looks kind of like this
and one thing we're going to need to do
is start our Apache server and then also
start our my SQL server if you have a
problem with
Pachi not wanting to start it's probably
because you have Skype open and Skype
blocks one of the ports that you will
need so if you have that issue that
Apache isn't starting then you can go
ahead and close Skype or you can go
ahead and open Skype and then go to
tools options and advanced connection
and you might want to just untick this
box because by default when you install
Skype that box comes ticked and it
blocks port 80 and 443 which is pretty
much the port that we need to run Apache
as you can see we're using ports 80 and
443 so if you have a problem with this
not starting again just go ahead and
either close Skype or disable that
setting in Skype okay and you should be
good to go
now let's take a look at how to install
Joomla so you're going to go over to the
Joomla website which is joomla.org I'm
also going to leave it as a link in the
description below you can go ahead and
click on download that's going to
download a zip file so once you finish
downloading that you should have a zip
file like this somewhere on your
computer I don't know where you saved it
whenever you chose to save it when you
downloaded it that's where it's going to
be then you can go ahead and right-click
on that and say extract files but you
want to extract them to a specific
location on your computer okay and that
location is actually going to be
probably local disk C or wherever you
installed xampp okay you're going to
have to look for this folder here called
xampp and then open that and inside of a
folder called htdocs that is where
you're going to install your version of
Joomla now I'm actually going to create
a new folder over here so let's go new
folder and I'm going to give this folder
a name so we'll just call it
Joomla 3.3 and I think I'm going to not
have a space in the folder name so
Joomla underscore 3.3 okay and now this
is going to extract all of the files in
this zip file to that folder okay so
we'll just give this a couple seconds to
run and that should be done I don't know
how I got sort of like that error sound
I don't know if you guys could hear that
probably not but once that sub is done
or once you've unzipped those files you
can then make sure that you're running
Apache so just make sure that that's
started and go over to localhost and
then type in the name of the folder that
you created so I called my folder Joomla
underscore 3.3 okay let's visit that and
you can see it takes me over to Joomla
3.3 slash installation so here is where
I'm going to install Joomla and you can
see that it's actually asking me for a
bunch of different settings or a bunch
of different information rather okay so
let's give my side a name we'll just say
Joomla test you could call it anything
you wanted let's go ahead and give a
description of our site testing Joomla
install for tutorial okay we're going to
have to give an email address over here
so you can put in whatever email address
you want to I'm just going to go ahead
and enter what quinton @ gmail.com and
that is my email address but I almost
never respond to anyone's emails so if
you guys are going to email me just know
that I might not respond okay let's go
ahead and give our website a password
and this is a password that we're going
to need to log into our site or into the
backend
our website every time we want to modify
something in Germany and I'm going to go
ahead and just make a password of
password and we'll confirm the password
as password okay site offline we can
leave as no for now if you really want
to put your scientist on offline then
you can go ahead and say yes all it does
is make it that nobody else can see the
site unless they're trying to login with
admin details okay let's go ahead and
click Next and now I need to set up a
database connection okay so that is one
reason why we might have our SQL running
over here and we're going to have to
create a database so it just so happens
that whenever you download and install
xampp right from the start then by
default you have a user which is called
root and you have a password which is
blank so if you leave your password
blank and you're using the username root
then this should actually be able to
connect to the database just fine okay
and now you can go ahead and just give
your database a name so I'm going to say
Joomla underscore tutorials okay and all
database process well I don't actually
have an old database called Joomla
tutorials so it doesn't really matter if
I click backup or remove nothing's going
to happen anyway because I don't have an
old database but you might want to just
if you're trying to install over your
old database you might want to remove
that or if you really want to back it up
that choice is up to you let's go ahead
and click Next and the last thing is
just do we want any sample data when we
install Joomla so in other words do we
want there to be content showing on the
front end of our website by default or
not and I'm going to go ahead and choose
default English just so that we can see
that there's actually
sort of a website going on even if it is
just random Joomla information so just
go ahead and click default English if
you want your website to be the same as
mine email configuration we'll just
leave that and the rest of the stuff
this is all Joomla defaults and we can
leave them as they are okay go ahead and
click install and this is going to run
for a few minutes but once it's done
Joomla should be installed so I'm going
to let this run and I'll get back to you
once it's done okay so my installation
is now done and I can go ahead and click
on remove installation folder okay
and here's a situation or here's
actually a point where you guys might
actually have a little bit of a problem
because sometimes with xampp
you might not be able to complete this
installation it'll just keep loading and
loading forever and if it takes longer
than 10 minutes or you know 15 minutes
then I'd say you really need to try take
a look at this problem or the solution
that I'm going to show you so I've got a
link that I'm going to leave in the
description below and this link is
basically just a link to Joomla forum
and if you if you visit the page
actually going to start from up here at
the top but the solution to the problem
is actually all the way down here where
someone tells you need to look for these
two lines of code okay so what you
actually have to do is go over to your
computer okay local disk C go to your
xampp folder and hit ctrl F search for
PHP dot ini and then go ahead and open
that up okay that should actually open
up a text document and if I just resize
this so we can see it a little bit if I
hit ctrl F over here and search for
Mac's execution okay that is what they
asked us to do here in the form search
for Mac's execution
so going to search for that I can see
that max execution is set to three
thousand which is actually exactly what
he said we need to set it to in the
forum so max execution time three
thousand and we also need a search for
memory limits so let's go ahead and
search for that memory go ahead and say
next and there we go we've got maximum
memory script is set to 128 30s there
okay so this is probably going to be
like this by default the memory limit
but my execution time which was actually
only a few lines above I had to actually
change that to 3,000 and then my
installation would work before my PHP or
my Joomla installation wouldn't work
when I have this at its default value
okay after that you're going to want to
go ahead and save the changes that you
made and close that and hopefully you
should be done with your PHP ini file
okay so that's just a little problem
that you guys might have picked up while
following this tutorial hopefully you
didn't but if you did just make sure
that you restart apache so in other
words you're going to have to click stop
and start and then actually restart your
installation from the beginning again if
that problem did happen to you okay but
if that problem didn't happen then you
should be able to go ahead and remove
all of this and go back to just
localhost and whatever you call your
folder go ahead and hit enter and that
is going to take you to your awesome
websites as you can see this is actually
the website that we just made it's just
the standard Joomla or the default
joomla website once you have finished
installing Joomla ok and you can see
that we've got our big heading over here
we've got a navigation a little banner
image
and on the side with some contents over
here as well okay and if I go ahead and
type in Joomla slash administrator so go
ahead and type in localhost the folder
that you created and then administrator
and that is going to take you to the
back end of your website so here we can
log in to Joomla and these will be with
the details
that you supplied whenever setting up
Joomla which I think I actually put in
my email address which was what a
coincident gmail.com and my password
which is a password I think okay and
then I can log in to Joomla so take a
look at that and this is the back end of
Joomla this is where we're going to be
spending the next few tutorials just
learning how to use Joomla and also just
taking a look at what we can do with
Joomla and that's all I have for you in
this tutorial so don't forget to
