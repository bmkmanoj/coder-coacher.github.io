here and welcome back to tutorial number
23 and in this tutorial we are going to
continue talking about string functions
and I'm actually going to show you guys
how to use the string position function
so what this function does is look for
one string inside of another string so
basically you can use this function to
look for a word or another word inside
of a string which would come in handy
let's say you asked the user to type in
like a message on your website and you
want to look for any curse words or
swear words that they might have typed
in there you can use the string position
function for that okay so let's take a
look at how to use this function and as
always you're just going to type in the
function name which is string position
or STR pause for short and then this
function actually takes two arguments
okay so when you're going to supply two
arguments to a function you're going to
put in the first one leave a comma and
then put in the second argument so
that's how to supply multiple arguments
to a function now the first argument is
basically the string you want to look in
and the second function is the string
you want to look for so in other words
let's say I had the sentence here hello
my name is Quintin what is your name
okay and this will be the sentence that
we're going to look in now the word that
I want to look for over here is name
okay so right now we haven't actually
done anything with this
just echo that out save this again click
refresh and as you can see we have
printed the number nine out on the
screen so let's just go back here and
count that's five characters six seven
eight nine and then the n4 name is
actually on the tenth character so just
keep in mind that whenever you're using
the string position function we're
always going to print out how many
characters there are before the starting
character of the word that you were
looking for
so we basically it always puts the
cursor kind of here if you can imagine
like just before the first letter of our
word that we were looking for but some
of you clever people may have noticed
that the word name actually appears here
in this sentence twice so we've got name
here at nine and then we also got name
right at the end okay so how do we land
up checking for multiple cases or
multiple instances of the word well we
have a third argument available to us
which is basically where do you want to
start looking from in this string okay
so this is going to be an integer value
and I'm just going to type in 13 because
we know that this variable name appears
at nine so we know we want to skip this
word name so basically when we start
from 13 we're starting from here and
we're looking again does name occur
anywhere else in this sentence so let's
go back we'll save that quickly click
refresh and as you can see name does
appear again
at character number 39 which would be
this case here okay so if you guys want
to look for multiple cases of the same
word and print them all out on the same
luck on all yeah in the same kind of run
or refresh you're going to have to use a
loop to loop through the sentence and
look for the word that you're trying to
look for okay so let's take a look at
how to do that now so I'm actually going
to make a few variables quickly so we'll
make this sentence a variable and we can
basically just call it the string as in
the string we want to look for okay and
then we'll go ahead and we'll make this
word name a variable as well and we'll
just call that find because this is
basically the variable or the word that
we wanting to find so put that there
offset we'll just take that out for now
okay and in fact let's make a variable
up here called
offset and I'm going to set that equal
to zero to start off with because we
will start looking from the beginning of
the sentence and then we'll only change
the offset while we're in the loop and
there's one last variable that I want to
make and this is going to be find length
and we're going to set that equal to the
length of the word that we're trying to
look for so STR L in find okay and this
just means that we'll have the length of
this word which we will use inside of
our loop okay so now that we've got all
our variables in order let's take a look
at how to
loop through the sentence and find both
instances of named okay now I should
probably mention that if STR pause
cannot find a word that you're looking
for so let's say I was looking for the
word pizza whoops okay pizza does not
appear anywhere in this sentence so if
we try to throw that into STR pause it
would return back a value of false which
is quite handy because it means we can
use this as a condition in our loop so
let's go ahead and type in while and
we'll make a variable here called string
pause okay and we'll set that equal to
STR pause of string find and offset so
basically what we're saying here is
while we get a value for this variable
string pause okay then we'll go ahead
and do whatever is in the loop and this
variable of string pause will always
return true if we can find the word name
in our string okay with the offset
starting at 0 but this will change as we
as we loop through okay and then when we
can't find the word name inside of our
string so when we can't find name inside
our string then we are going to return
false so this loop will stop executing
okay and that means that we have found
the last instance of name so I'm going
to just go ahead and say echo find and
we'll
a penned on was found at and will leave
a space and append string pause so what
this is basically going to do is say
name because name is equal to find
okay so name was found at string pots so
wherever we found the word name we're
going to echo that out okay and the last
thing we have to do is just say offset
is equal to string pause plus find
length okay and what this is going to do
is take the position where we found name
okay so string pause is the position
where we found name plus the value of
whatever length our word was so string
pause plus 4 in this case okay
and what that's going to do is say okay
next time this loop runs so next time
this actually executes instead of
starting at 0 will start at whatever
position we found name plus however many
characters they are in name so that
means that our loop when it runs the
second time starts over here on the
other side of name so then we're looking
for the next occurrence of name which is
over here then it will print out that
name was found here and then it's going
to skip this look again to see if it can
find name again obviously not and that's
when it returns false and then the loop
stops so let's go back a to Firefox and
click refresh did I save this no I did
not okay go back here and click refresh
and it says name was found at 9 and name
always found at 39
