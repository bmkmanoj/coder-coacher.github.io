to tutorial number 42 and in this
tutorial we're just going to talk about
checkboxes and radio buttons so if you
guys don't know what checkboxes are well
let me just clear this out first so we
don't need that anymore
if you guys don't know what checkboxes
are then they're basically like on/off
toggles so when you click it then like a
tick will appear in the box and that
means it's on and then if you click it
again then the tick disappears and that
means it's off and if you don't really
understand what I'm saying then let's
just go ahead and make a practical
example on the screen real quick so
let's say we were making a website where
we wanted the user to select different
sports that they like then we can just
go ahead and add in the heading three at
the top and just say select the sports
you are interested in and then below
that will obviously have all of our
inputs so let's just go ahead and say
input and here's where it gets different
because instead of saying type equals
text we now say type equals check box
box there we go and then we have to add
in a few more attributes over here and
one of those attributes is the name and
we can just name the sport and the
reason why we give it a name is because
it groups all of our check boxes with
the same name into a group so you'll see
now I'm gonna add in more than one input
and then we'll set a value so this value
needs to be anything we want really so
let's just say football and then the
label will add a label next to it just
so if the user know what the user knows
what the input is for ending label
and we just say football and Ramada so
say of ef4 for football which actually
means we have to go ahead and give an
idea to our input as well ID equals
football now I actually typed all of
this on one line so let me just typed
all of this on one line if I go ahead
and click word rap then you can see it's
all on one line now instead of two lines
and if I but just so that you guys can
see I'll just wrap it again so you can
see everything that I've written here
and now we can probably go ahead and
make quite a few different instances of
this so copy paste and now what we'll do
is we'll leave all of these type
checkbox' and we'll leave all the names
as sport now that means that all three
of these input elements are grouped in a
group which is named sport and then the
value can change so let's say this one
was for rugby which is a very popular
sport where I'm from and we'll just give
it an ID of rugby and then we'll say
over here for rugby and the next one we
might as well include the Americans in
this and we'll say baseball and baseball
okay and hmm what did I do wrong
baseball yeah okay I see what I've done
here
the second one I just need to change
that to rugby as well so this is
probably kind of confusing let me just
go ahead and space this all out cool
okay so these are the three different
input types and then there's three
different labels maybe I should just hit
the labels on two new lines as well okay
so we've got an input box of type check
box and then a label next to that says
football and this is for the football
check box and likewise rugby for the
rugby check box and baseball for the
baseball and we can change that to
baseball that's the problem with
copy/paste is you always gotta learn
that like changing all these random
things and sometimes you forget anyway
so let's go ahead and run this in
Firefox and as you can see we now have a
forum where we can the the user can now
select the sports they're interested in
so if they're interested in football
they can go ahead and say football and
now you can see it sticks which means
now football is on and if you hit an
antic it then that means football is off
so the nice thing about check boxes is
the user can select as many as they want
so they can say that they're interested
in football rugby and baseball and all
of these can be on and if the only one
you know football and baseball then only
the two of them have to be on and if
they're not interested in anything then
they can all be off so it doesn't really
matter but sometimes you might want the
user to select like almost like a
checkbox but at most they must only be
able to select one option so let's say
they only want to select okay you ask
them if they want to be on your mailing
then they can select yes or they can
select no but they can't select yes and
you don't want them to select both in
that case we actually use something
called a radio button so let's just go
ahead and we'll just put that all
underneath here I'll give myself a
little bit of space to work okay
so we'll bring our trusty h3 Vecchia
again and being a ch3 and we can ask
them would you like to be on our mailing
list so now every time you know they
might want an email about football or
rugby or whatever they're interested in
we can then send them a mail if they
take yes and if they take no then we
don't send them a mail so what we'll do
now is add in an input but now instead
of being typed checkbox we use type
radio there's radio and then we name
this
mailing list or list we'll just name it
list and then we'll also just give these
lesser value of yes or if they want to
be on the mailing list then it'll be yes
and we might as well just give us a
label here so label will just say yes
and then for yes for years and we have
to give this an ID now yes
because the ID and the four is what
links the label to the input box and
then we can go ahead and copy this
control-c control-v and then this would
just be no no and no okay and the reason
why we gave these two a name is for the
same reason of the check boxes these are
now grouped together this input and this
input are all grouped together in one
group for list and now that means that
if the user selects yes then they can't
select no and if they select no then
they can't select yes so like in other
words they can't select both of these
radio buttons and let's just go ahead
and let me show you this in Firefox so
now we have our first thing where they
can select as many as they want and it
doesn't really matter but when you go
down to our mailing list they can only
select yes or no so you can see as I
click no than the one in the yes
disappeared and when I click yes then
the no disappears so over here they can
only select one radio button they can't
have two so that's pretty much the
difference between check
axes and radio buttons and that's all I
have for you guys in this tutorial so
stay tuned for the next tutorial where
we will probably be going over select or
yaw select lists or drop-down menus and
that's all I have for you guys so see
