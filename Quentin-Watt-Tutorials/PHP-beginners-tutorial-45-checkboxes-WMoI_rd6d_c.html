here and welcome to tutorial number 45
and in this tutorial we are going to
continue talking about how to retrieve
data from forms but in this video we are
going to be specifically focusing on
check boxes okay so let me just explain
the code that I already have which
basically all the standard html5 code
but in my form I've got only a submit
button at the moment and when I click on
my submit button all the data is going
to be submitted to handler dot PHP so
pretty much the exact same setup as my
previous tutorials and in handle adop
PHP I've just got my default template
here where I on my html5 code again and
then just a header that says handling
your daughter and in this PHP element
that's where we will just display
whatever data we handled okay so let's
go ahead and actually put in some check
boxes on our page okay because right now
our web page is just a submit button so
let's put in some check boxes so I'm
going to ask the user question I'm going
to say do you play League of Legends
because you guys all know that I play it
D play League of Legends and I'm going
to place in a break tag over here just
so that everything else will appear
underneath this okay and then we'll give
the answer yes so the user has the
option to take yes and let's just put an
input element of type is equal to
checkbox and then value is equal to yes
so that the user can click on this
checkbox and
we'll send through a value of yes and
then we just need to give this a name as
well so I could name this yes but I
think I'm going to name this checkbox
just so that checkbox one just so that
it has a different name to the actual
value so you guys will be able to see
where I'm using a name and where I'm
using a value okay and then I'm going to
end that off and place in a break tag
and I'm actually just going to duplicate
this line because we're also going to
give the user the option to click know
that they don't play League of Legends
this must still be a type of checkbox
the value will send through is going to
be no and the name will give this is
checkbox to okay so now let's go ahead
and save this and when we refresh us in
our browser we've got do you play League
of Legends yes or no and actually both
of them can be ticked but let's just
assume that they're only going to tick
one okay now let's go ahead and use some
PHP to actually handle all of the start
that we're going to send through so in
handler dot PHP you might be thinking
after my previous tutorials that hey
okay if we're going to grab these values
then let's go ahead and just create a
variable over here so we'll create a
variable for yes and we'll set that
equal to dollar underscore post yes or
what is that it was actually checkbox
one so you might think okay well we can
store yes in checkbox one or the value
of check was one in yes sorry and then
we could do the same thing for no except
will say checkbox - but this is actually
going to give us a little bit of an
error so let's go ahead and save this
and I'll show you what I mean
okay let's go ahead and click yes and
when I click Submit now I've got an
arrow over here undefined index checkbox
too and you guys know that checkbox to
is actually our know checkbox okay
so let's go back here and this means
that if the user leaves one of these
boxes and ticked we're going to get an
error so let's go ahead and click no and
now we get checkbox one is undefined so
how do we get around this well we
actually have to start using an if
statement to kind of check which are one
of these check boxes were actually
selected okay and I'm going to go ahead
now and just delete all of this code
because we're going to have to use an if
statement so we're going to check if the
user take yes or if the user ticked no
okay and the way we do that is by using
a function is built into PHP called is
it okay and this function checks if a
value is set so kind of a useful name
right there and we'll say if is set
dollar underscore post and then we'll
check for check box one
so if check box one is ticked then we
know that we've got the value yes and
through so we'll make a variable called
yes and we'll set that equal to this
line over there otherwise so let's make
an else statement and we'll say else if
no is checked so basically if is set we
can just copy that
so else if got to put in some brackets
here and then got put in is set and then
we can go ahead and well I actually
overlapped what
okay so if is it checkbox too then we
know that no is actually checked okay so
then we can make a variable called no
and we can set that equal to checkbox to
some going to copy and paste again and I
guess all this copy and paste is
probably a mess but here we go that's my
final code so go ahead and copy that
down this will be the code that works so
let's go ahead yet and save and now
we've gone ahead and created the value
of yes
for when yes was checked and created a
variable called no for whenever no was
checked and you know what to be honest
I'm probably creating a lot of work for
myself because now if I want to display
the variable yes or no I'm going to have
to check again if yes was set or if no
was it so let's go ahead and actually
just cut all of that out so instead of
using my PHP tags up at the top over
there let's paste them in here and let's
just quickly and end all of this okay
instead of creating a variable let's
actually just echo this out so I'm just
going to say echo and that should
actually work just like that so then
we'll go echo variable no and now let's
go ahead and save this and click refresh
will resend our data handling your data
know so it's probably better if we just
check these boxes from here so let's go
ahead and say D play League of Legends
well I do going to click Submit then
we've sent through our value yes or
let's go ahead and click no now we've
sent through our value no okay and that
is how you guys are going to have to
handle checkboxes so you'll have to
check
which one was checked and then you can
go ahead and print it out just like that
okay so that's actually all I have you
guys in this video but as always don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share the video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
