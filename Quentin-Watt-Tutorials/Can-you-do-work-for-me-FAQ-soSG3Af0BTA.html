a number of different ways is quinton
what are your right cards or what are
your rates can you do this work for me
will you help me build a website I mean
a bunch of different ways you could word
this question but the answer to all of
these questions is always know I always
say no just purely because I've decided
that this is not a service I want to
offer I'd rather focus on making videos
then offering this as a service to
people on youtube so i always say no to
everybody who asked
but there are a bunch of guys who when
they contact me and I say I'm sorry this
is in the service i offer or i'd like to
focus on making videos so i don't offer
this real service to youtube generally
people tend to get quite angry or start
treating me like they're the only person
i've ever said no to which obviously
gets quite frustrating to me and yeah
like it seems like right now when people
come and ask me to do work and I say no
this isn't a service i alpha and I'm
trying to put you down politely I'm not
trying to be rude I'm just saying no I'm
sorry this isn't a service i offer
people tend to yeah like there's there's
a small percentage of people like a
twenty percent of people who contact me
and ask the question and I say I'm sorry
is in a service I often they said okay
thank you for your reply and then they
don't contact me again but like at least
they're being understanding at least
they they are not complaining about the
fact that I said no but then on the
other hand there seems to be this other
group of people and this seems to be
like eighty percent of the people who
contact me to do work nowadays they
contact me ask me to do work I'll say
I'm sorry this isn't a service I off I
don't do this kind of work I'd rather
focus on making videos and then people
tend to a bunch of these people tend to
get really angry and they'll either like
start calling me names or they'll start
whining or they'll start begging me they
won't accept the no as an answer which
is also it's very frustrating to me
because like first of all when I say no
I'm sorry this isn't a service i offer
and then you reply back with like oh i
thought you were a good person but
you're not or you're an asshole or
somebody called me a YouTube diva
because I said no this isn't a service i
alpha like I'm not being rude now you're
calling me a name that's not going to
change my mind it's not going to make me
want to do the work for you anymore like
in fact it's just going to make me want
to block you or like not basically just
never want to see you again I don't want
you calling me names so I already
struggle to
I don't know understand the thought
process behind the guys who are doing
this like you're calling me a name now
suddenly you think I'm gonna go oh sure
yeah let me do that work for you of
course I'm not going to so yeah it's
just weird and the other thing that
happens is i usually get like begging or
whining so i'll say i don't do the work
and then somebody roast will respond
back like but please do it for me just
for me you don't have to do it for
anybody else on youtube just do it for
me and like that i think it's very rude
to say something like that because now
what you're saying is the rest of my
audience is here and you're here you are
way more important than anybody else in
my audience and so I consider that to be
quite rude as a response and it's also
very annoying because it's whining and
stuff so there's that response but then
there's also another biggie / whiny
response which is usually like but
please I'll pay you I'll pay you to do
the work and to that I'm kind of like
listen you would have had to have paid
me anyways if you're asking me to do
this work it wasn't going to be free you
would have had to have paid me I know
that you would have been willing to pay
me I just choose to not offer as a
service I don't care if you're willing
to pay me two thousand dollars or ten
dollars you know to me it's just not a
service I want to offer to people on
YouTube because I know most of you guys
who are contacting me from YouTube have
been trying to learn how to do this
yourself now if you've been trying to
learn how to do this yourself you're
more than likely not willing to pay a
lot of money or you just don't have a
big budget to pay to me just I don't see
myself benefitting or profiting or
running a successful business doing
things this way so I just don't want to
offer it as a service it's not because
I'm trying to be an asshole i'm trying
to put you down please don't call me
name and yeah if you do want this kind
of work the only thing i can suggest is
that you go elsewhere if you guys do
have any other questions i'm going to
link to a playlist over here go ahead
and check that out maybe i'll have
answered another question
that you wanted to know the answer to
and if you do have another question
that's not in this playlist go ahead and
leave a comment and maybe I'll answer it
in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
