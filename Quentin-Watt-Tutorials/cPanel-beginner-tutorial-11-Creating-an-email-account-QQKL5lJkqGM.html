here and welcome to tutorial number 11
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to create and manage email
addresses in cPanel so you can cut you
guys can consider this bonus video
because for a while I was considering
not making this video but then I decided
okay well you know what I might as well
just to add that little bit of extra
value for those people who are new to
cPanel and they don't know how email
addresses work so if you are logged into
cPanel then you just need to go over to
the email addresses tab and to create a
new email address you'll click on email
accounts so I'm going to click on that
now and that's going to load for a
couple seconds but when you get to this
page you'll have the ability to add an
email account and if you scroll down you
can look at existing email accounts so
let's take a look at adding a new
account because right now I have test
one widget it already exists but let's
create a test to add Josie cocom I'm
going to create a password and I'm just
going to use the password generator for
this I'm going to tick I have copied
this and saves it in a safe place and
obviously if you guys are using this you
might want to copy it and save it I
don't plan to use this email address so
I don't need to know the password which
is why I haven't copied it but anyway
now we'll take a look at the mailbox
quota which is how much space this email
address is allowed to take up on your
server so you know for now this is 250
megabytes but I might want to set this
to unlimited and that way if I'm using
IMAP I'll never run out of space but if
somebody is using a pop3 email address
then you can just set a max quota here
and you'll probably never reach it
because every time the person with this
email address
opens up their email accounts then all
the emails will be downloaded to the
computer so they won't stay on the
server although I think IMAP is better
because when all the emails on a server
you can always access webmail later so
I'm just going to leave that at
unlimited but those are your two options
and if you guys don't know what pop3 and
IMAP are then I guess you got some
research to do but let's hit create
account and that is going to create a
new email account so now we have these
two email addresses over here and if I
click Change Password then that'll
obviously allow me to change the
password for this email account and
basically I have to reset the password
so I can't see what the old password is
I just have to reset the current
existing one that is the only option and
that is available here so if I click on
that you'll just see I just put in a new
password and then it resets it if I hit
change quota then that means I can
change the email address from being
unlimited to have a max amount of space
but again I'll just leave that at
unlimited so that I never run out of
space on this email account okay and
then we'll look at a configure mail
client so I'm just going to open this in
a new tab and what this page does is
give us all the information that we need
to set up this email address in a mail
client so if I go over to this page
you'll see there is a mail client for
iOS which is iPhone iPad iPod and they
can all have four they all get set up
differently then you've got Mac OS or
Mac mail anything from you know Lion up
and it has its own settings then Mac
mail from anything pre lion has their
own settings so like there are so many
different mail clients I could not set
up each one of these for you guys but
yeah like this is where you could get
details to auto set up your email
address generally these don't work too
well
so I always use the manual settings and
I just go into my mail client and
wherever my mail client asked me for a
username I'll place in the username
wherever it asked me for a password
I use my chosen password wherever it
asked me for incoming server I'll put in
the incoming server and the outgoing
server so those are the two that are the
four things that you need to know when
setting up a mail address and you can
get them all from over here so that is
if you're setting up your mail client
but there is a much easier way if you
don't want to set up a mail client you
can always use webmail and so if you
click on the little more button over
here and go over to access webmail then
this will take you to your webmail
account and so you see right now I am
logged in to test one at Josie cope and
I get to choose a mail application that
I use in the browser so I could use
horde roundcube
or squirrelmail and depending on what
server you guys are on you might have a
few other options here so I'm just going
to pick one because they're more or less
all the same they look a little bit
different but their features are you
know mostly the same and you can see
right now I have one email which is
hello there this is for the Tut so I
actually tested this email address
before I made this video so I received a
mail from test2 and it said hello there
this is the Tut so I'm gonna you know
draft my own email by hitting compose
and let's just test this email address
and we'll send a mail to test - so to
test - at um oops and choosey Corp Wow I
cannot type today okay set so test - I
chose eco calm and then for the subject
we'll just say this is for the real
recorded Tut right and then um for the
Edit to type you might want to
change this to HTML because you know
most emails are HTML formatted and what
that means is that when you type
something like this is my email you can
style the text like make it bold and
italic and you know maybe Center align
it or something so if you're using HTML
editor type then you'll be able to you
know format all the text but if it's
plain text then you cannot do any of
that kind of stuff so let's come back
here and change that back to email so
let me just hit Send and obviously
that's going to send the mail so you
guys know more or less how to send
emails and stuff but yeah if I come back
here and I go into my webmail for test
two I should now have a mail in the
inbox so let's just wait for this to
load going into round Q begin and yeah
now I have one in the inbox and it's the
mail that we just typed which says this
is for the recorded Tut and if I go into
that this is my email so yeah email
address is set up and working correctly
and that is how you set up emails and
yeah I'm not really going to talk about
too much of the other stuff under the
email tab because it's all relatively
straightforward if you wanted to forward
an email address then all you have to do
is add a forwarder and then and you put
in the email address that you want to
forward from to the email address that
you want to forward to and you know
there we go it works straight away so
the rest of the stuff is kind of
straightforward but that is how to
manage email addresses if you were
wondering and that's all I have for you
guys in this tutorial so don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like and share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
also most importantly don't forget to
check out my website which is Josey
Tut's comm and I'll see you guys next
