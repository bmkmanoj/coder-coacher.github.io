here and in this tutorial I want to
quickly do a few little updates because
taking a look at our code right now with
the head of the way it is and the foot
of the way it is I think we can almost
mark off the fact that our footer is
done so we could move this over but
there is actually one thing that I just
want to fix and it is kind of annoying
me I wasn't quite sure when I would be
able to fit this into the series but we
need to fix the font weights here
because if we take a look at this in our
design obviously we're using a much
lighter font weight and if we scroll
down to the footer we're also using a
much much lighter font weight so yeah
what I'd like to do here is obviously
lighten my font and the way I'm gonna do
that I could do this with CSS my own
custom CSS but I actually want to use
the uikit customizer so hopefully you
guys have kept that style dot less file
that I have available on patreon if you
didn't I'm gonna make this one available
on patreon for free for everyone to
download but let's go ahead and click
open
and that should load in my my my CSS or
my less file right so now my less file
has been important and there's a few
settings that I'd like to change here in
the customizer that will then be able to
download the less file and download the
CSS file again and see those changes
appear on the site as well so the first
thing I want to do is click the Advanced
Mode over here the next thing I'd like
to do is I think there's a section for
defaults or base there we go base is
kind of our defaults I want to set the
font weight of this to 100 so that
should lighten pretty much all the fonts
across the site so it has actually
lightened a lot of these ones it's even
lighten the brand the only problem is up
navigation still isn't quite as light as
I'd like it to be and our headers are
still quite bold so for the font weight
and also under bass I'm just going to
change the heading font weight to two to
two-hundred not 100 and that should take
effect on some of our headings it should
be these headings here I'm also gonna
say text transformation we can actually
set this to uppercase and that way all
headings on our site should by default
be uppercase so there's a header that is
uppercase and the rest of them not so
much so I think another place we can
change this is under article we want the
font weight of all of our articles to be
100 we want the text transformation to
be none unless it's actually a title
yeah sorry so when it's the title we
want that to be uppercase and we
actually want that to be 200 so that is
one of our article titles and this is
pretty much what we're going for for the
rest of our headers as well so we just
need to find out where else we can
change this and one of the ones that
we're gonna have to change is nav bar so
let's look for nav bar because this is
our navigation here right so here's some
nav bar backgrounds nearby animations
but that's all on the drop-down let's
keep going
let's look for nav bar itself should be
under Cassio's nav and there we go we
now have nav bar so I'm going to change
the font weight of all of our
navigations to be 100 and you can see
that those on our lightened as well we
could probably increase our font size as
well maybe if I click more font weight
nav font size there we go let's just
make that 16 pixels I think the default
was 14 so 16 is just gonna make them
that tiny bit bigger which I quite like
just for the navigation I
I only want that for the navigation up
for the whole site and now we just need
to try and find a few more of these
headers so I think one of those is going
to be under panel so let's look for
panel
title font weight we also want that to
be 200 so that's gonna fix some of these
title track text transformation we can
also set that up to uppercase so all of
the headings on our website basically
become uppercase and I think that this
is actually article lead text so let's
look for article lead text up here I'm
gonna scroll all the way up to the top
because article basically all of these
items here are in alphabetical order so
you know that if you're looking for
article it's gonna be near the top if
you're looking for nav bar it's gonna be
somewhere near the bottom lead font
weight so let's change that to 100 and
so that kind of fixes that one maybe
that could be 200 yeah okay that's
better right I don't know if I'm gonna
be using any lead article or paragraphs
but if I do that's kind of what it'll
look like right and so now I think that
my template has been set up much much
better something that I still can't
quite find is how to change the corners
of these buttons so I've gone and taking
a look under B for button and yeah there
isn't really a setting here to stop the
corners from being rounded I'm not sure
why that is because this should be
border-radius
so I think because I can't find that
here in the customizer I'm gonna use
custom CSS to stop these these buttons
from rounding but for now I think yeah
we've got this this template set up
exactly how I need it so I'm going to
download the LES file here and we can
just save that as well I'm gonna save it
as style updates or updated less and you
guys can always download this for free
on patreon I will
leave a link in the description of this
video just go ahead and download that
and you can import those exact same
settings into the customizer if need be
and then I'm also just gonna minify this
and get the CSS as well and let's call
this UI kit custom theme dot CSS and I
think I already have this once but
that's fine I'm gonna replace that so
that's gonna download and now I can take
it's in my downloads UI kit custom theme
dot CSS let me copy this come back here
and let's paste that and where is it
it's in UI kit CSS and you might get
custom let CSS I want to paste my new
item and just replace the old one right
so now if I come back over to my web
page and I refresh or what I did was I
hard refresh that command shift are if
you're on Windows
it'll be ctrl shift are I believe and
that'll just make sure that your browser
gets rid of any old CSS files or old CSS
rules and reloads everything afresh so
you don't have any caching and yeah now
I have my menu items pretty much how I
wanted them to be and I also have my
footer pretty much in the font weight I
wanted it to be so now everything's
gonna be matching my design a lot lot
better and I think in the next tutorial
we'll move on to actually creating the
slideshow for our home page so I'll see
you guys in the next one but before I
end this video off let me send a huge
