to tutorial number 12 and in this
tutorial guys I'm gonna just start off
by talking about the last tutorial for a
little bit and in the last tutorial I
show you guys how to add an internal
style sheet to your web page which was
this thing right here between the two
style tags now internal style sheets you
know they're alright you can use them if
you want to but they're not really the
best way to use a style sheet because
think about this for a second if you had
a web page you're more than likely going
to have more than one page you probably
going to have about five pages and you'd
have to go ahead and type all this code
out five times for each page that you
had on your website and let's say you
styled everything on your website so
this code would be a lot longer or
there'd be a lot more of this code and
it would be really time-consuming really
boring you know to be quite irritating
so and if you wanted to change something
or some look of your web page then you'd
have to go and change it five times for
each page you know so that would really
be irritating so instead what you can do
is you can use an external style sheets
and an external style sheet is a much
much better way to add CSS to your page
so that's what I'm going to show you
guys how to do in this tutorial so I'm
just going to go ahead and delete our
internal style sheet real quick and I'm
going to save my document and then what
I'm going to do up here I'm going to
file new and there we go I've got a new
document and I'm going to save this so
save as and as you can see this is my
tutorial 12 code over here in this
folder and that is my index.html file
that we were working with just now so
make sure that you save your CSS in the
same directory or same folder as your
index.html file but what I'm actually
going to do just to keep things neat
I've prepared the CSS folder over here
so I'm just going to go into that for
and then I'm going to save this CSS
document as main and here in save as
file type you need to go ahead and
choose cascading style sheet that's the
CSS document if you choose anything else
it's not going to work so go ahead and
choose that and then click Save and
there we go we've got an external
stylesheet but it's blank so I'm
actually just going to add in the code
that we had in our previous tutorial
which was just styling the paragraph so
what we do first is we select our
element P and then we open up our two
curly braces and I'm just going to
neaten this up a little bit by typing
like that and this is how I do all of my
CSS just to keep everything nice and
tidy and then I'm going to choose the
property I want to change which was the
color and I'm going to change that to
red and after that I'm going to change
the font family as well to send serif
now as you can see when I use an
external style sheet then CSS or notepad
really helps us out by changing all the
the text of the colors of the text so
over here a property is then changed to
like this nice light gray color so we
know that that was a property and the
element of here changes to blue so that
we know that that is a css3 or HTML
element that we styling in css3 so
that's just another reason why using an
external style sheet when using notepad
plus plus as your editor is just so much
more awesome and now what we have to do
guys is we have to go back to our
index.html file and before this will
work before this paragraph turns red we
still have to add in one line of code up
here so I'm just going to show you guys
what this looks like real quick if I run
this in Firefox
it still looks normal it still looks
like the same old paragraph boring it's
not styled but now what happens is I
just type in a
link tag here at the top of the page and
I have to add in three attributes so the
first one is rel which stands for
relationship which is just what do you
want this link to be and we're going to
set that equal to stylesheet so we want
this link to style our web page and then
we have to set what file we want to use
so H riff okay and you guys know that H
riff stands for hypertext reference and
now we just select the name of the file
that we want to use which is this main
dot CSS so let's go here and type main
dot CSS but if you remember I saved my
main dot CSS in a folder called CSS so I
have to add that in here and I go CSS
slash and there we go we have now got
chosen our folder so we now have our CSS
sheet and then the last attribute that
we have to type in yet is just type
equals and this is text forward slash
CSS just to tell HTML that we are using
CSS to style a web page I don't know if
there is another styling language but we
use CSS or we using CSS in my tutorials
so let's just go ahead and save that and
now what happens if I go back to Firefox
and I click refresh we get a red
paragraph in sans-serif so hTML is
actually looking at our external
stylesheet
so that's why using an external
stylesheet is actually so much better
than using an internal stylesheet
because now what happens is if I had
five pages I just go ahead and add in
this link at the head of all of my five
pages and all of my paragraphs will turn
red and have a font family of sans-serif
so that's pretty cool then I don't have
to type that code out five times and
that's pretty much all I have for you
guys in this tutorial so thanks for

time
