I cannot be helped you PI the line so
let's kind of start that off again hey
YouTube how's it goin it's Quintin here
and welcome to my video and I don't know
why I'm saying welcome but yeah in this
video I just wanted to talk about why
some programmers get annoyed by other
programmers asking questions or asking
for help now first off I do kind of want
to explain that there are certain
situations where it is completely
uncalled for for a programmer to get
annoyed and that is if you're asking
your question in an online forum if
you're asking your question on a place
like Stack Overflow the entire reason
that websites like that exist is for
questions to be asked so if somebody
responds in a read or condescending way
there is completely uncalled-for but I
guess the reason why means like this
still exists is because they are guys
out there who genuinely get annoyed by
seeing questions so they are programmers
out there who if they see a question
will get annoyed or will have an annoyed
response which I guess is testament to
why I need to make this video and talk
about why there are programmers who get
annoyed and I also just want to mention
to you guys
certain situations where it is
completely understandable that a
programmer might get annoyed with a new
programmer so an experienced program and
getting annoyed with an inexperienced
programmers this is one of the biggest
reasons why some programmers might be
annoyed by other programmers is if it is
quite clear to an experienced programmer
that an inexperienced programmer just
hasn't been willing to do the research
or isn't bothered to do research right
so if you ask a question that I could
get really copy and paste and type into
Google and get an answer after one or
two google searches then yeah it's going
to make hey youtube how's it goin it's
Quintin here and welcome to my video and
I don't know why I'm saying welcome but
yeah in this video I just wanted to talk
about why some program is get annoyed by
other
asking questions or asking for help in
an office environment you're asking
people in your office environment to
help you with something and you become a
repeat offender just constantly asking
for help on questions that could have
been answered by just searching on
Google for a little while then yeah it's
going to make a lot of the people in
here artists lose respect for you and
they're not going to want to help you in
future another reason why that's really
really important is because as a
programmer and being able to do research
and solve problems is part of your job
in fact being able to do research and
solve problems is literally a more
important than actually getting to the
point where you write code right because
if you can't research and solve problems
you're never ever going to have the
correct code written in your well file
so a history if you can't do this part
you're not going to be able to do this
part and so yeah it's going to make
programmers look at you and go well if
you can't solve problems that say five
minutes worth of searching on Google to
solve you're never going to get from the
point where you're a beginner programmer
to somebody who is more experienced but
at the same time if you can at least
show that you have been doing research
and you have been trying to solve the
problem but you're still stuck somewhere
then it does make an experienced
programmer more willing to help you
right because if you can show that
you've got all this documentation here
and your answers not in the
documentation it means that as an
experienced programmer something just
needs to come along and help you connect
the dots and that way you still got the
opportunity to learn a lot more right
you saw that the opportunity to have to
struggle through the problem and you
answer a bit of a learning phase and all
I need to do is come along help you
connect the dots and you figured it out
almost by yourself that's a lot more
rewarding for an experienced programmer
to see with an inexperienced programmer
and it's going to help experienced
programmers gain a lot of respect for
you now in my personal experience I have
had people ask me questions and I've
said please google that and then they
would say like oh but my aunts they
can't be found on Google I've searched
everyone
and then I find the answer on Google in
like less than 10 minutes that kind of
stuff is really really frustrating to me
so if you're one of those people who
want to say my answer can't be found on
Google it's also one of those times
where you're going to really really make
somebody angry especially if you're
asking them for help and then they can
find the answer on Google it's really
going to frustrate the person you're
asking for help from the other thing
that happens is new programmers asking
for help but not respecting the other
programmers time and that's really
really important in pretty much any case
where you're asking for help so this
isn't just in the world of development I
mean it's in the world of anything if
you don't respect how much time you're
actually asking for from that person
they are going to be annoyed by you
here's the thing as developers or as
programmers we don't really sell any
physical hard products I mean maybe the
company that we work for does or
something but at the end of the day as a
developer the main thing that we sell is
our time we sell our ability to think
through problems solve them and get them
down written into code so yeah all of
that takes time to do so when you come
along and ask a question that doesn't
respect that developers time in other
words if you're asking for too much time
or if you're asking for their time but
you're asking for their time immediately
I understand that maybe you have a
deadline but yes if you're asking for
time immediately or if you're asking for
too much time it will really really
annoy the other programmer and they
probably will respond in a rude way or
respond in an annoyed way and maybe they
respond back and say I don't have the
time to help you right now that isn't a
read response that's just them saying
I'm busy and I can't help you right now
and if you respond back to that really
it's not going to help your case if
you're asking for help from somebody and
then they tell you that I don't have the
time to help you right now
you should be completely respectful and
polite in your next reply back to them
and maybe they will help you out when
they do have time later on but if you
respond in just a really weird way back
to them like oh I thought you were a
good person which has happen
me in the past I'm like okay I can't
help you right now no I thought you were
a good person basically calling me a bad
person because I couldn't help them
immediately that kind of stuff is not
really going to help your case because
then the program is just going to get
more annoyed with you and not want to
help you at all another really really
really important factor is that you
should always be respectful and polite
in the way you ask your question and
make sure that your question is phrased
as an actual question I can't even tell
you how many times I've seen this happen
to me
but to other people as well where the
question is phrased in a way that it
isn't actually a question so you're not
using words like please and thank you if
you're asking somebody for help the
least you can do is say please and thank
if you can't even say please and thank
you obviously the person is not going to
be willing to help you but also if
you're asking asking a question in this
form if you're saying you should do this
and then you think that that's a
question also that is not a question
right that is telling somebody to help
you that's not asking somebody to help
you and I can't even begin to explain
how many times this has happened to me
where people have messaged me and said
hey you should do this and I'm like no I
shouldn't have to do anything you should
say please and thank you and I get a
really rude response back like oh well I
just thought that I was asking politely
but it just looks like you're not
willing to help me so that kind of stuff
as well if you really ask me for
somebody's help you should be able to
write your question as a question you
should be able to say please and thank
you you shouldn't go around telling
people to help you and also you on that
topic you should never hurry somebody to
help you right so if you're going to
hurry or rush somebody to help you that
kind of stuff is kind of like it wasn't
my problem to begin with if I'm the
person that you're asking help from that
was never my problem to begin with if
you have a deadline and you need
something sorted out by three o'clock or
four o'clock this afternoon that's
completely your problem and you
shouldn't be transferring your problem
over to me that's kind of really rude
do and so if you ever do that to me or
somebody else who's also a programmer it
is going to annoy them and they're
probably just going to say like this
isn't my problem I'm not going to help
you and that's not a rude response it's
just being realistic so another reason
why programmers might get annoyed when
you ask my help is if you ask for help
but they don't have the answer that
you're looking for and you kind of just
assume that they did have the answer
you're looking for it's really not cool
to do that right so you should always
say do you have experience with this
thing that I need help with so do you
have experience with Ajax or PHP or
whatever and then if they say yes then
often have you ever worked with this and
so like yes ask your question in a much
more polite fashion ask them in a
fashion where it shows that you are
considering the fact that maybe they
don't know the answer to the thing
you're looking for and that's going to
make for a much more flowing
conversation and much more polite
conversation it also does give them the
opportunity to say no I actually haven't
worked with that so I can't help you
anyway so those are some of the things
that people have done to me or to other
programmers that I've seen out there and
in fact I'm guilty of doing some of
these things as well so like I could
really understand why other programmers
get annoyed when I do one of these
things and if you think that I left
something out and you want to add in
your own reason why programmers get
annoyed by other programmers asking for
help then go ahead and let me know what
