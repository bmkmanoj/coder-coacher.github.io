here and welcome to tutorial number 37
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to pass an array to a
function so if you guys watch the
previous tutorial then you guys should
know all about arguments by now and you
should know how to pass and/or just pass
data to a function yesterday we just
passed like a simple string to the
function and we got our function to use
that as a variable so it's basically the
same thing with an array so I'm just
going to go ahead now and make an array
and I'm going to call it scores and this
will obviously be like an array of test
scores or exam scores so equals array
and obviously got to close that off
we'll put in a couple values here so
I'll put in 65 not so bad
32 so you don't want to be this guy
because obviously he failed and then
we'll go ahead and say 78 98 and
obviously you don't be this guy either
because he's the teacher's pet if you
got 98% and then 66 okay so these can
just be like percentages for an exam and
now let's make a function that'll work
out the class average so if these five
guys were in a class and that was their
scores let's try and figure out what the
class average was so I'm going to make a
function and I'm going to call the
function average err so let's go ahead
and say function average err and then
we'll put in our curly braces and our
parentheses okay and in here obviously I
need to tell my function hey listen up
you're going to have to expect an
argument so I'm going to put an argument
of array in here and this means that
whenever this function is called it's
going to expect at least one argument
and when we get that argument we're
going to call that argument array okay
now all we have to do is actually give
our function something to do when we
call the function so like I said I want
to work out the average and the way to
do that is obviously find out what the
total of all of these array elements is
or what the total of all these scores
are and then obviously divide that by
five because there are five scores so
let me go ahead and make a variable here
called total and we'll set that equal to
zero at first and now in a for each loop
we can loop through the array so for
each array as value let's do something
and what we're going to do is obviously
just take our variable total and then
plus equals value and those are supposed
to be the other way around plus equals
plus equals value so basically what this
code does right now is it loops through
each element in this array and then
takes the value of that at a specific
element at the time and adds it to total
so right now total sitting at zero but
as soon as the loop executes the first
time we get the value of 65 and we add
that to total so total should now be 65
the next time the loop runs it's going
to grab the value of 30 and then add
that to total so then we've got 65 plus
32 which equals whatever are not really
good at maths so I can't calculator that
in my head but so on so we're going to
do that for 78 98 66 and eventually we
will have a total then to work out the
average we're just going to create a new
variable called aviary
and we're going to set that equal to
total / however many elements there are
in our array so as you can see we
actually have five so I could go ahead
and just put in a five here but then if
I decided well there's one more student
then I'd have to change my code so we'll
leave it at five I mean we'll leave that
array of five but instead of putting a
fixed number over here we'll count how
many elements there are and our a so
we'll go ahead and say count scores on a
count array okay so we'll count how many
elements there are in this array
variable and then we'll divide it by
that number so basically whatever the
total is here divided by however in
however many elements they are in the
array will give us our average and now
the last thing our function obviously
needs to do is just print out the value
so that we can see it so we'll just echo
out average okay and last but not least
before we actually run this function we
need to call it so let's go ahead and
say average ER and then scores now it
doesn't really matter that I'm calling
the function before I've actually
defined the function PHP will know that
the function will be further down in
some programming languages like if
you're working with C or something if
you're going to make a function then you
might have to declare the function above
the code that actually uses the function
otherwise you run into problems but in
PHP we don't have to do that so I can
just go ahead and run this like this and
it should work so let's go back that's
working do I have Firefox open that will
get
okay cool so let's go back here and
click refresh and as you can see I have
the number sixty seven point eight
echoed out to the screen so if you were
to take a calculator and add all of
these up and divide that by five that
should be the average okay so as you can
see we can pass a raise to a function
just fine and I realize I probably
didn't explain this line of code but if
you guys watch the previous tutorial it
should make sense all I'm doing is
calling my function and then passing the
variable scores or the array scores to
the function so then all the data stored
in this variable scores gets stored into
this variable array and then our
function knows to work with this
variable whenever we're calling the
array function or array variable sorry
so that's actually all I have for you

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
