here and welcome to tutorial number 8 in
this PrestaShop series and in this video
I am going to show you guys how to
customize the default theme in
PrestaShop so there are actually a bunch
of things you might want to change right
off the bat and the first thing is the
logo because I mean obviously if this is
your website you don't want this logo
here you want to put your own company
logo over there so I'm going to show you
guys how to do that and then I'm also
going to show you guys how to change
modules now modules are actually what
pretty much everything in PrestaShop is
made out of so anything you see
displayed on the site is actually a
module like this slider is a module the
slider module these banners over here
those are modules then all of these
images down here those are all modules
so basically you get the point right
everything in PrestaShop is a module and
that is where we go to change all of
this stuff so yeah let's get started by
logging into the backend of PrestaShop
and the first thing you want to do is go
to preferences and themes and that's
going to allow you to change your logo
so as you can see when we go to themes
we're given our current theme which is
the default bootstrap theme for
PrestaShop 1.6 and over here we're able
to change our logo now if I scroll
further down you can see that there are
a bunch of other themes that I could
choose to buy and enable but I'm not
going to be talking about those we're
actually just going to be talking about
this default PrestaShop theme and I want
to change this logo so I'm just going to
go ahead and click in here and select
the file which I think I called demo dot
ping and that is a really big ugly logo
but just so you guys can see the change
I'm going to go ahead and
save and now you can see that the logo
has changed over here and this is the
logo that displays on our front end of
our website then we also have logos for
invoices and emails now you can see that
this logo has also changed to my new
logo but I can always override this by
just adding a different logo file over
here and I think it will replace that
one yeah so if you don't if you don't
what it says right here if you don't
actually upload a logo over here the
default one will be used so we're good
and yeah let's go to the front end hit
refresh and this logo should change and
it has so that's awesome and now we can
go back to the back end and now that the
modules have been changed we can change
or now that the logo has been changed we
can take a look at modules so let's go
over to modules and this is basically a
page that gives us a list of all the
modules that were able to edit and all
of the modules are listed over here as
well and you can like filter them by
category by clicking over here or you
can just filter to the exact logo you
want these are actually logos that need
to be updated so I haven't updated my
modules in a quite a long time actually
but let's go to theme configurator if I
click on that it's going to filter the
theme configurator over here otherwise
what I could have done was just searched
theme configurator in this little search
and what I want to do now is click on
this little arrow say configure and
that's going to allow me to configure
this theme so you can see I've got a
bunch of different yes/no options over
here which the first one is do I want to
display links to my stores social
accounts like Twitter Facebook etc and I
can choose yes or no over here and let
me just show you where that appears on
the front end so in the front end if I
scroll all
all the way down you see where it says
follow us and it's got my Facebook and
my Twitter link over here that is this
module so this one over here if I say no
and I come down and hit save and I go to
the front end again and hit refresh this
should disappear and it has so there we
go that's just how you get rid of that
if you want to battle eyes you can just
hit that on yes again because obviously
it's quite helpful to have your social
links on your website if you ever want
to configure them you can just go ahead
and hit this little configure button and
this takes you through to a page where
you're able to place a URL for each
different social media platform and if
for some reason you leave one of these
fields blank as you can see all of these
are blank
then none of them will show up but yes
as soon as you place a URL so let's just
maybe copy my Twitter link over here and
just change that to youtube.com and that
is actually my YouTube URL so that's it
save and if I come back here now and hit
refresh you can see that this is going
to appear because I changed that little
slider to yes and I also added my
youtube url so another YouTube logo is
displaying in the front end let's go
back to our modules
I really wish this back button took me
right back to where I was where I came
from because if I hit back right now
then it takes me all the way back to
this thing and then I've got to go
through the theme configurator again to
get back to the page that I was on so it
would be nice if that back button took
me back to where I was going but you
know no stress it just means is going to
take me like an extra two minutes to get
through all of this stuff now display
your contact information that is
actually going to be this block over
here so if I turn it off it'll disappear
and if I leave it on yes then it's going
to stay here again I can also configure
it by just hitting that configure button
and changing some of the details
and like a lot of these things that you
can actually tell what they are just by
looking at their name so sharing buttons
on the product page so that's only going
to be on the product page display
Facebook block on the home page if we go
back to our home page there is a
Facebook block over here so I can turn
that on or off or configure it if I
wanted to yeah so you can see that all
of these all of these modules are named
quite appropriately so you can tell
pretty much exactly which one goes with
display the custom CMS block if I take a
look here this is our custom CMS blocks
there's actually two of them there's
this lorem ipsum and this custom block
and if I wanted to change those I could
hit configure and let's just change the
first one over here to something so I'm
going to get rid of all this content and
I'm just going to write Quinton was here
hits save and now the content has
changed over there so if I come back to
the front-end and I hit refresh you can
see that we've replaced this content
with the words Quinton was here so
that's how to change that and the custom
block is this one right underneath it so
I can always go ahead and change that if
I wanted to or add a new one so the add
new buttons up here and yeah I think
we've pretty much covered that I'll let
you guys decide if you want to display
these blocks or remove them or actually
put whatever content you want to put in
here now let's go back to the theme
configurator and back to configure and
now that we've taken a look at these es
no buttons on a scroll yes little
further down the page and as you can see
we've got some images here for top
trends men's coats and jackets women's
jackets etc and all of those images are
actually displaying in the front end
over here so I can choose to remove them
and they will
disappear or I can replace them with
images of my own so let me let me remove
this one and I'm going to remove this
one so those are those two long images
over here and if I get rid of them
they'll disappear and then I'm going to
replace these three with new images so
let's say edit and browse for my image
so I put a green one
save I've also got a red one for this
guy so let's get the red image over here
open save and lastly let's change the
women's jackets as well to the blue one
and hit save
cool and now when I hit refresh all of
those images should change so green blue
red green red blue whatever so yeah
that's how to change any of those images
or get rid of them if you wanted to and
yeah I think we've got this theme
configurator dealt with you guys kind of
understand what's going on here now what
I'd like to do is just go back over to
my modules and let's show you how to
change the slider so if I just search
for my image slider and then once I
click on that it actually filters them
down here otherwise like I said you
could just search in here if you don't
have them appearing here and let's go
configure cool and so these are my
sliders you can see that we've got these
three images if I go back to our slider
the other images are over here so I can
always add a new one if I wanted to by
just hitting the plus button let's
choose a file I've
file of a little cute lion that I was
playing with a little while ago so that
is a lion cub and let's just add him his
name is Simba by the way it's kind of
unoriginal as far as names go
considering the movie butt heads he's
still a cute little guy let's go slide
title let's just call him Simba the lion
target URL this is if I want the slide
to link somewhere I can give a URL for
that so let's just go dub dub dub dot
google.com ideally what I would do is
actually put in a product URL so one of
the products on my store but let's just
leave it at Google for now since I I'm
not sure what my product URL is caption
this is going to be something that
displays on top of the image of course
so hello I forgot on a Mac if you hold
the button in and it gives you all those
options and let's go description this is
a description and let's just enable that
save it and yes now we have a fourth
slide and by default it appears as the
first image let's go back here and hit
refresh and as you can see we now have
my little lion cub appearing in the
slider and whatever I typed in the
description has appeared over here not
quite sure who I clicked on that so it
took me to Google so the link is working
now of course I'm not quite sure what
the caption is supposed to display now
mmm interesting but yeah if I ever
wanted to maybe just change this text so
it looks a little bit more like that
then in my configurator or on the Edit
Page I just need to make those a heading
so let's just edit it in the source code
that's always easier so I'll just make
that a heading 2 or something and then
the bottom one can be a paragraph and in
P and it's hit okay of course I wanted
to add a button over here I can probably
do that as well using code and yeah
let's just hit refresh one last time and
the slider should be updated so that
looks a little bit better yeah and I
think now that we've run through all of
that stuff I think we're good to go
maybe just the user info block actually
so user info block is actually this
block over here that displays my name
and I can actually remove that by going
over to modules and if I just search for
user info we've got the user info block
module over here like I said I could
also just search for it over here there
it is
let's hit disable on computers so that
way it doesn't display on a computer
which is what I'm using hit refresh and
you can see that that information or
that block has disappeared but now I
can't sign out which is weird so I think
that's definitely a block that we need
to have on the site at some point so
let's come back here and just hit reset
and that should bring it back cool so
that is how to change certain modules
that's also how to change the logo on
your site and I hope that this tutorial
