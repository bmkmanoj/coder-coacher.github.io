video we're going to take a look at
jQuery selectors and I'm going to show
you how to use the odd and even selector
to select odd or even elements on your
page so I'm actually going to work with
these paragraphs over here and we are
going to select the odd or even
paragraphs based on these four
paragraphs that we have over here so I
have the first paragraph with my name
then my sister's name then my brother's
name and my future brother-in-law's name
just in case you were wondering who all
these people are and now what we can do
is just jump over to jQuery and actually
let's take a look at that in the browser
before we've done anything so we've got
for plain old paragraphs nothing special
about them but if we go ahead now and
select the odd paragraph and the way
we're going to do that is obviously
opening up our selection tags and
selecting our paragraph but then only
selecting the odd paragraphs by adding
in this odd keyword and then we can
actually change the CSS of this so I'm
going to pull out my CSS function again
and we need to give this a property that
we want to change which I'm going to say
color and then we can give this a value
so I will set that equal to red and now
we should have selected all of the odd
paragraphs on our page and change the
color to red
but I already know that something weird
is going to happen because jQuery for
some reason is kind of weird with this
selection so I typed odd but if we go
back over to Firefox and I click refresh
you can see it's actually the even
paragraphs that are changing so the
second paragraph and the fourth
paragraph changed so it's really weird
that jQuery does this but you can
obviously get around that by just
changing this to even and then what it
does is select
or the even paragraphs in well ends yeah
it's it selects all the odd paragraphs
instead of all the even paragraphs which
is like extremely weird that it's
reversed but that's just something about
jQuery that I noticed while learning so
yeah just something that I'll point out
to you guys as well so when I type in
even there we go now it selects all the
odd paragraphs so extremely weird but
yeah that's jQuery for you and I have no
idea why it does that but to be honest
there's not really like a big fuss about
it or there's no need to cause a big
fuss about it because you can select
whichever elements you want to select by
just typing in either odd or even and
that's all I have for you in this video
and I will see you guys and next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
