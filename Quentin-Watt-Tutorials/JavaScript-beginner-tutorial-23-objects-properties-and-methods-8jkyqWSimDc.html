here
and welcome to tutorial number 23 and in
this tutorial I want to speak to you
guys about objects properties and
methods okay so you guys probably don't
know this and that's because I never
told you but JavaScript is an object
based programming language now what that
means is that everything in JavaScript
is an object now what the heck do I mean
by everything in JavaScript is an object
well you can think of an object in
JavaScript a lot like an object in real
life so let's take this car for example
okay
now this car is an object and what makes
this car an object is be that it has
certain physical properties that belong
to this object okay
so in other words this whole thing is a
car but it's name or it has a name which
is a property and that name would then
be lamborghini aventador then it also
has a color so a color is another
property about this car and the color
would then be red or kind of like
reddish orange so those are just
properties that kind of make up the
object okay so that's what a property is
it's just a value or something that
makes up part of the object okay
then we've also got this thing here
called methods now a method in other
words is an action okay it's an action
that we can perform with our object so
in other words this car has a few
actions that we can perform with it we
can start the car we can get in and take
it for a drive and then when we finished
we can
the car which would be another action or
we can park the car that would be in
action so in JavaScript every time you
perform an action with an object that's
called a method I'm not sure why they
named it that
but hey okay I didn't make the rules
just go ahead and make sure that that
that you call that action a method okay
so let's take a look at an example real
quick because I'm pretty sure a lot of
you guys are probably not quite with me
just yet so let's make a variable real
quick and we'll call that variable X
okay so the name is not important you
can name it whatever you want and I'm
going to set that equal to a string now
you can type whatever you want in here
but I'm just going to say my name is
Quinton okay and now believe it or not
guys this variable that I made variable
X is actually an object and as an object
it contains a property that I can access
so because it's a string there is a
property called length okay and what
length does is it counts how long my
string is so in other words it's going
to every time I add a character into the
string it's going to count that as one
okay so in other words this M would be
one that Y would be two that space would
be three and it's just going to carry on
counting so as the longer make my string
the higher this length property are the
higher the value that this length
property is going to contain okay so the
way we access this length property is we
first type the object name in this case
it's X and then we put in a full stop or
a period and then we type in our
property name so in this case the
property is length okay so whenever
working with properties
just remember it's the object name dot
and then property name okay that's how
we work with properties but this on its
own doesn't make much sense I can't just
tell the computer X dot length it's not
going to know what to do with that
property so I could go ahead and store
it in another variable or I could just
go ahead and write it out on the screen
so let's do that document dot write and
then we'll write out our property which
is X dot length okay
and this is probably going to print out
what's that two three and another four
that's seven okay that's really going to
print out about 18 characters so let's
save that cat I already did that okay so
I'm going to run this in Firefox and as
you can see I've got the number 18
printed out on my screen now the reason
why that happened was because this
length property is what we print it out
okay and like I said what this length
property does is it counts how many
characters are inside of my string so
it'll include the spaces and basically
anything that's in here so if I make
this a little bit longer if I say my
name is Quinton and I am 21 then that
number over here should go up so let's
go ahead and click refresh and you can
see there's now 31 characters inside of
my string so that's an example of how we
can access a property in JavaScript and
we're probably going to be doing this
quite a lot over the next couple
tutorials so if you don't understand
this yet then just carry on with the
rest of the tutorials and after a bit of
practice it's going to start making a
a lot more sense okay and then the other
thing I wanted to talk about was methods
so let's take a look at an example of a
method real quick okay I just want to
clear this line out here for now that
was our property we don't have to worry
about that now what I want to do is I
want to work with a method and what a
method is like I said is an action that
we can perform with our object so the
way we work with methods in Java Script
is we'll type in our object name so in
this case my object name is X and then
we'll obviously append on our method
name so the method I want to work with
here is to upper case and what that does
is it'll convert everything in this X
variable to capital letters and I'm
forgetting something very important
about this and that is these two
parentheses okay
that is basically how you tell the
difference between a property and a
method a method will always have these
two parentheses and sometimes you'll
have to put a value in here other times
you weren't really need to like in this
case we don't have to do anything with
this method we don't have to put
anything in these parentheses but now
what we can do is like I said this is
kind of useless to JavaScript by itself
we still have to either put this in a
variable or print it out so let's make
another variable and I'll call it
capitals and I'll set that equal to X to
uppercase okay now what that means is
that everything in this string variable
here is going to become an uppercase
letter even if
I didn't type it as an uppercase letter
so as you can see this Y and the word
name and the word is and the rest of my
name Quinton and all of these letters
here they're all small letters but if I
go ahead and I print out document dot
write okay if I print out capitals which
is my variable so I'm going to print out
this variable right here I save this go
back to Firefox click refresh okay you
can see that it's printed everything as
a capital letter even though I stored it
as lower letters so the reason why that
happened was because we used this method
which converts all of these letters to
uppercase okay
so we're running a little bit short on
time here but there was still something
I wanted to ask you guys and that is can
you guys see a similarity between this
statement over here and this statement
over here I'll give you a hint okay I'll
take the word capitals out there and
I'll put these both right next to each
other all the clever people should spot
this now I'll give you five seconds to
try and figure it out so one two three
four five okay so if you guys don't know
what I was trying to hint at here then
kind of take a closer look you see how
we've got our object name and then our
method name okay over here with a full
stop in the middle okay that's the exact
same thing we have here with our
documents we've got a document object
and then we've separated that with the
dot separator or full stop and then
we've added in this method here which
has an action that writes things to the
documents
so not only is my variable X over here
and an object so is our document and our
document in JavaScript is this white
window over here so if you look at our
browser our document would be everything
that starts from this corner here down
to here this is our document this white
section okay and not only is our
document an object this entire window of
the browser that is also an object and
there are tons of other objects in
JavaScript as well but we'll be talking
about all of those in the next couple
tutorials so get keen and stay tuned so
