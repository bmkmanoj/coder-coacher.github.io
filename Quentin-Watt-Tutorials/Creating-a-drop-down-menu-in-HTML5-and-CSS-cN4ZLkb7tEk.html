drop-down menu tutorial so in this
tutorial
obviously what we're going to do is
learn how to make a drop-down menu app
you guessed it I mean how hard was that
okay but now the first thing I'm gonna
let me just explain what I'm working
with you
hold on I've obviously declared my
doctype HTML I've opened my HTML tags
put the parameter languages English I've
opened my head I've put my meta tag
inside my head and I've put my title
inside my head now we're going to be
working with the body so we'll make a
tag here a div tag and it's quickly and
do and we'll put the ID whoa the ID
equal to top nav pretty cool okay and
then slide out our top nav will have an
unordered list for our menu so unordered
list and inside the unordered list it
must be a list index so start the list
index and in the list index and inside
the list index obviously to take us to
the other page there has to be a link so
open and close your links and then just
H riff equals hash okay and then home
okay so our first link will take us to
our home page pretty much like every
other website in the entire world
and then our second link can be you know
oops
about now you know tutorial tutorial
page
and then from they will put a contact
page book contact not contract okay and
now that's basically our menu the HTML
file for our menu done but because we
want a drop-down menu
we obviously want a sub menu within our
menu a list within a list a sub list my
dream within a dream
inception I don't know I wasn't that big
of a fan of Inception either so if you
didn't laugh at that joke yep it
probably wasn't funny okay and then what
we'll do now is we'll put our list index
all of that fortunately I still have it
copied so I can just ctrl v still got it
all there and now see what we've done
here yeah I've done it wrong see there
I've made my mistake okay
you got your list index which you open
then you have your link or whatever's in
your link you and your link and you take
this you don't end your Lester you you
continue that list until the end or that
list index sorry until the end of this
unordered list so you have an unordered
list within the list index
okay so unordered list within the list
and then that can have a couple of Lists
indexes now this will be the part that
drops down from the menu so over here
you know we can maybe have a quick link
all the way to our web development page
for our web development tutorials and
then you know a quick link maybe all the
way to some GIMP tutorials you know
maybe another another one you know for
for blender tutorials so blender and
then you know instead of going to a page
to choose what they'd like to learn they
could just go straight to web
development straight to GIMP or straight
to blender so that's that side that
would be done
and seeing is just look at some time in
this tutorial I'll just add in another
another page quickly so new file save as
and we'll call this menu dot CSS and
save that cool and now we just need a
link to that CSS for styling link
relationship equals style sheet make
sure I spell that right and then H ref
is equal to and the H rift is menu dot
CSS will CSS not see ssssss go safe okay
so now that we've linked our two pages
for the starting and we've completed all
our HTML code that'll be the end of this
first tutorial on web development I mean
on drop down menu but we'll continue in
the next tutorial so don't forget to
like my video and see you in the next
one good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
