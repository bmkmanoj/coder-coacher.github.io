here and welcome to tutorial number nine
and in this tutorial we are going to be
talking about math operators in PHP so
what do I mean by operators well I'm
talking about the symbols that we use in
PHP to perform certain actions so if you
guys watched the previous tutorials then
you guys know that I've already showed
you one Operator
which was called the assignment operator
okay and that was the equal sign so I
had a variable called name and I used
the equal sign to assign the value of
Quentin to the variable name okay so
this equal sign assigned this vert this
value to this variable now we are going
to use math operators in PHP to perform
certain mathematical calculations with
PHP okay so to do that I'm actually just
gonna explain all the operators to you
so I'm going to comment this out okay
and we'll write caps lock on math
operators at the top here okay and I'll
turn my caps lock off now the first
operator that we can use in PHP is
called the plus sign okay and that just
adds two numbers together so that's
quite straightforward okay two numbers
together then the next one is the minus
symbol and you guys can probably guess
what that does it just subtracts one
number from another okay then we've also
got the multiplication symbol but this
isn't going to be like an X or something
that you use
do in maths in computer programming we
use the asterisk symbol so that little
star above the number eight on your
keyboard okay that is the multiplication
symbol okay and then we've also got
division which you guys can pretty much
guess that is going to be this forward
slash okay and that's going to divide
one number from another okay and the
last one that I want to talk to you guys
about is gonna be the modulus symbol
which is the percent sign okay and you
might be a little bit confused by this
one but this returns the remainder okay
when one number is divided by another so
divided by another okay so those are
just our notes for this tutorial but
let's actually get on to it and actually
do some mathematical calculations okay
so I'm gonna make a variable called
example and we can set this equal to 7
plus 2 now this is going to be very
straightforward because obviously
example is gonna be equal to 7 plus 2
which we know to be 9 okay so if I go
ahead and echo my variable example let's
go see what we get printed out on the
screen
ok so I'll just have to put that
semicolon in come back here ok now I
actually went ahead and tested this I
needed to minimize my browser and get
all this organized but you should get 9
printed out on the screen ok
likewise if we go back and we change
this to an minus symbol okay then this
is going to be a 7
- - which we know to be five so if we
save that
come back here click refresh now we've
got five printed out on the screen so we
know that 7 minus 2 is 5 ok again silly
examples but I'm just making sure that
you guys understand all the math
operators ok so then we've also got 7
multiplied by 2 which we know to be 14
so when we come back and click refresh
there we go we've got 14 printed out on
the screen
ok likewise I can also use the divide
symbol and that's gonna take 7 divided
by 2 so we should land up with 3 and 1/2
so let me go click refresh and there we
go
3.5 printed out onto the screen ok ok so
now we can go ahead and talk about this
more complicated symbol and that is the
modulus symbol so if I go ahead and I
change this to percent seven percent -
okay
this is gonna divide 7 by 2 and then
give us the remainder so to actually
goes into 7 3 times like we saw when we
did the previous division example so
we've got if I put this back here we got
3 and a half okay
so we don't actually want the point 5 we
want an actual remainder okay so 7 2
goes into 7 three times with a remainder
of 1 so now that I've saved this if we
go back here and click refresh there we
go we've got 1 printed out on the screen
ok now if you still don't understand
then we can go ahead and maybe change
this to 8 okay so now we've got 8
modulus - okay and 2 goes into 8 exactly
4 times with no remainder because 8
divided by 2
is for not for point anything just for
so we should get a remainder of zero so
if we go back here click refresh there
we go got zero printed out on the screen
so how awesome is that not only can we
perform basic math calculations in PHP
but we've also got this little modulus
symbol so we can get the remainder so
that's all I have for you guys in this
