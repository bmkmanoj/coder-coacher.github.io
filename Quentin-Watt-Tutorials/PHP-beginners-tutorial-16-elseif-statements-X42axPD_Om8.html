here and welcome to tutorial number 16
and in this tutorial we are going to
talk about the else if statement so I
hope you guys have watched the previous
tutorial because I'm actually going to
continue from where I left off in that
video and if you guys did watch that
video then if you can remember correctly
I told you that I was gonna make a
program that checks whether the number I
store in my variable is positive or
negative okay so I told you that we can
check for positive number by just
checking if number is greater than zero
okay because obviously any positive
number is going to be greater than zero
then we'll just print out that the
number is positive but now we actually
have a bit of a problem because what
happens when I set number equal to zero
okay well zero isn't greater than zero
so we're not getting this message
printed out but we are getting a message
that says that the number zero is
negative and zero last time I checked is
not negative and neither is it positive
okay zero is not positive or negative
it's it's somewhere in the middle you
know so I told you guys it would be
really handy if we could check for an
alternative condition so we can check
for if number is greater than zero and
then we also need a check for if number
is equal to zero okay and that is where
the else if statement is useful okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and type in else if
and in parentheses over here I can put
in another condition okay so I leave my
curly braces as
well and basically now what we're going
to do is check
well obviously 0 is not greater than 0
but we want to check obviously if 0 is
equal to 0 or if number our variable
number is equal to 0 so I'm going to go
ahead and just say number equals equals
0 remember the double equal sign is to
compare if two values are equal okay and
then I'll go ahead and echo out a
message so the number number is not
positive or negative okay and we should
probably change those things to number
as well it makes a lot more sense as
number than variable I don't know what I
was thinking yesterday okay so now we
can actually run this program and test
that a few times because right now we
actually have the issue of 0 being
printed out as a negative number but
let's go ahead and see if we just fix
that
okay so let's refresh and I made narrow
I didn't put in a semicolon
I've got to watch out for those okay so
let's go back and click refresh and as
you can see it says the number 0 is not
positive or negative okay so it seems to
be working for 0 now let's go ahead and
make sure that it works for negative 2
okay so we should get this message print
it out on the screen let's go back and
see what happens the number negative 2
is negative okay awesome
and if we change this to 5 then we can
go ahead and click refresh and you can
see that the number 5 is positive okay
so the reason why all of that worked was
because we were first checking for one
condition so we're saying okay if number
is greater than zero we'll print out
this then we used our else--if statement
which really came in handy because now
we could check for an alternative
condition so when this one is false
we can always check for another
condition and we can have as many else
if statements as we want over here so I
can then go ahead and check again for a
different condition if I wanted to if my
program needed it to work but
unfortunately I don't actually need
another if start else if statement so
that's all we can do for now so just
remember that an else if statement is
there to check for an alternative
condition so like I said you can have as
many as you want so you can check for
this condition and if that's not true
then you can check for another condition
and if that's not true you can check for
another condition and if that one's not
true then you can go ahead and just put
in an else which will just work for
everything that wasn't one of your
previous conditions already okay so
that's all I have for you guys in this

my channel grow and I'll see you guys in
