here and welcome to tutorial number two
in my builder website from start to
finish series and in this video I want
to talk to you guys a little bit about
project management so we're not getting
into the code just yet but this is a
really really useful skill to have and
yeah I want to show you guys how to use
this tool which is called asana so
before we get started fun fact about
asana if you go ahead and google it you
can see that the CEO the current CEO is
Dustin Moskovitz and if you know a
little bit about Facebook or if you've
watched the social network you'll know
that Dustin Moskovitz is basically the
other program that started Facebook with
Mark Zuckerberg so yeah interesting
story there but now that I've got that
useless fact out of the way let's take a
look at how to use a Sunnah now when you
first go to a sanas website you're
probably gonna have to sign up it's
probably gonna give you a tutorial on
how to use the Sunnah it's gonna show
you guys how to set up a team and how to
set up a project so I'm gonna assume
that when you go through or when you go
to a Sunnah you're gonna go through all
of this stuff and I'm not gonna show you
how to do it because basically asana is
gonna show you guys how to do this but
what I am gonna show you is how I'm
setting up my project and how I'm gonna
manage this basically once you've gotten
through all of that and you look at a
sauna now you should have a bar on the
left hand side of the screen and from
here you can create different teams so
over here I've got a tutorial dev team
this is the team I'm gonna be working in
for this tutorial series now I can see
that right now you guys can see that I'm
just a team of one it's only me but if
you guys had designers and other
developers you could go ahead and invite
all of those people by an email address
and yeah that way everybody would know
or is going on in your project but I'm
gonna assume that all of us is just a
team of one right now and it's still
really useful to use a sauna in this way
because it basically gives you a check
box or a checklist of things that you
need to get done
and you can also schedule everything so
you can say like I'd like to get these
number of things done by the end of the
week so you can set deadlines for
yourself and manage or hopefully manage
those deadlines and finish your website
on time
but now what I'd like to do is go over
to the little projects button here and
I'm gonna hit plus so that's gonna allow
me to create a new project and let's
call this build a website from start to
finish right and you'll see this is very
important by the way but you'll see
you've got a layout over here that you
can choose right now so we can choose
list layout or board layout and in fact
I'm gonna choose board layout which is
kind of new to a sauna but the funny
thing is if you choose list you will
never ever be able to see the boards but
if you choose board layout you can
actually see a list of tasks so it's
kind of funny how that works but I
basically make sure you choose board
otherwise you're probably not gonna get
the opportunity to choose this again
until you set up a new project so let's
go ahead and hit create and yeah now you
can see we've got our project over here
and this is an empty project so right
now we don't have any tasks in here we
don't have any columns in here and
that's what it's asking us to add right
now so I'm gonna hit the add columns
button and essentially what we're trying
to do here is set up different phases
for our projects so we'll have a
planning phase and after stuff has been
finished getting planned we will start
designing that and then we'll start
building that so these are the columns
that we need to set up here so I'm gonna
set up a column for planning I'm going
to set up another column for design so
once we're finished planning something
we'll move on to designing it once we're
finished designing something we'll move
on to actually coding it and once we
have coded it we'll move on to finally
testing it and once it is tested it will
be complete so I believe once it's
complete all we need to do is
the checkbox we don't have to move it
over to a completed column see okay so
just go back to that project over there
and what I'd like to do now is start
setting up a bunch of tasks so I'm going
to set one or two up and I'm going to
show you guys how they work and after
that I'm just gonna pause the video and
setup a bunch of others and I'll come
back once they're done so let's hit the
plus button and I'm going to set up my
first task over here which is going to
be to research UI kits which is one of
the technologies that we're going to be
using for this tutorial series and I'm
going to basically this is now a task
and I'm going to assign this task to
somebody so I can click on this little
circle button and assign that to myself
because I'm the only person in the team
or I can add somebody else if I like and
then I can set a deadline for that so I
can say like I'd like to have that done
by today or tomorrow or next week
whatever suits your timeline if I click
on that I can also add in a bunch of
extra options over here so I can include
a description I can write comments to
other people in my team right now I'm
the only person in the team so no point
in writing a comment and yeah there's a
lot of stuff that a Sun I can do so that
well has our first task let's create a
second task over here so let's say
research current design trends that's
also something we're going to need to
get done and hopefully we can get that
done today as well so I'm going to set
the deadline for today and I'm gonna
assign that to myself alright and yeah
the rest of this stuff is gonna be more
of the same so I'm going to pause the
video here and come back once I've got a
bunch of tasks set up
ok so I am back and yeah I've punched
I've gone ahead and set up a bunch of
different tasks yeah so I've set some up
in the planning phase for today I've got
some design toss set up here so I've
basically broken everything up into
little bits and pieces to make it easier
for us and also give us some tasks that
we can check off occasionally
and then I've gone ahead and done the
same thing for the coding so we'll
basically code our website in bits and
pieces
just making it obviously easier for us
to get the website done right and then
at the end once I finish building
something I can move it over to the
testing block and actually test the
stuff that I've built but for now let's
just leave everything as it is now the
great thing is once all of these are set
up and they are assigned to people that
person whoever logs in the next day if
you're the only person on this project
you can log in the next day or whatever
they click on my tasks and you can see
all the tasks that you have to take care
of in a list so right now there are a
bunch of extra tasks showing up here
that's just because I have another
project set up on the side but yeah all
your projects are set up here you can go
ahead and look at them in list order
along with the description and once
you've completed it go ahead and hit
that check box to say you've done it I'm
just gonna hit undo because obviously I
haven't finished building that and yeah
I think looking at the project in the
project view with the board design just
gives you a little bit more structure
than actually looking at it as a list
and yeah now that we have our
instructions of what we need to do for
the next couple of videos I'm going to
end this tutorial off here and I'll join
you guys in the next video where we will
actually start taking care of some of
these tasks but before I end this video
off I just want to send a huge shout out
to my patrons and yeah if you guys are
wanting to download the code for this
tutorial series don't forget to become a
patron and that's all I have for you
guys in this video so don't forget to
leave a like comment
and to share this video because that's
really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
