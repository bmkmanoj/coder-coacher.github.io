here and welcome to tutorial number 38
and in this tutorial I am gonna show you
guys how to use a default argument in
your function now you could do this in
case someone forgets to supply an
arguments or you could do it in case you
decided well hey my function all of the
arguments that my function is going to
use aren't entirely necessary so for the
ones that are necessary we won't give a
default argument too but for the ones
that are are not really necessary we'll
just give a default argument to those
and then that way whenever the program
later on once the use this function they
can supply all of the arguments if they
want to or they can just supply one or
two of the arguments so to show you what
I mean by all of this let's create
function and I'm just going to call call
my function say hello so function not
function say hello and all it is gonna
do is say hello whatever okay so very
descriptive function there and I'm gonna
make it expect two arguments so the
first argument it should expect is going
to be the greeting and the second
argument that it should expect is going
to be a name and then all I'm gonna make
this function do is say it's just going
to echo out greeting or the greeting and
then it's gonna also echo out space so
we'll just depend on that and then
append on the name as well so whatever
you choose to be a greeting let's say
it's your greeting is gonna be hello or
ciao whatever language you're speaking
and you want a greeting that's gonna fit
that language you can go ahead and put
that in there and
also it can echo out your name should
you choose to put that in as an argument
okay so now let's call this function so
I'm gonna call say hello and I'm gonna
supply a greeting of just hello there
but I'm going to purposefully leave out
this name argument so let me just put a
semicolon in there before I get an error
save this and now when I click refresh
you can see I've got an error that says
missing arguments to force a hello okay
and that's because we left out this
named argument okay now if I went ahead
and supplied that argument so let me say
I put in my name Quinton then this would
work just fine
when I click refresh now my program will
work and it'll say hello they Quentin
but let's take that out because I'm
gonna use a default argument instead so
the way we use a default arguments in
PHP is whenever you're selling your
function to expect an arguments also add
in an equal sign and then set it equal
to the value that you want to use so I'm
just going to use user as my default
name okay so basically now whenever this
function is called if we forget the name
attribute like let's say we purposefully
forgot it then it's no longer actually
necessary because we're not going to get
an error
our program should still echo out the
word user so we've got hello there
user instead of getting an error which
is obviously quite nice but if we
decided that hey we don't want to say
hello there user we'd rather echo the
user's name then all we need to do is
remember to actually add in a name here
so we'll add in Quinton again and now
when I click refresh
I've still got I've got hello there
Quinton so if we pass an argument then
our argument will override the default
argument but if we forget to pass the
argument then our function will make use
of the default argument instead of
throwing an error and crashing the
program so that's how to use a default
argument in PHP and that's all I have
