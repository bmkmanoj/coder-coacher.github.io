here and welcome back to tutorial number
24 and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to use javascript to
reference elements on your web page
so in the last tutorial we learn about
objects methods and properties and I
told you that we'll be actually using
those quite a bit over the next couple
tutorials just because everything in
JavaScript is an object and it has
methods and properties okay so in this
tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you a method that belongs
to our document and what that method
allows us to do is look for elements on
our webpage and then actually we can
find them and change them okay so in
other words if a paragraph says click me
then I can change it to say something
else later on okay so what we need to do
now is we might as well actually just
take a look at the method that we're
going to use and the method that we're
going to use is called get element by ID
and if you ever want to use this in
JavaScript you have to use uppercase
letters where I've used uppercase
letters and like I said this is a method
that belongs to our document object okay
and what this method does is it'll
search through our entire document and
look for an element with an ID of
whatever we put in here
okay so ID goes in here whatever ID is
between these two quotation marks that
is what we're going to be looking for
okay so what we actually have to do is
we need to put an element on our webpage
with an ID that we can look for so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to put
in this paragraph
and I'm going to give it an ID of para
okay and then I also want to just type
in click me as whatever goes inside my
paragraph so now if we take this idea
over here I'm going to copy it and we
paste it in between these two
parenthesis what this line then means is
cut our document search an entire
document for this ID okay and when you
find this ID that is now our new object
that we're going to be working with so
in other words this paragraph then
becomes an object that we can work with
or it's it always has been we've just
found it this is how we find it okay
so right now this line of code actually
means nothing in JavaScript so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to delete
this and I'm going to save this and
let's just run this in Firefox to see
what it looks like okay right now we
just have a little paragraph on the
screen that says click me so nothing
important now however we can actually
write a function that will change the
contents of this paragraph tag when we
click on the paragraph okay
so we're also going to be making use of
an event so I'll just make it on click
and now what this means is whenever I
click on this paragraph we're going to
try run a little bit of JavaScript code
well what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to call a function so if you guys
don't know what this is this is an event
and I spoke about events in a previous
tutorial so if you don't know what
events all you need to go back and watch
that but now what we're going to do is
we're going to call this function okay
and this function doesn't exist anyway
yet I still have to make it okay
so I could name this whatever I want but
keep in mind I have to make the function
the exact same name as that call okay so
I'm going to call this function change
and I already spoke to you guys about
functions in a previous tutorial so if
you guys don't know what a function is
and you go back and watch that too okay
but now what we're going to do is we'll
write a function that changes the
contents of this paragraph okay so we
can use our document dot get element by
ID document dot get element by ID and we
need to grab this paragraph okay
so this is now how we can refer to our
paragraph in JavaScript by using this
exact method but right now there's two
different things we could do with this
okay we could actually declare a new
variable so far paragraph or para and
then we could set it equal to this okay
and now whenever roof 3 we refer to our
variable para we're referring to this
code here
okay so para or what we could have done
was instead of instead of doing that we
could have appended on the property that
we wanted to change okay so because this
of this paragraph over here is an object
it also has properties that we can
change and one of the properties that we
can change on this paragraph is
something called the inner HTML okay and
what inner HTM
is well it's basically whatever goes
between the starting tag and the ending
tag okay so the inner HTML of this
paragraph would be the words click me
including all the spaces obviously okay
so what we can do is we can go back to
our paragraph variable over here and
append on the property in a HTML and you
have to use uppercase letters we are
aware I've used uppercase letters and we
can set that equal to whatever we want
our paragraph to say after it was
clicked so we can say that tickles
or something I don't know maybe that's
kind of cute okay go ahead and save this
and now when we go back to Firefox and
click refresh we still only have this
paragraph but now when we click it it
should change so there we go
that tickles okay okay so the reason why
that happened was because we changed the
inner HTML property of that object okay
and like I said there were actually two
ways to do this so the first way which
we did was we declared a new variable
called para and then we set up our
variable equal to this little statement
so now what happened was every time we
wrote the word para or the variable
power then we what the computer does is
it actually replaces this text to be
part of that so if we go ahead and say
copy and paste this here okay then
that's basically how the computer saw
that line of code as document dot get
element by ID para dot inner HTML so
that is the other way we
could have done this okay we could have
just typed in that one line document dot
get element by ID para in HTML just like
that and save this and that would have
worked just fine too so when you go back
and click refresh we've got the word
click me and when I click on it it says
that tickles
so either all is fine but I like to just
declare it as a variable most of the
time because then instead of only being
able to work with the inner HTML and
property I could change the property I
could use a completely different
property and change my paragraph even
more or do even more stuff with my
paragraph so that's actually all I have
for you guys in this tutorial but it was
a pretty good one because we finally
learn how to change something on our web
page after the web page had been loaded
which is like the whole point of
JavaScript so we've finally got there so
