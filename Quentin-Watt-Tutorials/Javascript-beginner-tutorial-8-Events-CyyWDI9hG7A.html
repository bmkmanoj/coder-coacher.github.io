here and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about events so up until now
all of the code that we have been
writing has consisted of simple
statements that run or get executed as
soon as our webpage opens but there are
times where we're going to want our code
to run only after the users click the
button or fold in a form or hovered over
a certain area with their mouse and to
do this we make use of something called
an event now an event is basically
something that happens on our web page
and most of the time these events only
occur when the user actually triggers
the certain event so there are quite a
few different types of events and I'm
not going to be able to go through all
of them in this video but what I did do
is I made a list on my forum so if you
guys go ahead and just open up my
YouTube channel you will see there's a
link at the top of my YouTube channel to
my forum go ahead and open that and I
will also place a link in the
description below this video to this
webpage which is on my forum and
basically what happens is if you go
visit this page I've got a list of all
of the events that can occur in
JavaScript and also a list of when they
occur
okay so let's go ahead and take a look
at this on click event over here okay
now this occurs whenever the user clicks
on an element okay so let's go ahead and
use this ending in an example real quick
now first I actually just want to show
you what happens whenever we write our
code in our script section and to do
that let's go ahead and alert something
out on the screen
okay so this is different to actually
just writing something on the screen
we're actually going to make a pop-up
box up here so to do this we just write
in the word alert followed by
parentheses and inside here we can use
quotation marks and we can actually
write out a message on the screen
so our message will go in between these
two quotation marks so let's go ahead
and say you have opened my webpage as
the message and we go ahead and end this
off with a semicolon because this is a
statement go ahead and save this and
when we run this in Firefox as soon as
the page runs you can see we've got this
alert box that appears and says you have
opened my webpage go ahead and click OK
and we can proceed now let's take a look
at doing the exact same thing but only
after the user has clicked the button so
let's go ahead and delete this and let's
go ahead and add a button on our screen
so to do this we have to add in a form
not a forum a form and end form okay and
by the way if you guys don't know what
I'm doing right now go back and watch my
HTML videos and then you'll be good to
go because you'll understand what this
is okay and let's add in an input of
type is equal to button and we'll set
the value equal to click me and we can
go ahead and end this off for now so
let's save this go back to Firefox and
click refresh and I think we're actually
done with ease so we can close them and
now you can see we've got this button on
our screen this is click me but when we
click it nothing happens so now what we
can do is actually go ahead and add in a
third attribute and the attribute that I
want to add in
is our unclick event listener so go
ahead and type in on click because we
want to use the click event and then we
can go ahead and set this equal to
something okay and what I want to set
this equal to is just an alert so now in
between these two quotation marks we can
actually type in normal JavaScript code
and let's go ahead and type in alert and
we need to end it off with a semicolon
at the end there and inside here be
careful because we've already used
double quotation marks for our unclick
attribute of es so we don't want to
break out of that by accident so inside
here I'm going to use single quotation
marks and that will work just fine too
and let's type in a message that should
be alerted so let's just say you clicked
me go ahead and save this and now when
we go back to Firefox and we refresh
whenever we click this button we'll get
an alert box that appears on the screen
that says you clicked me so click me you
click me and this is actually fun I
think I could do this all day
click me you click me okay cool anyway
now what we can do is take a look at
another event so let's go ahead and
change this up a little bit in the code
and instead of using the on click event
let's use the on mouse-over so on mouse
over and this will happen every time you
move your mouse over an element and what
we can do is we can change this to you
hovered over me okay and let's go ahead
and change the value over here as well
because this way not make sense so let's
just say over mouse-over me go ahead and
save this and now when we go back to
Firefox and we click refresh instead of
clicking on our button every time I move
my mouse over the button the alert box
will appear so let me go ahead and move
my mouse over the button boom as soon as
you move the mouse there it says you
have hovered over me go ahead and click
okay and we can go ahead and do this
again as soon as we touch the button
there we go
cool so that's just basically what
events do and how we can use them now
don't forget to check out my forum and
look at that list with all of the other
events so that you guys can play around
with them and make a whole bunch of cool
stuff happen but for now that's all I
have for you so goodbye thanks for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
