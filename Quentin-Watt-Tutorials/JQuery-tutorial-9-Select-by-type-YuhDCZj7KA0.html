here and in this video we're going to
talk about jQuery selectors and I'm
going to show you how to select an
element on your webpage by its type so
we're going to be doing that a lot
whenever working with forms because
usually form input elements all have an
attribute of type and that type has to
be set equal to something to determine
what gets displayed in the browser so if
I expand this form out you can see that
we have three paragraphs and each one of
these paragraphs has an input element
with a type equal to something so the
first two have a type of text and the
last one has a type of submit and if we
take a look at this in the browser this
is pretty much what that form looks like
we have a label and input element a
label an input element and our submit
button okay so now we can actually use
jQuery to actually select one of these
elements by its type and I'm going to
select the input elements of type text
first so the way we do that is by
opening up our usual dollar sign and
parentheses which we use to select
elements and inside of that I'm going to
add in my quotation marks and here's
where things get a little bit different
because in order to select an element by
its type we add in a colon and this
tells jQuery okay we're now going to be
selecting all of the elements on our
page with a type of whatever we put in
over here and I'm going to type in the
word text so that means we're going to
select all of the elements with type
text and I'm going to add in an event
handler over here and the event handler
that I'm going to use is focus in
and the focus in event occurs whenever
we actually focus in or whenever we
click on one of these elements so let's
say I click on this input element you
can see that the cursor is now blinking
inside of that input input element and
that is that all that means that we're
focused in on this input elements and as
soon as I click away and the blinking
cursor is gone that means we have
blurred away from that input element so
focus in and then blur is when you leave
that element and what happens when we
want to focus in well we're going to run
a function and as you guys know function
in jQuery just means we want to do
something whenever this event occurs and
I'm going to break that down a line and
end the software the semicolon so we
have our you know standard function or
selection and then function that we've
been working with over the past few
tutorials and what I want to do here is
now change the background color of my
input element to something else so what
I could do is select my input element
again and just select that by the type
of text and change the CSS so dot CSS
and the CSS function will take two
properties so the first property will go
in quotation marks then I'll leave a
comma and we'll add in the second
property which will also go in between
quotation marks the first property is
basically what CSS property you want to
change and the second argument is going
to be what value you want to set this
property equal to so I'm going to change
the background and I'm going to
set this background equal to something
like blue and now when we click on one
of our input elements or whenever we
focus in on one of our input elements we
should change the background color so
let's go over to Firefox and I'm going
to click on first name or I'm going to
click on this input element next to
first name and I actually didn't click
refresh data
so now that I've clicked refresh you can
see whenever I focus in on that element
it's turned blue and if I try and focus
away nothing happens just yet
and one other weird thing is I focused
in on this top element but both of these
text elements changed so how do we
actually fix that gauge as well and I'm
going to show you guys how to fix both
of those so the first glitch that we're
going to fix is the glitch that makes
both of them change at the same time and
that is basically done by using a
different selector over here okay
because what we did was listen for one
of our input elements to be focused in
and then we selected all of our input
elements with the type of text and
change the background color and we don't
want to actually do that we just want to
change the background color of the
current elements that we are focused in
on and the way we do that is by using
the this selector and the this selector
will basically just select the element
that we are currently working with or
the other or the basically the element
that actually triggered this event to
occur so we've selected this element and
we're changing the background color to
blue and now if I go back over to my
browser I click refresh this goes all
back to normal when I click on this
first element you can see that only the
first element has changed blue so not
both of them change blue and if I click
away that still remains blue but if I
click onto this one now
only this element change blue and if I
click away
it hasn't changed back so if we want to
change those back to white whenever we
focus away on blur out of one of those
input elements all we have to do is
actually select our input again and then
instead of using the focus in event
handler we can use the blur event
handler and we're still going to be
working with the selector we're still
going to change the background but
instead of changing the background to
blue we'll change this back to white and
now when I click Save and we go over to
our browser we can actually test this
out so notice that they're both white at
the moment and as soon as I click in on
first name it changes to blue if I click
away and I focus away from that input
element it's back to white and if I
click on this element it's the same
thing it's changed to blue and if I
click away it changes to white and that
is how we use these elements or that is
how we use jQuery to select an element
by the type and that's all I have for
