in here and this is tutorial number 48
and in this tutorial I'm going to speak
to you guys about the text area element
that you can add into your form and if
you guys don't know what the text area
element does then that is basically that
big block of typing space that you can
type a whole big message into say like
an email or even a youtube comment or
something like that so it basically just
gives you more space to type something
than an actual input type of text so to
get started let's go ahead and add this
text area tag into our page so text area
if I can spell it correctly and I think
I'm just going to duplicate that and I'm
feeling very lazy at the moment and put
a closing slash in there okay and then
I'm going to give this text area an
attribute and you can probably guess
which attribute it is it's going to be
the name attribute and the reason why we
give every one of our elements a name is
because whenever the user Falls data or
data or data I don't know how you guys
like me to say that word but I say data
and a lot of other people say either
data or data um data or data so anyway
whenever the user files data or data
into this text area we need some way of
identifying that data and we're going to
identify that by the name that we're
going to give this text area so I'm
going to give this text area and name of
story because I'm going to ask the user
to tell me a story
so tell me a story and I'm going to add
a break tag in here for display purposes
but now whenever the user was to visit
this webpage we get
this question over here or rather a
yeast like command tell me a story and
then the user actually has to tell us
the story type it in here okay and then
I'm going to speak to you guys about two
other attributes that we could place
into this text area okay and both of
them are actually for resizing this text
area so right now you can see we're able
to resize it and make it as big as we
want but by default whenever we refresh
this the text area appears to be quite
small so we can make that a lot bigger
if we go back to notepad and we could
add in two other attributes so I'm going
to add in an attribute of rose and I'm
going to set that equal to 15 and then
I'm also going to add in an attribute of
columns and I'm going to set that equal
to let's say 60 okay and rows are
basically how high you want the text
area to be and columns are basically how
wide you want the text area to be but
this is not a measurement of pixels it's
actually a measurement of characters so
right now if we were to take a look at
this text area without refreshing the
page I can add in one two three
so by default minam of rows is three
rows and my columns well let's go ahead
and find that out now so let's go three
four five six seven eight nine and zero
and okay so that's ten one two three
four five six seven eight nine zero one
two so by default our amount of columns
over here is basically that 10 plus this
10 plus those two so 22 okay and now we
can go ahead and actually refresh this
and you can see it gets a lot bigger
because now we're actually you
in the rows that we specified here and
the columns that we specified here so we
got a lot more space but you cannot you
guys can also use CSS to change the
width and the height of this text area
so if you guys don't want to use inline
attributes like this then CSS is a much
better option actually so I'm going to
go ahead and just save that like that
because that's all we have for this
tutorial and yeah in the next video I'm
going to be speaking to you guys about
all sorts of buttons that we can use on
our webpage so come back for that and
until next time don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like and share this video and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
