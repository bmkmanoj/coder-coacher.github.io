here and welcome back to tutorial number
five and in this tutorial I'm going to
talk to you guys about comments in PHP
so comments are human readable notes
that make your code a lot easier to read
and are ignored by PHP okay and it's
pretty good for us as programmers to
leave comments in our code so that way
we can remember what a specific piece of
code does okay and it also helps us
let's say we were working in a group or
a team of programmers if I wrote code
and I left a lot of comments it would be
a lot easier for the other guys reading
my code to understand it without having
to try and decipher it themselves or you
know coming to me and asking me what
that code does if I left comments then
they'd know okay so that's why we use
comments and there are actually a few
different ways that we can make comments
in PHP so the first way that I'm going
to show you guys is called a multi-line
comment and this is a comment that spans
over multiple lines okay so to make a
multi-line comment we start off with a
forward slash and an asterisks okay
now that means that everything after
this is going to be commented out and
that is why all of this text over here
turned green okay
and if we want to end our comment off we
just end it off with an asterisks and a
forward slash again okay so that's the
start of our comment and this is the end
of our comment and everything in here
would be commented out so it doesn't
matter if this goes over multiple lines
okay we could have my name over there
and we could also have maybe the date so
today is the 22nd of the 1st 2014
and we could probably even have a
description of what this code does so
well that's actually what we should have
is a description of what the code does
so let's just say it goes out my name on
the screen and this is a quite a dumb
example because anyone can look at this
and see that it echoes my name onto the
screen but we might have some more
complicated code later on that is
probably a lot harder to understand
where we will need a comment okay so if
we run this in Firefox now so if I go
ahead and click Save go back to Firefox
and I click refresh you can see I've got
just hello my name is Quinton and I'm 21
years old so I've only got these two
echos printed out on the screen this was
completely ignored by PHP because it's a
comment and it's only there for us as
programmers whenever we are reading the
code in notepad plus plus or whatever
text editor we're using it's only there
for us to read so that it helps us
understand our code whatever our code
might be okay now the next type of
comment is called a single line comment
and there are actually two different
ways in PHP to make a single line
comment the first way is by just adding
two forward slashes so whatever goes
after these forward slashes is commented
out as you can see when I type my name
it's turned green so that means that it
is commented out and if I go ahead and I
put the date over there then that's fine
as well I can do that but if I go over
to the next line and I'll try type
something out like hello world or
whatever you can see that this text is
black so this has not been commented out
and if I try and save this
and refresh this now you can see we've
got an error and that's basically
because this isn't PHP code it isn't
valid PHP code so PHP doesn't know what
the heck that is and that's why it's
giving us an error so we could go ahead
and comment this out and that way PHP
would ignore it although it's pointless
to have something dumb like that in your
comments it should really be something
that describes the code in some way or
just helps you understand the code okay
and the next way is instead of using two
forward slashes you can also use the
hash symbol or the pound key and
basically everything after that one
pound symbol becomes a comment so that
is a comment and you can sell that in
notepad plus plus because it's turned
green and as you can see when you go
over to the next line that's black text
again so that is not a comment okay so a
single line comment only goes over one
line and the next thing I can tell you
guys is that a lot of people if they're
really one code to stand out they
actually make like this weird block so
they'll go ahead and now have like a
whole bunch of pound symbols and then
they'll have like four going down or
something and a whole bunch of pound
symbols again and inside here they'll
put in a description this is usually at
the top of the code so luck
they'll be like written by who whatever
the name was and then they'll have more
description maybe the date or something
so again the 22nd of the first 2014 and
this code echo is my name
whatever
okay and they'll probably make it try
and look very tidy so if I can just get
this right okay well that's my OCD
kicking in I'm trying to make it look
exactly like a block now but hey yeah
okay it's done so that's what a lot of
programmers like to do just so that it
stands it out it's not pretty in any way
but it stands out if you had a whole you
know three or four thousand lines of
code or even if it was 200 lines of code
this would stand out a lot more than the
code itself so you can see the comments
a lot quicker and it's just going to
help you understand you code a lot
easier so it's just that's the only
reason why people do that and that's all
I have for you guys in this video so
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys next time and as always don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to

up or share the video it's really going
to help my channel grow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
