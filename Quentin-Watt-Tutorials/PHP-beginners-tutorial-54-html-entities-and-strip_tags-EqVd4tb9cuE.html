here and in this tutorial we are going
to be taking a look at a little bit of a
security issue when it comes to
displaying a user input back out in the
browser
okay so we're actually gonna be taking a
look at two different functions one is
called HTML entities and the other one
is called strip tags and basically these
are just going to help us take care of
any HTML elements that the user tries to
put in the input boxes okay so if you
guys aren't really sure what I'm talking
about if you don't really understand
basically I have an input text box over
here and we've also got a a submit
button so if I go ahead and take a look
at this in the browser it basically
looks just like this a text box where
the user can type stuff in and the
submit button okay and now let's go
ahead and just code something out so I'm
just going to make sure that we can
display whatever the user types into
here so first we have to check if this
has been set so if is set dollar
underscore and I'm actually using the
get method over here so we're going to
say dollar underscore get instead of
dollar underscore post and I'm going to
go ahead and grab that input so
conveniently named I named it input so
let's go ahead now and just say okay if
it is set let's go ahead and echo dollar
underscore get input okay
and save this now go over to Firefox
click refresh nothing's broken cool so
let's go ahead now a hand actually type
stuff in so you know normally if I were
to type in my name or something like
that and click Submit there we go I've
got my name displayed out on the page
but what happens if I was you know being
a little bit more malicious and I was
trying to break the web page that you
made so I was trying to hack in or
something I might go ahead and type in
something like ul and Li ending Li and
ending ul ok and actually type something
in here like hey there or whatever but
you you see what I'm getting at I'm
creating an unordered list in my input
box and now when I go ahead and click
Submit oh my gosh
we now displayed this as a list item so
why like if this was a comment section
on YouTube and you know people were able
to do this and start making their own
styles and you know like creating their
own lists and things inside of the
comment section you know I'm saying it's
going to get a little bit out of hand
and things are going to go a little bit
crazy so we need to make some way of
protecting against this so if the user
typed in those HTML elements we want to
either get rid of them or display them
as is with the smaller than sign and the
greater than sign etc okay so that is
where these two functions come into play
HTML entities and strip tags ok so what
we can do now is just go ahead and
surround this echo in our function so
I'm going to go ahead and surround these
in parentheses over here and we're going
to use the HTML entities function first
so HTML entities
okay and what this function does is
strip the Auden not strip the tags but
displays the tags as they are so instead
of you know the browser printing this
out as an unordered list it's just going
to print out the actual tag so UL li hey
there becomes UL li hey there ending Li
ne UL so we don't actually display the
unordered list as if it were an
unordered list in the browser okay again
let's go ahead and take at the second
function over here which is strip tags
so type in strip tags and that is it so
let's go ahead and click Save and we'll
go over to Firefox now and just land on
this brand new so everything is empty
and we'll type the same thing in again
so UL li hey there click Submit and
we've just displayed hey there so it's
not displayed as a list and also the
tags are not showing so that is really
cool at least we didn't show this or
display this with any tags okay so it's
up to you to decide which one of these
functions you'd prefer to use obviously
if the user is trying to if you want the
user to be able to write out HTML tags
like say it were a forum or you know
comment section on a YouTube video like
I know some of you guys like to write
code underneath some of my videos if
YouTube were say using this strip tags
function then you guys would go ahead
and type out all those tags or all that
HTML code and it would all be lost
whereas if they were using
HTML entities then it would go ahead and
display the actual tag elements or the
yeah well the tag elements so you guys
could actually see them so whenever it
is whatever website you're programming
you just need to choose the correct one
for yourself okay and that's all I have
for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share this video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and of course I will see you guys
