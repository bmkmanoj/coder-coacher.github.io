here and welcome to tutorial number 15
and in this tutorial we are going to
talk about else statements so hopefully
by now you guys are used to the idea of
an if statement and we know that we can
use these comparison operators to
compare for different values and check
for different conditions we also know
that we can use logical operators to
check for multiple conditions okay and
most of all we know that an if statement
will only run the code inside of it as
long as these conditions evaluate to
true so if these conditions do not
evaluate to true this code is skipped
okay but there are some times where we
are going to want to actually run some
code even if these conditions are false
okay
so let's actually get rid of all of this
and I actually want to come I want to
declare a new variable called number and
we can set that equal to negative one so
now let's actually make a program to
check whether the number that we have
picked for our variable is positive or
negative okay and we can do that by
checking if the number is greater than
zero because obviously all numbers
greater than zero are positive so let's
go ahead and say if number greater than
zero
then we'll go ahead and do this okay so
let's just echo out something so we'll
echo the variable number so this is
actually going to print out the variable
one or that whatever whatever our
variable was set to okay is positive
okay
so this code will only run sorry this
code will only run if our variable
number is greater than zero but right
now our variable is actually negative
one so what we need to do now is add an
else statement to just run a bit of code
no matter what happens if if as long as
this condition is not met our statement
will run okay so the way we do that is
by typing else and I'm actually gonna
start that on a new line and then we
obviously put in the curly braces again
and now whatever code we put inside this
else statements will be executed if this
condition is false
okay so let's echo out the variable
number oops I accidentally hit cap sock
is negative okay so this is interesting
because if we read through this now
we're checking is number greater than
zero well if it is let's go ahead and
print out the variable number is
positive okay but for all other possible
situations so if number is not greater
than zero basically
oh so if if it's less than zero if it's
zero or something we'll just print out
the number is negative okay
so let's go back to Firefox now and
click refresh and as you can see it says
the variable negative 100 yeah is
negative okay
and obviously that happened because
negative 1 is not greater than 0 so
let's go ahead and
put in something like 10 now 10 is
greater than zero so obviously the code
inside our if statement will run okay so
the variable 10 is positive but now what
happens if we change this to just zero
so we've got number is zero okay well
logically this seems to work because if
number is greater than zero
we'll print this out but 0 is not
greater than zero so we're actually
gonna print out the variable number is
negative so if we go back and click
refresh the variable 0 is negative but
zero actually isn't a negative number so
we need to go about fixing this somehow
because we need to actually check for
two different conditions now because now
we need to check well if it's if number
is greater than zero
we'll print out its positive but we also
need to be able to check if number is
zero because then we need to handle this
completely differently and that's what
we're gonna do in the next tutorial so
