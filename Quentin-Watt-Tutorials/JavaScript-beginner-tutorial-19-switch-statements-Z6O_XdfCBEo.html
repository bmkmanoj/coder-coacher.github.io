here and welcome to tutorial number 19
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about something called a switch
statement so let's say we were writing a
program where we ask the user what his
or her favorite type of car was and then
we wanted to give them a custom response
back depending on what value they
entered okay well we already know that
we could use a whole bunch of if
statements so we could create a variable
here and let's say the user entered
Ferrari as their favorite car then we
could go ahead and we could check if car
is equal to Ferrari then we'll go ahead
and we'll do something and if kirara a
car is not equal to Ferrari then we'll
go ahead and say else if car is equal to
Porsche or whatever then we'll go ahead
and do something else and we could carry
on creating a whole bunch of if
statements for every single condition
but that wouldn't be very tidy and it's
actually not the most efficient method
for checking for a whole bunch of cases
okay so what the guys at JavaScript did
was they created this cool thing called
a switch statement and what a switch
statement does is it basically checks
for conditions a lot like if statements
and we can print our code or execute
code depending on what condition we've
met but it does it in a much neater and
a much more efficient way than using a
whole bunch of if statements okay so the
syntax for a switch statement goes as
follows okay we type in the keyword
switch followed by two parentheses with
the variable name inside okay
so whatever variable is in our case
we're working with car so I'm going to
go ahead and just write in car and then
we put in our two curly braces and we
break down okay
and now what we do is we use this
keyword case okay and that basically
means in the case that car is equal to
whatever follows this okay so this is
our condition over here okay
so case the car is equal to Ferrari then
add in a semicolon here then we'll go
ahead and we'll do something so these
are our statements oops
okay statements okay so basically this
means if car that's how variable a is
equal to Ferrari then do this code and
we can go ahead and add in a whole bunch
of other cases so case Ferrari
I mean case car is equal to Porsche then
we can go ahead and do something else
don't forget the semicolon though or the
colon sorry okay so let's go ahead and
actually make our program do something
and what I want to do is we'll just
print stuff out on the screen so
document dot write and what do we want
to write on the screen well if it's
Ferrari we can just write arts it's
aliens Dalian a and if it's a Porsche we
can probably just write something like
German precision a precision I like that
and we might as well add in one more
case so go ahead and copy that just
because it's easier so case dodge and
then we could probably say something
because Dodge is American like American
cars can't corner properly haha just
kidding
cool so basically what we're doing now
is we're checking if car is equal to
Ferrari then we'll go ahead and do this
else if car is equal to Porsche then
we'll go ahead and do this okay but I've
actually left out a very important part
of our switch statement and that is this
keyword called brake okay and we need to
do that at the end of every single one
of our cases so then go ahead and add
this in here and I'll explain what it
does in just a second okay so basically
what the break statement does oh yeah
the brake it is a statement okay
the break statement what that does okay
is instead of going through our entire
switch statements what the computer is
going to do is going to say case our car
is equal to Ferrari I'll go ahead and do
this and then I'm going to break out of
the statement in other words I'm not
going to continue checking for another
match okay because there's no point so
normally if you don't include a break
statement what would happen is this this
statement would run and it will check
case the car is equal to Ferrari okay
I'll do this but because there is not a
break statement I'm going to carry on
checking for Porsche and Dodge and is
actually just going to waste time
basically checking for cases that don't
matter so that's why you go ahead and
you just add in this break statement and
what that means is once you've found the
case you are looking for do this code
and then
take out of the statement so in other
words don't continue with the rest of it
okay so when we go ahead and save this
and run this in Firefox oops
need to minimize that again okay then we
get this Italian stallion a print it out
on the screen so we know that this works
because our car is indeed equal to
Ferrari and the case of Ferrari was
supposed to print out Italian stallion a
and we could go ahead and change this to
Porsche just to make sure it's working
they are spelt the same right okay cool
go ahead and go back to Firefox click
refresh and now I get German precision I
like that which is exactly what we're
supposed to print out if the case was
equal to Porsche okay so that's pretty
cool but now what happens if the user
entered something that isn't in our case
statements so let's say they entered in
that their favorite car was Ford or
favorite type of car was Ford then we
don't have a case in our switch
statement that matches anything okay so
it's going to check is car equal to
Ferrari well no it's not because it's
equal to forward is it equal to Porsche
well no it's not and then is it equal to
Dodge well no it's not
and then it's going to go ahead and do
absolutely nothing so when we save this
and we refresh this in Firefox you can
see there's nothing on our screen okay
and the reason for that is obviously
because there was no case that matched
the value Ford and this might happen
this might be a problem that happens to
you guys often because you can't really
judge what exactly what the user is
going to enter they might enter
something that's completely not valid
and then you're going to have to go
ahead and give them a default message
okay so what the guys at JavaScript did
was they gave us this ability to create
a default case okay and to create a
default case you just type in the
keyword default followed by the colon
and whatever statements we add in after
our default statement or default case
will be printed out or executed if the
computer doesn't find a match in our
switch statement before that okay so
what our computer will then do is it's
going to check okay it caused equal to
Ford well for cars not the case of
Ferrari it's not equal to Ferrari well
we'll skip this is car equal to Porsche
no it's not it's equal to four so we'll
skip this well is quite equal to dodge
no it's not it's equal to Ford
so we'll go ahead and the only other
thing left to do is the default
statement so whatever we're going to do
on default that is what's going to print
out okay so what we can do now is we'll
just print
I don't know that car print it out on
the screen so I don't know that car okay
and I'm not going to put in a break
statement here and the reason why is
because once the computers got to this
default statement that is the end of my
switch statement okay there is no point
in breaking out of this because this is
the end it's not going to save any more
time breaking out of the end it's going
to end anyways you know what I'm saying
so there's no point in using a break
statement underneath your default case
so let's go ahead and save this and then
we can go ahead and run this in Firefox
and now you can see I don't know that
car is printed out on the screen now the
reason why that happened of course is
because the computer ran through all
these cases so
saw that call is equal to Ford and then
obviously that was not the matching case
and this is not a matching case and this
is not a matching case so the only other
thing left to do was our default case
which was to print out
I don't know that car on the screen okay
and if we go ahead and we change this
back to dodge Dodge not ditch Dodge then
save that and run this in Firefox then
you can see American cars corn corner
properly print it out on the screen
which is the case for Dodge okay so
that's all I have for you guys in this
video I hope you guys can come right by
using your own switch statements and
your programs and that's all I have for
