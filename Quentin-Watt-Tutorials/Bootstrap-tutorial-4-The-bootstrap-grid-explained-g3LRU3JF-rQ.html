here
and welcome to bootstrap tutorial number
four and hopefully by now you've got
your bootstrap installation set up and
working correctly because in this video
we are going to be taking a look at the
bootstrap responsive grid so I kind of
mentioned in the introduction video that
bootstrap is made out of this thing
called the wrist or twelve column
responsive grid and you can basically
think of this as a table so in other
words we've got a table with twelve
columns and we can choose how many rows
we want to have in our website right so
the more rows we have the longer our
website gets from top to bottom but
width wise we always have twelve columns
so on a desktop we have really large
columns and as the phone or as the
screen scales down to the size of a
phone then we get twelve columns that
are actually really narrow and I will be
explaining all of that but basically
whenever we use these twelve columns we
can choose how many columns we want to
use at a time so we might have a banner
that will take up all twelve columns and
we can do that and then there might be
times where we want a left side to our
website and then we want to right side
to our website so we can create a row
with two columns that take up six
columns each or two divs that take up
six columns each then there might be
times where you actually want to have
your content on your site eight columns
wide and then you'll have a sidebar with
like adverts or maybe a navigation or
something like that
that is four columns wide and that's the
great thing about bootstrap is we've got
all these different options that we can
choose to use
whenever we are using the bootstrap grid
okay
and as that scales down you'll notice
that the columns actually get a lot
smaller on mobile so what happens is
whenever we get to a mobile site we
actually stack all of those columns so
instead of having a left side and a
right side they'll appear underneath
each other or yeah they'll appear
stacked is the way the word I'm trying
to use okay and the same thing with the
content on the sidebar once the screen
gets too small
we'll just stack the sidebar underneath
the actual content so the way we
actually choose our website to display
differently on a computer to a phone is
that we actually use these things in
bootstrap called breakpoints and
bootstrap actually gives us four
different breakpoints
so we have a large breakpoint which is
for a wide screen computer or a wide
screen laptop and that would be pretty
much most people using computers but
then we also have this medium breakpoint
which actually fits those older square
monitors that you used to have on a
computer so back in the days when I was
like 12 years old and I used to play
computer games on the old square monitor
that's pretty much what we would have or
with what we would be using in a medium
breakpoint because apparently people
still use screens that are that width
which is really weird because I don't
see them very often anymore and I live
in Africa so yeah I don't know if people
are using them in the state still and
we're not using them so much here in
Africa things are a little bit weird
right
but yeah or at least the way that the
story that America tells us of like
America's more advanced than the rest of
world but like what oh yeah okay yeah
that's enough rambling about America but
yeah then we also have small breakpoints
which would be your iPad or any other
tablet
so basically that break points there to
tablets then we have an extra small
break point which is there for your
iPhone or your Samsung Galaxy s5 or any
other phone that actually supports html5
right so yeah we've got these four
different break points and we can choose
our website to have different Numa or
the divs on our website or the
containers on our website to have a
different with each break point and I'll
be going over that in more detail in the
next video when I actually show you guys
how to create a grid but this video was
just on the like whole theory behind the
grid and I think we've got that covered
so that's all I have for you in this
video and don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
or share this video it's really going to
help my channel grow and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
