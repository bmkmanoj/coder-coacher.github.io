here and welcome to tutorial number 28
and in this video I'm going to speak to
you guys a little bit more about forms
okay so I realize in the previous video
I may have rushed things a little bit
too quickly for beginners and I thought
I'd just take a few minutes just to
explain what was going on here and then
I also just wanted to tell you what's
going to happen in the next few
tutorials and we'll move on from there
so right now we've got the code from the
previous tutorial here and if you guys
can remember this was a program that
like printed out whatever we wrote
inside this input element okay but I
realize that some of you may not be
familiar with this thought value
property over here so if I go ahead and
I just comment this out quickly and I
comment this out again over here okay
now we're left with this one variable
okay and this variable is called name
and you guys should know that we've our
set our variable equal to an element
which is this element over here okay
so if I save this and I actually want to
add one more line of code yeah and that
is alert name okay so what I'm doing is
I'm alerting the variable name okay so
that whenever I click on this button
it's going to run this function and
alert our variable name so let's go back
to Firefox now click refresh okay and
now when I click on done I get this
alert box that pops up that tells me
objects HTML input element okay so that
means that I have stored an object
inside of a variable okay and the object
being this input element over here
but when working with forms we don't
really need the entire object okay we
only need one property and that property
is most likely going to be the value so
because an input element and pretty much
all in elements or input elements in a
form have this attribute called value
that is also a property that we can use
up here in JavaScript so when I append
dot value onto the end of this line over
here instead of setting our variable
name equal to this element okay we're
setting it equal to a property which is
the value and the value of an input
element is whatever you type in here
okay so whatever is typed inside I input
element so now when I click refresh okay
if I type in my name here and I click
done then I get my name alerted out on
the screen so I've only grabbed what was
inside of our input element likewise if
I leave this empty and I click done I
get nothing
alerted out on the screen it's an empty
alert box and that's because we typed in
nothing there so our value is just like
an empty string nothing okay so that's
actually what we're going to be doing
over the next couple tutorials is we're
just going to basically look at grabbing
form values okay I values from a phone
and then we're going to look at how to
check that they meet certain
requirements so we're going to try and
check that our user didn't like try
submit and empty form and we're also
going to try and see that it meets
certain requirements which is that whole
process is called form validation so
that's what we're going to be looking at
over the next couple tutorials is just
how to validate your form and yeah guys
get keen because
that's what we're going to do so thanks
