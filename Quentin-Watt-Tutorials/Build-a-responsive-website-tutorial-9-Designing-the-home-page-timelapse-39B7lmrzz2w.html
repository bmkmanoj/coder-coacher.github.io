here and welcome to me tutorial number 9
and in this video I thought I'd just do
a quick time-lapse over the rest of my
design because I kind of wanted to speed
this process up a little bit but yeah
we're basically just using more of the
same tools here so it's more of the
shape tool more of the text tool and
just aligning everything exactly as I'd
like it to be so let's start off with
the time-lapse here and as you can see I
started off by looking at the panel box
teaser for uikit and then I jumped back
over to photoshop and started designing
my products now the reason why I was
looking at that panel box or panel
teaser is because I thought the next
best thing to show the user is a few
products so that's exactly what I was
setting up here is some images for some
products and yet all of these all these
three blocks were going to become
product blocks so basically I'm just
creating some holiday packages to show
to our clients so an image of what's
gonna happen in the holiday and then I
thought a little heading underneath that
and then
paragraph of text and a button now fun
fact I am not actually a designer so I
am a developer by trade and that's
pretty much all I've ever done I've
never really gone into the whole design
side of things so this is just a skill
that I've picked up after watching other
people do designs and working from other
people's Photoshop designs I've been
able to pick up the skill of maybe
starting to design my own websites but
normally this kind of job would would be
done by somebody else I wouldn't
actually be doing the design side of
things I just convert that design over
the code
and so I'm doing here I was just getting
all the text sizing correct I wasn't
quite sure what size I actually wanted
my text and I think something you'll
notice here is my headings right now I'm
not all capitalized and this was a
design design decision I made later on
was to go back and capitalize all of my
headings and then you'll notice the next
bit of text I'm placing on my screen
here is all alarmism or just content
filler and that's because whenever you
create a website or especially if you're
a freelance web designer or freelance
web developer you'll probably understand
the struggle of having to get content or
text coffee from clients it's one of the
most difficult things in the world and
often it can hold up your projects and
if your projects get held up it also
means that the money gets held up so
you're not getting paid so it can be
quite a stressful time
and then what I was doing here was just
copying over all of my products so I
managed to copy them over relatively
quickly and then I just had to get the
spacing set up correctly so this was
just changing the size of my boxes
without changing the size of the text
inside of the box and I suppose it's
also worth noting now that I'm using a
black background behind my products
because I feel like a black background
makes the images pop a little bit more
you can see a little more color out of
the image when it's on a dark background
it's the same reason why YouTube has
opted for having a dark background on on
YouTube so that option is available for
you guys as well
and this was kind of annoying basically
what happened here was I forgot to put a
button a call-to-action button on each
one of my product blocks so I had to go
back put the button on there get the
sizing right and then copy that button
over to each one of the products as well
if I had remembered to do this at the
beginning I wouldn't have had to have
come back and done this all again what I
was doing here was just getting my block
spacing correct so jumping back and
forth between UI kids website and my
Photoshop design just checking what the
standards were for spacing it didn't
have to be perfect but you know just
good enough
and then I moved on to creating the next
part of my site which I thought was just
gonna be like a tagline so I put in a
primary background color the blue
background and just threw in like a
really awesome tagline like thousands of
people use our products or thousands of
people travel with us just to kind of
enforce trust with the viewer and then I
copied that over to my mobile design
just getting the spacing correct again
just spacing everything out I suppose
some people are really gonna be
wondering why I even went through the
efforts to actually keep this whole time
lapse into my tutorial series but I just
thought that if I'm gonna show you guys
how to build a website from start to
finish that I don't really want to skip
over some of these bits I wanted to show
also how much work goes into actually
setting up a design and then converting
that design over to code there's a lot
of time that goes into actually develop
developing a website or building a
website for a client's
and yeah what I was doing here was just
grabbing some images to use for
testimonials or testimonies I'm not sure
which is the correct word there but yeah
basically what I thought I'd do here is
just add in some success stories of
people who have used our products before
and really enjoyed them so there's a
shounen guppy story that's just lorem
ipsum text and centering the text next
to the image and then I thought I'd do
the same thing below that add in another
story but this time flipped the images
so that the images on the opposite side
to the text and I thought what would be
really awesome here is once we've got
all of this set up I will use UI kits to
animate the text so when we start
actually building this in HTML
we'll use UI kits to animate the text in
from one side and the image in from the
other side and yeah I just placed my
footer and on the desktop size screen so
that design is done and now it was just
a case of copying everything over to a
mobile phone and making sure everything
looks good there as well
and started placing my foot in on my
mobile phone so that was our design the
final design just going over it one last
time and then I think I scrolled one
last time up again just to double-check
that everything was perfect and before I
end this video off I just want to say if
