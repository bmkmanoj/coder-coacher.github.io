here and this is tutorial number 47 and
in this tutorial I'm still talking about
how to retrieve data from certain form
elements okay and in this video we're
actually going to cover radio buttons
because I haven't done that yet and
radio buttons actually work very
similarly to or in a very similar way to
checkboxes okay so is this tutorial is
almost like an exact copy or exact
repeat of what we did with checkboxes
except only one radio button can be
selected so it is as I said a bit of a
safe option when you're asking for the
user for a yes/no question okay now if
we take a look at my code over here this
is all the same code that we had in the
previous tutorial all I did was clear
out the form and on this page all I've
done is I've cleared out my PHP tags and
any code inside of my PHP tags but other
than that the rest of this code has been
used for the past two or three maybe
even four tutorials okay so let's go
ahead and throw some radio buttons into
our form and I'm just going to ask the
user a question like a yes/no question
so let's say do you play League of
Legends and then we'll give them the
option of ticking yes or no so I'm just
going to add in a break tag over here
and then we'll put in the input option
of yes and put time equals radio because
we're working with radio buttons and
then we'll say value is equal to yes and
then
well we have to type the word yes before
this radio button as well so yes
okay value yes and then name is equal to
and we'll just say place okay that's a
can be a really long name let's just
call it league okay and if they say no
then we'll go ahead and send through the
value of no so input basically
everything is going to be the same here
control-c control-v except the value
we're going to sitt equal to no okay now
I'll just make sure that you guys leave
the name exactly the same for both of
them because if the user ever wanted to
send through these values they could
only send through a value of yes or no
because radio buttons can only have one
selected at a time and if you guys know
know what I mean let's go ahead and take
a look at that so go over to this
tutorials page which was localhost
tutorials tutorial and it's actually
tutorial 47 okay so do you play League
of Legends yes or no and as you can see
as soon as I click yes then no gets
unselected and if I click no than yes
gets unselected so only one radio button
can be selected at a time so we never
have to worry about the user sending
through multiple values for this form
unless they like physically try to alter
the data themselves or something which
means they're trying to hack into your
website or something okay so let's go
ahead now and actually handle those
these values to find out which option
that the user sent through okay so I'm
going to go ahead and just place my PHP
tags over here and then we'll echo
you were asked if you played league of
legends and you said okay so whatever
the user said and I'm going to end that
off here and let's go ahead and actually
grab the answer to whatever they said
okay and the way we're going to do that
is obviously we could create a new
variable or we could actually just we
could just echo that straight away well
I'm going to create a variable and I'm
going to call that plays underscore
League and we'll set that equal to
dollar underscore post square brackets
and then we'll just type in here the
name of our input element which is
League and we can echo out league so
actually if I take that line and I'll
place it underneath here then at least I
can actually use the variable oh yeah so
plays League and then we'll just append
on our variable plays League place
underscore League okay so now that I
have got that I can save this and let's
go over here and ah I didn't put in a
submit button
I accidentally cleared that so let's go
back here I've just got to put in a
submit button so I'll put in a break tag
over there and submit so input type
equals submit and then once give it a
value of submit okay cool so now we
should have everything working let's go
over here click refresh okay so do you
play League of Legends yeah
Oh No I'm going to click yes submit
handling your data ok if you you were
asked if you played League of Legends
and use it yes so we've sent through the
value which was whatever we typed in
over here that's what got printed out
when we actually create a variable of
what the user said and I'm making
everything disappear ok cool so yes or
no and let's actually go back here again
and let's just click no just for laughs
click Submit and now we've sent through
no ok so that's pretty much how you guys
can handle radio buttons and that is all
I have for you guys in this video so
obviously don't forget to subscribe

help my channel grow and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
