here and welcome back to tutorial number
25 and in this tutorial I am going to
show you guys how to use the substring
replace function to replace part of a
string okay so in other words let's say
the user submitted a string and you
wanted to check that they didn't type
any curse words or something in that
string okay well you could then replace
those curse words using the substring
replace function and I have already
taught you guys the STR pause function
which you could use to then look for a
curse word okay so I'm going to start
off with just creating a variable called
apples and I don't actually want to
swear in this tutorial believe it or not
so I'm just going to type fudge you noob
and I'm sure you guys get the point okay
so we will censor out this word fudge
for this tutorial and now I'm going to
show you guys how to use the substring
replace function okay so of course you
type in the function name which is
substring replace and then we've got our
parentheses okay but this function
actually takes four different arguments
okay the first one is the string that
you want to replace part of okay which
string you actually want to replace so
we've got the string here which is
stored in the variable apples so let's
go ahead and just put that in there okay
then the next argument is what do you
want to replace the string with or what
part of that string you run right
replace with okay so we want to replace
this word fudge with just asterisk
symbols because we're going to pretend
that fudge is a swear word or a curse
okay and the next two parameters are
where do you want to start replacing
text from and where do you want to end
or how long do you want to replace for
so because fudge is right at the
beginning of our string we are going to
start at zero okay but fudge is five
characters long so one two three four
five
okay so we're going to put in the number
five over here and now we should replace
the first five characters of our
sentence or of our string with these
asterixis okay but I'm actually going to
store the result of this in a new
variable so let's create a variable here
just called new apples conveniently
named because it's the apples and the
new apples and then we'll just echo out
new apples just like this save and now
when we go over to Firefox and click
refresh you can see instead of having
five you printed out we've got these
asterixis and then you new so how cool
is that
but if we go back here and we make the
string just a little bit longer let's
just say fudge this and fudge that you
don't win someone's your swearing and
raging in-game or something okay now we
know that if we using this function like
this we are only going to replace the
first instance of fudge because the
first instance of fudge starts f zero
and continues along five characters okay
so I didn't save that we need to go back
and say that okay now when I click
refresh here we still have the next two
instances of fudge printed out
okay so we could go and use a loop so we
could go and look for the word fudge and
loop through this string a couple times
which I have already showed you guys how
to do in the previous tutorials but that
actually seems like quite a lot of work
and shouldn't they already be a function
that could just look for all the words
and replace them
well that already exists okay and that
function is called STR and the score
replace and that is short for string
replace okay but that takes a arguments
in or yeah in a different fashion okay
so the string replace function basically
takes what word do you want to look for
which we want to look for fudge okay
then what do you want to replace that
word with and we'll go ahead and put in
for asterixis okay
and then what string would you like to
look in for this word fudge and replace
that word okay so the word the string
that week and I look in is apples which
of course is the string over here so now
when we save this okay we should get new
apples printed on the screen which of
course new apples takes this old string
and then replaces all instances of the
word fudge I
yeah there we get all instances of the
word fudge with asterixis so now we have
five you noob but all the fudges have
been censored out with asterixis so
that's pretty cool although it is worth
noting that this is not case-sensitive
so if I go back here and I what is
case-sensitive sorry so if I go back
here and I make this a capital F for the
second fudge
when I click refresh this has now been
printed out again so we need to find out
a way to make this not case-sensitive or
at least make searching not
case-sensitive so that is what I am
going to show you guys in the next
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
or share the video it's really going to
help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
