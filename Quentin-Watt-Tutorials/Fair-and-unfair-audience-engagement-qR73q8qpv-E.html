and this is not a tutorial now don't
take away just yet because what I'm
about to talk about is still kind of
important to me and it is a message that
I want to get across to a lot of you
guys I also want to apologize that this
video sounds a little bit ranti it's my
vehicle but Randy I don't want this to
be a wrecked but there is just something
I need to get it off my chest so I'm
sitting at what like 65,000 YouTube
transcribers now and about 3,000
facebook followers and a lot of you guys
contact me and for the most part I feel
like I do a pretty good job as talking
back with you so there are a lot of
people who messaged me and I ok Quinton
like how's it going how you doing how's
life and people just want to have a chat
with me and that is awesome like I am
happy to just secure it and talk back
and forth with you about life and how
things are going and you know whatever
it is almost anything you guys want to
talk about I'm happy to talk about that
right but there are a few people who
contact me and make requests that I
think or I feel are a little bit
unreasonable so what do I mean by
unreasonable well there are a couple of
guys who contact me and it seems like
they either didn't put much thought into
the fact that their request is probably
going to take me a lot of time or they
will request something from me that if
they were to request from anyone else
anywhere they probably more than likely
have to pay for what they're asking for
but when people contact me they almost
contact me and
in a way that they're kind of expecting
watching my youtube videos to have been
like a payment and now they just deserve
something from me for free and i'll tell
you like the standard kind of message I
get goes hey Quinton i watch all of your
youtube videos therefore you should give
me private tutoring give me your skype
contact so we can talk or also like you
should build a website for I got a huge
problem with that because I feel like as
a viewer when you guys watch my videos
you come out already having gained
something you learned something from my
videos and if you didn't learn from my
videos please leave comments let me know
that my video wasn't helpful or leave a
review give me some constructive
criticism and maybe I can improve my
tutorials but for the most part I feel
like if you're watching my videos you've
learned something so you have come out
of my tutorials having gained something
and then to come and contact me and kind
of like trying squeeze a little bit more
out of me and say hey Quinn said no I
like build me a website or give me
private tutoring or help me with a
school project I think those are
probably the three requests I received
the most awesome it's a little bit mm
not nice right like that you're coming
to ask for these things especially when
you consider how much time it's gonna
take for me to actually do this stuff
for you I mean let's just put that into
perspective real quick I mean replying
to a youtube comment or a facebook
message if you put that over here it's
going to take me what like two to five
minutes to do to reply to a message
think i'm going to take longer than five
minutes to reply to somebody not like
from the time you leave a comment but
from the time i see coming like we
didn't decide to reply my taking about
five minutes roughly whereas if you want
me to build a website for you i know
that that process might take me about
three weeks to get done do you see the
like huge time difference involved and
can you imagine if every single viewer
or every single person who liked my
videos decided oh hey yeah let me get a
website from Quinton do you think I'd be
able to hand out three weeks of my time
to everybody I would never have enough
time right even if you're even if I were
to charge you money it's just that the
amount of time is never going to happen
but let's take time out of the equation
let's take money out of the equation and
let me give you some reasons of why I
won't do these things now building a
website for somebody I think is kind of
counter productive to the channel
because my channel is here for you to
learn how to build a website for
yourself so to kind of just come to me
and say hey quits and I watched your
videos pull the website for me it's kind
of productive right you were you didn't
learn how to follow the website you just
came to me and asked me to do it for you
and I think that defeats the purpose of
the channel so that's also one recent
wire and pull the website for you when
it comes to school projects that's a
very touchy issue I think a lot of guys
have come to me and said like
Quentin help me with my school project
and I always say help me but what they
really mean is Quentin this is the spec
for my school project I'd really like
you to get it done for me and I want an
a like I've tried to help a couple guys
with projects and every single one of
them has just turned out to be a
nightmare because these guys kind of
dumb one help when I send them links
they don't want to go and read up and do
the research for the project which is by
the way is a very important part of
doing your project I mean if you're
doing a school project there is going to
be a mark somewhere in your project but
doing research that you need to have
done your research to get those marks or
to deserve those marks and when you're
coming to me and just saying hey Quinton
here's what I need to do tell me what to
do you're not doing your research I'm
kind of doing that for you which I feel
is not fair but also when i'll end up
doing research for you or I land up
doing your project for you actually
coding for you or something like that it
is kind of fraudulent is cheating and
you shouldn't expect me to cheat on a
project for you because then you aren't
passing your cottage projects or your
school project I'm passing your school
project and yeah it that kind of stuff
just morally not right and I wouldn't
want to do that for anybody no matter
how much money you can offer and there
have been a couple guys who have said
like I'll just give you money I want to
make private tutoring was the third one
that people request quite often and it
is something that I have
actually decided to make available on
patreon so if you guys want to
contribute financially to me and you
guys want to help my channel up I have
actually set up a reward on patreon
where I will give you private tutoring
for a specific amount of money but I
don't want to become a private tutor
tutor I don't like sit chair hoping that
one day I can quit my job to be a
private to that it's not a business that
I want to get into so i do think i need
to be really careful with that like I
can offer some tutoring but I just don't
want that to become my full-time thing i
think the biggest thing for me is I'm
not actually offering these services to
anyone like I'm not advertising them
anywhere and people can contact me and
ask for these things and what if you say
no I'm not saying no because of the
money you know I work a full-time job
and I come home and I work on youtube
videos and in my spare time I've also
got my own projects that I worked on so
I am quite busy doing other things I
don't really have the time to start
adding in projects for other people
especially because that means like I
would not have time to sleep I would not
have time to eat I would not have time
to do you know normal things that people
need to do in their life like go out and
see friends those kinds of things right
so when you're making a request I do
want you to consider that when I say no
it's not because I'm being
and it's not because I don't want your
money because some people do sometimes
off of money but I'm just saying no
because I can't do all of that work I
don't have the time to do all of that
and so yeah there is a reason why i'm
saying though and it's not because I'm
trying to be a mean person so yeah like
just think about that when you make a
request and that's pretty much all i
have for you in this video so don't
forget to subscribe leave a comment like
and share this video is really going to
help my channel grow although yeah this
is maybe not the best video to be
sharing because it was a little bit of a
rent and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
