to tutorial number 10 its Quinton here
and in this tutorial I just want to talk
to you guys quickly about the w3c so
some of you guys are probably sitting
there right now like w3c what the heck
what what are you on about
well let me explain the w3c stands for
world wide web con World Wide Web
Consortium that is a tongue twister and
these guys are basically in charge of
like setting all the rules that we as
web designers or web developers have to
follow so you can't just go and like and
deploy or whatever works attitude and
just type in whatever HTML you can think
of and test it in a webpage you actually
have to follow some rules but
fortunately I have been teaching you
guys most of those rules already
so obviously let me just open up my
browser real quick and you can view this
web page now obviously these are the
rules that you guys have to follow so
you guys always need to make sure that
you have a doctype definition which is
obviously this doctype up here and the
next thing you have to do is have an m
IM e or multi-purpose internet mail
extension now the it's got a funny name
because they use the user for mail but
they use it for websites now too
and what you actually have to do to have
one of these is type in a meta tag and
then top HTTP equals equals content type
and then content equals and then text
slash HTML semicolon charset equals ug
if
8.now what a lot of guys do is they
actually just type in meta charset utf-8
and that actually seems to work when you
validate your code but the book that I'm
reading told me to do it this long
really long way and basically what this
does just specifies the character set
that you need to use for your webpage
and the standard character set is
charset utf-8 so we're not going to
worry too much about what the different
charset so if you guys want to learn
about that
google it or something but this is the
standard and that's what we're going to
be using and yeah okay also now the next
thing you guys need to do is obviously
make sure that all your tags are nested
properly and they don't overlap so in
other words you know don't have a list
item ending outside of your outside of
your UL or your unordered list obviously
just make sure that it's always nested
properly and all the list items are
inside of your unordered list which is
all inside your body etc so that's quite
easy and we've been doing that make sure
that you use all lower case for your
element names so in other words all of
this must be lower case which it is I
haven't been using any capitals or upper
case always use closing tags okay I
guess I can read them from here always
use your closing tags so never type in
like Li and then miss the ending Li like
that I mean if you if you save this it
probably still works as you can see it
still works but it's just not according
to standard so make sure that you always
use a closing tag okay I'm just going to
push ctrl Z hey
cool so yeah we've actually been
completing all of that or doing all of
that and then the last or actually
second last thing is to make sure that
all empty tags are marked with a closing
slash so if you ever have an empty tag
like a break or something like that you
need to have a forward slash closing
that that tag or if you just have an
empty list tag or something make sure to
always close it and the last thing is
that every attribute must be in
quotation marks so as you can see here
we've got an image at the bottom of our
webpage and if the tribute is in
quotation marks now you can see if you
take the quotation marks away it still
works but it's just better to have
quotation marks there because that's
what the standard is
so guys always make sure that your
attributes are always in quotation marks
and then the last thing is if you can
see my image here at the bottom I
actually had to add in another attribute
that I didn't teach you guys about and
that is the alt attribute which just
gives the browser some information in
case the browser cannot find this image
it will display this text that you wrote
in the alt attribute yeah so in case you
can't the browser can't find this image
which should never be the case it should
always get this image unless your
connection is extremely slow so now that
we've actually gone ahead and we've
written this website I'm going to teach
you guys or show you guys how to
validate it so you here's our web page
right here and what I'm going to do now
is I'm just going to go over to my the
w3c validator which I'll place the link
in the description below and you're just
going to click browse choose the webpage
which is this one and then click on
validate or check and you should see we
don't really get any errors we just get
one warning and that is just
we are using html5 and it's still a new
checker so they don't know like if if
there's any bugs on it you need to
report them so there's actually nothing
wrong with our website the way it is um
so that was actually just a quick
tutorial on w3c validation I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will see you guys
next time I would appreciate it a lot if
you guys really hit that subscribe
button
and also don't be afraid to comment like
or share my videos it's really going to
help my channel grow so thanks very much
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
