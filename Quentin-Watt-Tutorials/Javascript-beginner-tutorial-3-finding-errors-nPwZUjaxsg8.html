here and welcome to tutorial number
three in my JavaScript series and in
this tutorial I just want to talk to you
guys about the Firefox error console or
just basically just how to find bugs in
your programming in general so in your
JavaScript code and you know before we
start I just want to tell you like kind
of a funny story
which goes back to when I started
learning JavaScript and basically I was
using a prescribed textbook from my
University so obviously I had to follow
along with some exercises and actually
copy some code that was in the textbooks
out onto my text editor and obviously
when you're doing that you would make a
few typos I mean any programmer does I
see it all the time on YouTube when
people are copying from my videos like
there are silly little questions out
because they've just made a typo
somewhere along the line or something
like that and you know it's like every
programmer does it so I understand but
here's the thing I spent hours looking
for my little error that I made maybe I
you know put a capital letter somewhere
where I shouldn't have or I left out a
full stop or I missed out a semicolon or
something like that but after hours of
looking at your code you it's very
difficult to find out where you've left
something out it's hard to see and
basically like I spent so much time
looking for these errors I remember one
afternoon spending like a whole day just
for the whole afternoon just looking for
the error that I had made earlier on in
the morning and then when I got to my
chapter 9 in my textbook it suddenly
started talking about error consoles and
how to find errors and stuff in your
programming and I went nuts okay I just
I was like alright you gotta be kidding
me like you're only telling us about
errors now like at chapter 9
you know I've been I've been doing eight
chapters of exercises like I've made
typos and things and you're only telling
me how to find the error now like ah and
it's just it wait I was like all that
time was wasted for what so I was going
mad we're at my head my textbook you
know kind of all wind like Hulk on it
just decided to try and rip it up or
something but obviously I couldn't
because it's like study for exams so
yeah that's basically the story finished
now but yeah I just always nuts and
hopefully I'll save you guys a lot of
time by showing you this early instead
of you know waiting until like halfway
through my tutorials to show you but
Firefox has an era console which you can
use to find errors in your JavaScript
okay so if you take a look at Firefox
over here our program has run perfectly
at the moment there was no errors but
let's go back to notepad plus plus and
quickly just make an error on purpose so
like I said this is actually case
sensitive so you can't actually have a
capital letter here and let's go ahead
and just put in a capital D and we can
go ahead and save this and now when we
refresh this in Firefox watch nothing
will show up here
okay so it's all gone and that's because
we made one simple little error in
JavaScript and it stopped a whole
JavaScript program from running just
because of that one little error okay so
nothing showed up and if there was a lot
of code yeah you'd probably be looking
at this Lac trying to wonder where is
your error where is your area like and
you don't even know meanwhile it's that
capital letter D there and that could
actually just be solved so easily by
just going to tools web developer and
error console okay so if you don't have
this little toolbar up at the top here
just right-click in the top of your
browser and you see this one that says
menu
that needs to be ticked so if it doesn't
if it's not ticked then Firefox kind of
looks like this with this thing and you
can get the error over here error
console there we go or you can actually
just right click up here somewhere and
just get to a menu bar back and then you
can get it from there so now we can take
a look at this error in our error
console here and what it says is at the
area type document dot write is not a
function so it's already picking up that
capital letter D there and it says this
isn't a function okay and then the next
thing is it's telling us the line on
which the error occurred okay so line
seven and if we go back to notepad plus
plus
whereas I capital letter D it's here on
line seven so we know where the area is
and then the next thing is if you click
on this little link over here even gives
you a link where you can see okay this
is my document the area is over here
line seven so that's very helpful
actually and I really hope I've saved
you guys a lot of time by telling you
this early and hopefully when you're
following along with my tutorials later
you'll actually just use the error
console whenever you're looking for a
bug or an error in case you type
something incorrectly when you were
following along with my videos so that's
pretty much all I had for you in this
tutorial and I will see you guys in the
next tutorial where we can actually
finally start writing some actual
JavaScript code that isn't or doesn't
have to do with document dot right so
I'll see you guys then and don't forget
