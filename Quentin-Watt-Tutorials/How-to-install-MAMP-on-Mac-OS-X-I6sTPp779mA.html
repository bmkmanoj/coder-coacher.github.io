here and in this video we're going to
take a look at how to download and
install map on Mac let me start off by
answering the question what does mam do
and why do I even want it on my computer
so those are technically two questions
but basically what map does is simulate
a server environment so it gives us
access to things that we wouldn't
normally have on our computer but we
would have access to on a server so we
can run PHP code we have access to
something called phpMyAdmin which lets
us create and manage databases for our
website and there's a whole bunch of
other cool stuff that mam comes with and
why do you want it on your computer well
you're going to need it to follow along
with most of my tutorials but you're
going to need it especially to run
WordPress and Joomla or any PHP code
really so go over to the member website
and then if you want to read a little
bit more information about mam or the
packages or software that comes with mam
you can scroll down and there are a few
Quick Links over here so let's click on
general and that's going to give me some
general information about map there's
also some information about my sequel
PHP Python if you've never heard of any
of those things go ahead and read up
about them but hopefully most of you
guys already know what PHP is and I'm
just going to go ahead now and hit
download and this is going to take me
through to the downloads page where I
can choose my operating system whether
it be a Mac OS 10 or Windows and seeing
as I'm on my Mac let's hit download and
this is going to let me download a
binary file I already have this
downloaded though so I'm going to hit
cancel and I think I already follow them
on Twitter so I'm just going to close
that and yeah let's open up my downloads
and from here I can see that I've got
the map package downloaded so I'm going
to double click on this
and that is going to open up the install
so from here I'm just going to hit
continue
read me OK continue continue make sure
that you have actually read the License
Agreement and agree to it
destination on the computer I'm just
going to install it on the Mac so let's
go continue installation type we're just
going to leave it at a standard
installation so I'm not going to change
anything let's hit install and for
security purposes I need to put in my
password and this is going to run for
about a minute not even so let's just
wait for this okay
almost done great so MAMP has been
successfully installed on my computer I
can go ahead and hit close and if I go
over to applications in my finder then I
can see that I've got mam and man Pro
installed so you might have to scroll
down a little bit before you see them
but yeah you should find MAMP
and man pro under applications and if I
open up my Start menu I've got mam over
here I don't know what this is
application menu
so yeah Start menu I go ahead and just
drag and drop map into my quick launch
bar and I'm going to open up map so from
here I can see that Apache and my sequel
are two servers that I have to get
running but right now they're not
running so if I hit start servers these
boxes should then get ticked or well
filled in and now MAMP has started and
we can see that we've opened up
something called Maps
start page or web start page that's this
page that opened up in my browser and
from here I can see a whole bunch of
information about my map installation so
if I click on PHP info this will give me
some information about what version of
PHP I'm running so right now you can see
I'm running
p7 and it is on my macbook great so
we've got we know where to find some
information about PHP we also might want
to get some information about my sequel
so here is a link to PHP myadmin which
we will be using in future there is also
information about our host so we are on
localhost we've got a port and we've got
a username and password now these are
very important to remember whenever you
want to try connect to a database so
yeah my username and password are root
and root other than that I don't think
there's any information I need on here
right now but in case you guys ever
wanted to find this info there it is now
I'm going to go ahead and hit my website
now for some reason MAMP on Windows
doesn't have this link but if you go
ahead and hit my website or if you type
in localhost comma or colon eight eight
eight eight that should take you through
to your localhost or your root directory
on your computer and right now my root
directory is empty so there are no files
on my in my root directory but let me
show you guys where to find this so what
you're going to need to do is open up
your finder go to applications go to map
and then go to htdocs and this htdocs
directory is called your root directory
so this is where all of your website
files need to go and just to prove that
if I place a website file over here it
will show up let me open up sublime
which is my text editor and i'm just
going to write hello there and save this
in applications find mam and htdocs' so
make sure you save it in that that
location I'm just going to save it as
index dot HTML and when I hit save and I
come back over to my local
and hit refresh you can see the text
hello there now shows up now I know that
this is not a valid HTML document but
the text shows up in the browser anyway
because the browser kind of knows how or
what to expect seeing as it is an HTML
document and we're going to be taking a
look at how to code and how to make
websites using map in future tutorials
so I'll see you guys next time if you
like that video there are a bunch of
things that you can do to help first of
all don't forget to subscribe watch
another one of my videos follow me on
social media and if you want to support

degree so go ahead and click on
something and I'll see you guys next
