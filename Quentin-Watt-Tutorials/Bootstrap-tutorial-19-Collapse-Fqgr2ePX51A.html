here and welcome to tutorial number 19
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at the collapse feature that
we have available in bootstrap and it's
really awesome for hiding and showing
content so as you can see in my browser
I have a button and when I click on it
it shows me this div with some content
in it and when I click on it again it
hides the div so it's really awesome and
it's got a bunch of other uses as well
if you take a look at get bootstrap coms
websites on the JavaScript page they
have an accordion example so you click
on the titles or the panel titles and it
hides and shows the content inside of
the panels which is really cool it's
nice little feature to have on websites
nowadays and yeah let's take a look at
how to actually implement this so we
have a div at the moment or I have a div
with a class of container I've got my
row and I've got a column and it's a
fairly short column but I figured like
it looked good for the tutorial just to
have a short column over here okay so
let's take a look at what we need and of
course we need a button because that's
exactly what you see there and the next
element below that was actually a div
with some content like I mentioned and
I'm going to give my button some text so
let's just say some text or click me or
whatever you want to say on your button
and inside your div this is where you're
going to put your content so content
goes here right awesome sorry excuse me
for the hiccup but now there we go we
have our button and we have our div and
now we need to actually tie these two
together and the way we're going to do
that is with a class and an ID on this
div so let's go give this class
the stuff a class of collapse and that's
just setting it up to be collapse
and it's actually necessary to have that
class and then the next attribute I
wanna give this div is an ID and I'm
going to set that equal to content right
so it's important to remember this ID
because we're going to use it in just a
second so now we need to go over to this
button and we need to start adding some
attributes to this button and I'm going
to add a class and this is really just
there to make the button look pretty
we'll give it a class of BTN and BTN -
primary and that just makes a blue
button that doesn't do anything so to
actually make this button function we
have to add a few other classes so I'm
going to add data
- toggle a few other attributes not a
few other classes and I'm going to set
data toggle equal to collapse so that
just means that when this button is
clicked it needs to toggle the collapse
class or the collapse function and that
is going to make or give us this effect
where the div opens and closes it like
kind of slides down so that is what
that's there for you'll notice on the
drop down menus that we be using in the
previous tutorials we had data toggle
always set to drop-down and it just kind
of made the drop-down appear instantly
okay so now that we've got that done
let's take a look at the next attribute
which is going to be data
- target and this is the target for this
button so what like if collapse is what
the button has to do then data target is
which content needs to be collapsed or
which element needs to be collapsed and
the way we do that is we take the ID of
this div and we place it in data target
over here and then we also need to just
make sure we add a hash before the
I D name or yeah the ID because what
happens is this then passes this content
or the ID name to jQuery and whenever
you're referencing something in jQuery
you use a hash and so it's the same over
here whenever you're referencing
something with an ID user hash right so
now that we've got all of this let me
hit save and I'm going to come back here
and hit refresh and you can see that now
I've got a button that says some text
instead of click me and when I click on
it it hides and shows the content
underneath which is cool but it doesn't
quite look the same as the example I
just showed you so in order to get it
looking exactly the same if you guys
want to you can have another div inside
here with a class of well and that has
to be spelled correctly unfortunately
and then you just throw whatever content
you have inside there hit save and my
code didn't disappear I just have a
really long line that goes off the
screen
great so let's hit refresh and now you
can see the content that's getting
hidden and showing looks exactly like my
example and yeah I guess that's all I
have for this tutorial so thank you for
