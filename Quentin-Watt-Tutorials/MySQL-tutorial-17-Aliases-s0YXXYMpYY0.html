and welcome to tutorial number 17 and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about aliases in my SQL so yeah if you
guys watched and I'm particularly guilty
of doing this in the last tutorial so if
you've watched the last tutorial then
you'll know that I actually made a query
that was like really really really long
and that's a problem is sometimes
queries can get quite quite long so
there is this thing called an alias
which helps us make our queries just a
little bit shorter so if you want to
save on a few keystrokes and you just
want to make that query a little bit
shorter and a little bit easier to read
then using an alias is what that's there
for right so now that we know that let's
take a look at what I want to do in this
tutorial and basically I want you to go
over the orders table and I think we'll
select the order ID and then we'll also
select the product name from the product
table so I want to join two tables
together which is something that we have
done over the past couple of tutorials
and I think it's going to make a lot
more sense if I just go ahead and type
this out so go over the SQL tab and we
know from the previous tutorials that
are going to type select and then
whatever fields I want to select so
let's select the orders dot order ID
something I think I might have missed or
skipped over in the previous tutorials
is that we can put our backticks
around our field ID like this so I have
been using backticks for most of the
tutorials and I think I skipped over it
in the previous tutorial but yeah this
is where your backticks would go if
you're going to be using backticks and I
think it's kind of good practice to use
backticks especially if you have columns
that have spaces in them but if you
don't have columns of spaces in them
then you'll probably find that your
query all works fine just fine without
the backticks so it's up to you all
right so let's select the orders dot
order ID and the product starts product
name
and I want to select these obviously
from two tables so we're going to say
from the first table which is order
orders and then also join that on to the
second table which is products and I'm
going to join them on a specific field
and that field is going to be where
orders dot product ID is equal to
product dot product ID and the reason
why we're joining them on that specific
field is because product products
product ID is in the products table and
orders the products ID is in the orders
table so it's the one field that is in
both of those tables so that's what
connects the two tables and now if I
copy this and hit go yeah I do have a
working query so we have our order ID
and we have our product name over here
but I could have saved a lot of time or
I could have saved a lot of writing if I
had used an alias so right now you can
see we're specifying our table name over
here and then we're specifying our table
name over here and then we're specifying
our tables again over here and we're
spacing specifying our tables again over
here as well so it gets a little bit
annoying because you're typing out the
table name the whole time when you could
actually just use an alias so in this
case I'm going to replace orders over
here with O and then I'm going to
replace orders over here with an O and
then I'm going to replace products with
that a P and product over here with a P
so basically now whenever we're
mentioning a column name we're only
using this little shortcut right and the
reason why I didn't change it over here
is because we still kind of need to
mention the product or the tables over
here right so we're you're using a field
or where you're mentioning a field it's
fine
to use the shortcut or where you're
mentioning the actual tables after the
front floors that's where you have to
have to have to have the table name but
there's something else that you have to
add in here as well which is the as
keyword and then you specify the
shortcut that you want to shorten this
table to so in this case I've already
set that to oh so now I'm selecting ODOT
order ID from orders as oh so now our
query knows to treat the orders table as
the letter O and if I do the same thing
over here our query will know to treat
the product table as the letter P and
that has somewhat shortened our query
and I suppose if you took this exact
same concept and put it in the tutorial
that we did previously tutorial member
16 you'll see that the query will
actually go from being like four lines
long as it being like three lines long
just because you've cut out all of those
table names and if I copy this now and
hit go you can see that the query still
runs perfectly so I've got the same
results but I just managed to save a few
keystrokes in actually writing that
query
so yeah that is how you use an alias and
that's what it's there for so now that
you know how to use an alias go back and
watch the previous video and implement
the exact same thing that we did in the
previous video but add the aliases and I
think that that's going to be a really
great learning experience for you but
that is the end of the tutorial so
