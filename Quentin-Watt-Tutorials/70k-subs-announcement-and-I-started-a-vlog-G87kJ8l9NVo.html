here and i just wanted to let you guys
know two things well actually two two
things right so first of all is this
youtube channel the tutorial Channel hit
seventy thousand subscribers either
yesterday or the day before so oh yeah
that actually looked kind of fake but I
wish I had like a party hat and maybe
that like little whistle thing that you
blow to celebrate because it is pretty
awesome that we hit seventy thousand
subscribers and I definitely owe you
guys more videos because of that because
now there's a lot of you following me I
need to actually make some more content
and the second thing which is kind of
what I want to talk to talk to you guys
about is that I've started a vlogging
channel so if you have been watching my
channel really carefully you will
probably have noticed some changes some
of you might even be subscribed to the
vlogging channel because they are about
almost 300 of you subscribe there so the
vlogging channel is just something I
started to have a little bit of fun on
YouTube to you know do stuff that isn't
so serious so work-related or you know
tutorial related so if you guys want to
watch me walk around Berlin for a day
i'm going to leave an annotation to a
video over here if you guys want to hear
a little bit more about my university
story maybe get to know me a little bit
more i'll link to a or i'll link to my
university video here and if you guys
want to see just what I get up to and
I'm on holiday I'll leave another
annotation of me doing something on my
holiday over here it would mean a lot to
me if you guys did go through and
subscribe but if you're only interested
in tutorials if you're only interested
in the web development stuff then you
know that's not going to happen on that
channel so go through and subscribe if
you want to if you do want to get to
know me a little bit more and you want
to get to see what I do on my holidays
or what I do on my time off but if
you're waiting for tutorials and things
like that that's going to happen on this
channel so just keep an eye out and I
we'll be back with more tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
