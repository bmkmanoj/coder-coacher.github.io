here and I guess you could actually see
that anyway I just wanted to make a
little bit of an announcement slash
apology and you know what this is going
to sound like every other youtuber ever
because a lot of them make videos that
sound like this so you know it's not the
same but yeah I haven't been making
videos lately or not as many videos as
I'd like to be making you know maybe
three to four in a month have been put
up but if we go back to how I used to be
in November / December of last year I
was able to put up a lot of more videos
right um I was putting up a video almost
every single day and part of that has to
do with my daily routine and how my
daily routine change and also part of
that has to do would think that I have
been under a lot of stress lately so
last year November when I was being
really productive something that worked
for me was that I had a routine where
I'd wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning
I'd take a 45 minute run jump in the
shower and then sit down and record a
tutorial before going to work that
really helped me because I got stuff
done and then obviously I went to work
come back edited the video and then
uploaded it so you guys could watch and
yeah that helped me get that helped me
get a lot of stuff done I felt out of
that routine when I injured my foot in
December so in December I taught lega
medicine my foot I didn't make much of
it I didn't think it was serious I
didn't go to the doctor and I just
waited for that to get better I did make
a few videos during this time I think
but then in February I decided like I
really needed to be productive and I
wanted to get back into my routine so I
started running in the morning again
well just one morning I took a run and
then I injured my foot and when I
injured my foot at that time I was
actually in the evening anyway I wanted
to be productive so I took a run and I
landed up tearing ligaments in my ankle
on the on the first run since the injury
and yeah that time it was a lot more
serious so I decided to go to the doctor
the doctor put a brace on my foot put me
in crutches and told me not to run for
three months so today has been today
marks three months basically since I
told my ligaments in my foot and because
of that I haven't been running so I
couldn't get back into that routine of
taking a run recording a video going to
her coming back uploading and editing
and uploading so that was one thing and
yeah routine really does help when you
want to be productive the next thing
that happened was when I injured my foot
I got bucked off by a doctor and I was
sitting at home and I could have made
videos during that time I really thought
I was going to make videos during that
time but we got mad we learned up
getting a really really busy at work and
so my colleagues asked me if I didn't
mind working while I was booked off by
the doctor and I said no no problem I
could I didn't want to go back to work
and have all this work piled up for me
that landed up happening anyway so I'll
end up doing work here going back to
work and I still had a crap ton of work
to get done and yeah I just under so
much stress and under so much pressure
I'm part of that happens to be because
some guys left the company and we had
five developers we went down to having
two developers with five developers work
and that you know kind of sucks cuz it
meant that yeah I'll end up having to
work longer hours to try and get things
done and then by the time I'd come back
home I'd be like you know what I should
record a video today but I just really
am not in the mood to see more coding in
HTML and sit behind a computer I'd
rather go out and do something you know
like see some of the city or whatever so
then on weekends instead of you know
recording videos and doing stuff that
helps me relax and you know stop the
stress a little bit but I need your
guy's help so one of the ways you can
help me is to just send me a message on
Facebook or Twitter or something and
just remind me if I
haven't been active for a while just say
hey Quinton what's up we're waiting for
another video but I sing it in a nice
way right don't be mean and don't be
like these guys are like oh my god I
subscribe to you now you're not making
videos what you know just just make it
make it just be friendly and just give
me a reminder to come back and make some
videos and I'll try and I will let you
know if I am busy that I can't another
way you guys can help is I have
mentioned before I would like YouTube to
become my full-time sing and if YouTube
is to become my full-time thing one of
the things that's standing in the way is
just money I need to be able to make
more money from YouTube and if I if
YouTube data become my full-time thing
obviously I won't have to divide my time
between a real job and YouTube and
hopefully I'll get more stuff done that
way right for you guys so you guys want
to see some more content one of the ways
you can help is by contributing on
patreon even if it's a dollar a month
there are a guy's quite a large number
of guys who have recently started doing
this just giving me one dollar a month
and if enough people do do this it is
going to go a long way so I do
appreciate everybody who had Wow any
water just be friendly and just give me
a reminder to come back and make some
videos and I'll try and I will let you
know if I am busy that I can't another
way you guys can help is I have
mentioned before I would like YouTube to
become my full-time thing and if YouTube
is to become my full-time thing one of
the things that's standing in the way is
just money I need to be able to make
more money from YouTube and if I if
YouTube does become my full-time thing
obviously I won't have to divide my time
between a real job and YouTube and
hopefully I'll get more stuff done that
way right for you guys so you guys want

you can help is by contributing on
patreon even if it's a dollar a month
there are a guide quite a large number
of guys

is a good point to just throw in a
little bit of shout out here to
everybody who is contributing to me on
patreon I do really appreciate all these
$1 donations and if you're contributing
$1 or more that's awesome and yeah I
want this to sound too much like I'm
begging for money so yeah if you guys
want to help contributing on patreon is
going to go a long way there is going to
be a link at the end of the video I'll
also leave a link in the top corner I
don't know which which corner should I
be saying is that this one or this one
anyway just look in the top corner
there's a little eye icon click on that
it's going to open up some cards along
the side of the screen it's probably
going to be this side and yeah when you
do that you will find a link to patreon
click on that and you can contribute to
me there and so that's all for this
video and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
