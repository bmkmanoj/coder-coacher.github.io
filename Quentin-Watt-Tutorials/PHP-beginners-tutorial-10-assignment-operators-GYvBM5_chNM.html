here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this video we are going to talk
about some more assignment operators in
PHP now you guys already know about the
most common assignment operator which
was the equal sign but we are going to
cover a few extra assignment operators
in the series or in this tutorial sorry
so let's say we had a variable called
apples like this and I set that equal to
the value of 3 okay then you know that
this equal sign was assigning the value
of 3 to the variable apples we already
know about this ok but what happens if
later on in my program I decided well
hey it would be really useful if I could
keep the value of 3 in Apple's but add 6
okay well there are a few ways to do
this so I could go ahead and say apples
is equal to apples because I want to
keep that value 3 and add 6 to it so I
can say plus 6 Oh woops plus 6 okay and
let's go ahead and echo that out on the
screen now so echo apples ok so I should
get 3 plus 6 which is equal to 9 so I
should be storing the value 9 over here
and then echoing out the value 9 so
let's go see what happens ok
just as we expected we've got the value
9 printed out on the screen ok so what
we did here was we stored 3 then we
change the value of apples to 3 plus 9
or 3 plus 6 which is equal to 9 okay but
again this doesn't look very if
efficient because I've had to type out
my variable name again as apples and I
mean we as programmers we're lazy we
don't like to work harder like this we
like to work smarter so we could do this
a different way and I could go ahead and
use this new assignment operator which
is the plus equals assignment operator
and what this is going to do is keep the
value of 3 which we assign to apples
earlier and add whatever I put on this
right-hand side so let's say I wanted to
add 10 to 3 okay now when I'm printing
out apples over here I should print out
the value of 13 so there we go
13 printed out on the screen
okay so we know that we can use the plus
and equals operator to add whatever this
value is to the previous value of apples
okay
likewise we can also use the minus
equals operator so what this will do is
assign the value apples to assign the
value of 3 to apples sorry and then
subtract whatever is on this side of the
equal sign so subtract 10 so we should
print out an answer of negative 7 and
there we go negative 7 printed out on
the in the browser ok ok so not only can
we subtract and add okay we can also use
a multiply equal sign so what this will
do is keep the value that was in apples
which in this case is 3 and then
multiply it by 10 and then store the new
value in apples so 3 times 10 is 30 so
when we print this out now we should
have 30 in the browser so let
go ahead and click refresh and there we
go the value of 30 is shown okay so not
only do we have a multiplier sign but we
also have a divide and equals symbol
okay so what this will then do is take
3/10 and store okay let me explain here
it's going to take the value of 3 which
was previously stored in Apple's divided
by 10 and keep that new answer in
Apple's which should be 0.3 so there we
go and not only can we go ahead and use
divide but we also as you learned in the
previous series have or previous
tutorial have this modulus symbol so
when we go modulus equal to we'll get
the remainder of whatever this is equal
to okay so 10 actually never goes into 3
it can't go into 3 because 10 is bigger
than 3 so we should have a remainder of
3 so when we print this out on the
screen now we've got 3 printed out
likewise if I change this to 34 okay 10
can go into 33 times but it can't go
into 4 so we should have a remainder of
4 printed out on the screen so if I go
ahead and save this now click refresh
now we have 4 printed out so that's
pretty cool but now you're sitting there
like hey are you telling me every time I
want to add or subtract just one from
Apple's I have to go ahead and use the
plus equal sign to add one to 34 well we
could do that but there is actually a
different shortcut so let me just go
ahead and refresh this okay so we've got
35 here and 34 plus 1 is indeed 35
okay but let's say I change this to
three okay if I wanted to just add one
to apples we have a shortcut as
programmers and this is called
incrementing a number so we are going to
increment apples by one by using a
double plus sign okay so now when we
print apples out to the screen we should
have three plus one because this is
going to add one to get the value of
four so let's go back here and click
refresh and as you can see we do indeed
have four printed out in the browser
okay so this meats may seem fairly
straightforward but if I wanted to
subtract one from three I could go ahead
and say apples - - and this is going to
decrement apples by one so we start off
assigning the value of three to apples
then we subtract one and we print apples
out in the browser so we should get the
value of 2 print it out and as you can
see - ok so that's it for this tutorial
