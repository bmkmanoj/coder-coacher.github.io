tutorial number 44 and in this tutorial
I just want to talk to you guys about
text areas and if you guys don't know
what a text area is then it's basically
like almost like an input box except the
user can now fill in a lot more
information so that you can have a lot
more lines or paragraphs of information
so let's say for instance you were
writing like an email program and you
wanted them to the user to be able to
enter quite a lot of information inside
of their email message or yeah in fact
you may be even making an instant
messaging program and you wanted the
user to have quite a lot of space to
type in their message then you would
probably give them a text area so that
they've got enough space to write like a
full-blown long message and in fact
Twitter probably gives you a text area
when you're on Twitter and you want to
type in your message that's a text area
or Facebook I think even uses the text
areas right now so instead of just a
normal input box so let's go ahead and
add in a text area to our page so we go
ahead and we add an element called text
area and then we end it off oh yeah and
whatever goes inside of here is
basically our text area and if you're
not gonna have anything in there you
might as well just have these two text
areas right up against each other and
I'll show you why now because if we
leave a space and we go ahead and we
save that and go back to or you go back
to go into Firefox you can see we have
got this text area here and as you can
see it's quite big so with a lot of
space to go ahead and type whatever we
want but watch what happens when I click
inside you can see we're starting one
space away from the edge so when I use a
text area if I'm going to leave it blank
and make sure that they
right touching against each other like
that so when if I savor everything so
I'm safe so when we're over here we
don't get that one little space anymore
we're like right up against the edge
otherwise what most people do is they'll
have a message in yes so it'll say like
tell me about yourself and then we go
ahead and we click refresh now and then
you get the message to tell me about
yourself so that's what a lot of people
do and then the user can go ahead and
type whatever they want so my name is
Quinton and you should should add me on
Twitter because I have no followers and
I'm kind of lonely just kidding not
really but I don't have many followers
on Twitter so if you want go ahead and
add me please links in the description
below and what we can do now is you see
how right now our text area is like
stuck at this size and no matter what we
type it's always there unless we resize
it over here we can actually resize our
text area as well so it fits our website
a lot better and what we could do is or
what we can do to do that is we just
increase the amount of rows or columns
so to make the text box higher we can
say rows is equal to 15 and we go ahead
and save this and you can see by default
our text errors something way around
there and now I wanna click refresh we
now have a much larger text area and we
can make it a lot wider as well by just
going ahead and changing the columns so
to change the columns you type in US
attribute called calls which stands for
columns and then you can set that equal
to 50
go ahead and save this and refresh this
in our browser we now get it takes the
area that is 15 rows down by 50 columns
across and I think what it does to get
that measurement is it takes like the
letter of the size of a capital M and if
we go ahead and we put 50 MS over here
we'd hardly get to the end I'm not gonna
count them all but yeah something like
that and yeah that's pretty much what
the text area does in HTML and that was
quite a short tutorial because there's
actually nothing else that it does so
