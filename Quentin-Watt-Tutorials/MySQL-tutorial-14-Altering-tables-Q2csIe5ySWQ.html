and welcome to tutorial number 14 and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to alter or modify a table so in the
previous tutorial we learn how to create
new tables but in this tutorial we're
just going to learn how to add stuff to
an existing table so if you take a look
at the users table right now you'll see
that I have an ID column a username
column a password column and use the
email first-name and lastname so there's
only six columns right now there isn't a
seventh but I'm going to go ahead and
create a seventh column just to show you
guys how to alter table so let's go over
to the SQL tab here and I'm going to
write in a query and basically what I
want to do here is type in alter tables
so leave without that query command for
a second so alter table and then you're
going to want to put in the name of the
table that you want to alter so in this
case if I wanted to alter the users
table I'll put in the users table name
here and then I need to go ahead and
give SQL another command so if I type in
add this is going to add something to
our table if I type in drop we can
remove something from our table and if I
type in modify then we can change
something about our table so it's up to
you to depend to decide which one of
these you want to use but let's go ahead
and use add for now and I'm going to add
a new row or a new column to our table
so let's create a new column called
random column and one thing that is very
very important that you cannot forget
whenever adding a column is you need to
specify some constraints at the very
least you need to specify a data type so
in this case I'm going to specify a data
type of varchar' and we can set that to
have a limit of 255 characters so let's
copy this and hit go and yeah you can
see that this query has run successfully
there was actually a little green
like a flash of a second but now it's
gone so if you really want to see your
change and if it's taken effect go over
to the users table and just look at the
structure and you can see that I have a
new column here called random column and
it has a VAR cha data type of 255
characters it's allowed to be null and
if we take a look at this in the Browse
tab you can see that I've got the column
here and all of the values within it are
set to null so now is a really good time
to point out that no and a blank space
are very different from each other so
you can see that these values here where
there's nothing filled in those are just
blank spaces and this is actually a null
value so there is a difference between
null and a blank space but yeah that's
just interesting I guess to know and now
that we've created this column let's go
ahead and modify it so I'm going to
place that exact same query in here and
except where I used add I'm going to use
the keyword modify so make sure that you
type that right otherwise it's not going
to work and then just put in the column
name that you want to modify so in this
case let's modify random column because
it's the column that I just created and
I can actually change this data type
from something like varchar to something
like text I believe in the previous
tutorial I said text 1000 I don't
actually believe that works like that
you just put in value of text and yeah
that there is no cap so let's hit go and
yeah now we can browse the table again
and if we do that well actually let's
look at the structure sorry you can see
that now the random column has a data
type of text instead of watch ah it's
still allowed to be no and yeah well
nothing else has changed really so yeah
if you guys want to modify tables and
that's how you go about doing that and
you can also set these to I mean
completely different values so I believe
there is a
value of year or year month let's just
type it in like that yeah nope aha knock
I have totally figured out my mistake I
said add let's use modify because
there's already a column called random
column we don't want to add it we want
to modify it and I think we'll just give
it a value update or a data type of date
and then that will completely change the
value of we get what gets put in here so
now instead of being a text or a varchar
it's now a date value and we need to put
in a date there we can also change that
value of null or not now by close that
tab but jumping back to here and just
adding not null as a constraint within
our query but now that you guys know how
to do that let's take a look at actually
removing the column so instead of add
let's try drop and whenever we use drop
we don't have to have any of these
constraints we just say also table drop
and then give the column name that we
would like to drop so let it go and that
should have now dropped the column so
let's look at our users table and you
can see that we now have an ID a
username a password use the email first
name and last name but the random column
that we just created is no longer here
because I've dropped it so that is how
to alter tables if you guys are ever
looking to change data types or just add
new columns into your database or drop a
column from your database then that is
how you do that and before I end off
this video I just want to send a huge
shout out to these guys do you guys are
my sponsors you contribute about five
dollars or more on patreon every single
month and that goes a long way to
helping me make more videos more often

video because that's also going to help
my channel grow and I'll see you guys
