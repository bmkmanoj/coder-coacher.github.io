here and welcome to tutorial number 20
and in this tutorial we're gonna talk
about classes and ID's so in the
previous tutorial we talked about divs
and spans and I showed you the
difference between inline and block
level elements and we're gonna take that
one step further with some more
different spans in this tutorial but I'm
going to show you guys how to really
leverage the power of that with some
classes and ID's so right now I have a
paragraph on the page and this paragraph
if i zoom in a little bit you can see it
just has normal text right now but I do
want this line over here to be green and
then I want this line over here to be
red and then I want this last sentence
over here to have some blue text right
so taking a look at this in the browser
right now if i zoom in it's all pretty
much normal text it's not styled right
so I'm gonna surround my green sentence
with a span tag and then I'm going to
end that off over here and then I'm
gonna surround my red text with another
span tag and I'm gonna end that off at
the end of the read sentence and then
for the last sentence the blue sentence
I'm gonna also create a span tag and I'm
gonna end that off at the end of the
census right so now all of them are
surrounded in span tags and we know from
the previous tutorial that I can style a
span so now because I wanted green text
over here I could just go select my span
tag oops
select my span tag and then type in
color green and that'll change the text
color to green so if I come back here
and hit refresh
well now it's changed all of our spans
and all of the text in us bands to green
so we might want something a little bit
more unique to identify
this green text and we want might want
something else more unique to identify
this red text and again we want
something more unique to identify the
blue text so this is where classes come
in handy because now I can take my first
span tag and give that a class of green
and then I can go over to my second span
tag where I want red text and I can give
that a class of red and in fact this
might just look a little bit more tidy
if I put all my spans on a new line even
though they won't display in a new line
it's just gonna look at idea right you
can see this better and then let's give
the last one a class of blue right so
now we've got these three classes over
here and because I want this one to be
green I want to select this element by
its class so I'm gonna jump back over to
my CSS file and then I'm gonna remove
that span selector and I'm gonna add in
a new selector here so I'm gonna start
off with a period or a full stop or a
dot or whatever you want to call this
thing and what that does is tells CSS yo
listen up we are gonna use a class to
style our content and the class name
that we want to use is gonna be this
class over here which is green and you
could obviously name it anything you
want it you're not limited to your name
as long as you don't have spaces right
so you can't have green and then text
because these would be two completely
separate classes so if you want to name
your tech or your class something then
it has to be green - text whether it
needs to be one word whenever you have
two words those are seen as two
completely different classes so let's
come back here now and now that we've
selected our first paragraph or our
first span by the class the class of
green let's come let's save let's come
back over the browser and hit
and now you can see that this text is
green but the rest of it is all black
normal text and we can do the same thing
with this red text so let me copy the
class or the styling and I'm gonna
change this class to the class that we
gave to our red text which is in this
case is just red and I'm gonna change
the color of that to red and we can do
the exact same thing for blue so let's
go over here and just change that last
class to blue and that one says blue as
well so that's safe come back here and
hit refresh and whoopsie I made a slight
mistake I didn't change the color of my
blue text to blue right so now that I've
done that I've got some green text I've
got some red text and I've got some blue
text so that's how you identify elements
by class and it gives you a little bit
more power to actually select text
exactly where you want it selected now
the same thing applies to IDs right we
could also give each one of these spans
and ID instead of a class so let me just
remove that class and I'll change it to
an ID attribute obscene
so let's change all our classes to IDs
and now we've got an idea green and idea
of red and an ID of blue right and if I
come back over to my CSS there's
something I'm gonna have to change
because like I said a full stop tells
the CSS hey listen up we're gonna use a
class right so if you're ever wanting to
style elements with an ID you need to
use a different symbol over here because
if we save all of this and come back and
refresh you'll see that we've lost all
our styling the text that was supposed
to be green is no longer green and so so
on and so forth so to select an element
by ID you use the hash
cymbal and that tells CSS yo listen up
we're gonna select an element by an ID
and the ID that we're gonna be using is
green or red or blue right so let's save
this now and come back to the browser
and hit refresh and you can see we've
got the exact same result using an ID as
we had using the class this text is
green that text is red and that text is
blue and so on and so forth
so you might think to yourself okay yeah
I can use classes and ID's
interchangeably they're gonna be the
same thing wherever whenever and that is
sort of okay right you could use classes
with an IDs in a very similar way but
the the one thing about IDs is you
should only ever have one element on
your page with the same id so right now
this one has an ID of green if I were to
copy this and paste this further down
where I also wanted some more green text
right that's gonna be a problem it might
not be a problem in CSS so if i refresh
this you can see the the CSS has worked
this text has indeed been styled green
but if I were to validate this so let's
validate by file upload and let me
upload my index file right I should get
an error because I've used two of the
same ID and here you can see duplicate
ID so that is a problem right you should
never use two elements with the same ID
this is especially a problem when you
come to learning JavaScript in future if
you ever want to select an element by ID
and there's suddenly two elements with
the same ID it's gonna cause issues
right so don't use more than one ID or
don't use two elements with the same ID
rather if you want elements to have the
same kind of styling and you want to use
that same class in multiple
places use a class don't use an ID and
yeah that is all I have for you in this
video and I'll see you guys next time
