part of the tutorial series for the
drop-down menu tutorial and obviously
now we're going to get started with our
CSS so we've in the previous video if
you don't know what I'm talking about
we did all this code right here you'll
have to go watch a previous video to
understand what's going on yeah unless
you already know HTML quite a bit you'll
probably be able to pick up from here
quite quickly and now we'll go to our
CSS file and start doing the CSS so the
first thing we're gonna do is start
styling our top nav which over here top
underscore nav and blue okay top nav now
our top nav is that one here but what
we're actually going to do is li UL li
however UL now what that does is just
when we are hovering over this unordered
list here it'll display it and it'll
display it as a block and and it'll be
displayed above everything else that's
underneath it so it's not going to be
like underneath anything you know
anything that's underneath it the
unordered list would will all the drop
down will be floating above it okay
so right now we're just going to display
block okay and then top under school nav
and now with this now we're styling on
air which is that div there which is
going to be oops
display:block okay and position:relative
now this code will work in old browsers
like a Internet Explorer 6 so if you're
wondering why I'm did I used it in a div
instead of a nav and things like that it
works in Internet Explorer 6 if you do
it this way so top nav and the school UL
and then we'll go margin:0 pixels and
padding:0 pixels so what this does is
just it takes away any any space they
might be between all the links and
obviously this just displays them in a
block and positions them relatively
which you can see if you if you've if
you've followed HTML tutorials in the
past you'll you'll know what they that
does ok and then top nav Li oops
and then that position:relative
float:left and let's start up none
okay so what this does now if we quickly
just go here run launch in chrome okay
so what we've got at the moment is we've
just got our unordered list with our
other sub lists in inside of it and
you've got all the bullet points here
and obviously now what this does if we
save this so cliquey quickly save go
back to google chrome refresh let's put
them all next to each other and it's
taken away the bullet points which is
pretty cool that's exactly what we're
going for and now moving along we need
because we've we've floated it we need
some way of clearing it so top and let's
go nav ul after because obviously now we
need to clear our our float we go
content just give it some content and
what happened . so what this does if you
don't know it puts a full stop there
well I didn't save come on chrome open
okay
it puts a full stop at the end of our
list which you know is all good but we
don't want that full stop there so we're
going to go ahead and then display block
just that it's a block with everything
else give it a height of zero pixels
clear:both which we wanted to do you
know because we floated now we need a
clear and then visibility
No is it hidden sorry hidden disability
is hidden okay so now that will hide the
full-stop that was there see it's gone
okay and now what we do is we go top
Neph again and then u L u L so if we go
back to this this is our top nav this is
the first ul ul and that is the second
ul ul okay so we don't want this to be
displayed so what we're going to do now
is are open our style tag there and then
position:absolute left:0 pixels with
zero pixels and now we'll go take a look
at this whoops zero pixels take a look
at that just save it go back to Chrome
and you'll see it puts them all in a
line underneath tutorial okay that's all
good but we don't want to see them we
only want to see them when we hover over
it so we'll go here um with category to
put that in whoops yeah display:none
okay and then now that'll hide them they
they're not going to be able to we won't
see them until we hover over them which
we've already put the code in so now
it's not there it's not there and then
when we hover over it it's not there
still
yeah did I actually put the code in
display:block not blocks blocks okay and
now when you go over it it's there okay
so that was my mistake I just had to
change the X to a c display:block cool
now that the functionalities in we can
begin styling it to look pretty and
that'll be done in the next tutorial so
just practice this and then come back on
the next tutorial and we'll learn how to
make this look pretty so thanks for
watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
