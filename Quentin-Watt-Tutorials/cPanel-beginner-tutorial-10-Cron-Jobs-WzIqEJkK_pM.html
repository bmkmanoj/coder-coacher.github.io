here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you guys how to set up a cron
job using cPanel so if you guys are
unfamiliar with cron jobs then basically
a cron job is a command that we can run
and we can run this every hour every day
once a year or even every minute if we
wanted to run a cron that often and
basically what this cron allows us to do
is run a script on our site and an
example of where this comes in handy is
press the shop which is a shopping
plugin that I've done tutorials on
before they have a script on the or in
the installation of PrestaShop that you
can set up to run on a cron and when you
set the script up basically it will
update all the currencies on your sites
so if you're using a website where
you're you have an international
audience or an international client base
you might want to update your euro to
dollar value or your ran to dollar value
as often as you can because you know if
the rand and the dollar change you might
lose money at some point so yeah
basically you can set up a cron to
update the currency every hour and that
way you know that your currencies are
correct and that you're not going to be
losing any kind of money due to like
exchange rates changing not that I
change that fast every hour that's a bit
much but like every day maybe you might
want to run that that cron so yeah that
is an example of where it's useful but
I'm going to show you guys how to set it
up now and I've also got my own little
scripts that I will be showing you guys
in just a second so let's scroll down to
the Advanced tab and here it is so let's
click on advanced and this is going to
take us through to the cron job
Paige give it a few seconds to load and
here we can set up an email every time
the cron runs but first we have to
actually set up a cron job so I'm going
to add a new cron job and you can see
that we've got this common settings tab
here so basically we get to choose do we
want our cron to run once a minute once
every five minutes twice a week or
whatever like so I'm just going to
choose once every minute and you can see
that now all of these values have
changed so if you wanted a more custom
setting then you could go ahead and play
with this but I'm just going to play
with the common once a minute settings
and now we need to add in a command so
let me first show you guys what file I
want to run and what it does and then
I'm going to show you guys how to add
this command in here so let me pull over
my files and the first file I have over
here is cron 80ml and this is an HTML
page it's not the file that we're going
to be running but it does have a counter
on the page so I've got a heading here
that says this is test zero and if I
visit that page which is over here you
can see it says this is tes 0 but then I
also have a PHP script and this is my
second file and basically what the
script does is every time the script is
called it will find the counter so it's
going to find the counter on my HTML
page which is here and then it's going
to increase the counter by 1 put out the
value save the HTML file and then put
out this message file updated
successfully so to show you guys just
how that works I'm going to hit refresh
over here and I've still got file
updated successfully so
so if I go over to my HTML page again
and I hit refresh you can see that we
now have this is test one so again if i
refresh this it's running the script and
now the counter should be on test two
great so now I know that if I set up
this file to run on a cron it's going to
update my counter every minute so what
I'm going to do is add in my file path
and we don't add in a normal file path
like for some people you might add a
full directory path like this a home
jozek Bay so this is your server name or
your user name for your server public
HTML and then your file but this didn't
actually work for me so you guys can try
this out I'll leave it in the
description below but this did not work
for me so what I had to do was add in a
full file path specifying my user bin
and then home and then my actual user
name for my server and then public HTML
and then the file that I wanted to run
so I'm going to copy this and I'm going
to leave all three of these file paths
in the description below and obviously
you guys will just have to kind of
change them to fit your server because
like I said I'm actually using my cPanel
username in this in this file or in this
file path so jozek Bay is my my cPanel
username and if I just go to the home
page you can see there's my cPanel
username right there and I'm going to
paste this full file bath in here add
the cron and now the cron has been added
and it should run once every minute so
when my clock ticks over to 10:15 p.m.
which I'm not sure how long that's going
to take then we will have an updated
HTML page so let's just go ahead and
wait here in fact I'm going to hit
refresh and you can see right now we're
still on to
still on two but as soon as this clock
ticks over to a new minute the page
should be updated so yeah let's just see
what happens okay
so there we go my clock just ticked over
and I'm gonna hit refresh and you can
see that the counter has now counted up
because that means that this cron ran
successfully so this page was actually
loaded successfully and my counter has
increased so that is how you set up a
cron job and that's pretty much all I
have for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like and share this
video it's really gonna help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
