and welcome to tutorial number nine and
in this tutorial I want to talk to you
guys about selecting stuff with some
functions so in this case there is a
count function and average function and
a sum function that we can make use of
when selecting things using my sequel
and then these functions will do stuff
for us so now let's take a look at the
Select count function and I'm going to
make use of the users table for this one
so let's click on users and click on the
SQL tab and from here I want to select
something from the database so the most
important thing here is that I want to
type and select but like I said I
actually want to make use of some of the
functions and the first function I want
to show you guys is the count function
so let's type in count make sure that
that's all caps and then add in brackets
now this is very very very important I
want to stress to you guys if you put a
space between count and the brackets you
are going to get an error this is not
going to work so make sure that you
don't put a space between count and then
the brackets just make sure you don't do
that anyway so now that I've stressed
that really important part let's move on
with the tutorial so I want to select
count and then basically what happens is
in these square brackets you put the
column that you want to count so in this
case I can count the user names and
that's exactly what I'm going to type in
here so let's say username and then you
just put in from and the table that you
want to count from so in this case I
want to count from the users table and
if you take this now and hit go it'll
count all of the users in the table and
we can see that we actually have 15
users with 15 user names
in this table alright and the nice thing
about that is yeah you can actually make
use of this along with some conditions
so you can say select count from users
where a specific user name so where user
name is equal to in this case let's just
say Quintin 92 all right so let's copy
this and go and see what happens and
yeah in this case we have one user with
the username Quintin 92 or where the
user name is exactly equal to Quintin 92
so yeah that is actually a very useful
query and this is something that you
will probably make use of if you are
ever trying to log a user into a website
or if you are just trying to see if that
user name is taken on your website then
this is the exact query that you will
use to find out if that query is taken
or not because obviously if this returns
the number 1 you know that the user name
has been used it is taken and if it
returns the user and if it can return
the count of zero then you know ok well
actually that user name is free and
available so yeah that is literally the
exact query that people would use to
determine if that user name is taken or
not alright now that we've taken a look
at the count option I also want to make
use of the sum option and or sum
function and the average function but in
order to do that we're going to need a
column that makes use of numbers so if I
browse my table we don't really have
numbers in this table so instead what
I'm going to do is go over to the
products and then if I browse the
products table I have a price and I
think we can try to work out what the
average price is of a products across
our site and then we also have the
product stock option so we can count how
many products we actually have in stock
right or how many items of
we have of a specific well of everything
so let's go over the sequel and I'm
going to show you guys exactly which two
queries to run so let's type in select
because obviously this is going to be a
select query and I want to make like I
said I want to find out what the average
price of something is in our store so if
I type select AVG and then add in some
brackets again make sure that you're not
going to put a space there because if
you put a space there it's not going to
work and then let's select the column
and in this case I want to find out what
the average product prices across our
site so let's say product price in the
average function and then let's just say
from and the table in this case happens
to be the products table so if I copy
this and hit go you can see that the
average price of something across our
entire site happens to be nine thousand
five hundred and eighty eight dollars
and sixteen cents if we round that off
so yeah kind of an expensive store am i
right so that is one way to make use of
the average function and then another
function that I want to show you guys is
the sum function so let's type in sum
and in the brackets of the sum function
instead of working with product price I
actually want to work with product stock
so let's hit product stock into this and
yeah the rest of the query can actually
remain the same so obviously we're
selecting the sum of all the products
that we have in stock from the products
table and if I go I should have an
answer of 678 product in stock right so
yeah basically what this query did was
go through my table
and add all of these numbers together so
it added 10 plus 5 plus 1 plus 50 plus
500 plus 5 and so on and so forth until
we eventually got to the number 678
right so that is how you use some of
these select functions to select some
stuff out of a database or maybe just
count certain items in a database and
that is all I have for you on selecting
things and the next couple of tutorials
we are actually going to be looking at
inserting updating adding deleting these
kinds of things so we're going to be
moving from select to some more advanced
SQL stuff and just before our end of
this tutorial I want to send a huge
thank you to these guys who are my
patrons that contribute five dollars or
more every single month it really means
a lot to me and if you guys like the
content I create and you want to help me
make more of this content then consider
