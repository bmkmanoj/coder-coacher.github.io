here and welcome to tutorial number 16
and in this tutorial we are going to
hopefully finish off this header over
here so yeah right now it looks pretty
good on desktop and if I inspect this it
does look pretty good on mobile as well
but there are definitely a few things
that need changing
right so if I maybe just take a look at
this in desktop you can see that right
now I'm on the home page and the home
page menu item is the one that's
displaying is active also we've got
these other menu items here but if I
click on them I can't actually go
anywhere even though I actually have an
about page so we probably want to add
this about page into the menu so make
this menu actually function and then
you'll notice that now that I'm actually
on the about page we've got a few
problems being that the home page over
here or the home page menu item is still
displaying is active and not our about
page our about page or about link should
be the one that's blue displaying is
active right and it's the same thing if
you inspect element and you look at this
on mobile even though we're actually on
the about page the home page seems to be
the one that's displaying is active so
I'm going to show you guys how to fix
all of that and then hopefully by the
end of this video we can take this build
a website task and/or build a web site
header tasks and move that over to the
next column here which I always used to
be testing but now I've renamed it to
testing and quality control so let's
leave it there for now but hopefully by
the end of this video we can move it
over and get somebody else to test the
actual header for us so let's jump back
over to our code and you can see that
I've got the index file open I've got my
bow page open and I've also got my
header
Inc PHP file open and we are going to be
making some changes to all of these
files now the first change I actually
want
actually has nothing to do with the
header it was just really bad practice
on my part but whenever you include
files with PHP if you do it this way
sometimes you might land up having an
incorrect link and then you get an error
so right now let's say I move all of
these files to a different server or a
different location on a server and I
still try user include like this it
might break something
so a better practice just to get the
full URL is to use this thing called der
name so it's a PHP function directory
name and you want to just append that on
to your actual string and you're also
gonna have to include a forward slash
here and in these brackets type in two
underscores file and then two
underscores if for some reason you
haven't appended it or you haven't got
this forward slash over here you're
probably gonna get an error so whoops
that I actually save that it is on the
home page let's just make sure I'm on
the home page because I'm not but there
we go
I have an error right and that's because
it couldn't locate my file so you got to
make sure that yours pretty much looks
exactly the same as mine over here and
then all of this should work right okay
and basically if you if you guys are
unsure of what this does I can always
show you by opening up some PHP tags
over here in the body and we can just
echo the directory name and only only
the directory name and what that does is
grabs this kind of text so it looks
wherever my file is on my computer or
wherever my file is on a server and just
gets the full directory path for that
and then of course we're adding in some
extra text on the end of that
being being this text over here right so
that's just a really cool trick and it
is best practice if you're including
files to make sure that you have all of
that whoops all of that just set up
correctly so let's let's just copy paste
all of these things and I'm gonna do
that on the about page as well
okay now hopefully if we jump over to
the browser and we refresh nothing
changes
well let's just go back to the home page
here and remove that line don't I have
it removed let's just make sure I've
saved this and yeah nothing should
change our website should still look
exactly the same but we've just includes
our files with best practice or better
practice now what I'd like to do is take
care of these active and non-active menu
items so let's jump back over to my text
editor here and go to headed up PHP and
for our home page of course this needs
to link to index.php and this one needs
to link to about dot PHP it's also fine
if this kind of just links to the root
directory with a slash just like that
and I think we can also include that
same link for about dot PHP and then
we've kind of just got a copy that
functionality down to about a PHP here
and a slash for here or it could even be
index dot PHP right and the reason why
we have two menus here this is obviously
our off canvas menu for mobile and this
is our menu that displays on desktop so
we're gonna just change it in two places
but let's jump back over to the browser
now and let's see that our menu work so
if I click on the about link I go over
to the about page and if I click on the
homepage I go back over
to the homepage so that's cool our links
are working but we still need to fix
this active class and so the way you're
gonna do that is on the home page you
want to create a page ID so you want to
give this page a variable or an ID so
let's open up some PHP tags here and end
that off and then just create a variable
here called page ID and let's set that
equal to one for the home page but I'm
gonna copy that over to the about page
and we can set that equal to two right
so now we have we can identify which
page we're on if we just grab this page
ID variable so if we go over to our head
over here we can actually use those
variables in our links or in our classes
so right now let's just get rid of that
UK active class on the home page link
and also down here and essentially what
I want to do is use a little kind of if
statement but there is a shorthand
version of an if statement called a
ternary operator and yeah that needs to
go inside PHP tags so let's create some
PHP tags and essentially what we want to
do is check for a condition and if that
condition is true that comes after this
question mark and if that condition is
false then whatever comes after the
semicolon is going to be what gets
output so actually it might be a little
bit easier if we just show you a demo of
this somewhere up here right
but if I say echo and then if something
is true let's echo out true if something
is false we can echo out false and so
let's go a page let's let's check for
the variable here so page ID equals
equals one
right so basically what we're doing here
is we're checking if page ID is equal to
1 if it is let's spit out the word true
and if it isn't let's spin out the word
false and if we jump back over to the
browser refresh right now we're on the
home page so page ID is actually 2 and
that's why we've given the ID false but
if I go over to the home page we should
have an undefined variable on line 3
let's just make sure it should be
ah okay I think my homepage just wasn't
saved right so yeah okay so since we're
on the home page and our page ID on the
home page is actually one our header
file
obviously can spit out true and if we're
on another page then obviously it puts
out whatever we've put over here and
right so this is a really handy kind of
thing because we can now obviously do an
if statement and check for everything
inside of an actual class attribute of
an item or a menu item and I think if
our condition here evaluates to false I
don't want to actually put anything out
so we'll just leave those those
quotation marks blank and then for this
one we'll actually put out our class
which is called UK active and that will
display whether the menu item is active
or not right and now all you need to do
is copy that link down to the home page
menu item for the the off canvas menu
and then you can do the exact same thing
on the about page menu items so you just
want to put in that PHP code again but
then check for the variable to be page
ID too and exactly the same thing down
here just check for that page ID to be -
now I know we're kind of repeating code
over here so what might be useful is if
we actually took this entire list item
or all of these el eyes and just put
those into an actual include file so we
could actually do that if I go to my
document here and say let's create a new
file in includes and let's call this
save this as menu dot Inc dot PHP and
essentially all we need to do now is
take those menu items put them in here
and then over here manage our include so
include der name
final two underscores again and then
includes that menu
don't includes
slash menu dot Inc dot PHP and just end
that off there and we just want to take
this exact same line and paste that in
for our menu item items up here as well
so basically what we've done is we've
simplified our menu instead of you know
using the same menu code twice
we've just got all of that over here in
one file and now we only need to make
changes to our menu items once right so
let's come back here and refresh and
I've got a little bit of an include
problem
I guess maybe my path is wrong okay so I
see what's wrong here I've got
applications MAMP htdocs includes
includes so i've got includes twice and
that's because i guess if we take a look
at our header file
i had a file is already in includes so
this directory name is already including
that includes section for us so we can
just remove that from the bit of string
that we're appending and now this should
work so if I jump back over to my
browser and refresh tada
so we now have our menu items here and
when I'm on the home page the home page
displays is active and when I click on
the about page
the about page now displays as active
and so essentially all we need to do is
create the services page and do the
exact same bit of code for the services
link and then we can create the contact
us page and do the exact same code for
that link as well and all of those pages
will display as active so let's let's
actually do that right now
copy that whole class section oops just
copy it and paste that here and then
paste that here and then just make sure
that we're checking for different page
ID so one two three and four four all of
these pages and then we'll just make
sure that to create those pages later on
so now hopefully let's just test this
for our mobile screen as well so I'm
just going to inspect element and just
make sure that we're looking at this on
an iPhone 6 screen size and we can see
that the about page is showing active
here and on the home page the home page
is showing active so that is awesome
we've kind of got a header set up now
and I'm gonna leave it up to you guys in
between the space of this video and the
next video to just set up any extra
pages that you have to set up so the
services page or the Contact Us page and
I'll see you guys in the next video but
