here and welcome to tutorial number
fourteen and in this tutorial we are
going to talk about logical operators in
PHP so I'm just starting off with a
basic if statement here and we're going
to talk about logical operators like I
said so you guys know that we can
already use an if statement to check for
one condition to see if this one
condition is true but what happens if we
wanted to check for two or more
different conditions so in other words
we wanted to make sure that yes apples
needs to be greater than one but apples
also needs to be less than ten okay then
we've got to use logical operators okay
and the first logical operator I'm going
to show you guys is the end operator
which is a double ampersand just like
that okay
so now I can go ahead and put in my
second condition which like I said I
wanted to make sure that apples is less
than ten so this expression now reads if
apples is greater than one and apples is
less than ten then go ahead and do
whatever in this echo statement okay so
let's just say you have more than one
but less than ten and we can probably
append on our variable as well so you
have less than ten apples okay
so right now apples is set to five and
is 5 greater than one yes it is and is
five less than ten well yes it is so
both of these conditions
evaluate to true so that means this code
should run and it should print in the
browser so let's go ahead and click
refresh and it says you have more than
one apples but less than ten and that
five is actually confusing because we
didn't really word that in there but hey
okay
so you can see that when we use this and
logical operator both of these
conditions have to be true so what
happens if one of them is false let's
say I had apples as 11 well now this
would kind of read if 11 is greater than
1 which it is so this is true but we're
going and 11 less than 10 well 11 isn't
less than 10 so this condition is false
and that means that this whole if
statement will return false or this
whole if condition will return false I
guess that means that we're not going to
print this out okay because one of these
conditions was false so let's go back
and click refresh and as you can see
we've got nothing printed out and that's
because when we use the and logical
operator both of the conditions on
either side of the operator have to be
true you can't just have one true and
the other one not okay but not only can
we use this and operator we also have an
or operator in PHP which is these two
pipe symbols so those will be next your
Enter key above the shift key on your
keyboard you'll have to hold down shift
to actually use them and what these
symbols mean is or so what this sentence
or what this expression reads out to be
is if apples
is greater than 1 or if apples is less
than 10 do this okay
so right now apples is set to 11 and is
11 greater than 1 well yes it is
so there's actually now we're using the
or operator here so it doesn't actually
matter if the statement is true or not
okay because this condition is true you
know it's true we're only checking for
or if you know we're only checking if
this is true or if this is true so it
doesn't actually matter which one of
these is false okay one can be true one
can be false we're still going to print
this out as long as one of these two
conditions is true so 11 is indeed
greater than 1 so when we go back and
click refresh we've got this thing
printed out okay likewise if I change
apples to 0 when we read through this
again we've got is 0 greater than 1 well
no it's not but we're also checking or
if apples is less than 10 so is 0 less
than 10 well yes 0 is actually less than
10 so this condition is at least true
even though this one is false so we're
still going to get this thing printed
out on the on the browser okay so that's
how these logical operators work you can
use and which is the double ampersand
sign and that means that both of these
conditions have to be true for this
statement to execute or you can use the
or our logical operator which basically
means only one has to be true doesn't
matter which one as long as one of these
conditions is true this code will run so
