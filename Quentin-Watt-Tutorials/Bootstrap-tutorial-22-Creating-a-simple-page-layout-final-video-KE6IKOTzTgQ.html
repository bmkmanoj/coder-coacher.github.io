here and welcome to tutorial number 22
and this is the final tutorial in my
bootstrap series and in this video I
actually was just going to say to you
guys hey congratulations you finish
bootstrap the end but I thought well why
not end this tutorial off by just
creating a simple page template or a
page layout that you guys can then use
in future so I'm actually gonna be
starting this tutorial off with the code
from our slider so if you finish the
last tutorial then this is the exact
code from there we have a slider and
that's pretty much all we've got on this
page right but now I want to add in a
few extra elements so what I'm going to
do is just go over to the line number
here and sublime and these little
triangles up here I'm going to click on
that and it's going to minimize that
block of code so my slider is still
there it's just hidden at the moment
it's just going to make everything look
nice and tidy great so now that we've
got my slider set up and it's minimized
I want to add in a navigation I also
want to add in some page content a
sidebar and a footer because every
website you go to usually has all four
of those things so we've got us our
slide over here but above our slider I
want to add in my navigation and that is
usually a header so I'm going to add in
some header tags here and ending header
and actually what I'm going to do over
here since we've already spoken about
how to create a nav is I'm just going to
copy some code that I have and this is
the code straight off the bootstrap
website by the way so that is a
navigation inside of our header and then
just tidy that up a little bit and I
think what I'm going to do is highlight
it all indent it so we can see where it
all goes and then I'm going to minimize
that
so this is our navigation and like I
said it
the navigation direct from bootstraps
site so I have explained this before but
you guys can go ahead and copy that and
paste that in there and if you save this
and then come back here and hit refresh
you should see that we now have a
navigation and we have a slider which is
awesome
so from here I think what I want to do
is then create another new row so let's
create a div and we'll give this a class
of row and inside here I want to place
two elements so I want to place my
sidebar and I also want to place my main
section with all my content so let's go
ahead and actually well I've actually
got the code typed out here so I'm going
to copy this div and I'm going to paste
it in here and as you can see this is if
I indent this all a div that is set to
take up eight columns so this is like
our main section of our site and I'm
going to change that from a div tag to a
section tag and that is just to kind of
help the website be html5 friendly and
stuff because I know a lot of people
hate on me for calling something html5
when I don't use one of these tags so
yeah that is where you would place a
section tag and it is going to be eight
columns wide so if I save this and I
come back here and I hit refresh you can
see I've got my content over here and it
is spreading over eight columns so yeah
that's what that's there for and below
this section I want to place an aside
tag so I already have this prepared as
well I'm just going to copy it and paste
it in here and yeah I know a lot of guys
are probably going to be really upset
that I'm doing a lot of copy pasting but
again like this is just a heading and
some paragraphs it's not
that hard or it's not difficult code
it's not code we haven't learned before
and yeah what I can do now is actually
just minimize that section tag just to
make everything look a little bit tidy
and here is the div that I just paste it
in so this is setup set to take up the
remaining four columns out of my 12 so
this one's 8 and that's 4 so obviously
12 and I want to change the tag over
here because this would work a lot
better
as an aside tag instead of a div tag so
let's go a side and a side and yeah this
is our sidebar and if you take a look
here I've actually got two divs that are
actually will have the class of panel
and panel default and these just have a
heading or a panel heading and an image
in the panel body so if I save this now
and I come back here and hit refresh you
can see we've got a panel with a heading
and we've got an image and if I place
some content in there and a link or
something like that then that's
generally what you would have in the
sidebar of your website and yeah from
here the last thing I want to do is add
in another new row so I'm going to say
div and I'm going to give that a class
of row and then I'm going to end this
row off just like that okay
let's create a paragraph in here well we
should probably create a column so let's
change this from div to footer with a
class of row and I am going to then
place another div in here actually
that's confusing right let's let's keep
all the rows divs and inside here I'll
make this a footer footer and we'll give
this a class of Col MD 12 so it's going
to take up
twelve columns and let's actually make
that SM so it's going to take up twelve
columns on any device so it's a foot
it's going to take up that whole bottom
section and all I'm going to say is and
copy copyright 2015 and if you guys are
not aware what this does it makes the
little copyright symbol so and copy and
I should probably put that in a
paragraph because it's text and you
should probably also give this paragraph
a class of text
- Center great and now if I come back
here and hit refresh I should have a
footer that is centered and it just says
copyright 2015 so yeah that is pretty
much how to set up a template so yeah I
know I kind of ran through that a little
bit quickly but like I said I do have
tutorials on pretty much all of these
sections and if there was something that
I missed then you can also just copy the
code from bootstraps website and I just
wanted to give you guys an idea of like
how simple it is to lay everything out I
mean we really just went ahead and put
in a navigation a slider title a side
bar and a footer so five different
pieces and we have our page setup right
and yeah I know looking at it right now
it's not perfect like there is
definitely some improvement that can be
made for instance we've got no space
between the sidebar and our slider we
also don't have any space above our menu
and so this is where you would probably
link a custom style sheet and start
styling away and I've actually already
done that in a previous tutorial I
remember which one but I created a link
to a custom style sheet and you guys
should know how to do this already
so here is my style sheet and yeah I can
go ahead and not add in a class so let's
just say
my sidebar my - sidebar and we will give
this some margin on the top so margin
top 20 pixels and yeah if I copy this
class and I go back over to my index
file and I go to my aside which is my
sidebar and just place that as a
secondary class and come back yet and
hit refresh you can see that now - my
sidebar actually has a little bit of
space between the slider and the actual
content right and we could do the same
thing for the navigation and so on and
that's just how you would go about
improving your site you could also
override some of the bootstrap default
styling so if you wanted your sidebar or
your navigation bar to have a background
color of black then go ahead give your
navigation bar a class and then just go
start styling it however you would like
it to look like and again that stuff is
kind of all out of scope of the series
so I'm not going to be covering it but I
really want to see some work that you
guys get done so you know send me links
on Facebook on Twitter and I'll take a
look at your website and yeah that is
all I have for you in the series so

channel grow and I'll see you guys next
