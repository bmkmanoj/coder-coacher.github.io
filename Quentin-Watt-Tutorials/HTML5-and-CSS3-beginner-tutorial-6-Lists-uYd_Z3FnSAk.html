here and welcome to tutorial number 6
and in this tutorial I'm going to talk
to you guys about lists in HTML so
taking a look at my text editor I've
gone and cleared out the code from the
previous tutorials and I've left some
comments here because we've got ordered
lists we've got unordered lists and then
we've got definition lists so these are
the three different types of Lists that
we use in HTML and I want to show you
guys an example of each one so an
ordered list is obviously a list that
has an order this would be a list that
is numbered from 1 to however long your
list is right so let me create a list of
steps to take 4 steps to learning HTML
something like that right now whenever
you want to create an ordered list in
HTML you open up something called an O L
Tech which stands for ordered list so
I'll hit enter and that completed the
tag for me I'm going to hit enter again
just to format everything nice and tidy
and then inside of this Oh L tag you
actually have to create another tag
which is an L I tag and that stands for
list item so I'm going to hit enter and
now we have an ordered list with one
list item in it but that list item is
empty so let's think about it steps to
learning HTML or what is the first thing
I want to do go to YouTube maybe and
then I want to duplicate this list item
so if you're using sublime like I am you
can hit shift command + D or shift ctrl
+ D and that will duplicate the line
provided your cursor is in front of that
line so let's do that 4 times and let's
just say there's 4 steps to learning
HTML go to YouTube
search for Quinton what watch his videos
and the last one can be practice right
so let me go ahead and save this now and
I want to take a look at this in my
browser so I'm going to jump back over
to my to Firefox and hit refresh with
the my localhost open and now you can
see if i zoom in I have my steps to
learning HTML an ordered list that goes
from 1 to 4 and all of the items that I
placed in here are displaying so that is
how to create an ordered list let's take
a look at how to create an unordered
list so I know that lists are not
numbered they are or they have bullet
points so obviously an unordered list is
something that you don't have to follow
the specific order of let's just say
something like grocery a grocery list of
things I need to buy today grocery list
of things to buy I probably shouldn't
waste my time fixing these typos but hey
let me open up my unordered list by
opening up a UL tag so that is how do
you create an unordered list you open up
a UL tag and I'm just going to hit enter
so UL obviously stands for unordered
list and inside of this UL tag we also
make lists or make use of these list
items so I'm going to create a list item
and I'm going to duplicate this four
times and let's think of four things
that I need to buy today because it is
really hot right now so I think maybe
some ice for drinks maybe some iced tea
because that sounds very refreshing
right now hmm
something without ice in it
apples because they're just nice
refreshing fruits and hmm something else
that I need to buy today probably food
so let me go ahead and save this and hit
refresh in the browser and now you can
see that I've got a grocery list of
things to buy and this is an unordered
list so all items are marked with a
bullet point instead of a number and
that is the main difference between an
ordered list and an unordered list now
let's take a look at the last type of
list I want to show you guys which is a
definition list so definition this
actually works slightly differently to
these ones you might use this if you
were creating something like a
dictionary or maybe a menu perhaps so
let me open up my definition list by
opening up a DL tag and that stands for
definition list so I'm going to hit
enter and inside of here
we don't make use of the li item anymore
we make use of two new tags one of them
is ADT for definition title or
definition term someone hit enter and
then below the definition title we need
to add another tag which is d d which is
the definition description so hit enter
and over here you put in like your
definition term so let's say that this
was a menu perhaps I might put in coffee
as the definition term and then for the
definition description I'll say
something like black coffee with sugar
right
so that was one list item done or one
definition term and description done let
me go ahead and
see this and paste this a few times and
the next definition term again because
it's really hot let's use something nice
and refreshing like iced tea and for the
description I'll just put iced tea with
lemon and then the last one let's use a
milkshake as an example and mmm I don't
know just list the flavors vanilla
chocolate or strawberry right so let me
go ahead and save this and jump back
over to the browser and hit refresh and
now you can see we've got the definition
term displaying as if it were like a
title and then we have the definition
description displaying as if it were
like one of the list items except it
doesn't have a bullet point or a number
so that is how you use the three lists
in HTML and we'll be taking a look at
using these for other things in future
but for now that is all I have for you
and I'll see you next time I just want
to send a shout out to my sponsors at
dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp
with courses on iOS development UX
design and web development and they can
teach you everything you need to know to
get a job within this field and they'll
do it within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
I thank you hey thanks for staying until
the end of the video that really means a
lot to me now while you're still here
there are a few things that you can do
to help first of all if you haven't
already subscribe and watch another one
of my videos and if you want to help me
make more content more often or if you
feel that my content is just worth
paying a little bit of money towards you
can check me out on patreon you can also
check me out on social media I will
leave the links next to me so go ahead
and click on something and I'll see you
guys
is next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
