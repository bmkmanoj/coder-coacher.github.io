here and welcome back to tutorial number
28 and in this tutorial we are gonna
start taking a look at how to use loops
with arrays now I'm not too sure if you
guys have ever heard that saying the
space between your fingers is right
where mine fit perfectly now I know
that's kind of a cute saying to a girl
and it's like a line in a song and all
that but this is exactly how loops and
arrays work they are pretty much made
for each other okay so I've got some
code here from the previous tutorial
where I showed you guys how to make an
array and we actually deleted an array
element and we were echoing array
elements out individually but now let's
take a look at how to loop through an
array and print out every single one of
these elements okay so I'm just gonna go
ahead and delete this code and then
we're gonna start off our loop now for
this example I'm gonna use a for loop
but it's possible to use a while loop or
a do-while loop as well okay so we're
gonna start off with for variable I is
equal to zero so this is basically our
counter and the nice thing about
starting our count at zero is that this
array also starts at zero remember that
Ryan is element zero so we're going to
use this variable inside of our loop
later on whenever referring to these
elements now we happen to know that this
array actually only has four elements so
we got Ryan Sean Kyle and Quentin one
two three four
okay so I know that I only have to
repeat while I is less than four so
while I less than four and the reason
for that is because we start counting at
zero so zero one two three once we get
to four there are no more ray elements
left that's when our loop needs to end
okay now we're just gonna go ahead and
increment I by one every time the loop
iterates and of course in here all we
have to do is just say echo people if I
can spell people right one day okay
echo people I so this will basically
anchor out whatever element we're
working with at that time I should
probably just append on a break
statement I mean a break tag here as
well okay just to make everything appear
nice and neatly but like I said what
this is gonna do is the first time it
runs I is gonna be equal to zero so
we're gonna anchor out people zero which
happens to be Ryan then the second time
we iterate through this loop is gonna be
one so we're gonna echo out people one
which is Sean and so on and so forth
until we get to the end of our array or
until we get to I is equal to four and
then it will stop so let's go back here
and just click refresh and as you can
see I've got Ryan Sean Kyle Quinton so
we have printed out every single element
in the array but now although that code
already works there's a little bit of a
problem here in the fact that if we
decided to add one more element to this
array so let's say I was just going to
put one more element in here and we'll
say the girl's name was Kirsten or
something then our loop suddenly doesn't
work anymore because we have to change
our counter to five before our loop will
work again
okay otherwise we'll end up not printing
out Karstens name when I is still four
okay so instead of actually using a
fixed number in our loop over here we
can use a function
that will count how many elements they
are in the array and then we'll be able
to loop through the array until the
array ends so in other words our loop is
going to be dynamic if the array is
shorter it'll loop less times and if the
array is longer it'll loop more times
okay so the function that we can use is
called count and it takes one argument
and that is whichever array you want to
count so count people will then return
how many elements they are in the people
array which in this case is five so now
when we go back here and click refresh
we've got Kirstin printed out so our
first element is included okay and again
if I go ahead and take Kirsten out I
won't have to change anything here in my
loop because this is going to be dynamic
it's going to count our array every
single time it loops so we're going to
know whether or not oh how many elements
there are in the race so now it's going
to work again perfectly with Kirsten not
being in the array so that's pretty cool
and that's how to loop through arrays
again you can go ahead and try this
example out with a while loop or a
do-while loop I'll leave that up to you
guys it is quite simple all you're going
to have to do is just change the loop
but still use a counter somewhere along
the line so thanks for watching guys
