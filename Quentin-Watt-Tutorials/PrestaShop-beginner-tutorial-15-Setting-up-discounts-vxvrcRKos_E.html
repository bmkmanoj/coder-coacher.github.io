here and welcome to tutorial number 15
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at how to apply a discount
to someone's product or someone's
voucher right so log in to press the
shop and go over to the price rules tab
and you'll see that we have carpools and
we have catalog price rules so these are
two different areas where we get to
apply discounts but I'm going to start
off with the court rules so let's click
on that and this should load a page with
a bunch of different vouchers so you can
see we've got the birthday discount
voucher which i believe is added by
default with prestashop and then we have
a bunch of others over here which I
think I set up at some point so yeah
that's what those are therefore and if I
go ahead and click on these I can also
delete or disable them if I want to if
they have a green ticks a green tick
over here it means that they're enabled
and people can still use them or I can
go over to the big plus button in the
top corner over here and this is where I
get to add a new voucher so let me go
ahead and click on that plus button and
this is going to take me through to
another page with a form so i get to
fill in some information about the
voucher that I'm creating then I also
get to add some conditions to this
voucher so who gets to use the voucher
and how long it's valid for and then we
have actions so these are actions that I
want to apply to my voucher does the
user get free shipping will they get a
discount and so on but let's go over to
information and let's actually fill out
this form and actually create our
discount so I'm gonna say that I'm about
to launch my store and I want to give
out a discount to the first 100 people
who buy something then let's call this a
launch promo I'm also going to give this
a description and this could really be
anything you wanted but I'm just going
to
a discount for website launch or
something like that and then for the
code I could enter in my own code
manually like launch code or I could
generate a random code for customers to
use but let's let's leave it at launch
code or site promo or something like
that and yeah from here I can then
choose do I want to highlight this
discount so this means that if the
voucher is not yet in the cart it will
be displayed in the summary so I'll go
ahead and highlight that so people can
see that it's there then for partial use
I'm going to set that to know and
partial use means that the user can use
part of the discounts so let's say you
were going to give them a fixed discount
of ten dollars and they only wanted to
spend seven dollars then you could allow
partial use and then they could use the
voucher for only seven dollars but I'm
not going to do that I'm just going to
leave the set know so they have to spend
the full amount and then priority I will
leave this at one and this is won by
default but let's say you have two
different discounts that a customer can
use so one gives them a fixed amount of
discounts so one gives them like five
dollar discount and then we have another
discount on the other side that gives
them a percentage you might want to take
away the fixed amount before you take
away the percentage or you might want to
take away the percentage before you take
away the fixed amount then you need to
work with these two different priorities
so whichever one has a priority of one
will be applied first and then priority
of two will be applied second so yeah
yeah you guys get the picture okay then
we've got status and this is set to yes
by default so it means that the promo
code or the voucher will be available
immediately otherwise we could leave the
said no and only come back and enable it
when we feel like it or when we choose
to
okay then let's go over to conditions
and I'm gonna go take a look at this
first option here which is limit to a
single customer so I can choose do I
want everybody would to be able to use
this if so I'll leave this blank
otherwise I could start typing in a
person's name and this should auto
complete quinton cool so I can select me
and then only I would be able to use
this discounts but i'm going to leave a
blank so everyone can use it then we've
got a date of validity so this is when
the voucher is valid from and when how
long the valley the voucher will be
valid for so by default this is actually
set to one month and I'm going to leave
it like that then we'll also have a
minimum amount so does the customer have
to spend a minimum amount of a certain
value before we give them the discounts
so obviously if you set this to ten
dollars they have to spend ten dollars
and here is the currency over here right
now we only have dollars set up
otherwise leave this at zero and they
can use the discount even if they
haven't actually spent anything then we
can go over to tax excluded or shipping
excluded and we could choose if we want
text to be included or excluded in this
minimum amount okay then we've got total
available so this is how many of these
vouchers can be used so if i set this to
100 it means that 100 people would be
able to use this voucher and that's
exactly what I'm looking for I want the
first 100 people who use this or use my
store to use this voucher total
available for each user I'm going to
leave that at one which means that each
customer can only use their discount
once restrictions we can place carrier
restrictions on here so let's say a
certain carrier isn't available for the
discounts I can remove them or I can
just leave them as is an
every carrier would be available and
that's what I want to do so let me move
on to the next section now which is
actions and this is what my discount
does so I'm going to give them free
shipping and i will apply a percentage
discount of five percent so the first
100 customers will get a five percent
discount and i can choose to apply the
discount to the order without shipping
seems logical they're shipping is free
anyway so yeah cool let's go ahead and
hit save and that is my voucher created
so if i wanted to see this in the front
end i can then go over to the front end
of my store I've already got a product
added over here so let's hit check out
and because I chose to highlight my
voucher you can see it's displaying over
here so all I have to do now is actually
copy that code placed it in here hit
okay and this should apply a discount to
my cart so hopefully when it's loads we
have vouchers added here and it's given
them an eight dollar 23 cents discount
and then I can go ahead and complete the
order however they wish to do so great
so that is the comp rule explained now
let's take a look at catalog price rules
so I'm going to click on that and that
is going to take us to a page with some
catalog rules hopefully this loads one
day yeah sorry about the slow internet
guys not much I can do to fix it so yeah
right now we don't have any catalog
rules but I can choose to add a new one
if I want to and from here I can give my
catalog rule a name so let's just name
it test one or test you test one okay
and then we can choose do we want this
catalog rule to apply with only as
certain currency the only currency i
have available at the moment is dollar
because the only one I've set up but you
can limit to cut limited to currencies
or leave it available for all currencies
you could limit this discount two
countries or you can leave it at all
countries that's actually us know
America man why Cannot I find one the
United States of America great there we
go so I'm going to limit it to America
only let's choose a group I can choose
do all customers or get this discount or
only customers or resellers guests
whatever so let's leave this at
customers from quantity one so yeah I
think they can get the discount if
they've bought just one price rules and
text you can leave that at the base
price we can set a discount validity
again so the month that it will be
active let's go to September the 10th
done a reduction amount so we can choose
how much we're going to give them a
discount by so it can be a discount it
can be a percentage or it can be an
amount so let's go percentage and I'll
give them a 10-percent discount if
they're ordering from the United States
within that month right and yeah that is
the discount set up so I can go ahead
and hit save and there it is or there it
should be and you can see we can also
add new conditions at the bottom there
as well but yeah that is our discount
set up and that is all I have for you
