here and welcome to tutorial number
three and in this tutorial I am going to
show you guys how to upload files to
your website so we're going to be using
the file manager for that so go ahead
and click on the icon or click on the
link and that is going to open up in a
new tab so this is just how cPanel likes
to work things as it opens this up in a
new tab but this should look really
familiar to you because this is supposed
to look like the Windows File Explorer
or finder on a Mac so if I take a look
at this over here you see we've got this
directory tree to the left and over here
I've got a directory tree to the left or
over here and once you click on it it
shows all the files to the right so it's
the same thing that's going on here is
you got your directory tree and you got
your files and your folders over here
then we've also got some navigation so
this will take me back to the home which
I'm already there right now so that's
why it's disabled if I go down a folder
I can go I can always go up one level or
back and forward using the navigation
over here reload is kind of useful for
when you want to reload everything
that's in this section so after you've
uploaded some files go ahead and click
reload and that's just going to reload
this box with all the files you can
select all or unselect all and so on so
basically this is just a file manager
but in the browser right and you can see
we've got a toolbar at the top to upload
for our add new files and folders or
upload folder path folders and files or
we can restore delete and so on but
something has to be selected at that
point when you want to delete anyway
don't just delete stuff that's over here
please we need to go into public HTML so
I'm going to go ahead and click on that
and you can see that's opened up the
public HTML directory here
public HTML is where we want all the
folders that all the files that we want
uses to be able to see need to be
uploaded to our public HTML directory so
that that that is what uses see when
they visit the site and you can see
right now I've got an index file over
here and there's also CGI bin which is
empty but let me go up a level here and
I'm gonna just delete these files so
this index dot PHP file is the coming
soon page that's currently displaying
and I'm going to get rid of that and
upload my own file so let's select them
click delete trash the files BAM they're
gone if I go back to the domain Josey
cocom and refresh you can see it now
says index of and there's nothing here
so basically what is happening is
because there's no index page the
browser is trying to give me a list of
any other files or folders that might be
in the public HTML directory and the
problem is there aren't any so nothing
showing up but if there was something
then we'd have a few files showing up
here and if there was an index file then
instead of showing the index of the
directory it would actually load the
index file that I place here so that's
exactly what I'm going to do I'm going
to upload my own index dot HTML file and
I've already created it it's the most
awesome web site in the world basically
just the standard html5 template that
you would have learned to how to make in
my previous tutorials and yeah we've got
a title I'm about to go live on the
Internet and we've got a heading that
says oMG I'm live on the Internet so
just make sure that well I'm the only
reason I'm reading that out is so that
you guys can see it because I'm going to
upload it and I want you to see the same
thing over here
did I just Wow let's put you back there
and just pulled it out of its place and
so what I want to do now is upload a
file so I'm going to click on upload and
that's going to open a new tab and I'm
going to drag my index dot HTML page
that I want to upload into this box and
there we go it's uploaded the file so if
I come back to my file manager and I hit
reload I can see that my file is now
here and I can see the file size the
time and date it was last modified was
today at 8:08 which is the time right
now and then we've got permissions which
I'll talk about quickly after this but
let's quickly refresh this page so I'm
going to hit refresh and you can see oMG
I am Alive on the internet so that is my
index page showing up on the server
which is pretty awesome so now people
can see my website and yeah if I go
ahead and highlight or click on this
file you'll see I can also copy it move
it
download it rename it or edit it in one
of the code editors so there are three
editors here this code editor HTML
editor and the normal editor and this is
going to look I guess the closest thing
to look like a code editor would be the
one that says code editor and so yeah if
you ever want to edit files directly on
the server really quickly you can go
ahead and click on that but I usually
just download files and then work on
them in sublime because it's you know
much easier to use and then I'll upload
them again back to the server then we've
got permissions so by default
permissions for files are usually 644 so
let me highlight this click on
permissions and you can see we're able
to change that so permission right now
644 but as soon as I start ticking more
of these boxes these numbers change
right so basically if the file is
read-only in other words nobody can edit
it then it would be 4 4 4
and four for four obviously that's what
you want people to have if you want them
to go to see the file if the file is
forbidden and you don't want them to see
it go ahead and make the file
permissions zero zero zero and now when
I come back here you can see index dot
HTML is forbidden so you're not allowed
to have access to it and obviously we
don't want that to happen on our sites
so let's go ahead and just change
permissions to be at least read-only but
the user should actually have write
permissions so we can go ahead and
modify this file but we don't want other
people to be able to modify the file if
they gain access to the server somehow
so we will leave those boxes on ticked
and then execute is if you ever have an
executable on here which you really
shouldn't then you can enable execution
and that will allow files to be executed
and actually I recently had an issue
where images need to be in an executable
folder which is interesting but we'll
get into that at another time
so yeah that is how to use this file
manager and I realize I just skipped
compress and extract so compress if I
highlight this and hit compress is going
to make a zip file of the file that I've
just selected so I could go ahead and
click compress and obviously extract
would extract the file but I'm not going
to bother about doing any of those
things because you guys know how to
unzip and zip files so that's just
available in this file manager if you
ever want to do that and that is all I
have for you in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like and share this
video it's really going to help my
channel grow and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
