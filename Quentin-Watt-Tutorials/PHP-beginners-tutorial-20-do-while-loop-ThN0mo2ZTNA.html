here and welcome back to tutorial number
20 and in this tutorial I am going to
talk to you guys about the third and
final leap that I'm actually going to
show you guys for a while and this is
called the do-while loop now of course
the do-while loop is similar to the for
loop and the wildly because you can use
it to repeat one line of code or a few
lines of code until a condition
eventually becomes false but there is
one difference because a do-while loop
only checks for the condition after the
loop has been executed so this means
that a do-while loop will always run at
least once even if the condition is
false okay whereas the previous loops if
you had a false condition the loop would
never run at all because those for loop
the for loop in the while loop checked
for the condition at the beginning okay
so let's take a look at the syntax for a
do-while loop you're gonna start off
with the word do and then we're gonna
put in our curly braces and this is
basically where the code we want to
repeat goes so code to repeat goes here
and after that we type in the word while
and this is where we'll put in our
condition okay so as you can see we
actually only check for the condition at
the end so the computer sees this word
dude does all this stuff checks the
condition and if this condition is false
then it doesn't do anything inside this
loop again but if this condition is true
then it'll go on and keep going and so
this condition eventually does become
false okay now another thing that you
can see here is that much like the while
loop this do-while loop does not
have a built-in counter so if we want to
run this loop ten times we have to make
our own counter so let's go ahead and
make our variable I outside the loop
over here and we'll set I to zero okay
and then after that inside our loop over
here we're gonna have to increment I so
I plus plus now remember if you don't
increment I inside of the loop you're
going to make a loop that runs forever
and you're going to make the user's
browser crash so not a good idea to
leave this line of code out okay and
let's just echo something out inside our
loop so we'll just echo I repeated I
times so topping them with x and a break
tag as well just to make sure that every
time this loop prints out it'll be on a
new line so now we just have to take
care of our condition which you guys are
probably used to by now and that is just
going to be well I is less than 10
awesome so now let's go ahead and save
this and run this in Firefox and as you
can see we've got I have repeated 0
times 1 times 2 times whatever okay so
the loop actually ran from 0 to 9 which
is 10 times and like I said before this
loop will run at least once even if this
condition here is false so let's start I
off at 11 okay
this means we know that 11 is not less
than 10 okay but watch what happens we
still get one line of code printed out
or one
eko printed arts I have repeated 11
times okay and this is like I said
because we actually execute our loop at
least once before checking for the
condition and that's actually all I have
for you guys on loops for now but just
remember that a four loop has a bolt
encounter so if you guys want to create
a loop that runs only ten times and you
don't want to make a loop that like
lands up running forever
a for loop is probably the best and
safest option but that doesn't mean that
you should never use a while loop or you
should never use a do-while loop because
like I said they are all slightly
different and they all have very good
specific uses okay
so we'll learn about those a lot later
on but for now you know how loops work
