here and welcome to tutorial number five
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to password protect a
directory using this directory privacy
option so let's click on that and you'll
see it gives me the option to go to my
public HTML directory so let's go ahead
and go straight to that and over here
you'll see that I had now have or I'm
inside of my public HTML directory that
is my folder that I'm in and inside of
this we have one other directory which
is the admin directory so that is
actually a directory that I set up in
the previous tutorial we actually FTP it
on to the server so if I go to file
manager I should have actually had these
open before the tutorial started but if
I look in public HTML you'll see that I
have a folder called admin over here so
I'm going to password protect only that
admin directory by just going over to
this admin directory over here and then
I'm going to tick the box protect
password protect this directory you'll
have to give it a name so I'm going to
just call it admin protection and when
you hit save the directory will now be
password protected so if I try go to my
admin folder now and I try to refresh
this you can see that it's asking me for
authentication so I have to put in a
username and a password but I haven't
actually set one up yet so I'm going to
keep getting an error as long as I hit
enter so what I need to do is just
cancel this go back to that page where I
password-protected the folder and I need
to create a user and a password so let's
create a user named Quinton and I'm
going to use the password generator over
here to generate a password tick I have
copied this and saved in a safe place
use the password make sure you have
actually caught
saved in a safe place and let's hit save
and now you can see that we have
assigned the user Quinton and the
password to this directory so now if I
come back here to Jersey admin and I put
in my username Quinton and my password
that I created and hit OK
I can update the password well that I
was actually just because I've I saved
it in my browser and there we go you can
see that we now have access to the admin
page again but only if I put in that
password but once I've logged in I've
logged in so it's not going to ask me
for the password again
so yeah that's just how to password
protect a directory and if you ever
wanted to unprotect it you need to go
back to that directory again and then
just untick password protect this
directory hit save and now nobody will
need to log in so you can actually
delete the user as well if you wanted to
and yeah now the password should be open
or the directory should be open to
everyone and a way that I can test that
is to maybe just open that in a new
browser that I haven't logged in with
hit enter and there we go I can still
log into that page or access that page
one last thing I just want to mention
before we end of this tutorial is that
the only time that this is really useful
protecting the directory with the
password is if you're building a project
that you don't want anyone to see or you
don't want to have anyone to have access
to but it must be on a live server then
we'll password protected otherwise when
your site gets hacked a server a host
will usually block your entire site like
this and then you might need to unblock
it or you might want to if you're a host
blocks on one side that got hacked so
those are the two cases where this is
really useful in the real world if
you're trying to prevent access to pages
because you won't be able to log in kind
of like a
a Facebook type system or a social
network type system you really have to
code that yourself so if you want the
login page to be in the browser and not
that little pop-up thing that comes from
the top here you've really got to learn
how to code that in PHP or whatever
other scripting language you're using to
prevent access and also grant
permissions etc so that is a completely
different topic all on its own but the
cPanel directory blocking is something
that we only do if you're building a
site that's in its test phase and it's
live on the server but you don't want
random people to have access to it and
that is all I have for you in this
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
and share this video it's really going
to help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time
