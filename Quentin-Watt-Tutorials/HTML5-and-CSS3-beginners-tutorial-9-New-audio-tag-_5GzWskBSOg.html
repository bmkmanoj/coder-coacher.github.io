in here and welcome to tutorial number
nine and in this video I'm going to show
you guys how to add audio to your
website using the new html5 audio tag
now like I said this audio tag is new to
html5 so because it is a new tag there
are some browsers that might not support
this tag or if someone is using a
browser that hasn't been updated in a
while so let's say they are using Google
Chrome or Firefox but it just hasn't
been updated in a long time
then this tag might not work for them
either okay so to add an audio tag to
your web page you're just going to go
ahead and type in audio like that in a
tag but it is a double tag so we're
going to close it off as well
okay and because this is actually not
enough information we're still going to
have to tell the browser some how what
file to include okay so we've got
another tag that we can put inside here
which is the source and this is actually
we will be placing our source attribute
as well now the reason for this is some
browsers might not support one file type
so they might not support mp3 then you
have to put in multiple source tags so
you'll put in a source for google chrome
which supports mp3 and then you'll put
in another source tag for firefox that
in that supports OGG or something like
that okay
but actually most browsers all support
mp3 so if you're using Firefox or you're
using Google Chrome we should get away
with just using an mp3 file okay but
before we get into the attributes I also
want to just tell you
if the user is using an old browser okay
this audio tag isn't going to work for
them it's not really going to show up so
what we can do is include a message in
between this audio tag just to say to
the user that they need to update their
browser ad won't show up if the audio
tag does work so if they're using a
browser that is already up to date then
the message won't show up but if they're
using an out-of-date browser then the
message will show up okay so we can just
say if you can see this update your
browser okay so hopefully they don't see
this message but if they do they need to
update their browser okay and now we can
talk about the attributes so there's
actually a few attributes that we're
going to need to include over here and
the first one obviously is the source
attribute and we can set this equal to
the file that we want to include on our
page okay so I've got this audio file
here too mp3 file which I downloaded
from YouTube's audio library and it's
basically just some free music that
YouTube offers there so I'm going to go
ahead and set Garage dot mp3 okay and
that should work for us for now but
there's also another attribute that we
need to include and that is the type
okay and the type is basically just
telling the browser what audio file they
should be expecting okay well it should
be expecting should I say okay so
because this is an mp3 then we know that
the browser should be expecting a an
audio slash MPEG file okay
so like I said the reason why this is
set up like this in a different tag is
because what's a single tag so you can
close that off is because let's say if
you wanted to test this in a few
browsers and you found out that maybe
opera or something does not support an
mp3 then you can go ahead and put in
another tag here with a file like OGG
which it does support okay and then you
just have to make sure whoops
you just have to make sure that you have
not only an mp3 here but an OGG file as
well but that might be a little bit
complicated for some of you guys so let
me just get back to notepad plus plus
here and we can just take that line out
we really don't need it right now
because we've only got an mp3 okay
but there is one file or one other
attribute that we're gonna have to
include here and that is going to be in
these audio tags we're going to specify
that we want some controls okay so the
controls are going to show up in the
browser and they might look different on
every browser so unless you want to make
your own controls with JavaScript then
you need to actually specify these
controls so that the user will be able
to push play pause and rewind etc okay
so let's go ahead and save this now and
if I go back to Firefox and click
refresh you can see I now have this
little audio thing here which I can push
play and if it ever push play it's going
to play the music so that
I guess that's cool but then there's two
other attributes which I can talk to you
guys about as well and that would be the
autoplay so photo play and loop loop
okay sorry typos
so autoplay basically tells the browser
when this when the webpage is finished
loading just play the music okay just
don't even wait for the user to click
play or anything just play it and loop
is basically when you get to the end of
the track just start it over again so
let's go back now and I'll save that
first and click refresh here and as soon
as I click refresh the music is going to
start playing and well I'll make it loop
I'll click on the end and I'll make it
loop again okay
so let's click refresh and as you can
see the music starts playing so if I go
ahead and I fast-forward this right to
the end okay as soon as it ends it's
going to jump right back to the
beginning and start playing okay so
that's what loop does that a loop just
makes it restart again and autoplay
basically makes it that as soon as the
webpage loads the song plays okay
now let me show you what happens if we
didn't include the controls tag or
controls attribute okay then that would
mean that we have no way of telling the
music to play or stop or pause or
anything so right now we've still got
the autoplay here and the loop okay so
now when I click refresh we're not going
to have this thing but the music's going
to play as soon as I click refresh okay
and I can't stop it
so yeah can I just need to delete it or
exit close it okay and that's actually
all I have for you guys in this video so
