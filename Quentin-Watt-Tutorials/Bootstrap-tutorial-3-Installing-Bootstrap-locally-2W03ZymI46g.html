here and this is bootstrap tutorial
number three and in this tutorial I am
going to show you guys how to download
bootstrap and add it to your website the
local way so this is if you want to
download bootstrap and actually have the
files on your server how you would
implement bootstrap onto your website
and this is actually the way I prefer
doing this just because I trust if the
website or if the hope files are on my
server that if my server doesn't go down
the files won't go down but let's say
for some reason a CDN goes down and is
unavailable my websites not going to
work even though my servers up which is
a bit of a disappointment so I don't
want that to happen and that's why I
would rather use a local version of
bootstrap okay so to download bootstrap
you're going to go over to get bootstrap
com click on the download button just
like we did in the previous video and
this is going to take us through to the
download page now I explained all of
these things in the previous video and
yeah we use the CDN lost in the last
video and in this video we're going to
take a look at how to use the minified
CSS and JavaScript files so go ahead and
click download that is going to download
a zip file for you and once that's done
you should have a zip file in your
downloads folder on your computer so
mine is over here bootstrap 3 point 3.2
distribution okay so if I go ahead and
open up my finder and we go over to my
downloads okay there we go that is the
zip file I can go ahead and unzip that
and I can use these files somewhere else
so what I'm going to do is actually open
up
this folder and I'm going to copy all
three of those folders it's a CSS folder
a fonts folder and a JavaScript folder
and I'm going to go over to my desktop
where I can't just click on my desktop
anymore
getting used to Mac is kind of hard for
me okay and I'm actually just going to
paste it in the same file or in the same
folder as my index file okay so I'm
actually still using the folder from the
previous tutorial and I'm going to go
ahead now and hit paste and that is
going to paste the CSS folder which has
a bunch of different CSS files okay
and you'll notice we've got the
bootstrap theme dot CSS we've also got
bootstrap theme dot min dot CSS and the
difference between these two is that
this is raw CSS you guys can open this
and read it and edit it if you like but
you actually really don't want to edit
these files these files are actually not
full editing so don't edit them but
maybe just read them take a look and see
how bootstrap works this is just the
theme and then the dot min version of
CSS if you guys ever try and open these
files up you're going to notice that the
code is all compressed and squashed up
and what they actually did was they just
took all the spaces out of the code and
many fired it so that is where this dot
min comes from in the name so they
minified the CSS file to be as small as
it could possibly be so it takes up the
least amount of space and it loads fast
on the server and that's why we will
more often use the dot min dot CSS files
just because they're smaller in size and
they're going to load a lot faster
because all the spaces were taken out ok
then we also have bootstrap CSS and
bootstrap dot min dot CSS again same
explanation for these two as we
have for these two okay if you want to
edit bootstrap or if you ever want to
read bootstrap you can go ahead and read
that file this file is going to be
pretty much unreadable okay fonts we've
got a few different fonts that bootstrap
actually provides such as icons etc so
if you guys ever want to make use of
these I'll probably explain them in a
future video and there's a bunch of
documentation on bootstraps website on
how to use those icons okay and the last
folder we have oviya contains all the
JavaScript files so we've got bootstrap
j/s and bootstrap Minjae s same
explanation that applied to the others
applies here if you want to read through
the JavaScript file and see how they
wrote their code you can go ahead and
read this one but the dot min version is
going to load faster and not only is it
going to load faster it's going to be
unreadable as well so there's a good
chance that no one will edit the dot min
J s file just because they won't be able
to read the code okay now one thing that
we're missing before we can actually
start hosting our local files is to
actually get a copy of jQuery okay so
what you need to do is go over to
jquery's website so instead of using
this CDN from Google what I actually did
was I went over to jquery's website
which is jQuery comm and I went to the
download page so jQuery comm /downloads
that's going to take you to this
downloads page where you can pick a
version of jQuery that you want so I'm
just going to go ahead and use the
compressed version of jQuery which is
the same as a minified version of those
other files that we were talking about
just now
so go ahead and click on this compressed
link that's going to open up a file
like this or a webpage like this and
this is just a JavaScript file or a
jQuery file that has been minified so
this is what a mini fide file looks like
there are no spaces at all it looks like
a bunch of gibberish no one's ever going
to edit this but it does load faster
which is a nice thing and that's why we
use these files on our website so go
ahead and hit ctrl a and I'm hitting
command a by the way come on C and that
is going to copy everything okay and you
can go over to your editor create a new
file and save this in the appropriate
place so I'm going to go ahead and hit
paste and that's pasted the entire
jQuery file or the contents of that
jQuery file and now we can save that and
I want to save it in tutorial one and
I'm going to save it in this j/s folder
so let's call it jQuery dot n dot J s
okay and that is going to save our file
okay and we can now jump back over to my
find over here and as you can see I have
jQuery nsj inside of the same folder as
all of my bootstrap files so let's just
take a look at that one last time if I
go to my desktop and I go to tutorial
one we've got our index file we've got
our CSS folder fonts folder and J s
folder and in this J s folder that's
where I just saved my jQuery file okay
so everything is relative to this index
file okay so we're going to index file
here and if we want to go into one of
these folders we're just going to go
slash and the folder name okay so this
is where file paths are important
because now we
change all of these links to link to our
local files instead of linking to the
external file on the CDN so these href
s-- all need a change now okay and the
CSS files like we saw before are now no
longer on the CDN we've actually got
them hosted on our computer so I can go
ahead and remove everything from HTTP to
3.2.2 and that's going to leave us with
the correct file path because I pasted
all my folders in the same folder as my
index file okay if you guys pasted and
pasted them somewhere else you're going
to have to make sure your URL or your
href reflects that but as long as you've
pasted them in the same place
that I have in other words you pasted
them right here like this so we've got
index then we've got CSS fonts jeaious
if you did that perfect okay so let's go
back over to the script and we can do
the same thing over here get rid of
everything from HTTP to the version
number and let's just go ahead and put
that forward slash back in there so that
one actually needs to go into jes
because I saved it in the JavaScript
fault folder and I saved it as jQuery
dot minjae yes so that should work and
then one last one we just have to get
rid of that version number as well okay
and we're looking for the bootstrap
javascript file inside of the JavaScript
folder which is over there
okay so now if I hit command s that
should save everything and now we can go
ahead and test this out by jumping back
over to our file which i've already
closed
okay so let me open up this index dot
HTML file and if everything opens up and
works exactly like it did in the last
tutorial it means we've done everything
right so let me say open with Firefox
and immediately I can see something's
wrong here because we're not loading add
jQuery or we're not loading bootstrap
sorry so let's take a look at what might
be wrong we're going okay so these
slashes actually aren't supposed to be
there my mistake the whole time I'm
telling you to put them there and we
don't actually want them there okay so
slash having a slash beforehand means we
need to go back to the root directory
and then into a JavaScript folder so
that might work on a server and now it's
probably the proper way to do it on a
server but this is on my local machine
and on my desktop so we need a relative
file path meaning that everything needs
to be relative to our index file
so index files here the next thing we're
looking for is our CSS files which are
in the CSS folder so we're just going
CSS we're not using a forward slash at
all and then inside that CSS folder
we're looking for bootstrap Topman J's
etc okay so now that I don't have those
forward slashes this should work and
look at that look how fast that loaded
as well because it's on my local server
and now we can go ahead and click on
this and the button disappears as well
so everything that we did over here is
correct and now we are hosting our own
local version of bootstrap and jQuery
and that is all I have for you guys in
this video so don't forget to subscribe

or share this video it's really going to
help my channel grow and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
