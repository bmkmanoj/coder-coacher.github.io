here and welcome to this WordPress video
and in this video I'm going to talk
about what WordPress is and then I'm
going to talk a little bit about how it
works and how we can go about using it
as a front-end developer or as a
back-end developer or even just as a
user then I want to explain the
difference between wordpress.com and
wordpress.org and I'm going to talk
about who uses WordPress and then how we
can use WordPress to make money now I
know that the last question is probably
the most important one but let's start
off at the beginning with what is
WordPress so WordPress is a content
management system that is a CMS for
short this means that it allows you to
easily create and manage content on your
website without the fuss of having to
learn how to code but that doesn't mean
that WordPress is only for people who
can't code a common misconception that
people have about WordPress is that it's
some kind of WYSIWYG or some kind of
drag-and-drop editor where you just drop
your pictures and drop your content and
it just kind of like formats itself but
that is not the case in fact I'd say you
can divide WordPress into three
different parts so you can use WordPress
as a front-end designer when you are
creating WordPress themes but you can
use WordPress as a back-end developer
creating plugins that add extra
functionality to WordPress and you can
be a user in other words someone who
just wants to manage content on their
website like a blogger or a web site
admin and you don't even need to know
how to code you just simply write
articles or write pages and post them
and they will appear in the front-end of
WordPress
how does it work well as a blogger or a
content creator WordPress users can
easily create edit and manage pages and
posts through the WordPress admin
section now WordPress has one of the
most user-friendly interfaces of any CMS
out there and that is what has made
WordPress become one of the most popular
CMS in the
world in fact it is the most popular CMS
in the world the content is all stored
in a sequel database which is completely
separate from any of the website code so
that means that WordPress users can
easily export content from the rest of
the site in other words they can take
all their pages and move it over to
another site or if you want to change
the entire look and feel of your site
you can simply switch themes but you
won't lose any of the content which is
pretty awesome WordPress users can also
install plug-ins that add extra
functionality to WordPress so plugins
can range from something as simple as
allowing you to embed a YouTube video to
something a little bit more complicated
like turning your WordPress website into
an online shop or even turning WordPress
into a social network now let's take a
look at how it works as a front-end
developer so friends and developers have
the freedom to create WordPress themes
and manage the look and feel of the
WordPress site so all of these theme
files are coded in PHP CSS JavaScript
and HTML that means that you will need
to know all of those languages if you
want to create a theme you can also list
your WordPress themes on the wordpress
theme directory and if you feel that you
are your themes are good enough to sell
you can start selling the these themes
on external sites like theme forest or
some kind of other marketplace and
WordPress themes can sell for anything
between 30 and 50 dollars depending on
how good your theme is and how much
you're willing to offer so you can code
themes and actually make a pretty good
profit if you're using WordPress as a
back-end developer you will need to be
very comfortable with PHP and you can
use PHP to build plug-ins for WordPress
so you can build plugins that add extra
functionality to WordPress or plugins
that modify existing functionality of
WordPress so plugins can be something as
simple as allowing a user to easily
embed a YouTube video but they can range
to something a little bit more complex
like turning WordPress into an online
shop creating slideshows or even turning
WordPress into
a social network so as a plug-in
developer you're only limited by your
imagination and your capabilities when
it comes to coding let's take a look at
the difference between wordpress.com and
wordpress.org because even though these
websites have the same name and they're
owned by the same company they do two
entirely different things so if you are
a wordpress user if you're a blogger or
just someone who wants a free website
you can go over to wordpress.com where
you they'll host all your files and you
have access to a very basic very simple
version of WordPress and all you can do
is create and edit pages but you can't
actually edit any of the files you can't
edit the database and you won't be able
to build plug-ins but you can use
WordPress for free to build a website
for yourself wordpress.org is an
entirely different beast so you can go
over to wordpress.org download a free
full version of WordPress and install
that either on your local host on or on
any server that you want to host your
website on and you will have full access
to everything in WordPress so you can
modify and edit the database you have
access to modify and edit any WordPress
files which means that you can use this
version of WordPress to create your own
WordPress themes or your own WordPress
plugins let's take a quick look at who
uses WordPress so if you go over to
built with com this is a website that
allows you to find out what other
websites are built with and it gathers
statistics on the technologies used so a
quick look up of my website which is
Quinton what com reveals that I'm using
WordPress as a content management system
and if I click through to the global
trends I can see that almost or actually
38% of all websites that are built with
CMS's are built with WordPress that
means that WordPress is ranking way
higher than systems like Joomla and
Drupal and that over one third of the
world is actually using WordPress as a
CMS according to bolt
and in fact both with hasn't indexed
every single site in the world so there
are probably still a bunch of other
WordPress websites out there that we
don't even know about or that build with
doesn't even know about yeah but the
point here is that there are a lot of
people using WordPress if you want to
see a showcase of some of the websites
built with WordPress or some of the
people who were using WordPress you can
go over to wordpress.org / showcase to
see some examples of companies or
celebrities that are using WordPress for
their website now let's answer the
question that all of you have been
waiting to hear the answer to how can I
use WordPress to make money well as I
mentioned before you can build and sell
WordPress themes or plugins that you
have created so there are actually
entire businesses who are built around
this concept that they just build
WordPress themes and sell them ople
WordPress plugins and sell them the only
rule here is that all WordPress themes
or plugins listed on the WordPress
directory must be free so if you want to
sell plugins or if you want to sell
themes you have to host them on your own
site or you can upload them to a
third-party marketplace a common method
for selling themes is to have your theme
displayed on your own server somewhere
so hopefully somewhere on a subdomain
filled with demo content showing all of
the themes features or all of the
plugins features and then hopefully
potential clients can view that decide
whether they like it or not and then go
ahead and click a Buy button that you
have somewhere on the page and this Buy
button can then take them either to your
shop or to a third-party marketplace
where they can download all of the theme
or plugin files and install it onto
their own version of WordPress what a
lot of guys like to do with plugins is
actually create a lite version of the
plug-in and less that for free on the
wordpress directory and then have a pro
version of the plugin that people
actually have to purchase and buy and a
lot of people might like the lite
version of the plug-in so
much that they choose to buy the pro
version because it has a few extra
features that they want to use but if
you don't know how to code WordPress
themes and you don't know how to code
WordPress plugins you can still make
money from WordPress by simply selling
somebody a wordpress site so in other
words if you know somebody who wants a
website go ahead and build a WordPress
website for them so download a version
of WordPress pick a theme throw in some
content and charge them for the amount
of time it took you to set that website
up for them if you liked that video
there are a bunch of things that you can
do to help first of all don't forget to
subscribe watch another one of my videos
follow me on social media and if you
want to support the channel financially
you can also become a patron becoming a
patreon means that you're going to
choose to help me pay for some of the
equipment and the software that I use to
make these videos and also hopefully
help me finish my degree so go ahead and
click on something and I'll see you guys
