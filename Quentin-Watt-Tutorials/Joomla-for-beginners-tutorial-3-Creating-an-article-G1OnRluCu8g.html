here and in this video I'm going to show
you how to create a new article in
Joomla so I've got my current
installation of Joomla open in my
browser and this is the installation
that we installed pretty much tutorials
ago I haven't actually changed anything
but you can see that we have this
article showing up on the web page over
here so this is an article and the
article heading is getting started okay
so that is how we know that this is an
article and we also have a little menu
on the right-hand side over here that
says latest articles getting started so
that is the one and only article that we
have on our website at the moment so if
I click on that it's going to take me
straight back yet
but now let's take a look at how to
actually add a new article in Joomla so
you're going to have to go over to the
backend of Joomla and of course
hopefully you guys know how to get here
but of course you have to login and all
that good stuff and then you can go over
to content article manager and I could
have just gone straight to add new
article but I just wanted to go into the
article manager so that I could show you
guys that right now we have one article
which is called getting started and I'm
going to go ahead and click the new
button here and we can create a new
article okay and whenever you create a
new article in Joomla you have to give
it a title so let me just say something
like my first article and then we'll
also give this article some text pretty
good to just maybe throw in a heading so
I'm going to use this text editor here
to just pick a heading and we'll go for
a heading two and we'll just say hey
everyone and then once I hit enter you
can see that the formatting has changed
back to paragraph and I say this is my
first Joomla article okay now
I actually have an article that I can go
ahead and save one thing that I actually
want to show you guys is if I go ahead
and click on source code you can see
that it actually shows me the source
code for the website or just the source
code that is going to be displayed for
this article and you can see I've
actually got one too many paragraphs
over here so I can go ahead and remove
that and then just have a heading and a
paragraph underneath that and I'm also
going to show you guys in the future how
to make a editor in Joomla that's a
little bit better than this so you can
edit straight in code rather than have
to open up this little window okay but
we'll get to that whenever we start
talking about plugins okay right now
I've got my article I could go ahead and
give that a category but I don't have
any categories at the moment so the only
one I can choose is uncharacterized
featured will allow me to feature the
article or not feature the article so
I'm just going to go ahead and leave it
at unfilled but we do want to keep this
status as published and the access as
public if you change any of that stuff
it might not show up on the front end of
the website depending on whether you're
logged in a lot to the back end and that
kind of thing okay and then we can also
set a whole bunch of permissions and
stuff here although I'm not going to
worry about that too much let's go ahead
and just click Save and now you can see
we've auto-generated an alias so that
wasn't there a minute ago
but now we have an alias and that is
just how we get to the article in the
URL up here okay but now that we've got
this article saved let me go ahead and
refresh my browser and you can see that
under latest articles I now have a new
link to an article called my first
article so I'm going to go ahead and
click on that and you can see that I now
have an article over here which has my
title my first article and that is
the title we put up here okay we also
have the content which is a header and a
paragraph and we did put indeed put a
header and a paragraph over here so
that's what's showing up okay and if we
take a look at the URL in the top of the
browser over here you can see that we
have a how will an alias showing up of
my - first - article and that's actually
what we have in our alias over there so
those are kind of all the things that
you can see in the front end okay and we
can also add images and a whole bunch of
cool stuff like that so let me go ahead
and insert an image and here I have to
actually put in the image source and the
description of the image okay which is
kind of annoying but what I could do is
go ahead and click on image down here
and this is going to allow me to pick an
image from my Joomla installation so
right now in my images folder in Joomla
I've got banners headers sample data and
all of this other default joomla stuff
which is actually just joomla logos okay
and i could go ahead and just pick any
image i guess
insert that and now we've got an image
over there
and if we save that and go back to the
front end of the site and click refresh
then we should have the image show up
over here as well so that is pretty cool
and that is how you create an article in
Joomla okay
now let's take a look at this little
side thing over here which is the status
and right now it's set to published
which means anyone can see it it's going
to be visible on the front end of the
website if we say unpublished that means
nobody's going to be able to see it
unless they log into the back end and
one to maybe edit the article so that's
me
if you're writing an article and you're
not quite done yet you might want to
just leave it as unpublished archived is
going to be really old articles that
people probably aren't reading on your
website anymore
just want to archive them and trashed
will obviously trash the article let's
go ahead and change that back to
published I'm going to close this and a
cool way to publish and unpublish
articles is to actually just go ahead
and click on the tick and you can see
that that changes to an X so that means
that the article is now unpublished so
if I go back over to the front end of
the slide over here you can see I got a
404 error because technically this my
first article doesn't exist anymore
okay and you can see that the link kind
of disappeared from latest articles and
if I go ahead and publish that again
and come back here and refresh the
article should show up again and we
should be able to visit it again as well
so hey look at that that's pretty
awesome so that's just a quick way of
publishing and unpublishing articles you
can also go ahead and feature them by
adding in this little star or you could
archive and trash them by just clicking
on that arrow okay so that is how to
create articles and also manage articles
in Joomla and that is all I have for you

really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
