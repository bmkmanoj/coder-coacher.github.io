here and welcome to tutorial number ten
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about inserting stuff into your
tables in other words adding a new row
to your table but before we get started
with this tutorial I just want to send a
huge set shout-out to my sponsors at dev
Mountain so dev Mountain is a coding
bootcamp and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to become a
web developer an iOS developer or a UX
designer within 12 weeks so if you are
looking to make career change
go ahead and check out their website the
link is in the video description below
and if you do contact them make sure to
tell them that I thank you
right so now let's take a look at how to
insert stuff into our tables and I think
for this example we can take a look at
the users table so let's go ahead and
click on that and one of the things
you're going to want to make sure you
can do or make sure you know before
trying to insert stuff into a table is
how many columns you have in that table
and what values need to go where right
so it is very important that you study
your sequel or your SQL table so let's
click on users and yeah if I take a look
at my table structure over here you can
see that I have an ID I have a username
a password a user email a first name and
a last name but here's a really
important detail is my ID which is also
my primary key has been set to auto
increment which means that if I don't
specify a value for my ID it's going to
automatically increment to a new number
now that is a very important detail yeah
so just make sure that you know what's
in your table and also which values have
Auto increment set and you know if there
is an auto full value somewhere along
the line that you know what that auto
fill value does right so in this case
auto increment is is something that we
need be aware of and let's go over to
browse and that's going to let me see
the table so I can kind of see that my
ID has an ID that is always Auto
increment
it and yeah if I don't specify a value
for my ID the next number is going to
just be 16 username you can see that we
fill in usernames here and it doesn't
seem to be any kind of rule except for
the fact that none of these have spaces
but yeah then after that we've got the
username and user names kind of just
seem to be a bunch of characters so yeah
not too many rules their passwords same
thing user email obviously that's just
an email address first name and last
name and these are actually allowed to
be blank so now that we kind of know the
table and we're kind of familiar with
the table let's go over to the SQL tab
and actually start typing some code so
let's type in the query and in this case
I want to type in insert into and those
are going to be your caps because those
are SQL keywords now this next part is
probably gonna be easier if I just type
it out and then explain it to you once
I'm done but basically you need to put
in a table name so table open up some
parentheses and yeah basically put in
some columns so each one of these is
going to be a column and you're going to
separate each column with a comma and
then you're going to type in a keyword
values so values is an SQL keyword so
it's important that you type that in
there I always learn on work and then
open up another pair of brackets or
parentheses and you can end off your
query with a semicolon although I
haven't actually been doing that for
most of my tutorials so yeah then in the
values parentheses you're also going to
need to add in some values and each one
of these values has to be separated with
a comma now the important thing is
whatever value you put in here has to
line up with whatever field you choose
to add over here so we can get our
columns from this tab of year because
I'm using my
but let's pretend we weren't using my
sequel and we couldn't actually see this
stuff yeah I kind of told you guys are
ready to study your database so you need
to know what values you need to put in
here and basically there are six columns
in this table so I can add in six values
for the first one will be ID second will
be username password comma lock next one
will be user underscore email then first
underscore name and last underscore name
is there another one over here
no there isn't great okay and then for
values like I said any value that I put
in here has to correspond with the value
or the column number over here so in
this case an ID is going to be
whatever's next in the column password
okay username is going to be whatever
the user's name is that one will be
password so that's whatever we want to
use for the password the next one will
be user email first name and last name
so all of those kind of need a lineup
now something I did kind of mentions you
guys already is that ID has been set to
auto increment so actually I don't need
to supply ID as an argument here which
means I don't need to have it over here
either and that's just going to mean
that ID is going to automatically add
itself and it's automatically going to
increase from whatever the previous
number was so I'm going to not put that
in here and now let's put in user name
so for the user name I'll put in brad
and for the is that password let's just
make and make up some random password
like pass 1 2 3 4 for the user email we
can just make him brad at fake mail.com
for the first name he can be
Brad and the last name he can be guard
or something like that so let's copy
this now and hopefully I haven't made
any errors so let's hit go and there is
something insert into table ahaha
there we go right so I basically didn't
put in what table I want to insert this
into so uses that is very important
because obviously if we don't have that
there this doesn't work right so now
let's copy this and hit go and hopefully
that works so insert into users and then
these values and now I can go ahead and
check that by either browsing my table
or running a query to see if it's read
so if I browse the table I can see I now
have a 16th user by the way I didn't
supply ID so you can see that that
automatically got filled in then we have
the name which was the username that I
selected password obviously the password
that I selected email was the one that I
selected and first name and last name or
the two that I put in my query so that
query seems to have executed perfectly
and everything is in place now if you
guys have to have stuff jumbled around
it's obviously because you jumbled
around your field names when you ran the
query now just before I end of this
tutorial I want to send a huge shout out

or more every single month and that goes
a long way to helping me make more
