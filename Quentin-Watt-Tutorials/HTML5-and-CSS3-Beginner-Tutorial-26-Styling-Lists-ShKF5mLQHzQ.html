to tutorial number 26 and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
about styling lists in HTML so the first
thing that we have to do is create an
unordered list on our web page so let's
go ahead and UL and ending UL and inside
here we're gonna have to make some list
elements or list items and I guess we
should probably just make a list of
things that I'm interested in so the
first thing that I'm interested in is
games because I could play xbox
literally the whole day like that's how
much I love gaming and then web design
and web development just because if I
wasn't interested in that you guys would
not be able to watch any of my videos
because they probably wouldn't exist and
then I guess graphic design now I'm not
a graphic designer
and I'm probably no good at graphic
design but I like to look at other
people's work and just admire it for
being good so now we go ahead and save
that and run this in Firefox and you can
see we get a normal plain old standard
boring list with the normal plain old
standard boring bullet points over there
okay and now what we can do is we can
actually change what bullet points go
next to our list because we've gone
through changing colors and all of that
kind of stuff so I don't want to bore
you guys with changing colors again
we're actually gonna style that bullet
point so go back to notepad plus plus
and you'll go back to your style sheet
and what we can do now is just select
our unordered list and inside the curly
braces over here go ahead and type in
this property that's called
list-style-type okay and that is what
allows us to change what bullet points
go next
list so right now it's like the standard
one but we can change this to circle and
if we save that and then refresh it in
our webpage you get a nice empty looking
circle instead of that bullet point and
we could also change this to square and
you get then get a fold in square take a
look it's it's not a bullet point it's a
fold in square but you know that's
that's interesting at all but what if we
wanted to make more customizable or more
attractive looking bullet points you
know instead of using like these
standard boring ones okay what you could
do then is use the list style style
image property to set an image to sit
next to our list style type or our list
items okay so to put an image there
you'll have to type in the word a URL
and in brackets and inside quotation
marks top in the file that you want to
use as your image okay so I've got an
image in a folder called images and it's
called smiley dot PNG okay and when I
save this and I go back to Firefox and
click refresh you can see we now have a
cool smiley next to all of our list
items instead of those boring old bullet
points so that's actually a lot cooler
and a lot more interesting to look at
when you go to our website and that's
how you can make your lists a little bit
more customizable but what happens if
you wanted a list and you didn't want to
have any bullet points next to you the
list at all okay what you could then do
is again it's the list style type this
style type and you could just set this
equal to none and when you save this and
then refresh in Firefox you'll see you
have no
bullet point there at all but as you can
see our list slow gets pushed up like
towards the middle of the page and
that's because by default a list always
has padding on the left to allow for
those bullet points to show so we can go
back to our unordered list chair and we
can just set the padding equal to zero
pixels and when we save this and refresh
our list is now going to jump over to
the side of the window look at that
pretty cool huh so that's actually all I
have for you guys in this tutorial and I
hope you guys found it helpful so I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial I
would appreciate it a lot if you guys
