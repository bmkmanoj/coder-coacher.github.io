back to tutorial number 36 and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you guys what to
put inside of your section but before we
go ahead and start that I should
probably just explain some things to you
guys and the first thing is there's
quite a few guys below my commenting
below my videos saying you have a really
nice accent where are you from and
that's really nice of you guys but uh
I'm from South Africa so you know just
thought I'd let you guys all know at
once so then you don't have to answer
this question 150,000 times but yeah so
that's where I'm from just in case you
were wondering what my accents funny and
then the next thing is actually a little
bit more tutorial related and this image
over here in my previous tutorial I
wasn't actually using an image so it
just displayed the words logo underscore
image or just logo image I don't know
where about the underscore from but yeah
okay so logo image but since then I
actually went ahead and I put this image
inside of there so let me just large
icons okay so I put that image inside of
there now so if if we run this in
Firefox now you can see we get an actual
logo and I actually really made this
tutorial a couple minutes ago but then I
realized I made a big mistake so I had
to re-record it now
so anyways there we go that's my website
for now but now we need to go ahead and
work inside of the section so as you can
see inside of our section right now is
just a comment that says next tutorial
and that was written in the previous
tutorial so now it's the next tutorial
and we can go ahead and delete that and
get started on our section so let me
just start off by explaining what your
section is okay your section is like the
main article or the main
yeah well basically the main article of
your website so that's pretty much why
the users came to your webpage they
wanted to see what was in your section
so if you were writing a story about
cats then your story about cats would be
over here inside of an article and that
kind of gives away what we have to put
inside of our section and that is an
article tag already cool and then we
have to end our article off article I
yeah I can really not type today so
article and inside of our article we
have to start our article off with the
header because I guy you guys never ever
went to websites or read a story in a
newspaper that didn't start off with a
header to attract your attention it's
just that's how the things are you have
to start off with the header so go ahead
and Hitler and inside of our header we
can go ahead and add in heading one and
for this we'll have to say something
that is really gonna grab the users
attention like they're gonna want to
look at that and then read the article
so we might as well just say hey look
here stupid and that's pretty much got
their attention they now looked at that
and they're like oh my gosh you're
calling me stupid okay let me read some
more you know so oh maybe they would
maybe they just feel insulted now
they're running away so now we can put a
sub header underneath our main header
and we can be a little bit more kind in
this one and say please read me it's
what I'm here for
it's here what I am for okay I'll go
with that
I don't know why I typed that but that's
what I typed so you would and
what I want to do now is because we've
used two headers right next to each
other when our browser starts reading
through this
page and displaying it to the user it
kind of thinks okay is this the header
or is this the header and it gets a
little bit confused so what you actually
have to do is you have to surround both
of these tags in something called an age
group if I can get this right H group
there we go
cool finally got it and we'll end our H
group off over here okay just breathe H
group
there we go cool so we can highlight
that and push tab and then it indents it
for us which is pretty cool just in case
you're wondering how I did that and now
as you can see we've got this great
header inside of our article and I mean
this is really gonna attract it users
attention after they see this they're
really gonna want to read our article
and like I said whenever we had more
than one header we had to group them
inside of a H group just to tell our
browser that that is all one big group
of headings and what we can do now is
after our article we need to go ahead
and write a story because to be honest
no one's really going to be happy coming
to your web page and only seeing those
two headers they're gonna want to read
some story so let's go ahead and make a
story over there and we can put that
inside a paragraph and for our story we
can probably just say this is my story
the cat sat on the mat the end cool so
that is like the best story ever written
right there that is like Oscar material
but anyways so now what we can do is
beneath our story once we finish writing
our story we can then add in a footer
and whatever goes inside our footer is
basically just like who the story was
maybe written by or the date that the
story was written on so we
and in that footer and if you were
writing like a news website or something
I got then you probably like to have the
data and then the article I mean the
yeah the person who wrote the article as
well but I'm just gonna write my name
for now so we'll just say written by
Quinton what variety cool save that and
now we've got this really interesting
article that you know like everyone's
gonna come to our website and read this
because it's like the best article in
the world but we can actually add quite
a few different articles to our website
so we don't actually just have to have
this we can go ahead and let's just go
ahead and copy that and we can have a
second article livia
so we might as well be a little bit more
kind in this one and we'll just say hey
handsome and please okay well please
read me
I was lack of creativity over there okay
we'll just write story time just like
that and written by Quinton Watts cuz I
write all the stories on one website you
know cool so now when we go back to
Firefox you can see that our section
which was actually above the side news
so it's actually appear over here when I
click refresh I am there it is okay so
that is our section and our section says
hey look ya stupid so there we go that's
our article and underneath our section
we've got our recent news and then we've
got our main footer but like I said at
the end of the previous tutorial this
isn't the final website no one's really
gonna want to come and look at this so
in the next couple of tutorials I'm
still going after you show you guys how
to style your website and actually how
to get this a side section which is
supposed to be on the side to get to be
on
because right now it's just sitting here
underneath everything and that's not
where it's supposed to be so that's what
you guys have got forward to look or
that's what you guys have got to look
forward to in the next tutorial uh-huh

kind of a tongue twister right there and
