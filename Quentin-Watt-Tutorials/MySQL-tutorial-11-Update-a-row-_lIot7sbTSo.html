here and welcome to tutorial number 11
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about how to update stuff in
SQL so this is going to be very similar
to the insert tutorial except okay there
are quite a few syntax differences but
the concept is pretty much the same
you're going to need to look over your
database and make sure that you know
exactly what fields are in your database
and what you want to update before you
go ahead and start running queries so
yeah just make sure that you run it run
of your database and make sure that you
are familiar with it now let's take a
look at how to update stuff using my
sequel so yeah in this tutorial like I
said you're kind of going to want to
make sure that you know what your
database looks like so let's go over to
my users database here and I'm just
going to look over the database
structure real quick so again we have
six columns ID username password user
email first name and last name ID has
been set to auto increment so we're not
probably not gonna want to fiddle around
with that too much we might want to
change user names or passwords or emails
and first names so those are things that
typically might get changed on our
website I just want you guys to also
notice that some of these values are set
to not Nell which means that you can't
set them equal to nothing I don't think
I mentioned that in the previous
tutorial but yeah if something set to
not know you cannot set it equal to no
value it has to have a value right so
now that you guys know about that and
let's actually look at writing some
sequel code so actually let's browse the
table real quick and let's say I have
this user Quinton and I want to change
his user name to Quinton instead of
Quinton 92 well in order to do that I
just need to run a little update query
so let's clear this and type in my
update query so the update query goes
like this it goes updates
and then uses so update and then
whatever table you're looking to update
so in this case I want to update the
users table and then you add in another
keyword which is a sequel keyword or an
SQL keyword set so set obviously tells
us what value to set where and then you
can put in the column that you want to
set or change and then set that value
equal to whatever it is that you want to
set that value equal to so in this case
let's change Quinton's username from
Quinton ninety two to Quinton now if I
run the query just like this it's going
to run through the entire table and
change everybody's username to Quinton
obviously that's not cool I don't want
to do that but what I do want to do is
add in a little we're close to make sure
that I only update this way if the ID is
equal to Quinton's ID which happens to
be one so let's add in a way close here
and set the ID equal to one now make
sure you run it with the where Clause
because if you run it without the where
Clause you might get into a little bit
of trouble where you update in the wrong
place right and make sure that you have
the ID of the person correct as well I
happen to know that the ID of the person
I want to change it is one so let it go
and there we go my query has been
successfully run so if I go back to the
Browse tab over here I can see that I
have now successfully changed Quinton's
username from Quinton 92 to Quinton and
let's see if I can change my email
address and my user name and my first
name all at the same time so let's come
back here place that query in here and
updating multiple values is as simple as
just adding an extra value in here with
a comma I think a comma is the right one
but
let's just see alright I'll add a value
here and then if there's a mistake
we'll see it alright so let's change my
username from Quinton back to Quinton 92
and then let's also change my user email
use an email to something else so I
think right now sits like business
Quinton what a quintic Quinton at this
business acquaintance what something I
yeah but let's just change that to
Quinton at mmm
not exist calm so that'll be a different
email address and then let's also change
my first name first underscore name from
Quinton to cue dog something like that
right so let's copy this and hopefully
this is going to work it it go and query
successful right so yeah I can go back
to the Browse tab over here and take a
look if my changes have taken place and
you can see that my username has now
changed and we've got we've changed it
from Quinton back to Quinton 92 we also
changed my user email from business at
Quinton watts to Quinton at not exist
calm and I've also managed to change my
first name from Quinton to Q dog and all
of that was as simple as just adding in
a comma and then adding the next value
that I want to change and setting a
value for that so yeah it is a fairly
straightforward and I think what I want
to do is maybe just change my name back
to Quinton and my email address can
change back to business at Quinton what
calm yeah so you guys can go ahead and
play it with the update queries and see
if you can get this right make sure that
you're always using
we're closed because if you play around
with this without using away clause and
if your weight loss has a bad value or a
wrong value set to this then you might
actually update stuff that you don't
want to update so yeah
just be careful with that and now that I
have warned you let it go and see what
happen right all of this is back to how
used to be right so before I end off
