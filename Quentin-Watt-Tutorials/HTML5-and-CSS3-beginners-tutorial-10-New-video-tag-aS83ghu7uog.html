here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about the new video tag in
html5 again
this tag is new to html5 so there could
be some issues regarding browser support
okay so some users that are using older
browsers might not have support for this
video tag so just keep that in mind when
using this video tag okay so to add a
video tag onto the web page we're
obviously just going to put in our two
little symbols for our tag and we're
going to type in video okay and this is
a double tag so we're actually going to
close it off as well and in between here
I'm going to put in another tag which is
a the source tag okay and as you can see
this is very much the same as in the
previous tutorial when we added some
audio to our web page okay so the one
thing we have to do now is just in case
the user is using an old browser that
does not support this video tag we are
going to have to leave them a message so
if we type a message and over here if
the video tag works the user won't see
this message but if the video tag
doesn't work in other words they have an
old browser then the user is going to
see this message so let's just say if
you can see this you need to update your
browser okay
okay so now we've got all the tags and
this message out the way there are still
a few attributes that we have to work
with okay so the first one is the source
attribute and we actually have to tell
HTML what video we plan on using in this
video tag okay so I've actually got this
video here to mp4 and I suggest you use
mp4 because they are probably the most
widely supported video type so we're
going to just use this little gameplay
video so let's go back in type that in
Lowell underscore gameplay dot mp4 now I
should probably close that off as well
there's another attribute which we can
use here called type and basically what
type has to be set equal to is just what
type of video are we using okay we just
need to tell the browser what video it
should be expecting and it's obviously
going to be a video slash mp4 okay
because the video is in mp4 so we're
just going to say a Firefox listen up
expect mp4 okay now there are still a
few other attributes that we need to
work with okay so we're going to put
those up here in the video tag and the
first one is going to be the width of
what we want the video to display as
okay so YouTube actually uses 640 as the
width so I'll use 640 on my video as
well and for height we can set that
equal to 360 so this is just going to
make sure that the video is 640 pixels
wide and 360 pixels high okay and that's
pretty much the same
sighs as a normal video on YouTube okay
and then we've got one other attribute
which we need to work with at the moment
and that is the controls attribute
without this we wouldn't be able to play
our video at all
okay so let's go ahead and save this now
okay and run this in Firefox and as you
can see we've got this video over here
and there's a little play button and
whatever so we've got some controls here
okay if we didn't include this controls
attribute so let me go ahead and take
this out go back here again click
refresh now you can see we don't have
any control so we have no way of
starting this video so we actually need
that controls attribute okay unless we
want to make our own controls but then
we need to know a little bit of
JavaScript first okay so let's go ahead
and click refresh and as you can see
we've got the controls back so when I
click play the video will start playing
I know you there okay so that's just me
talking while I was playing League of
Legends now there are two other
attributes that we can use okay so let
me go back here and just add those in as
well
and the first one is going to be
autoplay and the next one will be loop
okay so what autoplay does is it just
means that as soon as the user loads the
webpage the video must start playing
okay and loop loops the video so as soon
as the video gets the end it's going to
start at the beginning again and carry
on going okay so loop might be kind of
annoying for some people because once
they finish watching the video they're
probably not going to want to watch it
again but also play
on YouTube if you go to if you click on
a video the usually the video always
plays automatically so they would then
be using an autoplay attribute on their
videos okay so let's go back to Firefox
now and when I click refresh because
we've got to autoplay attributes this
video will start playing as soon as the
video or as soon as the page has loaded
so let me click refresh and as you can
see as you can see the video actually
played okay now if I fast forward this
right to the end and then I'll let it
play again then it should start again
from the beginning because we have the
loop attribute as well okay so as you
can see it went from the end right back
to the beginning so that's what loop
does okay so you don't actually have to
use all of these attributes controls I
would recommend you use that for now
until maybe we learn some JavaScript but
for now just always use controls
autoplay and loop you don't have to use
both of them you can just use one or the
other but I just show them to you both
to save time okay so thank you very much
for watching guys that's all I have for
you in this video don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share the video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
