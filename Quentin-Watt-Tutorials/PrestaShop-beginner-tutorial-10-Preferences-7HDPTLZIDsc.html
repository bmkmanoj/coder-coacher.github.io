here and welcome to PrestaShop tutorial
number 10 and in this video I am
actually gonna run through a whole bunch
of different options in the Preferences
tab so I'm going to show you guys just
some general settings and some settings
about orders and products etc so log in
to PrestaShop and we'll go from there so
I'm gonna take a look at this
preferences tab over here and the first
menu item or sub menu item that we can
see over here is general and under
general this is where we get to change
some general settings about our shop so
yeah quite conveniently named isn't it
but the first option that we have over
here is to enable SSL so that's if you
want to use HTTPS or not and I should
probably show you then the front end
okay contracts you see the URL but yeah
this is gonna help you just make your
site look a little bit more secure
because often people won't want to give
their credit card details out to a
website that is not using HTTPS because
like yeah it's my credit card details
and I really rather not be scammed out
of some money so yeah just make sure
that that's always ticked you can force
SSL on all pages you don't have to set
this to yes because by default I think
we will only be using SSL if we're
signed in and if you're not signed in it
going to be using SSL until you do so
yeah I think that is the option but I
might be wrong yeah and then increase
front office security that is obviously
always or should always be set to yes
because you want your store to be as
secure as possible
I would only disable this if like
there's some real reason like your
hosting provider which if you're not
hosted by priest shops cloud if your
hosting provider is
got some difficulties and it has to do
with something in this front office
security then disable it but really I
wouldn't disable it until you have like
some major issue in your site's not
working you know okay we've also got the
OP the option to allow iframes so by
default PrestaShop always sits this - no
because like I I frame czar kind of
updated and not too many people use them
nowadays
but then there are always those
developers out there that still want to
use iframes and if you ever try add an
iframe to an HTML box in PrestaShop
PrestaShop is just gonna clean that out
it's gonna delete it and you'll wonder
why your iframes are not saving you need
to come back over here just enable this
option and then PrestaShop will stop
deleting the iframes okay HTML purifier
this kind of falls in the same category
as that iframes thing basically by
default PrestaShop will purify or
validate your HTML now this is set to
yes by default for people who don't know
HTML and like shouldn't be messing stuff
up but for people who are developers
like me I can find these things to be
quite annoying sometimes because I'll
code something in HTML because that's
how I want to displayed and then press
the shop will just go ahead and delete
the HTML that I coded so yeah like I
would set that to no but again like if
you don't know anything about HTML maybe
just leave that as yes okay round mode
so you can choose like how you want your
numbers to be rounded and you can also
choose if you want your manufacturers
and bestsellers to be displayed and I'm
not gonna go into multi-store because it
is kind of like a complicated thing like
most stores were always only going to be
having one store but there is always
that like one guy
who has multiple storefronts and only
once one store back in
PrestaShop is capable of handling this
but I'm not gonna go into that in this
video you'll have to just wait for a
future video or something but yeah just
know that that option is there and we
can set this to yes but I'm gonna go
ahead now and move over to the orders
page because I've already saved that as
I wanted it okay so on the orders page
over here we're able to change the order
process type and by default this is a
standard five-step process now if I show
you guys in the front end what this
looks like I'll just go over to my
product page and hit check out and
that's going to take me to the checkout
page and by default you can see we've
got our five-step process
summary sign in address shipping and
payment so those five steps right and
you can change this to a one-page
checkout so I'm gonna save this and I'll
show you guys what that one page
checkout looks like as well let's go
back here or now checkout just reload
the page okay and now you can see we've
got the one-page checkout which instead
of like going Next Next Next Next
through all the steps we just have our
summary up here and then we've got all
the forms and stuff that we need to fill
in over here and everything is all on
one page and you can see it's asking me
to sign in in some places but yeah like
all the information is on the one page
so we don't have to go next next next
next next whatever but sometimes like
seeing a form like this can be
overwhelming for clients and I think
generally most people who are running
online shops try to keep everything
simple and they just want one form or
just like a small about a amount of
information for the customer to submit
at a time and that's where this standard
5 step process comes into
bleh so I would actually leave that on
there as default I wouldn't change that
then there's other options over here as
well like guest checkout which I would
leave to no because if someone's signing
in or trying to check out as a guest
you're maybe not going to have all the
information you need from them and I
know they can fill in the form like
their contact information and their
delivery address but like why not just
create an account and then we have your
record or your information on record and
you have an account with us permanently
you know so I would just leave that at
no then reordering this just allows the
customers to reorder so in other words
like they can go back to their order
history and then just reorder and order
if that makes sense I hope it does yeah
so basically just order something that
they've ordered before right
and then you've got delayed shipping
you've also got some tax options
terms of service you'd want to leave
that as yes so they need to tick your
Terms of Service box and also they can
go through to the Terms of Service page
where they can like read and agree to
your terms and conditions so I'm going
to leave all of that as it is let's just
take a look at PDF settings over here so
yeah you have the option of yes or no
just to display your product image on
the invoice or on the delivery slip and
it's actually less to print if you're
going to print delivery slips and
invoices there's also less stuff on the
page so it's just gonna make the invoice
look simple if it's all set to no but if
you really want that image on the
invoice page you can go ahead and change
that to yes then we've also got gift
wrapping options and gifting options if
you want customers to be able to send
gifts from your store you can always
enable these options but I'll leave that
up to you guys and I'm just gonna move
on to the next section which is products
sorry if I'm rushing through everything
but
I kind of recorded this tutorial earlier
and it was like 25 minutes long or
something stupid which yeah I can't make
a tutorial that long okay so let's take
a look at products and this is where we
get to choose if we want our online
store to be a store or just a catalog so
if we enable this catalog mode and you
can hover over the title over here and
it'll always give you a description of
what's gonna happen but if you enable
this it basically this allows the option
to check out it this allows the option
to add to cart or anything like that so
it removes all the shopping features
from your store and basically if clients
wanna order from your store they'd have
to come to your website look for the
product or like oh yeah I really want
that thing and then phone you find out
where branches and then come buy from
your physical store instead of ordering
online and there are a lot of people out
there and a lot of websites out there
that do this just because they want the
catalog online so people can search
through and decide like whether they
like the products or not and then just
come into the store and buy one so yeah
you have the option of doing that if you
want to or you can always just see that
at no product comparison kind of
self-explanatory you can compare more
than three products at a time if you
change this or you can change this to
less than three products all so on and
yeah like there's nothing more to that
right number of days in which a product
is considered new what I would do is
maybe change that to 31 and so that way
a new product will display in the front
end of the store for a whole month
instead of just 20 days and yeah like
just these are all personal preference I
guess so you don't have to fill in what
I fill in but yeah it's all it's all up
to you okay redirect after adding to
cart you can redirect to the cart
summary page or you can redirect to the
previous page now this is something that
I was kind of annoyed about before so
I'm gonna say that the previous page
because like when you add something to
your cart and press the shop for some
reason it's yeah like for this exact
reason you've yeah it's directing you to
your cart summary instead of back to the
products see you land up going into your
cart summary and not shopping anymore if
that makes sense
so I'm going to leave that at previous
page and then you can also play around
with these other settings over here like
max size of a short description and
quantity of discounts which do you want
to be based on products or combinations
etc pagination this is kind of also a
self explanatory after twelve products
you're gonna have to hit a Next button
to see the other twelve products I guess
but you could always set this to 200 if
you like it just means that the page is
gonna load really slowly so I wouldn't
do that it's also going to be like
overwhelming like clients with products
so yeah like it's just easier they see
twelve or ten products at a time hit
next and they see the next twelve ten
products at a time you know whatever
option you put in here okay ordering
type you can set that to name or to
price or to anything else over here I
think price or name is kind of the most
logical but that is just my personal
opinion some people like to go by
manufacturer or product inside the
category or something so yeah it's all
up to you okay yeah product page again
all these different options that you
guys can play with and I'll let you take
a look at all of them and decide what
all you want to to change over here okay
let's get over to customers now and here
is just some information about how
customers register for your site or some
options about how customers register for
your site
only account creations they can create
an account or standard account creation
and address creation which means they
can add the addresses when they sign up
to the store but they can also add
addresses when checking out so I think
we can just leave it like that by
default so they can sign in they don't
have to worry about giving us their
address information until I've actually
bought something ok
then phone number is mandatory so this
is when they're signing up do you want
their phone number to be mandatory and I
would say yes because if they ever pull
something in wrong by mistake or they
are not at their address that they put
in on the order form you'll be able to
phone them and contact them and just
find out where they are yeah and
basically a whole bunch of other options
like newsletter registration and enable
opt-in opt-out I would just leave all of
this stuff as default there's no need to
change any of this unless you really
want to like people don't want your
newsletter you're not offering a
newsletter or something then said that
no okay and then from here let's take a
look at CMS and CMS is all of the pages
on your website that are not products so
you can see that by default we have a
few pages over here delivery legal
notice terms and conditions about us etc
and we can change or edit all of these
pages and then something that I edited
just a little while ago was this a
badass page so I just went ahead and hit
edit if you guys didn't see that okay
and here I'm editing the about Us page
so we've got the major title etc etc but
this is all of the information that
appears on the about Us page and if I go
to the front end of my store and I
scroll all the way down to the footer
and we have a link to the about Us page
and I'm going to click on that and
you'll see here is all the information
that we see over here right and I added
this Quinton was here content a little
while ago when I was recording this
tutorial for the first time and I'm just
gonna remove that content and let's hit
save and if I come back over here and I
just wait for that to finish loading
I can hit refresh and that's going to
refresh my page and you can see that now
Quinton was here has now been removed so
if you ever want to edit content it
ready is that easy
okay and yeah obviously you can always
add more CMS pages or delete the CMS
pages you're not using okay and the last
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is store contacts and I think if we go
to the front end of here and go to our
stores that's the first link or not the
first link but yeah the only link that I
know of then you can see that we've got
some information about your stores over
here there's a map and if you click on
these stores you've got an address
you've got some opening times and a
person's name okay and if you take a
look over here in the backend you can
see we've got people's name we've got
the address
we've got zip codes and we've got GPS or
latitude and longitude coordinates so
that's just how to make your store
appear on the map over here okay and
yeah that's how you actually add
different store contacts in the front
end of PrestaShop you just go back to
store contacts over here add one of and
any one of these or edit one of these
place in your latitudes and longitudes
and all your information like your shop
name and your email etc okay so now that
that is all done I think we're done with
the tutorial so yeah thank you for
