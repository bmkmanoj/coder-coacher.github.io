here and this is tutorial number 51 and
in this tutorial we are gonna continue
from where we left off in the previous
video having this form that we created
that if you guys try to submit it
without filling any fields then it will
go ahead and give this error you need to
fill in all fields and let's say you
fold in all of these fields but you left
one of them blank you'd still get the
exact same error okay
so now we're gonna take a look at you
know if the users fold in all the fields
let's go ahead and check for a few other
extra like requirements that the user
would have to meet okay so let's just
say that our user name is only allowed
to be 30 characters or 32 characters or
less so no more than 32 okay
again our password we're gonna have to
make sure that these two passwords match
and also that these passwords are not
longer than 32 characters or something
so that's what we'll go ahead and do in
this tutorial and then I think we'll set
a limit to this info box over here so
we'll make sure that the user doesn't
put in more than a hundred and twenty
characters so just because you know if I
if I made this limit a thousand we
wouldn't really be able to just test it
very well I don't really want to be able
to have to type out a thousand
characters in there to test okay so
let's go ahead now and create some more
variables for all of these things that
we've checked up here okay so we right
now have our username variable which was
checked over there so I'm just gonna go
ahead and we're going to copy this but
we're gonna make it one called password
so a variable called password and that's
going to be equal to dollar underscore
post password and then we've got
password again so I'm gonna go ahead and
just set this equal to password again
and that will be equal to dollar
underscore post password again same
thing with the last two things that
we're working with you agenda and info
so a variable called gender and we'll
set that equal to dollar underscore post
gender so a little bit tedious creating
all these variables but we're pretty
much done so info and dollar underscore
post info okay so now we have all of
these created as brand new variables
which we can go ahead and use in the
rest of our code it's a lot easier than
typing dollar underscore post every time
we want to use the variable okay so now
we just want to check is this username
too long or is it alright so I'm gonna
go ahead and start off an if statement
over here so if and then all say STR
Linh so you guys should have learned
about this in my tutorial about strings
I do cover STR Linh and this is just
going to return the length of whatever
variable we place in here so if STR land
username is greater than 32 so if they
are more than 32 characters in this
username let's go ahead and just tell
the user that their username is too long
so go ahead and say echo your username
is too long okay go ahead and turn that
off
another check that we want to gonna have
to want to perform is to see if the
two passwords are correct or that they
match each other okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and say else if and then we'll say
password not equal to password again
then we're going to want to go ahead and
echo out an error of your passwords do
not match and we're also going to want
to check the length of these passwords
so let's go ahead and just we'll only
have to check select or check the length
of the password field because whenever
they fill in password again it has to be
equal to password otherwise they're
going to get this error so let's just
make sure that we check that this
password is not longer than 32
characters so it's got else/if password
I always do that I always type password
but I type ass rod like that or instead
of saying pass word it's like just a
really weird error that I make every
single time but that's kind of funny
okay password else--if password okay we
want to check the length right so it's
STR Len password greater than 32 then
we'll give them the error of your
password is too long so your password is
too long and I guess Genda there's
nothing really to check for over here
because right up here in this in this
beginning if statement we're checking if
gender is not empty ie if they have not
ticked one of these radio buttons
checked one of these radio buttons but
as soon as they've checked one they're
not going to be able to uncheck the
radio button so you know then it's
either like the choice of them having
been male or female there's always going
to be a value that we're not going to
have to check if the value is too big
too small too long too short
whatever we created all of that behind
the scenes over here so there's no not
much point in checking that unless the
user physically tried to alter our form
which we'll get into in another tutorial
but for now we don't have to check
anything to do with this gender okay
then we'll go ahead and just check this
info variable over here as well so let's
go ahead and say else if I'm actually
break that down to a new line else if
our info variable is too long so STR Len
info and we'll just check if this is
greater than a hundred and twenty then
let's go ahead and echo out your info is
too long okay cool and that's pretty
much all we've had to do we've just made
sure that they've passed all these
checks and if they do pass all of these
checks then let's go ahead and just echo
out something so we'll say else that
means that all of these checks or these
conditions have been passed then we'll
just echo out your well let's use double
quotes here okay I'm going to say your
data or the following data has been
submitted following data has been
submitted and then we'll just echo out
whatever has been submitted so
say adding a break tag over here and
then I'm gonna I'm just laying this out
the way that it would be displayed so if
I put a break tag yeah then this is
gonna be on a new line so we'll go ahead
and say password
well username first sorry username is
equal to username and then we'll add a
break tag over here and I'm actually
just gonna duplicate this one two three
four five okay the next one can be
password and we'll just display that
password we don't have to display a
password again because they have to
match so there's no point but we're
going to display gender and that will be
displayed as whatever gender was so
gender and I did not use a capital so
gotta get that around there gender
gender and an info and that was equal to
info and I'm getting rid of those two
things okay cool so let's go ahead and
save this now and let's go ahead and
check that everything was correct so I'm
gonna go ahead and just I mean I must
have made an error somewhere along the
line let's see semicolon over here I
guess go ahead and save that again click
refresh resend again made another error
undefined password again again so I got
need to go ahead and just add in that a
over the cool dad so it's weird like you
you'll get used to just reading these
error errors as you find them and then
going and fixing them but let's go ahead
and just land on this page brand new
without putting
daata in here and now we can go ahead
and test this so right now it says you
need to fill in all fields so let's go
ahead and fill some stuff in we already
know if we leave something blank we're
going to get an error but let's fill in
Quinton for the username password we'll
say apples and password again let's make
it different passwords so we'll just say
apples too so that it's slightly
different so we'll get our arrow showing
up yeah go ahead and say genders male
tell me about yourself
let's go ahead and just say I'm cool
okay click Submit and now we've got this
area your passwords do not match so we
need to make sure that our passwords
match let's go again
quinton password let's say Apple's
password again let's say apples gender
male tell me about yourself
we'll go ahead and just say I'm cool and
let's make sure that our user name is
now too long so we can see that our
username check works click Submit go
ahead and get rid of that that said your
username is too long and that's just
because I pasted my name in like 200
times okay so quinton password let's try
apples again and apples as the password
gender mail and now let's go ahead and
make sure that this can't be too long so
let's try and make this longer than a
Twitter post longer than
Twitter post and I'm probably just going
to copy that and paste it in a few times
it's the fastest way click Submit
and over here your info is too long so
that error shows up as well if this is
too long but now let's go ahead and pull
this in perfectly so
quinton so that's not too long it's not
too short
etc apples and apples mail and hey
that's cool
click Submit and your daughter of the
following daughter has been submitted a
username of Quinton a password of apples
gender of mail and info of hey that's
cool okay so now we've actually just
correctly and for the first time ever
validated our form daughter and I'm
sorry that this tutorial took a little
bit longer than usual but I'm gonna try
and keep all of them under 10 minutes
from now on so thank you very much for
