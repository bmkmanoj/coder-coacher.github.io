and welcome to tutorial number 11 and in
this tutorial we are finally getting
started with the code so I know a lot of
you guys have probably been wondering
and waiting for this moment but yeah
we're finally there so I'm taking a look
at a sunnah real quick just to see what
our next couple of tasks are to do or
what we're supposed to be doing in the
next couple of tasks and yeah as you
guys can see we have ticked off the
design tasks so I've done the home page
design the about page design and all of
these I haven't quite done a contact
page design just yet but I will take
care of that off-camera and then we will
look at that in the next couple of
videos but for now let's take a look at
setting up our website template and then
the next thing we're gonna have to do is
set up our website header but the
website template is pretty much
everything that we're going to be doing
in this video so the first thing you
need to do is get MAMP downloaded and
installed if you don't already have it
installed but i've got map on my
computer if you guys don't have map on
your computer click up here in the top
corner of the screen and you can watch a
video on how to download and install map
now let's go ahead and hit open the web
start page and then I'm going to click
on my website if this link isn't here
you can also just copy and paste the
link from up here just leave everything
from backslash MAMP
out so don't don't use any of that stuff
just use the localhost and whatever's
there write whatever number you have up
here and that is going to take you to
this page that right now says index of
and the reason why it says index of is
because if I go back over to my finder
or if you guys are using Windows Windows
Explorer you're gonna see that your htd
htdocs folder is blank if it isn't blank
you need to delete whatever's in there
and we're going to be filling up this
space with whatever is going to be on
our website so now what I'd like to do
is open up sublime text and I'm going to
hit file save as
let's save this in our htdocs directory
and I'm going to save this as index dot
PHP please make sure you're using PHP if
you're using dot HTML stuff is not going
to work later on so please make sure
that this is index dot PHP and hit save
and yeah we now have our PHP file kind
of setup so I'm gonna open up my HTML
tag and hit enter and that's gonna
autocomplete a whole bunch of stuff for
me and for the title right now I think
I'm just going to set this as build
website right but there's a few things
that we're gonna have to do right from
here we're going to need to link to
UIKit CSS then we're also going to need
to link to our custom CSS CSS right and
then we're also going to link to java
square is JavaScript so I think I'm
gonna link to those in the footer and
not in the header some people like to
put the JavaScript files in the header
and in fact it's fairly standard
practice for a lot of people to do that
but yeah if you guys have ever worked
with a website called Google PageSpeed
so let me just go ahead and google this
for you right now but Google has this
PageSpeed tools thing and basically if
you ever test your website with this
tool it's going to tell you to get rid
of render blocking JavaScript so if you
have a lot of JavaScript files up here
in the head
basically it just takes it makes the
website take longer to load and if you
put them down here in the footer that
kind of fixes the problem so we're going
to be linking to our JavaScript in the
bottom of our website and the first
thing we're gonna have to do is link to
jquery's javascript file and the next
thing we're gonna have to do is link to
UI kits jeaious right so we're gonna
have to link to UI kits in javascript
and we might also need to link to a UI
kit theme at some point but for now we
need to take care of all of these
something else we're gonna have to do is
also link to Google font right so these
are all the things that I want to take
care of in this video the first thing to
do is to get you Ike its CSS so what you
want to do is go over to you Ike its
website I go to the get started page and
download UIKit or you can follow the
instructions that they have set up on
this page but for now I'm just gonna go
ahead and click download well actually
I'm not gonna click download because I
already have this downloaded so if I go
over to my downloads you guys are gonna
have downloaded this as a zip file and
then when you unzip that file it's going
to look kind of like this so what I'd
like to do is copy all of those or copy
the entire folder and then let's go over
to htdocs again paste that in here and
now I've got my uikit folder set up so
let's just remove or rename this and I'd
like to rename it to uikit and that's
just going to be a little bit simpler
for creating our link right so let's go
over to our index file and to link to
UIKit CSS let's open up a link tag
relationship is equal to style sheets by
the way if this is not here your link is
not going to work and then we need to
set this equal to our folder or our
files directory so I'm gonna start off
by adding in a forward slash and that's
just going to mean wherever I am right
now let's just link to the root
directory over back to the root
directory which in this case is our
htdocs folder and then from there we can
go into our UI kit folder so let's go
into UI kit and then the next thing
we're gonna have to do is go into CSS
and then we're gonna have to link to one
of these CSS files now if you guys don't
know the difference between minified CSS
and CSS let me just show you guys those
real quick so yeah basically normal CSS
is
all spaced out there can be a lot of
comments and stuff it's very easy to
read but the problem is that this can
slow down your loading time and that's
really really annoying for the user so
what we like to do is minify CSS files
and that removes all of the spaces from
CSS it makes it very difficult to read
but it does mean the website loads a
little bit quicker so I'm gonna be using
UIKit min dot CSS in my link so let's go
ahead and type in CSS uikit dot min dot
CSS and that is going to link to my
UIKit CSS right
I can also link to jQuery now so let's
move over to the jQuery link and what we
need to do to get that link is type
jQuery CDN Google into Google and that's
going to take us to this link over here
I will leave that link in the video
description below
let's find jQuery in the side menu here
and I'm going to link to the latest
version of jQuery which is version 3 if
for some reason version 3 doesn't work
you might want to just go back a version
so try that later on but basically uikit
1 is kind of for internet explorer there
are certain versions of Internet
Explorer that don't quite work with the
latest versions of jQuery and there are
also other browsers that might not work
with the latest latest version of jQuery
version 3 but I think for the most part
across the new browsers we are sorted
and jQuery 3 will work across all of
those so let's paste that script tag in
here and that looks good now what we
need to do is also linked to UI kits CSS
so I'm going to open up a script tag and
then I'm going to give this a sauce SRC
equal to and our sauce for our UI kits
j/s is going to be very very similar to
this href up here for our stylesheet so
we're going to go into we're going to go
to our root diary
tree with that slash and then we're
gonna go into uikit je s and then into
uikit dot min dot J s so it's probably
good to show you guys where that file is
so it's in J s directly and it is this
file here so we're linking to you I keep
minute J S which is there now very very
very very very very important if you
don't have jQuery linked above the uikit
J s file then it's not going to work
right so you have to make sure that
jQuery is linked before you link to UI
kits J s file just saying right now we
need to link to Google's font and I
think I want to use the Roboto font for
my design because that's what I was
using well that's what I was using in my
designs that's what we need to load for
this website so what you need to do is
type in Roboto font Google and yea you
can go over to Google's font directory
and you need to just select the font so
let's click select font and this little
thing pops up where we can now get our
link so basically we need to copy all of
that and paste that over here so now we
have our Roboto font linked and the last
thing I want to do is link to my custom
CSS file which I haven't yet created but
we can create that now so let's go over
to well yeah make sure you've got
sublime open and let's say file new file
file save as and we want to save this in
a folder called CSS so we've got our
index dot PHP file there we've got our
UIKit file there let's create another
file or folder over here called CSS and
let's call our final custom
dot CSS sorry for the squeaker
but let's call this custom that CSS and
hit save and that is our custom CSS file
so I can either comment here custom CSS
goes here and actually one of the first
things I want to do in this custom CSS
file is select my body and we're going
to take this style rule font family and
set that to Roboto so let's jump back
over here and paste that in save and
that should make all of the text on my
website Roboto
alright so now we can go back over to
localhost and that's of course our
website hit enter and it looks like
everything's kind of worked so far I
think what we can do to test here is in
our body open up a link tag and then
just set the href to hash but give this
a class of UK - button and then just
give it some text of demo save this and
let's refresh and now if everything has
worked correctly you should have a gray
button which is styled in the uikit
styling and you should have Roboto font
and you shouldn't have any errors so
let's inspect element here and yeah you
can see that the text right now looks
like it's set to now UIKit has been set
up correctly and that's working but I
have seen that my font is not quite
correct so taking a look at my head a
document I haven't actually linked to my
main CSS file just yet so what I'm gonna
do is copy this link here paste that in
and then the directory path to that is
just a little bit different so instead
of going into our UIKit directory we're
going into CSS so let's just change that
to be going into the CSS directory
and then we need to go into custom CSS
and that should now change my font
family so okay that looks good
thinks something that I haven't quite
done here with robot of my Roboto font
is use the correct sizing or a correct
boldness here so I I want the thin and
light fonts so in order to get those now
we need to come back here customize this
and let's make sure we have thin and
light and now our link should probably
have changed so if we copy that
we can come back over to our Roboto font
link here and just paste over that and
now we have the font weight of 100 300
and 400 so I want all of those and now
we can come back over to my browser and
that's probably not going to change
anything until we start styling it later
on but everything here should be working
and one last thing you might want to do
is inspect element and just make sure
that your console doesn't have any
errors I know right now you might have
likes no network detected and that's
because I'm linking to my Google Fonts
files or font directory and there's a
little bit of a slow connection to that
but if i refresh hopefully that slow
Network era is the only error you have
and you don't have any JavaScript files
or JavaScript errors or anything like
that and we'll pick all of this up in
