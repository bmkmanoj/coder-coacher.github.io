here and welcome to my tutorial series
on my SQL or actually rather my sequel
because that is how it's pronounced it's
pronounced my sequel not MySQL but I'm
one of those guys who tends to say my
sequel or MySQL a lot right and that's
just because I that's it was felt that
way don't blame me all right so now that
we got that out of the way let's take a
look at the next thing I want to talk
about which is what the heck is my
sequel right and my sequel is a
structured query language that's what
the SQL actually stands for so because
it's a structured query language what
that means is this is one of these
languages that we use to talk to a
database right so before I go any
further let me kind of clarify what a
database is and a database the simplest
explanation I can really give to you is
that a database is a collection of data
right and it is more specifically it is
a collection of data that you choose to
collect so if you want to collect
information about a user whether it be
their first name last name email address
that kind of stuff then you can collect
whatever it is you choose to collect
right so databases are typically made up
of tables with this kind of information
so you might have a user's table that
collects information about a user you'll
take their first name last name
telephone number whatever it is you want
to collect right it's up to you and
typically the more information that you
are trying to collect the more
information or the more tables you'll
have so different data goes into
different tables so for instance you'll
have a user's table that'll have
information or a data about a user where
so that'll be their first name their
last name and email address the user
name things like that that are specific
to a user but then you might also have
products that you sell on your website
and those will go into a table so then
you'll have the product name and that
kind of stuff in a product table and
yeah if you have users and you have
products you're more than likely going
to be selling these products to the
users or to the customers so then you
might have an orders table that keeps
track of any orders going on on your
website and if you have orders going on
you're probably going to deliver these
things to people which means you need to
keep track of addresses that you are
delivering to right so the yeah
basically the more information you want
to collect the more tables you're
probably going to have in your database
and you know having a lot of tables it's
not a bad thing it's better to have a
lot of tables and have all the data
separated nicely than to just keep
throwing it all into one table that
would be very very bad practice right so
yeah that is pretty much what a database
is and I try to make it as simple as
possible right and yeah where the heck
does my SQL come in with all of this
well my SQL or my sequel allows you to
add information to a table it also
allows you to add tables to a database
it also allows you to remove tables if
you want to like if you decide that you
don't know I'm going to need a table or
a user deletes their profile or
something like that you might want to
use code to then remove them from the
database it also allows you to modify
databases so anytime a user wants to
update their profile or anytime you
update a product on the website
something like that
you will use my sequel or a my sequel
query to modify the database when you
are displaying products on a website
then you'll probably need to search the
database for the specific product that
kind of stuff so yeah my sequel
basically allows us to use code to do
all of these things add remove modify
search and join tables and it's it's
pretty awesome so now let's take a look
at what you're going to need to follow
along with this tutorial series
and the first thing you're going to need
is you're going to need to have my
sequel on your computer somehow there
are a bunch of different ways to do this
but I think the best and the easiest way
especially if you have been watching my
tutorials in the past is to use mam
because I use map and I use map and a
lot of my other tutorials so if you guys
haven't got map installed go ahead and
watch another video over here where I
will teach you guys how to install map
and I have videos to do that on both
Windows and OS 10 so pick a video that
suits your operating system okay and
once you have mapped on your computer
you will now have my sequel installed on
your computer something else that I
think is going to be really helpful is
to have some experience with PHP if you
have absolutely no experience with PHP
whatsoever
you could probably still follow along
with the series and understand
everything and you'd like yeah it's not
going to be the end of the world if you
don't have experience with PHP let's
just put it that way but it is going to
be extremely helpful I think it's just
going to give you a better understanding
or like a better idea of where you're
going to be using my sequel and why
it'll be useful right so hopefully you
have map installs on your computer and
you do have a little bit of experience
with PHP and that means that this next
bit is going to be really really easy
but what you want to do right now is
open up MAMP start the server so make
sure your servers have been started make
sure that apache server and mysql server
are both running so it should have like
some clothes check boxes over there
just means that those are both on if
neither of one of those is on or if one
of them is on and the other one is all
for whatever it's just not going to work
right so now that we got that other way
let's open up my web start page so I
clicked on that button and that opens up
my MAMP Web Start page and from here
what I'd like to do is go to something
called phpMyAdmin so PHP myadmin is
where we get to manage our SQL queries
and things like that right so there are
a few ways to go about doing this you
can on this home page
just scroll down a little bit and go to
phpMyAdmin there's a link over there
if for some reason that link isn't
showing there is another link in the
menu up here so phpMyAdmin and in fact
i'd prefer using this link because it
opens up phpMyAdmin a full screen rather
than this link of a year which opens it
up kind of in a half screen I don't like
that it's like in a container I don't
like it anyway but if either of those
links isn't showing then you can just
type in localhost colon 8080 8 or
whatever your port number is in my case
the port number happens to be 888 and
then type in PHP my admin' and that'll
take you to PHP myadmin as well so
there's a bunch of different ways to go
about getting there I just wanted to
show you all of them and now that you
are here what I really like to do is
import a sequel database so what you
guys need to do is go over my patreon
page I will leave the link in the video
description below and also a link up
here in the top corner click on one of
those so once you've clicked on that
link that is going to open up this page
over here which is a post on my patreon
page and from here you can then go ahead
and download learning over here dot SQL
so this is a SQL file that I've created
for you guys that has a bunch of
databases and some dummy info so if you
guys want to follow along with this
tutorial this is going to be a really
helpful SQL file just for querying and
learning how to use SQL so go ahead and
click on that to download it I already
have it on my computer seeing as I'm the
person who created it so here it is on
my desktop and what I'd like to do now
is go back over to PHP myadmin so you
guys need to do this as well and right
now you can see that I've only got these
databases on my well computer so what
I'd like to do now is import another one
so let's click import
and I'm going to browse my computer for
the file so click on that and that opens
up this little Finder browser thing and
this is the only file on my desktop so
that's the one I want to import learning
over here SQL so let's click open and
now that I've opened that the character
sets file should be utf-8 the rest of
the setting should actually be all
defaults so you shouldn't have to worry
about changing the rest of the stuff you
can just leave them as they are and
click go and that is then going to give
us a little confirmation thing over here
so import has been successfully finished
31 queries executed so now I know that
the database has been imported and I can
see that as well because now learning
over here is a database right on my
computer so let's click on that and as
you guys can see there are a bunch of
tables within this database so an
address the table orders table products
and users right so just before we end up
