to tutorial number 43 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to show you guys
how to use the Select element also known
as the drop-down list so what matters
we'll do now is just start off with
heading over here just to tell the user
what to do so H 3 and H 3 and let's just
tell them to select their favorite rugby
team so select your favorite rug being
to your typing slow cool and if you're
American you probably saw that and
you're like okay you spelled favorite
wrong and no I didn't that's how we
spell favorite over here so burn and now
we can do is a start off with a select
tag so like I said it was a select
element so we open up the select element
and then we can close it off and there
we go we now have a select list on our
page but if you run this in Firefox
right now I'll select element is empty
there's no options there so you're just
gonna get like a blank list and that's
not really good for anything so let's
just go ahead and take a look at that
one day when Firefox decides to open
it's like crashing there we go cool so
we have our little select element here
but there's nothing there and the reason
why there's nothing there is because we
still have to put some options there so
let's go ahead and add in an option
sorry option and then you end off the
option so ending option and whatever we
type in here is what appears in the
select list so let's go ahead and we'll
say Bulls okay because that is pretty
much like the best rugby team in South
Africa at the moment
and we might as well just give us a
licked list a name over here that's
always good to name everything inside of
your form so we'll just say name equals
teams and then the other thing we have
to do is we have to give our option a
value because when we want to use
JavaScript or PHP or something later on
to determine which item is selected then
or which option is selected inside of
our list then we need to know what the
value is so let's just go ahead and
booze and then the next one can be
control V and we'll probably go ahead
and put four yeah so the next one can be
Stormers because a lot of people really
like the Stormers Stormers swimmers and
then the next one can be sharks because
there are a lot of people that really
like the sharks team sharks and then the
last one can be cheetahs and that's just
because these are like the four most
popular teams not to like down anyone
who is a supporter of any of the other
teams but these are like the four most
popular teams in South Africa so there
we go go ahead and save that and now
when we go back to Firefox you can see
we're gonna get a whole bunch of items
or options now in our list so go ahead
and click fresh and now we've got pools
as the selected option or default
selector option just because its first
on the list and then we've got Stormers
sharks and cheetahs so there we go
that's how to make a select list but
right now bulls is the selector option
just because it's the first option but
let's say the most popular team was
something like the Cheetahs and not that
it is well let's go ahead and
say that the most popular team is the
Cheetahs then we might want the Cheetahs
to be selected first all the time so
let's just go ahead and say selected
equals selected and what this attribute
does is it basically just means that
cheetahs is going to be selected first
by default no matter what and let's go
ahead and save that and this probably
isn't gonna work so because bulls is
already selected what I have to do is
actually just run this in Firefox again
and there we go now cheetahs is selected
first so no matter what happens every
time I use it comes to the page
cheetahs is always the default selected
option unless we move this attribute
somewhere else so that's what that
attribute does and I actually have
another two attributes that I want to
talk to you guys about and they actually
go up here in the top select element and
basically what the first one is is
multiple and I'll tell you what this
does in a second just if I can spell
multiple right there we go
multiple and what multiple does is it
just means that instead of having one
item showing or one option showing at a
time you can have multiple options but
when we do that we also have to include
an attribute called size and we can set
this equal to 6 for now so let's go
ahead and click Save and as you can see
we've only got four options here so
we're going to land up with a little bit
of extra whitespace underneath the
option let's go ahead and click refresh
and as you can see we've now got a
select list with four options but it's
got a size of six so there is another
space for two more options underneath
here and if we go ahead and we change
this option to or we change the size to
two
then we can go back to firefox click
refresh and now you can see we've got
only two options showing but we can
actually scroll up and down to view all
of the options in the list so there we
go that's what select what the Select
element does and how to use it and
