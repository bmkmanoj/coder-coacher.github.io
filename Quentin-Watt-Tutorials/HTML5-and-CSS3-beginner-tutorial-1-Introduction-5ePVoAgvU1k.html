here and welcome to my html5 and css3
tutorial series and in this tutorial
series we are going to take a look at
how to create websites using well html5
and css3 so let me go ahead and answer
the question that most people should be
wondering right now which is what is
html5 and css3 so HTML stands for
hypertext markup language and the 5 is
simply the latest version so html5 is
the language that web browsers
understand and interpret when displaying
your website and the name kind of gives
away what this does because html5 is a
markup language
now markup simply means that we take all
the regular kind of text that you would
see on your web site like let's say
you're trying to write an article and we
surround that with these special things
called tags and I will explain what tags
are in a future video but for now just
know that if you can read and write in
English or if you can read and write in
any kind of language you can read and
write HTML it is that simple then the
next thing is css3 which stands for
cascading style sheet and the 3 is
simply just the latest version of CSS so
the name of this also kind of gives away
what it does because it is a style sheet
and what that means is that we use CSS
to style the website let's say you want
to make your text on your website blue
that would be controlled by CSS if you
want to add a background image then that
would also be controlled with CSS so now
that you know what CSS is let's move on
to the next question that most people
should be wondering which is what do I
need to follow along with this tutorial
series so the first thing you're going
to need is a good browser now Google
Chrome and Firefox and Safari are
probably the best out of all of
please do not use internet explorer or
internet edge the both of these kind of
have like a track record of not being
very reliable and no internet edge is a
little bit better but if it has this
little esign please don't use it okay so
a good browser again is something like
Firefox Chrome or Safari the next thing
you're going to need is a good text
editor personally I use sublime text
which is my favorite and it is the text
editor that I will be using in this
tutorial series but if you want to use
something like atom or notepad plus plus
go ahead and do that they are relatively
good or they're actually quite good but
please make sure whatever text editor
you're using it has things like syntax
highlighting and so on so don't go ahead
and use some simple program like
TextEdit or notepad on windows please
don't use those okay then the last thing
you're going to need is some sort of
Apache software and I've outlined a map
for this because I have tutorials on how
to download and install map and I will
be linking to those in the description
of this video but yeah go ahead
download and install a map it is a
server or it is a program that'll turn
your computer into a server so we can
simulate a server environment it's not
going to turn your website into a live
so that will allow you to display with
your websites to the entire world but it
simulates a server so that the website
that you build in this tutorial series
will work the same on this server as it
does on any kind of Apache Linux hosted
server that you might want to use in
future so your homework between this
tutorial and the next tutorial is really
to go ahead and download a text editor
in my case like I said I'm using sublime
so go ahead and download that if you
want to use the same text editor as me I
will leave a link to this website in the
description and then you also want to go
ahead and download map now I have a
video explaining how to download and
install map and I will link to those
videos in the description because there
is actually one for Windows and one for
Mac uses so go ahead and check those
videos out and then you can come back
and watch the next tutorial where we are
going to learn how to actually code
something I just want to send a shout
out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they
run a coding bootcamp with courses on
iOS development UX design and web
development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
I thank you hey thanks for staying until
the end of the video that really means a
lot to me now while you're still here
there are a few things that you can do
to help first of all if you haven't
already subscribe and watch another one
of my videos and if you want to help me
make more content more often or if you
feel that my content is just worth
paying a little bit of money towards you
can check me out on patreon you can also
check me out on social media I will
leave the links next to me so go ahead
and click on something and I'll see you
