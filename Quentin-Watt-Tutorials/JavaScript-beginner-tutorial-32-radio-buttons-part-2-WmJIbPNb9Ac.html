number 32 and this is the second part of
the radio buttons tutorial so in the
previous video I actually left off with
you guys with these two variables and I
explained to you that if our radio
button of yes was checked then that
would mean that this variable was equal
to true and if our radio button obvious
was not checked like it's not checked
now that means that this variable would
equal to false and the same thing for
this variable over here so let's take a
look at this in a browser quickly and as
you can see neither one of my radio
buttons is checked at the moment because
I actually just ran it from Firefox or
in Firefox right now and I haven't
clicked it yet
okay so both of these radio buttons are
false but I don't want my user to be
able to click Submit and run this
program right now if they haven't
selected anything I want to tell them
hey you need a select and option so
let's go ahead and make an if statement
based on what we now know okay
so we know that if neither one of them
is checked
they're obviously both going to be equal
to false so let's make an if statement
over here and we'll say if this variable
over here yes checked is equal to false
okay
maybe let's just space this out so it
looks a little bit more tidy and if this
variable over here and no checked is
also false okay so if both of these
variables are false then what we want to
happen well then I think we can go ahead
and just alert something out on the
screen so let's go and alert out
please select an option and I guess it
doesn't really matter about my
punctuation right now so it's fine okay
and what we also want to do is just
return false so that we don't go through
to the submitted page and we'll make
another statement yeah so we'll use an
else statement otherwise if neither of
them is false so if okay so this lonely
happen if none of them are checked but
if one of them is checked so one of them
will be equal to true either yes will be
true or no will be true I don't know
which one but one of them is going to be
true then we can go ahead and just
return true and we'll go ahead and let
them submit the dotter because they
actually have checked the box we just
don't know which one yet okay so let's
go ahead and save this and then I can go
ahead and run this in Firefox again
click refresh here okay if I don't click
on any of these things if I don't select
it and I click Submit then you can see
we've got this alert box that appears
and it says please select an option so
we won't let our user go through to the
next page if they haven't selected
anything so when I click OK we don't go
anywhere we still stay right here okay
now if I select an option so let's say I
select no and then I click Submit now
I've gone through to the next page and
it says thank you for submitting your
daughter and when I check up here in the
URL I have my auto renew set to know so
I know the user has checked no because I
sent through the value no in the URL
okay so that's actually all I have for
you in this video and I hope you guys
will have fun playing around as Wade
radio buttons and checking the certain
values and in the next video I'm going
to speak to you guys about checkboxes
which are very similar to radio buttons
and then we'll move on from there so
thank you very much for watching guys
and I will see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
