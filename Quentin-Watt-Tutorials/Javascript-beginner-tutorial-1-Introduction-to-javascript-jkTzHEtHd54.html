and welcome to tutorial number one in my
JavaScript series and in this video I'm
just going to introduce you guys to
JavaScript but before we do that I
actually just need to explain a few
things that you guys are going to need
before you can follow along with these
tutorials and the first thing you guys
are going to need is at least a basic
knowledge or a little bit of experience
in HTML because if you guys don't know
anything about HTML you're going to be
completely lost in these tutorials so go
ahead and check out my youtube channel
there's going to be a link somewhere
around the video and I'll leave a link
in the description below and just go to
my youtube channel and you'll be able to
see that I've got 47 videos so there's
number tutorial number 47 47 videos on
how to write a web page in HTML so it
starts right from the beginning all the
way up to actually uploading your web
page onto the server so here's the first
video it's currently my trailer video
and then all the way up to the final
video tutorial number 47 which is just
how to upload your video to a web host
so go ahead and watch those videos and
then you should be good to go for the
series but the next thing you get also
going to need is just a text editor now
if you followed along with these videos
then you should have this text editor on
your computer it's called notepad plus
plus that's what I use that's what I
recommend you guys use I'll leave a link
in the description below on where to
download this and then you guys can go
ahead and get started and the third
thing we're going to need is we're
actually going to need a good browser
preferably a browser that has an arrow
console which is this thing of EF I
click on Tools web developer arrow
console that is Mozilla Firefox Azera
console
and this thing is actually going to be
our best friend when it comes to writing
JavaScript because if you ever have any
errors it'll show up in our error
console over here so make sure to
download Firefox and you'll be able to
follow along and check for any
JavaScript errors in your error console
so go ahead and download that and then
the next thing that I recommend you guys
do is just go over to my forum there's a
link on my youtube channel and I'll also
leave a link in the description below go
to my youtube channel which is I mean my
forum sorry which is forum program is
Creed dot-com and you guys can log in
and sign up and log in and then just go
ahead and post your an introduction to
yourself so we can all get to know you
and then maybe just follow along with
the these or follow along with these
tutorials and you can get the code from
these tutorials in my forum I'll post
the code for every tutorial in the forum
and then what you can do from there is
maybe just ask if you have any questions
ask them in the forum because you know
that's what the forum is there for guys
it's there for to answer your questions
so yeah basically sign up on the forum
that's just like the first thing you
have to do and now what we can do is
just go ahead and continue explaining
what javascript is so if you're new to
programming you've probably heard of a
programming language called Java and now
obviously hood of this programming
language called JavaScript ok these are
two entirely different languages some
people confuse them for the same
programming language they're not there
are two completely different programming
languages guys I just had to make that
clear and then now let me just explain
what JavaScript is and that is
JavaScript is the most popular
client-side scripting language at the
moment so why client-side scripting
language what I mean is that all
of the code gets executed on the clients
computer or the users computer so if you
guys don't understand let's go ahead and
just check out this image okay now this
is basically how we use the internet
every day okay you'll go to your
computer you being the client okay so
this is the clients computer and you
will try log on to a web page now seeing
as Twitter's in the picture we models
will just use Twitter as an example so
you go to Twitter what happens is your
computer sends through a request to the
server and then the server sends a
response back to your computer so there
are two different types of scripting
languages okay there's the clients for
client-side scripting language which
happens here on your computer which is
what JavaScript is and then you've got
server-side scripting languages which
happen here on the server like PHP and
that kind of thing
so obviously this tutorial is all this
tutorial series is on JavaScript so we
only really worry about what happens
here and basically what we can do with
JavaScript over here on the server I
mean on the client is we can use
JavaScript to change the appearance of a
web page after it has been loaded okay
you can't do that with a server-side
scripting language and you can't do that
with a static HTML document so if you've
watched my HTML videos then you'll know
that every time you make a change you
have to go out there click refresh and
then only the website changes and you
can't change it again after that that's
it
that's what's displayed but if you're
using JavaScript you can have animations
of like sliding images and that kind of
stuff so that's one thing that we use
JavaScript for and the next thing is
we'll use Java scripts to turn our
static web pages into actual
applications such as calculators or even
games okay now for now we'll just focus
on the basic JavaScript stuff so that
differs a lot from server-side
programming or server-side scripting
because server-side scripting is where
you'll actually connect to a database
and have shopping carts and search
engines and web-based mail programs and
that kind of thing so they have two
completely different purposes but they
actually get used very often together
okay so you won't have only client-side
scripting or only server-side scripting
you'll often use both of them together
and there's a technology called Ajax
which actually actually uses them
asynchronously so JavaScript
asynchronously with a server-side
scripting language and that is pretty
much our Facebook and Twitter and all of
those websites are actually run so you
need to you learn both JavaScript and a
server-side programming language so now
that you guys know what JavaScript is
let's take a look at including that into
our webpage so I'm going to go over to
notepad plus plus and basically this is
our template that we're going to be
using for the rest of the tutorials if
you've watched my HTML videos then
you'll know exactly what all of this
stuff means the only difference is I'm
using a shorter meta tag then I was in
my HTML videos just because it's less
work and less to remember so that's the
only reason why I'm using that shorter
one and I should probably go ahead and
close that off cool and then I've just
included this attribute here in my
opening HTML tag which says Lang equals
en that just means that my website is
written in English okay so that's pretty
much the document and now what we can do
is just include our script tags or
JavaScript into our web page okay so
what we do is we open up a script tag
and obviously we have to close that
again so in Ning script and now this
means that we're using a scripting
language so we're telling the browser
okay we're using a scripting language on
our website but what scripting language
are we using well
we're using javascript so let's go ahead
and say type equals text slash
JavaScript
okay now JavaScript because it is the
most common client-side scripting
language you don't have to include this
attribute but it's probably better if
you do if in case you're worried about
all the browser's and that kind of thing
so just go ahead and include that
attribute just in case and now what we
can do is we'll just type in a basic
statement which is document dot write
sorry I made a spelling mistake the
document dot write and we'll say hello
world okay and I'm going to explain what
this statement does maybe in the next
video but for now let's just write that
and then test this in our browser so run
launch in Firefox and we can probably
close those tabs and you can see what
we've got here is we've got the words
hello world print it out into our
browser okay and if we go back to
notepad plus plus you can see we don't
have the words hello world put in our
body over here so it's actually grabbing
the words from this instruction here
this statement called document dot write
hello world so that's where it got that
from and I'm actually going to explain
what this does in the next video because
we're kind of short on time and this is
quite a lot to explain so I will see you
guys next time thank you for watching
don't forget to sign up on my forum and
don't forget to subscribe don't forget
to like my videos and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
