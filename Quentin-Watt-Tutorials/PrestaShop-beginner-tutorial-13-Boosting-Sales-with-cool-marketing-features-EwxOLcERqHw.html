here and welcome to tutorial number 13
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to boost sales and press
the shop using a few cool little
marketing features that we have
available so the first one is a loyalty
program then we also have a referral
program customer follow-ups and banners
and all of these are actually modules so
once you've logged into PrestaShop go
over to the modules tab in the menu
click on modules and then click on
modules again and that's gonna take you
through to a list with all the modules
available to you in PrestaShop and you
could filter by category over here but
I'm just gonna go ahead and search
because I know exactly what I'm looking
for and I'm looking for the loyalty and
rewards program so here it is and you
guys might see a green install button
over here looks kind of like that but
I've got the configure button because
I've already installed this module
before and now I can just go back and
configure the settings change them to
whatever I want to change them to if you
hit install it's going to take you
through to this configure page as soon
as the module is installed and from here
we can then set up this module exactly
how we want it so the first option we
have here is a ratio and this is how
many dollars does the client or the
customer have to spend in order to get
one reward point by default that number
is 10 and I'm gonna leave it at 10
because this is just a tutorial so it's
not so serious
but yeah you guys obviously want to do a
whole bunch of calculations figure out
what you can afford to give away as
points and for how much then we also
have how many dollars do you want one
point to be equal to so this is setting
one point equal to 20 cents and again
I'm just going to leave it at that
because the
tutorial but you guys can't put whatever
value you want over here you could also
set a valid validity period of point so
basically how long do you want a point
to be valid for if you don't want points
to expire just leave this at zero it
should be fine then we have voucher
details so when they like their points
are going to generate a voucher and you
can then name this voucher something and
in this case we're just naming it
loyalty reward then we have a minimum
amount in which the voucher can be used
so does the customer actually have to
spend money in order to use this voucher
or do you want to leave that at zero and
they can just buy without spending any
money then we also have the option for
taxes and when the point gets rewarded
or rewarded or awarded hmm yeah I think
it is supported I don't know how I read
that wrong okay then we have when are
the points canceled so if the order is
canceled then let's just cancel the
points right and there are a bunch of
other options you could choose from
there too then we can decide do you want
to give points away to on discounted
products or not so you can set that to
no and then they won't get points on
discounted products or yes and that's
fine and then also where customers are
allowed to spend the vouchers that are
created in the loyalty point system so
by default all of these boxes are checks
but if you don't want customers to be
able to use loyalty points in a certain
category just go ahead and untick that
and save and you will be good to go and
that is our loyalty program pretty much
explained if you ever want to take a
look at it in the front end you can go
over to your account by clicking on your
name hopefully you signed in and that's
going to take you through to your
account and then you can choose okay
loyalty points let's go ahead
take a look at those and this should
take me to a page that tells me I have
no loyalty points just yet because I
didn't spend any money okay great
so there we go that is the loyalty
program explained let's move on to the
referral program so I need to go back to
the modules page by clicking on modules
and once that has loaded we can search
for the reefer roll program reefer
customer referral program there it is
and I've already installed this one as
well so I'm just gonna go ahead and hit
configure but if you guys hit install it
should take you through to the same page
once the module is installed and from
here you get to choose all the settings
so you get to set up this referral
program so the first setting that we
have here is a minimum number of orders
of the customer misplaced to become a
sponsor so we have this set to 1 by
default and that means that once a
customer has placed one order they can
then refer their friends to get
discounts and the number of friends that
they can refer you can set this or limit
this to a certain number so we have this
at five and as soon as they've placed an
order they'll be able to refer five five
of their friends to your store combining
vouchers you could enable or disable
that obviously that just means that when
customers come to the yeah basically
what his customers have come to your
store via their referral program they'll
be able to use multiple vouchers okay so
that's done about your type you can go
ahead and set up all the settings for
your vouchers so how many dollars you
want the voucher to be equal to
percentage of discount and so on and I'm
actually just going to leave all of that
okay well
terms and conditions go ahead and put
those in hopefully you have some I don't
so yeah go ahead and put terms and
conditions in save this and go back to
your account on the front end and then
you can take a look at all your settings
for the customer referral program and
just make sure that they're right by
going over to referral program over here
so once you have loaded into the
customer referral program page then you
should get a page that looks kind of
like this if your page doesn't look like
this then it means that you probably
haven't placed an order yet and by
default or according to my settings you
need to have a minimum of one order
before you can become a sponsor so go
ahead make an order and then this form
should appear on your referral program
page and here you can add the details of
your friends then hit I agree and
validate and this is gonna send the info
through to all your friends and when
they accept or they click the link and
sign up on to the store then you guys
will get a $5 you guys you girls who
will get a $5 voucher or a $5 discount
whatever was actually set up over here
okay and that's pretty much how that
module works quite simple now we can
jump over to the next module which is
the customer follow-up module and this
is kind of a cool one because it just
lets you remind customers that they
should come back and shop at your store
and there's a bunch of other features in
there as well so let's search for a
customer follow and there we go that is
the module customer follow-up this
should be a module that you guys have to
install so there should be a green
install button here but I've already
installed it so I'm just going to click
on configure and that's going to take me
through to this page and we have a bunch
of different options here I'll let you
guys read the descriptions but I'm gonna
scroll all the way down to bad customers
and I think that this is probably one of
my favorite uses for this and the bad
customers are basically customers that
have ordered from your store before and
yeah like just never come back so you
got you can like remind these customers
to come back by enabling this bad
customers follow-up and then just give
them a discount of like 15% or you know
5% or whatever then just decide who you
want to send this to so like people that
have been missing for longer than X
amount of days so let's say that they've
been missing for about three months
what's that like about 90 days 91 days
if they haven't ordered anything in
three months then let's send them a
reminder just give them a little bit of
discount and then the last one is
discount validity how long do you want
this discount to lost I will just go
ahead and say 30 days so they can buy
something within actually not even 30
days let's just say 10 not the numbers
Mehta this is just a tutorial then they
can come back and buy something within
10 days and hopefully that gets them
back into using the store and yeah go
ahead and click Save and that should
generate two emails it'll send it to
anyone that hasn't placed an order in
longer than 90 days and that's how that
module works quite simple let me go back
over to modules now and I'm gonna
explain the fourth and the last module
which is the banners module so I'm gonna
search here for banner and there you go
we have banner block as a module and
this is something that should be
installed by by default in PrestaShop so
you can just go ahead and hit configure
and that is going to take you through to
the page where you get to choose a
banner for your site so here is the
banner you can go ahead and replace this
with any other
you once that is about the same size or
you should at least try make your image
the same size and then you get to choose
with a banner links away do you want
this link to go to and a description of
the banner and this banner if you guys
are wondering where that displays in the
front end is actually right here at the
top on most of the pages on the homepage
and a few other pages as well so as
people land on the site they can see oh
there's a 70% sale on all products wow
that's awesome and yeah that's just all
about the ban and that is all I have for
