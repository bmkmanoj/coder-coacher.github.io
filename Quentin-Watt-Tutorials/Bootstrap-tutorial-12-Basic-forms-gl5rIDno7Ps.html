here
and welcome to tutorial number 12 and in
this tutorial I am going to show you
guys how to create a basic form using
bootstrap so if you build your form the
way bootstrap recommends then by default
you actually land up having this really
good-looking form that is responsive and
I'm going to show you guys exactly how
to do that but first of all I just want
you to take a look at the code I'm
starting off with over here so obviously
we have our container our row our column
or our div which is set to take up 12
columns and then I've also started with
a heading that just says basic form okay
so if we take a look at this in the
browser we're going to land up having
something that looks kind of like this
minus the input elements so if I hit
refresh here we go
that's what you've got so now let me
show you guys how to start adding one of
those input elements and that label just
how it was so the way bootstrap
bootstrap recommends you do this is you
open up your form tag of UC and these
require action and method but we're not
submitting the form anyway so I'm not
going to fill those in but just keep in
mind that when you create your form
you're probably going to need an action
and a method to send the data somewhere
or the data someway okay so we have our
form now inside of our form what we've
got to do is create another div and
we've got to give this div a class of
form - group and that's just going to
tell the browser that this is our form
group it's also going to apply a little
bit of styling to the elements inside of
here so let's go ahead and end that div
off and basically what it does is just
going to add a bit of padding between
the label and the input element that
we're going to add inside of you so the
next thing we need to do is actually add
a label and I'm going to end that tag
off and this label
to just have a four attribute of
whichever element it is for and I'm
going to leave that blank for now that
I'm going to type in email address as
the label and below that we can go ahead
and create another input of type is
equal to email because the label says
email address so we can have an input of
type email and then we can go ahead and
add a class of form - control
okay and this is going to be quite
important so you need to add this class
of form - control and that's just going
to apply bootstrap styling to make the
form element responsive and also just to
make it look what it looks like because
but it doesn't look very nice by default
but go ahead and add this class and it
looks great
okay now let go let's go ahead and add
an ID okay so I'm going to add an ID of
email and whatever I put in the ID over
here needs to go into this for attribute
for our label so let me go ahead and add
the word email okay and yeah that's
pretty much it so I can go ahead and end
this input tag off and if I go ahead and
save this and view this in the browser
you can see that we now have our email
address label and we have the input and
what this for attribute of ear does
means whenever I click on the label it
highlights the input box associated with
that label okay so that's pretty cool
that is one form element and if we ever
want to add more form elements then we
need to keep the same kind of formatting
so we need to keep the same form group
just like that and the next one can be
whatever it is like a password maybe so
password and and that's
for a true attribute and I'm just going
to change the label text to password as
well and I'm going to change the ID to
password and of course this can't be a
type of email it's going to have to be a
type of password okay and if we go back
here and refresh you can see that now
we've got an email address field and
we've got a password field which is
great and we've literally just got to
keep going with this exact same
formatting even if the input element
that we're going to add is going to be a
little bit different so let's say we
were asking the user for a file then we
can go ahead and just change this label
to be for a file upload and the type
obviously is going to be file and the
last thing we've got to put in here is
an ID of file - upload or whatever we
want to call it really by the way since
then gave that an ID of file upload I
need to give this label the four
attribute of file upload so those need
to be the same just to stress that and
I'm going to remove this class and if we
go ahead and hit save and come back yet
and hit refresh you can see that now
we've got a label that says file upload
and we've got the little file upload
button if that makes sense yeah I don't
know why I got confused when I was
trying to say that but that's basically
how to create a form and then right at
the end once we're done and we just want
to add a submit button we still need to
keep with this whole deform group things
that's why I copied that down and we
won't need a label but we will need an
input of type is equal to submit and an
ID not that it's necessary but we can
give it an idea of submit and then we
just need to give this a class
of VTN - default and that's just going
to make our submit button look like a
button so let's go ahead in it save and
come back yet and hit refresh and that
is not right we've got a class of submit
type of submit mmm let me go ahead and
add a value over here of just submits so
that's there but we're not getting our
styling did I make a spelling mistake oh
yeah we need BTN and PT and default my
bad there we go okay so all I had to do
is go ahead and add in that secondary
class that I forgot to add and now we
have a button that looks like a button
so that's pretty awesome and that is how
to make a basic form in bootstrap and
I'll probably be showing you guys how to
make a few more other cool forms but
until then don't forget to subscribe
