here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this video I just want to talk to
you guys about using functions with
parameters so before we can get started
we just need to make a function that we
can actually use a parameter with so I'm
going to make a function that will alert
a message out onto the screen and I'm
actually just going to call it alert
message so if you guys didn't watch my
previous video then you need to go ahead
and watch that so that you guys know how
to make a function but we basically type
in the keyword function followed by our
function name which in this case is
going to be alert message and then we
include two parentheses and two curly
braces okay and I'll just break down two
lines and before we give our function
any instructions or anything to do let's
worry about this part of here which is
our parameters okay so first of all what
is a parameter you guys might be
wondering well a parameter is a variable
that we place inside of these two
parentheses and then we are free to use
that variable within our function okay
so just like any other variable name
your parameter can be almost anything
you want okay so I'm just going to name
mine message okay so placing this
variable message inside of these
parentheses was basically the same as
declaring a new variable except I didn't
have to include the keyword var before
my variable name okay and now I'm able
to use this variable message within my
function so I can do anything I want if
i wanted to add two numbers together
then I could have my two parameters
added together inside my function but
what I'll do now is I'll actually just
alert out my
variable which is message and I'll end
that off with a semicolon
cool so now we have this function that
alerts this variable message out onto
the screen but we still haven't actually
given our variable message a value so
the reason the way we do this is when we
call our function and I'm going to call
my function as soon as the webpage opens
so I might as well just say alert
message okay and after my calling my
function I have to include my two
parentheses and basically inside of here
I will place the value for alert message
so let's just alert out of the word
hello and in order to do that I
obviously have to implies the word hello
in quotation marks because Hello is a
string and then I just end that off with
a semicolon and now if I go ahead and
save this and then run this in Firefox
you can see we're met with this alert
message that says hello and when I click
OK I can continue to my website so I'll
just go ahead and minimize this and the
nice thing about this is now we can
reuse this function as many times as we
want but we can have a different message
each time so let's go ahead and instead
of alerting the message hello
I can alert message and I can say
welcome to my website as the message
okay and we might as well have a third
alert and that one we can probably just
say are these alerts annoying you
question mark
aren't these alerts annoying you okay
cool save that and now when I run this
in Firefox then you can see cool you can
see we've got this this alert that says
hello and when I go ahead and I click OK
then I get the second alert which is
welcome to my website and I can go ahead
and click OK and then I get a third
alert that says are these messages or
are these alerts annoying you so that's
just the one cool thing we can do with
functions is we can reuse them all the
time but we can print out different
stuff so let's go over what we've
actually just done here and basically
what we did is we started off by just
defining a function telling JavaScript
okay we're going to make a function and
it's be going to be called alert message
and what a loop message does is it just
alerts out this variable message okay
and where do we get the value for our
message well we get the value for the
message when we call our function okay
what we do is we pass the value hello
because that's what this is called week
it's called passing a value to a
variable so we pass the value hello to
our variable message and then we alert
it out on the screen so you can see what
you did is we call this function three
times and each time we gave it a
different message so that's actually all
