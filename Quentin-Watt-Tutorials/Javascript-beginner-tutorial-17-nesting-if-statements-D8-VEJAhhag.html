here and welcome to tutorial number 17
and in this tutorial I am going to talk
to you guys about nesting if statements
okay and what I mean by nesting if
statements is basically putting one if
statement inside of another if statement
and what that means is that instead of
our condition having to pass one test it
has to pass two tests before we execute
or run a little bit of code okay
so let's take a look at a quick example
and I'll explain everything as I'm going
along so seeing as we're used to just
working with the users age from all the
previous tutorials I'm going to go ahead
and make another variable called a each
and I'll set that equal to 21 because
that's how old I am
and then I'm going to make two more
variables and I'm going to call the one
max age and we can set that equal to 30
and then I'll call another 1mm age and
I'll set that equal to 18 okay and now
what we can do is let's say I was maybe
having like a competition on my website
and you guys had to be between the ages
of eighteen or thirty to enter okay we
can use two if statements nested inside
each other just to check that our user
is older than 18 but younger than thirty
okay so the further way we do that is we
first check if they're older than 18 so
we can go ahead and say if age is
greater than or equal to men age and
what this means is if H 21 is greater
than or equal to men age 18 then let's
go ahead and do something
okay and what we want to do well we
actually want to put in another if
statement to pass another test and what
we're going to do now is check if age is
less than or equal to max age so if age
is less than or equal to max age then
let's go ahead and finally print out a
line of code or do something okay and
what you can do is just will print
something out on the screen so document
dot write and we can say you meet the
requirements or something like that and
I guess doesn't really matter if I spell
it right or not okay cool and what we
can do now is also you just want to add
in a little bit of an else statement on
to this if statement so go else and this
will only happen if the user is too old
so what we can do is print out something
else onto the screen and just say you
are too old okay so now what we're going
to do is we've already set our H equal
to 21 so what will happen is when we run
our program we're going to check if H
which is 21 if 21 is older then 18 or
greater than or equal to 18 let's go
ahead and do something so because that
test gets passed we are then gonna carry
on with this test over here and
basically what that is checking is if 21
is less than or equal to 30
which it is then we'll go ahead and do
this okay and when I run this in Firefox
now I should get you meet the
requirements printed out on the screen
so there we go as you can see it works
everything is 100% and let's go ahead
and change our age up a little bit so
instead of checking that if the user was
821 let's check if they 12 okay so now
12 is obviously less than 18 so that
means this whole if statement is going
to get skipped and nothing is going to
happen okay so let's go ahead and click
refresh and as you can see nothing
happens
okay and now let's see what happens if
the user is too old so let's say they
are 50 or something like that okay well
50 is obviously greater than 18 so we've
passed this test but 50 is obviously not
less than 30 so that means we fail this
test this is now going to evaluate to
false and that means that our else
statement over here is going to run and
we're just going to tell the user that
they are too old you are too old okay
awesome so that's pretty cool and that's
actually quite a basic tutorial so
that's basically all I have for you guys
