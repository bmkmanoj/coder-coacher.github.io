here and welcome to tutorial number 43
and in this tutorial I'm going to
explain get and post to you just like I
said I would in the previous video okay
so let's get started with get okay
because right now we are actually
already using git as our method okay now
you'll notice that whenever I go over to
my browser and I type in my name over
here and click Submit what happens is I
send the data through as part of the get
method now whenever you send data
through using the get method you
actually send it through part of the URL
now you'll notice it's not actually here
and that is because whenever you're
working with form data you must never
forget to put in an attribute called
name and that is something I forgot to
do in the previous video okay so I need
to give a name to this input element so
that our PHP or HTML knows how to
identify the value that was passed
through in this this input element okay
so let's go ahead and give this a name
of name because we're typing in the
user's name okay and you could name this
anything you want you could also name it
user name or whatever you want but I'm
calling mine name okay and basically now
let's go back to Firefox and click
refresh over here type in my name again
so Quinton and when I click Submit you
can see I now have in my url name is
equal to name okay and this is basically
where it gets these values from Quinton
was what I typed in over here in my
input
Xbox and name was the actual name we
gave to our input elements so just for
interest sake let's change this to
username is equal to name is equal to
username and when I go back here let's
click refresh on this just type in my
name again so Quinten and when I click
OK we've got username is equal to
Quinton okay so basically you pass
through the name and also the value of
whatever you typed in this input element
okay and let's say we had multiple input
elements so let's go ahead and copy this
line and paste it and instead of sending
through name we'll put in surname and
we'll change this to surname and let's
just change this back to name for like
convenience sake I guess that it says
name and surname and now when I click
refresh over here I've got my two input
elements so I can put in Quinton as my
name and what as my surname I believe it
or not that is my surname and when I
click refresh
I've got name is equal to Quinton and
surname is equal to what so that is
basically how get sends the data through
to your server it actually sends it as
part of the URL okay and of course this
isn't very secure because if you were
using passwords or something like that
then you'd land up having a password up
in the URL and people would be able to
see that and people would be able to
bookmark that because you can bookmark
while URLs that have get data inside of
them okay so that's not a good idea if
you want to use passwords or something
so but if you're going to just use
something for a search engine or
something like that then using the get
method is alright okay so now let's go
ahead and
look at how to access the starter so
let's go over to handle it our PHP and
we access the data up in that URL by
using something called a super global
and a super global is basically dollar
underscore and then whatever the
superglobals name is which in this case
is get because we are trying to get the
data that was sent through as part of
the get method so it's going to be up in
the URL okay and then you're going to
put in some square brackets and inside
of those square brackets you will put in
the word name so basically this get
super global is actually a URM an array
sorry of whatever was put up in the URL
okay and it's actually an associative
array that's why you're putting a key in
here of name so let's say let's create a
new variable here and we'll call this
name and we'll set that equal to dollar
underscore get name so this will
basically get your name as a variable
and then we'll set dollar surname so
we'll create a new variable called
surname and we'll set that equal to
dollar underscore get and then surname
dollar underscore get surname and that
will get hold of our surname and just so
that we can print it out in the correct
place I'm going to put some PHP tags
down here and then we'll just say echo
and we'll start off a string that says
your name is and append on the variable
name if I can spell it correctly twice
in a row that I made a mistake okay and
then append on a space and then append
on your surname and that should be fine
for now
so we've got name and surname
sent through or collected okay and
echoed out so now let's go back to
Firefox here and let's type in something
so let's type in my brother's name which
is Jared and his surname is obviously
also what because he is my brother and
now we've got the values passed through
up here and we've also echoed out your
name is Jared what okay so that's pretty
cool now let's go ahead and take a look
at the post method so I'm going to go
back here and I'm going to change this
to a post so just post like that and now
when I go ahead and save this and go
back to Firefox now and let's just type
in some value so we'll type in me again
my name is Quinton Wat click Submit oh I
got it and click refresh so go ahead and
click Submit and as you can see in the
URL over here we don't have our
variables or our data sent through as
part of the URL so this makes post a lot
more secure than get because you're not
sending the data through in the URL so
it's not where someone can bookmark it
or someone can see it very easily it's
actually sent through as a like separate
HTTP request or something okay so
basically we now have these two errors
over here which say undefined index name
and undefined index surname and that's
because these variables that we're
trying to use over here and over here
don't work anymore because we didn't
send the values through as part of our
get method we're actually using post so
a quick fix for this would be to just go
ahead and access them using the post
superglobal which would be dollar
underscore post and again dollar
underscore post and that will grab the
so that was sent through via the post
method okay so let's go ahead now and
click refresh I'll have to resend the
data let's see
just click refresh it again as well
submit okay I realize what I did wrong I
when I changed post accidentally deleted
one of my square brackets so just go
back and put that in click refresh
resend and now I've got handling your
data your name is Quintin watt so we
actually handle data that was sent
through using the post method okay and
just a fun fact for you guys I know this
video is getting kind of long but if you
guys didn't know which method you were
using so let's say you were using get or
you're using post you didn't actually
know what method the other person was
using whoever wrote this you could then
instead of using the dollar underscore
get or dollar underscore post
superglobals you could use the dollar
underscore request variable or
superglobal and i did spell request
wrong it's a request just like that okay
and basically what this is going to do
is grab whichever method that it was
used okay so if it doesn't matter if you
use get or post if you're using the
dollar underscore request superglobal
then it doesn't actually matter so let's
go ahead and click refresh and you can
see it just works just fine right now
saying your name is Quintin watt and if
we go ahead back here and change this to
get so let's change that to get there
save that again go back to Firefox here
and click refresh yes we will resend
that yeah
well yeah see it still works even though
I think it's not actually sittin there
we go now I'd actually sent it through
using it I was looking in the URL as you
can see so it still works
now because we are we are getting the
data or accessing the data using dollar
underscore requests so that's all I have

really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
