here and welcome to tutorial number 16
and in this tutorial I am gonna show you
guys how to set up Texas and impress the
shop so this is something that is gonna
be different for all of us and it's also
something that if you're in a country
with multiple states or federal states
that can have different taxes for each
state's like it can be kind of complex
but yeah I'm just going to show you guys
how to set up the taxes and hopefully
you know all the tax laws in your
country and you can abide by them but
yeah what you need to do is log in to
press the shop and go over to the
localization tab and then you need to go
over to taxes and when you click on this
this is gonna load a page with tax rules
that we have already set up so by
default PrestaShop comes shipped with
all 50 states or 52 states in the United
States of America they're all set up but
yeah what I want to do now is actually
set up South Africa because that's where
I'm from so let me add a new tax here
and I did that by clicking on the green
button and really this form is
incredibly simple all you have to do is
name your tax something and then give it
a rate so in South Africa I think we pay
14% v80 as tax so I'll enable that and I
just need to give this a name of v80
South Africa 14% or something like that
just so that I know exactly what tax
rule this is let's go ahead and hit save
and by tax rule I mean it's just tax
this isn't the tax rule I'm going to be
talking about tax rules in just a second
okay so we have South Africa set up and
it's probably on the second page v80
South Africa okay I also want to add a
secondary one over here yes
for tutorials sake so I'm gonna add a
BOTS or v80 Botswana which is a
neighboring country in South Africa next
to South Africa and I'm gonna set that
to 12% because I think that's what they
pay I did a little bit of research but
yeah let's go ahead and hit save and so
that is Botswana setup with their tax as
well and yeah now that we have the setup
we can go ahead and create a tax rule so
you need to go over to the tax rules
page and here is a list of tax rules
when this page loads it kind of looks
exactly the same as the other page but
yeah these are tax rules that are set up
by defaults in PrestaShop for each state
in the US if your shop is in that state
and again I'm in South Africa so this
kind of doesn't apply to me and what I'm
gonna do is set up another tax rule for
southern Africa so I'm gonna create a
new tax rules group by clicking on this
button and when it finally loads I can
give my tax rules group a name so I'm
gonna call this southern Africa which
you know technically I still need to set
up a few countries for this to work for
southern Africa I'm gonna enable this
and then I'm gonna click Save &amp;amp; stay and
once this is saved we can then add
countries or tax rules and countries to
this tax rule so I'm gonna say we'll
make a tax rule that applies to South
Africa only so I just need a search for
South Africa over here zip and postal
code I'm just gonna leave that empty I
should probably put in a zip code but
yeah this tax only and then I need to
select my tax that I set up for South
Africa which was
dat South Africa as a description I can
just say tax for South Africa save and
stay and once that's saved we should see
South Africa appearing as a country in
this list down at the bottom not sure
why this is taking so long
okay cool so now we have South Africa
appearing over here and what I can also
do is add a new tax rule by going over
to that green plus button again and I
can add a secondary rule here so if
someone is shopping at my shop from
Botswana I'll apply this tax only and
we'll get the tax for Botswana and then
I could put in a description if he has a
tax for instead of South Africa Botswana
great so if I had save and stay this
should add Botswana to my tax rules
group as well and now this means that if
someone in always shopping from my store
from South Africa then we'll apply 14%
and if they're shopping from Botswana
then we'll apply the 12% great so once
that has been set up you might want to
just go over to your catalogue and your
products and apply this tax rule to each
product so let me just go over to a
product let's stick with the printed
summer dress seeing as that's the one
we've been working with the whole series
or for the past couple of videos in the
series and yeah if I go over to the
taxes option I thought that I was
actually on the side menu prices tax
rules okay so I can pick a tax rule here
and I'm
to add my southern Africa tax rule and
this means that any countries that I've
taken care of in this text group will be
covered so you guys kind of saw I setup
Botswana and I set up South Africa for
this tax group and now I can go ahead
and hit save and stay and my shop should
now apply 14 percent or twelve percent
depending on the country that I'm in but
I think my user isn't actually set up
yet because we haven't taken a look at
localization and countries so yeah
that's all I have for you guys in this
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
and share this video it's really gonna
help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
