here and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this video we are going to take a
look at some typography classes in
bootstrap so I just want to mention that
I've already started off by creating my
container my row and I've created a
column that will span the full width of
my container okay and inside of here I'm
going to type in all of my typography
stuff because generally whenever we type
something that we want the user to see
it's going to be inside of a column so
let's start off by first of all showing
you a cool trick with an h1 tag so I'm
going to go ahead and add an h1 and this
will say this is a header and I'm pretty
sure all of you guys know that this is
going to display as a really big heading
but something I want to show you guys is
that if I add a small tag over here and
then I type some secondary text so
secondary text just like that then
basically what we have is a heading and
this h1 will display as a heading but
the small text inside of an h1 actually
displays like a secondary heading so
it's slightly smaller than the main
heading it's just if you guys ever want
to take some text from a main heading or
something and shrink it down just a
little bit so it becomes a secondary
heading then this is how you do that so
let me go ahead and hit save and I'm
going to jump back over to my browser
here and hit refresh and you can see
that now I have a heading and then I
also have some secondary text on the
side of that heading so if you guys just
ever want to use something like that and
have that kind of cool effect then
that's how you do that and the small
text or the small tag is not limited to
only being used with headings ok you
could also have a paragraph and if you
use a small text inside the paragraph
then
and that would become kind of like fine
print kind of like at the bottom of a
contract you can maybe say terms and
conditions fine print or whatever
and yeah that's going to be really
really small text I don't even know if
you guys are going to be able to read
this but there we go we have some really
really small text displaying in the
browser okay and yeah that's just how
you can use the small tag I also want to
show you guys a bunch of other cool
stuff so it might happen that you don't
want to shrink text down but you
actually want to enlarge a paragraph
slightly we can go ahead and do that so
I'm going to create two paragraphs here
I'm going to say this is a leading
paragraph and then I'm also going to
create a paragraph over here and I'm
going to say this is a normal paragraph
okay and I'm going to go to this leading
paragraph and I'm going to give it a
class of lead and if I save that by the
way this just pops up because I haven't
bought sublime I'm just using the free
version okay so let me go ahead and save
that and if I come back here and hit
refresh you can see that now I've got a
pretty big paragraph and then I've got a
kind of smallish paragraph but it's not
quite as small as the fine print okay so
this is the size of a normal paragraph
and this one is the size of a paragraph
with the class of lead so if you guys
ever want to have like a really big
paragraph that catches the users
attention and that would usually be like
the first paragraph of your article or
something then you can go ahead and
apply the class lead to that and it just
makes the paragraph nice and big okay so
those are some cool typography tricks I
also want to show you guys how to
highlight text so
what I want to do is maybe just create a
new column so you can maybe see this a
little bit better and I'm going to give
this a class also of coal XS 12 and in
this column I am gonna create a
highlighted text so you can highlight
text using mark and I'm gonna highlight
that mark all that highlight word so
mark and ending mark oops forgot sublime
actually closes the tags for me and I
guess we could probably just mark the
word mark as well that's a lot of
marking isn't it and again I made the
exact same mistake by forgetting that
sublime autocompletes everything for me
so now let's jump back over to the
browser and I'm going to hit refresh and
now you can see that the word highlight
is highlighted and the word mark is
highlighted and we did that with the
mark tag okay now let's take a look at
how to strike through some text
sometimes you might want to delete text
that's on your page or just mark it as
deleted okay you can do that by using
the del tag so del and ending del and
here you can put in some deleted text or
this is basically if you've ever written
an article on your website and then
people come back to view with the second
time but you find out that the
information wasn't so accurate or needed
to be removed from the article you can
go ahead and surround it in del tags and
that way it still shows up but it shows
up as if it had been crossed up with
that little strike through the text okay
so it's
just there basically so the user doesn't
think they're at a different article
there's not the same article but you're
just acknowledging that the information
in this tag was maybe not so accurate
and had to be removed from the article
and you can do the same thing using an S
tag so s and ending s and what that does
is strike through the text so it
basically looks the same as delete so
you can see that you do look very
similar deleted text looks the same as
strikes through text and yeah it's up to
you to decide where you want to use them
but basically deleted tak L or delete
the deleted tag will tell bots like
Google or Yahoo search engines or
something to that this text is actually
deleted it shouldn't be part of the
article
whereas strikethrough text with the s
would just tell those bots that the
information in this tag is not accurate
so that's the difference between the two
it looks the same to the human eye but
to bots or search engine crawlers and
stuff like that it will look like this
one is actually deleted and it'll just
look like this is inaccurate information
okay so now we've got through all of
that let's take a look at some alignment
classes because some of you guys will
probably want to align text certain ways
okay so if I create a another column
over here
excuse the squeakers my throat is kind
of sore from the cold let me give this a
class of Col XS 12 again and over here
I'm going to create some paragraphs so
this paragraph I'm going to give a class
of text left and by default text is
always aligned to the left so you're
probably not going
really notice the difference here but
left-aligned text okay I'm going to copy
this line a couple times and just change
the class so one two three we can also
say a text Center and that will Center
the text in the paragraph we can also
say text right and that will make the
text right aligned we can also say text
GSD Phi and that will justify the text
so let me just change all of these
descriptions Center text right align
text and the last one can be justified
text just D fide if I can spell it right
let me go ahead and hit save and now
when I jump back over to Firefox and hit
refresh you can see that my paragraph
that had a class of left align text
appears on the left my paragraph that
had a class of right or center line text
appears in the center of the column and
my class that had right align text
appears on the right whereas justified
text right now you can't really see the
difference but if this column was long
enough this text would be justified
meaning that it would look like it goes
from here all the way to here without
yeah basically we need like a lot of
lines but you know what justified means
right I hope you do because otherwise
this is really embarrassing okay so that
is just how you justify text then let's
take a look at something else that's
pretty cool that I want to show you guys
so there's actually two things I want to
go through and the first one is just how
to change your text case because we can
do that using a bootstrap and some fancy
CSS okay and I'm going to type in all
lowercase text so let's go ahead and say
this is a paragraph and we need to
indent that some and this is going to be
all Loic well I'm going to type in
uppercase this is lowercase so I'm
typing this in uppercase but I'm going
to give this a class of text - lower
case and I just need to make sure that
that is spelled correctly go ahead and
hit save
so I've typed this in the code as all
uppercase but if we come back and take a
look at this in the browser it actually
appears all in lowercase okay and that's
because of this class and it's using a
CSS attribute called text transform and
then it transforms the text to lowercase
okay we can also change this class to
text uppercase and what that'll do if we
type this all in lowercase this is
uppercase then what text uppercase does
is it transforms all of this lowercase
text to uppercase text okay so if I come
back here and I hit refresh you can see
that now all this text appears as
uppercase text but I typed it in the
code as lowercase text so if you guys
ever want to maybe change the case of
some text make it uppercase or lowercase
then that is how you do that with CSS or
bootstrap rather okay and the last thing
I want to show you guys is a block quote
so I'm going to create a tag over here
block quote and it is quite a long one
but let me go ahead and create a
paragraph now and what I want to do is
actually just copy some of this
so I'm on the other screen at the moment
you guys can't see me but what I'm doing
here is just grabbing all of that lorem
ipsum and then i'm also going to add a
footer and ending footer hi I always
forget that this actually closes the
tanks for me someone famous okay so what
a blockquote does is actually creates a
block quote so in other words it's a
quote of some text that's maybe in your
article okay so let's say you spoke to
someone famous and they said something
and you wanted to quote that out on your
site you could do that by just
surrounding it in a block quote and it
looks pretty awesome actually it's got
that little line on the on the left hand
side we've got the actual quote and then
you can take that footer and whatever is
written in the footer gets that little
dash before it and then basically will
just tell us who actually said that so
let's say Brad Pitt said something
really hilarious it was like a joke or
something go ahead and put that here and
then add Brad Pitt's name over here okay
and we can also reverse this block quote
so if I say class and I give that a
class of block quote - reverse I think
that is the class then let me come back
here and hit refresh and you can see
that now the quote appears right aligned
instead of left aligned we've got the
line over here on the right and yeah it
basically just takes the block code and
puts it in Reverse which is pretty cool
if maybe you want the quotes to be on
the right-hand side okay and yeah that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this video if you want to learn more
about bootstrap typography classes you
can go to get bootstrap comm slash CSS
and yeah you'll be able to learn a
little bit more about some of the
typography classes but that's all I'm
going to show you guys
