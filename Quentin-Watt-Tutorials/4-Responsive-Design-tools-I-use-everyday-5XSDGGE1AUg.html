here and welcome to this tutorial where
I'm gonna be showing you guys a bunch of
my favorite responsive web design tools
because we all know responsive web
design can be a little bit tricky
sometimes you don't know what screen
size you're working with and sometimes
you just want to be able to test in
multiple screen sizes so you want to be
able to get your browser to the exact
pixel size and so I've got a few tools
that I can use for this and my first
favorite tool for checking screen sizes
and finding out what screen size I'm
actually working with is a website
called what's my browser size dot-com
and you can type that in your URL or you
can just click on the link I'll leave it
in the description but once you go over
to that website you'll have a little
centered window and you can see that in
the middle I've got one number over here
and I've got another number over here so
this is my width my screen width which
is 1920 pixels and that's because the
screen is 1920 by 1080 but the second
number over here you can see is not 1080
it's 951 and that's because this tool is
only giving me the exact size of the
browser in other words we're going to
exclude all of this height and we're
only starting from where the browser
window actually starts which is over
here so let's say I were to hide my
bookmarks toolbar suddenly I have a
little bit more height in the browser
and then when I open it up same thing we
have a little bit less height in the
browser and this is responsive so when
you actually change screen sizes you'll
notice that the numbers change as well
so you'll always be able to get the
exact size of your browser window which
is pretty awesome and that is the first
tool pretty much done so let's take a
look at the second favorite tool that I
like to use which is actually a tool
that's built in to Firefox which is the
browser I use
and right now I'm on my website Quinton
what calm and if I go over to tools and
I go to web developer and I go to
responsive design view you can see I've
also got a shortcut over here which is
alt command and M if I go ahead and
click all those buttons or click on that
link I then change my browser size to
something that is a little bit more
responsive so I can see the exact size
of the screen over here or the brows
over here and that is 768 by 1024 which
should be an iPad size and if I have
this little button I can change the
orientation so this is an iPad in
landscape and that is an iPad in
portrait and you can see I've got some
issues that I've got to deal with on the
side like this logo and all this blank
space that appears on iPad in portrait
size interesting okay then we can also
go over to like an iphone size and we
can add our own presets as well by
typing something in or adding a preset
okay
and this is a tool that I really like to
use just because I work with Firefox and
it's really easy to pop in and out of
responsive design view
hitting keyboard shortcuts if you don't
want to use Firefox there is an
alternative for other browsers which is
something called the viewport resizer
and that you'll find at this link which
is lab multi-vitamin calm and I will
leave the link in the video description
but go ahead and visit this link and
then you need to bookmark this page so
you need to drag that up to your
bookmarks toolbar and now you'll notice
you have a little resize option in your
browser's bookmarks and now whenever you
go over to a website like my website
Quinton were calm and you hit the resize
a tool it will
open up the option to resize the website
so UCF with this little black bar over
here and I've got the option to see what
it would look like as an iphone5 we can
take a look at what it would look like
on an iPad and if you click on the
button a second time then it'll change
it to landscape so that's iPad in
portrait and that's iPad in landscape
same thing I phone in portrait and then
iPhone in landscape and obviously you
can check for laptop sizes and 1080
desktop sizes as well which is pretty
awesome my fourth favorite tool is
actually a tool that's only available
for iPhone and for people who have
Safari so you can see I've got my iPhone
connected with the cable to my computer
and if I open up the Safari web browser
I can then go over to develop in the top
menu over here and if this option is not
available you're going to want to go
over to Safari and then go to
preferences and just make sure that show
develop menu in menu bar is ticked and
if it's not sick you'll see there is no
menu item but once it is ticked the menu
item shows up and this is a pretty cool
tool to have because once you click on
develop you'll notice that if your
iPhone is plugged in or if your iPad
isn't plugged in you'll have that as an
option over here and then you can see
what website is open on your iPhone so
right now I'm open on Quinten what com
that is the website and when I click on
that we now have the element inspector
and as I hover over some of these
elements you'll notice on the screen
it starts highlighting who what what
elements I'm hovering over and you can
use this to inspect elements and find
out if like there's an element that's
taking up too much width or too much
height or just not displaying correctly
and yeah it's a tool that I love using
but it's also the tool that I probably
use
the least because it's only available
for high phone and if you're testing for
Android there might be a little bit of a
problem but yeah otherwise it is a tool
that is useful because it still helps
you fix the Android problems sometimes
but not all the time
and that's all I have for you guys in
this tutorial I hope these tools helped
you and don't forget to subscribe please
