in here and welcome to tutorial number
seven and in this tutorial we are going
to be taking a look at designing the
footer for our website so if I jump over
to a sign over here you can see I've
ticked off the designing a header task
and the neste task here is to design the
footer so let's take a look at a few
examples of what a food I should
actually look like because we've got a
bunch of different options here we could
go for just a completely simple looking
footer or we could go for a slightly
more complicated footer and it really
depends on how much information you have
available to you on your site and how
much information you'd like to share to
the user right so if we take a look at
UI kids website this is an example of a
very simple looking footer where we just
have a logo at the bottom and some made
by information or some copyrights right
if you have a slightly more complicated
website like an online shop as like
Apple then you can see that you've got
some product information they've also
got some store information account
information so this is all kind of stuff
that you could also put in your footer
so you could put in a bunch of different
columns with menus and yeah that would
be awesome if you have a lot of content
but if you don't have a lot of content
yeah it can sometimes be quite tricky to
think of things to put here so I think
for my example I'm just going to keep
everything really really simple and use
a copyright information or a copyright
paragraph and then something else I'd
like to do which I see is done on a lot
of Google's websites so this is the
Google Adsense site is they add in
social media links in the footer so I
think that's what I'm going to be doing
on my my website as well is some social
media links to the left hand side and
then some copyright information to the
right hand side so now that I know more
or less what I'd like to do here I think
let's jump over to photoshop and before
I actually get into designing anything I
needed
tidy up my photoshop file a little bit
because right now yeah even though I
have my Mac in one artboard and my
iPhone on another artboard all of these
other layers here are just kind of there
and that can be quite confusing when I
start adding a lot more layers so I
think what I'd like to do here is create
a layer group and just drag that into
the correct artboard and then take
everything that is on my iPhone layer
right now and plunk it into that layer
group and call that layer group header
and then for my Mac do the same thing
create a layer group here call that one
header as well and just plonk everything
into that layer group so now I can close
these layer groups and yeah everything
looks a lot more tidy and I know that I
can hide and show my entire header or
yeah if I'd like to I can grab my move
tool with that layer group selected and
move the entire layer right which is
going to come in handy while I design my
footer because now I can design my
footer hide it away and then at the end
of my project show it again and put it
exactly where I want it to be right so
let's create a layer group here called
footer and I'm gonna stop the design on
my Mac and then we'll move that over to
iPhone and just a second so what I'd
like to do here is create a rectangle so
grab my rectangle tool click here choose
my sizing so I think 1440 by 80 pixels
word works quite well and then hit OK
right and now I've got this properties
box here so if I wanted to change
something about my block size I could
simply just do that but I think for now
80 pixels is gonna be good so let's move
this into place and I think I'd like to
change the color because this gray is
not exactly part of my theme colors but
if I go over to ui Kids website I'd like
to explain some colors to you because
you rike it has a
customizer right so we can customize
whatever color we would like into our
website but uikit also has these things
called blocks which I guess is maybe the
best example I can give to you guys
right now and there are these block
classes so there is a default class a
muted class a primary class and a
secondary class now default I think is
going to be white muted is going to be a
kind of gray color like this one primary
color is your blue color but you can
choose whatever color you'd like for
this if you wanted a red or orange or a
different color shade of blue you could
always choose that in the customizer
right and then the same thing for the
secondary color you could always choose
your secondary color as well if you'd
like it to be something else but the
default secondary color in uikit is this
black or it's not actually black it's a
slightly lighter black than black and I
think I'm gonna just inspect that
element and grab that color so you can
see yeah it's hash two to two right so I
think that's the that's the color I'd
like to use for my footer as well so
let's jump back over to photoshop and
change the color here to that darker
color there which is it should be hash -
two - I think I can just double click on
my layer and put that information in
here as well right so now I have the
footer rectangle set up now let's add in
some text so I'm just gonna take I'll
click anyway on my document and then
let's type follow us and I know right
now that's really difficult to see so
let's put that over the black background
so follow us and I can see right now
that we're not using the correct font so
let's change that font to Roboto thin 14
pixels in size should do and then add in
a semicolon and I'd like to add in
social media links here as well so I
think what I'm going to do is jump over
to
to Google Chrome and look for where is
it fun to awesomes website and grab the
information I need here so let's grab a
Twitter icon copy that and paste that in
on Photoshop and you can see again I've
got this funny block so let's change
that to font awesome right and I think
I'm gonna grab a few more social media
links okay so I've added in my social
media links I think the next thing I can
do is just go over to the other side of
my footer here and put in my copyright
information right so let's grab another
text block drag that out and type in
copyright 2017 and move that over here
so we can actually see it right and if
you guys want to get a copyright symbol
you can always grab one from fun to
awesomes website again so let's see here
copyright so you could use the font
awesome copyright symbol or yeah you
could do what I'm gonna do here and just
hold down alt + G on my Mac keyboard and
that actually creates a little copyright
symbol for you so if you guys didn't
know that now you know
and then yeah what I was thinking about
doing was calling this company for this
website link but it's actually a travel
website so link travel and I think that
looks good so let's just get the sizing
right and then I think to get the
alignment right let's drag this over
here place these two together so that
they're inline hold down shift and then
just drag that
to where it needs to be right and now I
have my footer pretty much set up for my
desktop now I think what I'd like to do
is do the exact same thing for my mobile
phone so I'm just gonna keep things
simple and yeah once this gets to a
mobile phone height what I'd like to do
is take the copyright symbol put that
underneath take the social media links
put those on top and obviously my foot
that will probably get a little bit
bigger so if I jump over to my iPhone
layer here creates an artboard for the
footer I just need to create a rectangle
the correct size here and I think 375 by
160 will work quite well if you're
unsure of how I got that 160 basically
this one is 80 pixels so because I want
to stack these two on top of each other
I'm just basically doubling the height
here for my mobile phone and changing
that from being 80 pixels to 160 pixels
now I just need to change the color here
so let's go hache - - to zoom in and
actually what I think I can do here to
save myself some time
it's just duplicate those layers by
hitting command J pulling those up to my
phone artboard make sure that they're in
the right place yeah yeah so they're
kind of on the phone artboard oops
that's not right yeah where is it that's
the one there we go and now I can drag
these down to where they need to be so
that one there and I think the follow us
link
they're just try and get the spacing set
up here so yeah something like that will
do if I hide my guides that's pretty
much our desktop setup so far and our
iPhone setup so far and I think what I
can do now is yeah
just hide my photo layers and I'll put
them back in when I am done with my
design and that is all I have for you
