here and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to add images to your
website so if you take a look at my
htdocs folder over here I've got my
index file and then I've gone ahead and
added two images into this directory so
we've got a picture of me in winter and
then a picture of me in winter but this
one's labeled small and I'll explain why
later in the tutorial so let me go ahead
and open up this image and you can see
that this is just a picture of me but
this is the picture that I want to add
to my website so I'm gonna close that
and let's open that or yeah let's code
that into my website so to do that we're
gonna add an image tag into our document
over here so I'm going to open up an
image tag by typing i mg and that stands
for image and if I enter and just
autocomplete that you'll see that we
automatically get this attribute called
sr c which stands for image source and
this is how we tell the browser what
image we want to add to our website so
we need to put in that image name within
the source so let me just open up finder
again and because my images are in the
same folder as my index file all I need
to do is take this image name and copy
that and paste it into my source make
sure that you have your file extension
over here I think some guys if I just
say get info in Mac or if you go to
properties in Windows you can check what
the file extension is so in this case I
can see it is a kind of
see we need dot jpg in the file
extension over there alright just make
sure you get your file extension right
and make sure that it's there because
sometimes you could maybe click hide
extension and then it doesn't show up in
the what do you call this finder or
Windows Explorer right so let me go
ahead and save this now and come back
over to the browser and hit refresh and
now you can see my image has been added
but it is absolutely massive so I've got
to kind of scroll around now so that is
quite an intense zoom up of me you can
see nostril hair yeah but yeah that is
the picture of me added right now it's a
little bit big so let's take a look at
how I can resize this and I also want to
talk about some other attributes of ear
so to resize the image in HTML we can
add an extra attribute called width
there is also one for height so you can
choose either one although it is
recommended to have both and I'm just
going to set width equal to a thousand
two hundred pixels I'm gonna leave
height blank for now just to show you
guys with what will happen let me hit
save come back here and hit refresh and
well now you can see that I've got my
image displaying much much smaller but
it's scaled right it's scaled uniformly
we didn't we didn't stretch our scale
scale the image in any way we scaled it
we didn't stretch it or warp it right
now if I put in a value for the height
and it happens to be the wrong value
like I know the right value is going to
be 800 pixels but if I put in a wrong
value like 400 what that'll do is then
squash the image to fit the wrong
dimensions so let's come back here and
hit refresh and as you can see now I'm
looking a little bit squashed I don't
like that obviously we wouldn't
do that to any of our images so make
sure that you always have the correct
values and in this case I know that this
image this image of me is actually five
thousand four hundred and seventy two
pixels in width and three thousand six
hundred and forty eight pixels in height
and if you scale this uniformly I just
happened to do my homework
it'll be one thousand two hundred by
eight hundred
so let's hit refresh and well yeah now
the image is displaying and it's not
warped it's not stretched or anything
like that that's good but the problem is
that this image is still this five
thousand four hundred and seventy two
pixels in width right and if I
right-click on this and say get info
you'll see at the top corner over here
it says that the image is four point
seven megabytes in size now that is
absolutely massive if you are creating a
website with images that are this size
it's gonna make the website load
extremely extremely slowly and it's also
gonna use up your bandwidth on your
server so if you are limited to a
certain amount of bandwidth depending on
where you're hosting having a really big
image like this is really a chase away
your visitors and waste your money so
instead of using really big unedited
images you should always use a program
like Photoshop so I use Photoshop just
to resize your image and make it the
correct size and also optimize it for
web and that's what I've already done
with this image went to me small so if I
come back over to the browser and I
change the name here to winter me small
dot jpg and I can get rid of these
height and width attributes just to show
you right now okay it's not actually
gonna change anything because that was
the exact size of my image these 1,200
by 800 pixels but yeah now
it is loading a much much smaller image
if I just get info here and I take a
look at it it is a hundred and eighty
five kilobytes in size so this well that
is a mosquito biting me in the arm so
this image is a hundred and eighty five
kilobytes in size and that is obviously
much much smaller our website is going
to load a lot faster we're saving data
so you know we're not gonna run out of
traffic space or data space on our
server anytime soon and yeah it's just
better to make sure you optimize your
images for that reason and now that I've
spoken about that let's get the last
attribute out the way because if you run
this in a HTML validator which I talked
about a few tutorials ago it's gonna
give you an error and that is because
all images need an extra attribute which
is the alt attribute and you're going to
set this equal to a value so what the
alt attribute is is basically text that
this basically explains this image so if
for some reason I made a spelling
mistake and my image doesn't show up
let's just yeah take away those two else
come back here hit refresh you can see
my image is not showing up anymore
because I made a mistake in the name at
least if I've got some text here in the
alt attribute the text will show up it
also allows certain things like Google's
search engines to figure out what was
actually in this image so let's just
make the alt attribute Quinton what in
winter not water wind and that at least
explains what was in this image so right
now let's hit refresh and you can see my
alt attribute shows up over here
I still have spelling mistakes in my
image name but if I fix the image name
to not have spelling mistakes anymore
and come back here and hit refresh the
image shows up but if certain search
engines like Google Google's search
engine can still tell what is in this
image by looking at the alt attribute so
yeah that is all I have for you actually
there's one more thing right so I was
talking about width and height and I was
talking about how these are recommended
the other thing is I'm probably gonna
have to get rid of the alt attribute to
show you this but if I make a spelling
mistake in the image name the one thing
about this is the browser still knows
how much space to it's set aside for the
image so let me go ahead and save this
and come back here and refresh and you
can see that we've got the this border
displaying right now and that's just
because the browser knows to set aside
1200 pixels by 800 pixels for the image
that I've chosen and the reason why it
knows this is because we put these two
attributes yeah so even though the
images in showing up the layout of our
website shouldn't get messed up because
the browser is saving this space and so
that's why those two attributes are
recommended but you actually should have
all four to be on the safe side so let
me go ahead and save this now and now
I'll end the video I just want to send a
shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain
they run a coding bootcamp with courses
on iOS development UX design and web
development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
