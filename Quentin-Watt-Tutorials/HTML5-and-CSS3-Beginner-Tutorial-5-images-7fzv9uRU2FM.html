here and welcome back to tutorial number
five and in this tutorial I'm just going
to show you guys how to add images to
your website
so as you can see I've actually just
cleared out everything that was in my
body there's nothing there now and what
we're going to do now is add an image
but the first thing we need is to
actually have an image that we can load
into our website so don't worry I
actually went ahead and prepared that
beforehand and I've got these two images
here on my desktop and I'll show you
what they look like and now we're going
to go ahead and add these two images
into our website but to do that our
images have to be in the same file
location or same folder as our
index.html file so if you open up this
full folder here you can see there we
have an index dot HTML file let me just
yeah anyways it's fine ah there we go we
have our website right there in that
folder so let's go ahead and just drag
these images into that folder and as you
can see we now have we now have our two
images and then our index dot HTML file
so that's cool now we can go ahead back
to notepad plus plus and begin adding
our image and obviously we need to make
an image tag so let's just go ahead and
smaller than and greater than sign and
inside here we're going to type I mg for
image and it's a single tag so we can
just go ahead and and it add in our
forward slash before the greater than
sign over there and there we go now we
have an image tag but this alone is not
enough information for HTML HTML doesn't
know what image we want to use they
don't know doesn't know where the image
is where to find the image to use or
anything like
that so we actually have to give HTML a
little bit more information so what we
have to do now is we have to use
something called an attribute and an
attribute looks something like this
if you go ahead and just type in like
this for now so you always have an
attribute and then it'll be equal to and
then it'll be set to something in
between these two quotation marks and it
usually turns yellow like that if you're
using notepad plus plus but attribute
isn't actually a real attribute so in
this case the attribute we want to be
using is SRC and as you can see it turns
red in notepad plus plus and that just
means that that is indeed a real
attribute that we can use and SRC stands
for source which is obviously the source
of our image and now we need to set it
to something over here which is
obviously going to be the image and name
dot and then the file type okay so let's
just go ahead back to my folder over
there and now let's take a look
obviously this is the image I want to
use right now and obviously you can see
the name here says sweet and the file
tab is here in the bottom corner where
it says PNG okay that's because it's a
ping image so let's just go ahead and
type that in now if you're using a JPEG
obviously you'll be dot jpg but in my
case it's PNG and now we can go ahead
and save that and run in Firefox and
there we go we now have a website with
an image loaded in that's a sweet it
worked
so I explained to you guys how you can
use an attribute let me just minimize
this we'll exit how you can use an
attribute then to add in the image and I
said to you guys that we
also have a whole bunch of preset
attributes but I didn't tell you what
they all are yet and there's a whole
bunch of them like name and ID but I'll
be going into that in more depth in
future tutorials but for now there are
actually another two attributes that we
can use in this in this tutorial so let
me just go ahead and load in that bigger
image that we had showed in just now as
you can see it the image name is HTML
and the school CSS and that's also a PNG
file so I'm just going to type in your
HTML underscore CSS and save that and
when I go back to run that in Firefox
we now land up with this really big
image that actually takes up so much our
website that we have to now start
scrolling around and obviously you know
we don't really want an image is going
to take up so much space on our website
so let me just go ahead and minimize
that and we can actually resize our
image with another two attributes called
height if I can spell it right nope
gosh a TSP height
okay I'm back sorry about that I just
forgot to spell height so I was under
pressure you know anyways and I still
spelled it wrong
haha there we go okay under pressure
from the camera okay and now we can just
go ahead and specify the height so our
last image I think let me just go back
here if we make if we want to turn this
image 960 by 540 to be the same size as
a smaller image that we loaded in
earlier it would be 480 by 270 so let me
just go ahead and change the height to
270 and we can change the width to what
does that 480 I think and if we go ahead
and save that and then go back to our
browser and click refresh we now have
that really big image sitting at exactly
the same size as our smaller image used
to be okay so that's pretty cool
but just be aware that if you guys ever
resize a really big image down like this
in HTML it's still what goes ahead and
loads in that big mumbo-jumbo image let
me just go ahead and show you guys quick
it still goes ahead and loads in this
really big image and then resizes it
down to the size that you wanted it so
it's still going to increase loading
time if you have try have a big image
like that and then resize it in HTML so
it's probably better if you guys just
make your image the exact size it needs
to be and then load it into your HTML
it'll just help your website load faster
and then people won't be so impatient
while waiting for it to load but anyways
guys thanks for watching and that's all
I've got for you in this tutorial so I
will see you guys next time don't forget
