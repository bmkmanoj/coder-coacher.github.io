here and welcome to this tutorial on
creating your own SVG icon so yeah if
you guys have been watching my previous
couple of videos then you'll notice that
this is part of a series and you can
watch my other videos on icons up here
so just in the top corner of this video
behind the microphone I know my hand is
maybe a little bit hidden by the
microphone but click up here and there's
going to be a video or a couple of
videos on icons so go ahead and check
those out as well but in one of those
videos I spoke a little bit about
downloading icons from another website
like icon monster and then opening those
icons up using Adobe Illustrator and
importing them onto your website now
there were a few guys who were a little
bit confused as to why I did that so
before I actually get into actually
creating any icons I just want to talk
about saving your icon correctly when
you want to use it for web so if I go
ahead and open up my finder over here
and I go over to one of these icons this
is something that I've downloaded from
icon monster in the past and I'm going
to open that up with Adobe Illustrator
and now you can see I am zoomed in
zoomed all the way in and this is the
actual icon right now some of the guys
were saying I don't have to open it in
Illustrator I could just take this drag
it down over to a text editor and then
copy the code that I find over here and
paste that into my HTML document right
now that's perfectly fine I can actually
do that but here's where things get a
little bit tricky is if I jump back over
to my browser and refresh
there's the icon and right now it's
looking a little bit small so I think
I'd like to resize that and I'm gonna go
over here and say set my heights to 50
pixels and my width to 50 pixels
save this and if I jump back over to my
browser and refresh you can see that
actually the amount of space that this
icon was taking up kind of got bigger
because this
gray box got bigger but the icon didn't
get any bigger and that is a little bit
frustrating sometimes so yeah what I
want to show you guys is how to fix this
problem how to get around this problem
and that's why I use Adobe Illustrator
when I export my icons so if I go over
to Adobe Illustrator and I say file save
as and then I choose SVG as the type
over here it doesn't really matter what
I name this if I can if I name it icon
or whatever because I'm not actually
gonna save this all I wanted was this
block that appears over here and again
if all of your settings are exactly the
same as my settings over here and you
click this SVG code button it's going to
open up this little text editor and yeah
you can copy this code and go back over
to the brown or to your text editor and
paste that in and the first thing you'll
notice is this code and this code are
not the same right
Adobe Illustrator has actually changed
the code a little bit so that this works
a little bit better right and if I save
this and I go back over to my browser
and I refresh you can see right now I
have two of the same icon but if I go to
this icon the second one that I've just
added and I change the size to 50 pixels
and the what the height and the width
250 pixels each then you'll notice that
my icon actually gets bigger so when I
have exported my icon using Adobe
Illustrator and I've exported correctly
this one resizes and when I'm just using
something that I found on the internet
it doesn't really recite so well so
that's the reason why I always use Adobe
Illustrator to export my SVG's correctly
and yeah actually let's get rid of this
now and work on creating our own SVG
right so now that we got that out of the
way I want to talk to you guys about
creating an icon using Adobe Illustrator
I know it's kind of weird because we've
got the second part of the tutorial out
of the way before we did the first part
of the tutorial but I think that that
was like the most most important part
anyway now let's take a look at actually
creating our icon so I've just gone
ahead and cleared everything out of my
index body and if I go back over to the
browser and refresh that should all be
gone and before I jump back to
illustrator I just want to take a look
at a few examples of icons here on the
website so as you can see icons are
supposed to be really really simplistic
and really really minimalistic you don't
have to go into any sort of detail you
don't have to have like a super great
knowledge of using an a program like
Adobe Illustrator some of these things
might actually come to you without you
know having an in-depth knowledge of
Adobe Illustrator but I do kind of
expect you to have some experience with
it I mean if you have absolutely no
experience with Adobe Illustrator right
now this tutorial is pretty gonna be a
little bit difficult for you but let's
jump over to illustrator and I'm gonna
click new and you can go ahead and just
give your project a name whatever it is
like icon or a custom icon and you can
give your canvas a size I've just opted
for a custom size of 200 by 200 because
I know that I want my icon to be kind of
square ish so let's hit go or hit OK
and there we go I now have my canvas
over here and I can move around my
canvas by just moving my mouse around
and then I can also zoom in and out of
my canvas by holding down the Alt key on
my Mac and that will zoom out and zoom
in depending on which way I scroll my
mouse wheel right and yeah what I'd like
to do now is create an icon for a mobile
phone because I think a mobile phone is
something that's really really easy to
create at least for most of us if you
have a little bit of imagination over
here so I'm going to go over to the tool
box on the side and I'm gonna have
choose the rounded rectangle so the way
you get this thing to open up is just by
holding down on the button
that you want and choosing rounded
rectangle and now I'm gonna drag out a
sort of elongated rounded shape and to
make this a little bit easier to see I'm
gonna bump up the strokes a little bit
to like ten pixels and that's obviously
very visible I also want to go over to
this button in the top corner here and
just remove my fill so I don't want any
fill that just means that if I jump over
to my selection tool again and I drag
this out off the canvas you can see
there is nothing in the background if I
had a fill of white which it had before
you can see there's at now a background
and obviously for an icon I don't want
this I want my icon to be transparent so
that it works on every kind of
background there is right and now I can
drag this back to the center of my
canvas and if snapping is turned on my
icon should snap back into the center of
the or my rectangle should snap back
into the center of my canvas now what
I'd like to do is grab a square
rectangle and I'm going to drag that out
a little bit and give my mobile phone a
screen so yeah I've kind of eyeballed
that to be more or less the same
distance on the top the bottom and the
sides well the top and the sides I don't
want the bottom to be as close down
because I want to add a button here
right so that kind of looks like a
mobile phone I guess we can just pull
the sides in a little bit and that kind
of looks like a mobile phone now except
for the fact that I don't have a home
screen button or a touch button over
here but for now I think it still looks
good to have a home button somewhere at
the bottom of the phone over there so
I'm gonna just grab the or I'm going to
change this to the ellipse tool and then
I'm going to hold down shift and alt and
as I do this I should be able to create
a perfect circle from the center of
where I clicked so if I created
something about that big maybe just drag
and drop this to this
do you think that is the center no let's
just try eyeball this properly boom okay
yeah and there we go that looks like a
mobile phone and hopefully I have got no
backgrounds on any of these things so
I'm just gonna select all of them and
take them off the canvas and I can see
right now there is no background on any
of my shapes and that looks good so I'm
gonna take this back over to the center
here and I think what I'm going to do is
select everything right click and group
there is a keyboard shortcut for that if
you just select everything and hit
command G it should also group them or
control G if you're on Windows and that
is going to create an object group and
then if you have this object selected so
let's just go ahead and select that and
say object expand that is going to
create the object or expand the object
and I do recommend doing this before
actually exporting your file because if
you don't expand it you might have an
icon that doesn't really work all that
well in the browser so let's go ahead
and hit OK and you can see now if I or
if I select everything and i zoom in
instead of having a single line down the
middle of my icon borders I now have
dots on the outside so I've basically
converted my shape into a little bit
more of a complex shape and now I can go
ahead and do exactly the same thing I
did previously the sort of say file save
as and let's save this as an SVG so
let's change the type here to SVG and
again it doesn't really matter what I
name it icon dot SVG will be fine
the only thing I'm really looking for
here is this little box and I want to
then hit this SVG code button and I can
copy everything from up here all the way
down to the bottom of the text editor
and paste that in my browser so
basically I only copy everything from
the beginning SVG tag
the ending SVG tag but what I'd like to
do now is maybe just indent all my code
so it looks a little bit neater so let's
indent that some and take that and put
it back on its own line or in line with
its parent all right
and now looking at this I can see I've
got a little bit of redundant code or
code that I don't need so anything
within a style tag I don't need that
anything within a linear linear gradient
gradient tag I'm not gonna need any of
that and I'm also not going to need this
style element tag thing or style
attribute over there as well so now I
have some slightly simpler code and if I
hit command s save this and I jump back
over to my browser now and refresh you
can see I now have my icon appearing on
my website and if I jump back over to my
code I can always change the size of
this to be anything I want so let's say
I want that to be 100 by 100 pixels I
can do that jump back over the browser
refresh and now I have a much smaller
mobile phone icon so yeah that is how
you go ahead and create your own icons
using adobe illustrator and yeah make
sure to always export your icon the way
I'm doing it now by you know file save
and then just make sure when you save
this as an SVG that all your settings
are exactly the same as mine over here
and then click that SVG code button and
you'll get the right code for the job
and that is all I have for you guys in
