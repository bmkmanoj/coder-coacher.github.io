it's Quinton here and this is my new
bedroom so this is part of my new
apartment there is a whole other
downstairs section that I'm not gonna
show you guys because it is still a
little bit messy but what I am gonna do
is try and set the camera down over
there somewhere and yeah let's talk
about something that is of really high
value to you as a developer but before I
get to in depth I just want to mention
that this video was sponsored by dev
Mountain so go ahead and check out their
website the link is gonna be in the
video description below and I'm gonna
talk to you to you guys about them a
little bit more towards the end of the
video let's talk about something that is
of really high value to you as a
developer and that is your ability to
think right so you might think at the
beginning when you start programming or
when you start learning how to code that
people pay you to code but as a
developer that actually isn't the case
you're gonna find that more often than
not the vast majority of your time is
spent figuring out problems so yeah like
figuring our problems solving those
problems thinking through those problems
that's the tough part and then the
easier part is actually doing the code
because once you've got all of that
figured out you could actually just go
to somebody who is a sort of junior
level programmer and tell them hey this
is what I need you to code this is what
I'd like you to do and they'll probably
be able to do it even if they've only
been coding for like two to three weeks
so really depending on the the
difficulty level there but yeah you once
you've done the thinking once you've
done the hard part
you know guys you can't just hand over
the easy part of the developers so
basically what I'm saying here is your
ability to think and your ability to
solve problems is probably your most
valuable asset as a developer and
because of that it's something that you
don't really want to go around handing
out for free and it is something that a
lot of people are probably going to try
make you fall into this trap of giving
information away for free
and this happens quite a lot with my
youtube channel this also happens in the
real world with clients a lot of people
phone in to where the place that I work
and yeah they'll often just say hey I
need your help with this and this and
I'll try and keep you on the telephone
or you know some guys with with YouTube
will try and just keep messaging me and
try and get as much info out as possible
before before you've known yep
well come on but before you know it like
you've actually spent about you know an
hour two hours so like sometimes time
can get away with you and you've spent a
lot of time giving this person a lot of
information and that information is
valuable to you that information is
something that you should have been
charging the person for especially
because they were taking your time and
so actually this kind of service has a
name
so basically when somebody who has less
experience than you comes to you for
advice and asks you to solve something
for them or help them with something
give them advice on something that is
actually a professional service that you
can sell off to people it's called
consulting well at least here in South
Africa in English it's called consulting
but depending on where you from maybe
you have a different name for it and
yeah doing consulting work for somebody
often involves actually billing them
just to give them some advice so I mean
essentially if they're gonna come to you
and they're gonna ask you questions for
an hour they should be paying whatever
your hourly rate is so again whatever
your hourly rate is that's up to you
but make sure that you're charging
people a decent amount of money to be
giving away info to them you can't just
you know spend an hour on the phone with
somebody or have an hour meeting with
somebody and expect them or have them
expect to not owe you anything at all so
again yeah this is something that's
really really valuable to you your time
and your advice and
yeah it isn't uncommon for people here
in the area that I live in in South
Africa to charge between 750 to a
thousand South African Rand for
consulting which if you do the dollar
conversion on that is going to be
somewhere between 70 and 90 dollars just
for giving out advice right so just for
somebody less experienced than you
coming to you and asking you how they
can do things better or how they can
build something better and yeah it is
again something like I said that you
should not be handing out for free
because as a as a developer your time is
of course valuable to you and yeah it's
not something I mean I mean like right
now I probably spend about twelve hours
a day working and when somebody asks me
for an extra hour out of my day
it really freaking bugs me because it
means that I now have to spend an hour
doing something that I probably don't
really want to do because you know it's
work
and I probably at that time just wanna
relax and so yeah this is definitely
something that you are going to want to
figure out how you can build people just
you know let them know more or less
beforehand you know when somebody comes
to you for advice just let stop them
right there and say okay listen we're
gonna have to set up a meeting I'll you
know give you consulting and it's gonna
cost so much per hour or whatever but
yeah you definitely don't want to be
going around just giving people advice
for free because if you do all the
thinking and stuff for them you've taken
care of the hard stuff and you know you
if they are sort of a novice developer
they'll be able to figure out some of
those things by themselves and of course
yeah you're actually gonna land up
having given them a lot of time that
you're not actually getting any money
back for which is just a bad business
decision so let me know what you guys
think about that I know that some of you
especially from the reactions that I get
when I tell people listen I can't give
you advice for free or I can't do that
stuff for free I get a lot of people who
yet who tend to get a little bit angry
with me especially sometimes clients on
the phone like call through and try and
get me to set up their entire website
for them over the phone and I'm like I'm
not gonna do this I'll do it for you for
money and then usually they just hang up
so sometimes people are not really
willing to pay for advice but at the end
of the day it is also an unrealistic
expectation for people to come to you
and just expect you to do stuff or give
them valuable advice or information for
free but I'm gonna go ahead and end this
video off yet so if you've got something
to say about this topic please go ahead
and leave a few comments down below and
yeah
before I end of this video I just want
to send a huge shout out to dev Mountain
