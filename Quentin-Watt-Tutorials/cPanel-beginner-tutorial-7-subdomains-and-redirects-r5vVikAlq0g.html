here and welcome to tutorial number
seven and in this tutorial I am going to
show you guys how to set up a sub domain
so we're skipping straight over this
email panel over here because emails
don't really have anything to do with
web development I might come back and do
a tutorial on this as like a bonus video
but yeah it really isn't related to web
development it's not related to my
channel and I don't want to cover too
much about that but let's go over to
subdomains and I'm going to click on the
subdomain link and this is going to open
up a page where I get to set up a
subdomain and like how simple is this
all I do is like fill in the subdomain
at once and that'll be added to my
domain so whatever I type in here dot
josy cocom will be the subdomain and
then I'll hit create so let's type in a
new project I don't know something like
the Hat and let's hit create and that is
going to create my subdomain you can see
over here as well the root directory is
public HTML slash new project so what
that means is it's going to create a
directory called new project in my
public HTML folder so if that has
confused you basically that's just a new
folder in the e
the public HTML folder and I know I kind
of said that twice now so let's just go
to file manager and if I go to public
HTML you can see that now we've got a
new project set up here as a directory
and there are two ways we could access
this so I could go to Josie Corp comm
slash new project and that's going to
take me to this directory but instead of
doing that I could actually use the
subdomain that I set up which is new
project dot Josie
and that goes to the same directory so
that's pretty much what a subdomain does
it just sets up a like subdirectory and
then it also directs this domain to that
same directory anyway now that that's
done let's take a look at redirects
quickly because if you if you might want
to redirect that subdomain at some point
so you can create a permanent redirect
with by just using that option and you
could also do the same thing with an HT
access folder if you guys have ever
worked with HT access and that's exactly
what this is going to do is just going
to add it to the HT access folder so we
can permanently redirect our subdomain
which is a new project at Josie touch
comm and we can redirect that to
something else so I'm going to redirect
this to Google just for fun and it has
to be the full URL so let's go HTTP
colon slash slash W google.com and yeah
you can choose if you want to redirect
it with the w w or without it whatever
that's up to you and let's hit add and
this is now going to redirect my
subdomains so now if I try go back yet
it should redirect me to Google so the
how simple is that redirects and
subdomains work so easy and if you have
a one to delete that redirects you can
just go over there and delete it and the
same thing with the subdomain scroll
down to the bottom and you can go ahead
and delete the subdomain if you choose
to so that is how subdomains work and
that is all I have for you in this
