here and welcome to this tutorial series
and yeah let's build a project together
so in this tutorial series what I'd like
to do is equip you guys with some skills
that go beyond simply copying down some
code I don't want you to watch this
tutorial series and only coming I only
come out of it at the end
having just copied down code I want you
to learn a little bit more about web
design and web development so I want you
guys to learn some technology I'm also
going to show you guys some common
design trends and we're going to take a
whole bunch of languages that I have
spoken to you about or taught you about
previously in all my other tutorials and
we're going to combine those all
together to make one big website so
basically we're gonna take some html5
and CSS we're going to combine that with
a front-end framework that I really like
using which is called UI kit and then
we're going to combine that with some
JavaScript and some PHP and at the end
of it all of that is gonna come together
to make one static websites but we're
not going to jump straight into coding
so I actually want to show you guys a
little bit more about the programming
process or the web design process and
basically I want to start off by
introducing you guys to a project
management tool that I use quite a lot
which is called asana and then we're
gonna move on from a sauna and we're
actually going to take a look at some
real-world websites and I'm going to
take a look at those websites and show
you guys what's good about them and what
I like about these websites and we're
gonna try and convert some of those
aspects into a design so we're actually
going to make a design in Photoshop I'm
going to show you guys how to use
Photoshop and how to make a grid in
Photoshop and from there we're going to
make the design and then finally we'll
move over to converting that Photoshop
design into code so there is a lot of
stuff that's going into actually
building this website and yeah if you
guys came here just to jump straight
into code I'll probably leave a link
somewhere up here or in the video
description down below you can go
and check either one of those links out
and you can jump straight into the
coding part at the end but yeah if you
guys want to know a little bit more
about how this works in the real world
and how to manage projects and how to
design stuff then yeah you're probably
gonna want to stay tuned for the next
couple of videos so now let's talk about
what you're gonna need to follow along
with this tutorial series and like I
said we are going to be working with
html5 and CSS so I'm gonna assume that
you're at least a moderate level user
there I'm also going to be working with
PHP so I'm going to assume that you have
a little bit of experience with PHP I'm
not going to assume that you're an
expert so don't worry if you're not
entirely an expert in PHP just yet I'm
also going to assume that you have a
little bit of experience in JavaScript
although we might not be using that much
JavaScript so again if you are not a
professional at JavaScript and don't
worry too much we're not going to you're
not gonna get lost if you don't know too
much but at least if you've had some
experience maybe moderate to beginner
level Java experice crips experience
that's going to help as well then I'm
gonna be using UI kit and I understand
that a lot of you guys might not be a
professional at UI kit just yet so I'm
actually gonna assume that most of you
have no experience with UI kit so don't
worry if you don't have experience with
UI kit that is not going to be a problem
then I'm also going to assume that you
have a little bit of experience with a
mam lamp Apache kind of setup so I'm
gonna be using MAMP in these tutorials
and I do have some videos that you can
go ahead and watch if you don't have any
experience in MAMP and I'll leave a link
to those either in the description down
below or up here in the corner so you
can go ahead and watch my videos on
ma'am and yeah that's gonna be really
useful if you have no experience with
mam and then from there we're also going
to need you to know a little bit of
photoshop so I'm not going to assume
that you're some Photoshop Pro because
I'm not a Photoshop Pro either but as
long as you have a little bit of
experience and you know how to navigate
your way around some of the Photoshop
tools you should be fine we
some basic understanding of Photoshop as
well so now that you know what you need
to follow along with this tutorial
series I hope to see you guys in the
next video but I'm gonna end this one
off here and as always I just want to
send a huge shout out to my patrons so
