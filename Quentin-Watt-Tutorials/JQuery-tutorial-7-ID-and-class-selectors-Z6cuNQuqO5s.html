here and in this tutorial I'm going to
talk to you guys some more about
selectors in jQuery and we're actually
going to be taking a look at the ID and
class selectors and I'm going to show
you guys how to use those and you guys
are probably familiar with the ID
selector already because we've actually
used that a couple times in some of the
previous videos so let's create a
paragraph on my page over here with AP
tag and then I'm going to end that off
ending P and we'll give this some text
so I'm just going to say some text as
the text how creative is that and then
I'll give this an ID and I'll set that
equal to something like para or para one
and let's duplicate that and we'll
change the ID to para two and we'll just
say in here some more text because this
is para two and I think we'll leave
things at that so we've got our two
paragraphs over here I'm going to click
Save and we'll go over to our script
where we are going to listen to see if
one of these paragraphs has been clicked
and we're actually going to listen for
peril one so we're going to be selecting
this paragraph by its ID so I'm going to
copy that ID and we'll go over here and
you guys should already know whenever
we're selecting an element's we're going
to use the dollar symbol and the
parentheses hand these to quotation
marks and we're going to add in the hash
symbol because whenever we use this hash
symbol or the sharp symbol or whatever
you want to call that the pound key that
basically tells jQuery okay we're going
to be selecting an element by ID and
what ID is the elements or what's the
idea of the element we're looking for
well it is para one so I'm going to
listen out for that ID and when that is
clicked so I'm going to add dot click
so once that's clicked then we'll do
something and whenever we want to do
something we actually have to add in the
word function followed by some
parenthesis and some curly braces so you
guys kind of get the picture here so
we're listening out for this paragraph
to be clicked and then we'll do
something which is whatever is in here
and in this case let's just alert out I
you clicked power one and end this off
with a semicolon and now when I click
Save and we run this in Firefox so we
have to run the index file you'll notice
that I've got these two paragraphs over
here but we only have a jQuery rule
right now for one of them and that is
peril one so if I jump back over here
and I click on peril one you can see
I've got my alert box that pops up and
it said you clicked peril one so I'm
going to click OK and when I click para
two nothing happens because these two
paragraphs of course don't have the same
ID and in fact you can't give two
elements the same ID you it's just bad
practice and in fact it would actually
cause an error in HTML but you don't
really have error reporting on a page
like that so you would never actually
know that there was an error unless you
try to validate it of course okay so
that's how to select an element by ID
but now let's actually take a look at
how to select an element by class and
I'm actually just going to get rid of
these numbers real quick so that they
have the same class and we're going to
change this ID attribute to class okay
so now we have a paragraph with the
class of para and another paragraph with
the class of para and when I save this
and we go over to our jQuery if we want
to listen out to see if one of the
paragraphs with a class of para has been
clicked then what
do is will change this select over here
to select all classes and the way we
tell jQuery to listen up for a class
that is going to be selected we actually
use the full stop or the period symbol
and then we add in the name of the class
that we want to select which in this
case is para so I'm going to copy that
and we'll paste that in here and now we
have all of the class or all of the
paragraphs with the class para on our
web page whenever they are clicked we're
going to alert this out so you clicked
let's just say a paragraph rather to fix
that message so we'll click save go back
over to Firefox and I'll click refresh
and we still have the same web page here
but now when I click on our first
paragraph we have an alert box pop up
and if I click on the second paragraph
we also have an alert box pop-up that
says you click the paragraph okay
so we can select ID by using the hash
symbol and we can select by class by
using the full stop or the period symbol
and that's pretty much all I have for
you guys in this video so don't forget

comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
