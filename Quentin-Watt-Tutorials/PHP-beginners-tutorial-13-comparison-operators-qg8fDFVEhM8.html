continued and welcome to tutorial number
13 and in this video I am going to talk
to you guys about the different
comparison operators in PHP so
comparison operators are these operators
that you will very often see in an if
statement that compare two values okay
now you guys already saw the greater
than operator from the previous tutorial
which checked if apples or the value of
apples was greater than one okay and
because obviously apples was five so
five y is greater than one this code ran
and we got the stuff printed out in the
browser okay so because there's a
greater than sign we also have the
ability to check if apples is less than
one by using the less than operator okay
so now we're checking is apples less
than one well right now apples is five
so that is obviously going to be false
because five is not less than one and
when we go back and click refresh we've
got nothing but let's say apples were
set to zero zero is indeed less than one
so your models will just change that to
say you have less than one Apple okay
and now when we save this and click
refresh it says you have less than one
Apple you have zero apples okay so not
only can we check for greater than but
we can also check for less than but what
happens if I actually had one Apple okay
so apples is equal to one then the
computer is going to run this test and
go
well if apples which is one is greater
than
or less than one will do this code but
one is not less than one okay there are
actually equal to each other so what do
you guys think is going to happen here
because this is actually false one is
not less than one okay so the answer to
that is that we're not going to get
anything printed out because this is
actually this condition is false so if
you want to be able to include one as
part of the scope you actually have to
use the less than or equal to operator
okay and basically what PHP is going to
do now is check well if Apple's which is
one is less than or equal to one then
we'll go ahead and do this code and
right now apples is one so is one less
than one no it's not but it is equal to
one so this statement is now true again
and this code will indeed execute okay
so we're going to go back to Firefox now
click refresh we've got everything
showing up okay likewise and I'm
guessing this is fairly straightforward
to you guys now because if we've got a
less than or equal to operator we've
also got a greater than or equal to
operator so this will check is 1 greater
than or equal to 1 well it's not greater
than 1 but it is equal to 1 so this
statement again would be true but now
let's actually talk about if we're
checking if the values are equal to each
other ok so let's say while we've got
apples equal to 1 here and we want to
check if apples is equal to 1 so we
don't want to include if it's greater
than or less than we just want to check
if they're equal to each other now
remember that the single equal sign
already has a
purpose in PHP we already use it as the
assignment operator to assign the value
on the right to the variable on the left
so instead of using a single equal sign
when comparing if two values are equal
we actually use a double equal sign so
that's how we check for equality in PHP
so right now is one equal to one well
yes it is
so let's actually just get rid of this
and just say you have one Apple okay
let's go back to Firefox now and click
refresh and yes we have one Apple okay
because one is equal to one okay but
what happens if this was five well is
five equal to one no it's not so again
this condition is false and these lines
of code will be skipped okay so if we go
back and click refresh oh yeah we got
nothing okay and that's because five is
not equal to one
okay but we also have the ability to
check not equal to so not only can we
check if apples is equal to one we can
check if apples is not equal to one okay
so in other words is five not equal to
one
well yes five it is not equal to 1
because five is more than one okay so
again well let's just change this
message up to say okay we can say apples
our variable apples is not equal to one
okay so this will only happen if our
variable is not equal to one this like
this code will only execute if this is
not equal
to one so let's go back click refresh
and five is of course not equal to one
but again what if we have one in the
situation well one is indeed equal to
one so that would be false and this
would not execute again okay so if we go
ahead and click refresh well you can see
one is of course equal to one so this
statement actually is false okay and the
tutorial is getting kind of long from
now but let's go ahead and I also just
want to show you one last thing and that
is I the identical operator okay so
let's make another variable called
oranges and we can set that equal to one
okay
and now we can check if apples and
oranges are indeed identical so what I
can do is just put my variable here
oranges and like I said I want to check
for if they're identical and that is
actually three equal signs
okay so right now apples and oranges are
both set to one as an integer okay so
they are actually identical so when I go
back and I well let's just change this
message up to say apples is identical to
oranges
arrangers I need to spell that right
there we go okay cool
save that when I click refresh one is
identical to one okay
and that's because they're both integers
now let's say I turned one into a string
okay so they're still both equal to one
okay
it's just that this is now a string one
and this is an integer one if you guys
don't know what I'm talking about you
need to watch my tutorial on data types
but as you can see when we go back now
after saving this we're going to get a
little bit of a confusing message or not
a message at all okay and that is
actually because the string one is not
actually equal to or not identical to
the integer one okay but they are
actually equal to each other so if I
test that if apples is equal to oranges
like that okay then I this will actually
still run okay even though there are
different data types they are they still
hold the same value so let's go back and
click refresh and one is equal to one
but because they're different data types
they aren't actually identical so that
is what the triple equal sign means that
that it's strictly equal they have to be
identical so they have to be the same
value and the same data type so if I go
back and click refresh I get nothing
okay so that's all I have for you guys
in this video it was kind of a long one
