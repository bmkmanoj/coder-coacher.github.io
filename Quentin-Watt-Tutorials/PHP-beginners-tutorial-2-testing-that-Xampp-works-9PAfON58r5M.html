here and welcome back to tutorial number
two and in this tutorial we are finally
going to start writing a little bit of
PHP code but there are a few things that
we have to just make sure our working
first so the first thing we're going to
do is save a PHP file now we have to
save these PHP files in the correct
place so if you watch the previous
tutorial I told you that you need to go
to your computer and check at your C
Drive okay
there's a folder there called X M okay
in that folder
there's another folder called htdocs now
htdocs is the root directory for our web
server that we have now turned our
computer into so over here is where all
of our PHP files have to go now to keep
things tidy I told you guys to make a
folder called tutorials and if you guys
don't have this folder then you need to
go ahead and make it because I made mine
it wasn't here by default and as you can
see there's nothing there right now so
let's go ahead and actually save a PHP
file there so I've got notepad plus plus
open and there's a new document here so
let's go ahead and just save this
basically exactly why I told you guys to
save it so on the C Drive
xampp htdocs and we're going to save it
in this folder called tutorials so I'm
going to save mine as index dot PHP and
if you want to be sure that it's named
correctly or saves correctly go ahead
and look for the PHP file name over here
okay I'm aware that you guys probably
can't see that on your screen so it's
somewhere over there but here ok so
let's go ahead and just click Save
and now you can see we've got a PHP file
saved on our computer okay if we go back
here to this document or this folder we
can see that there is our index dot PHP
file okay now if you guys don't save
your file in the right place then this
isn't going to work so just make sure
that you save it in the right place okay
so now that we have our PHP file we can
finally start writing some code now if
you guys are familiar with HTML and
hopefully you are otherwise you're going
to be completely lost in the series then
you will know that everything was
written in tags so we basically had like
HTML tags like that to start and end our
documents okay now PHP has something
kind of similar we have to write our PHP
inside of some special PHP tags and
those tags look like this okay so it's
still the smaller than and greater than
sign but inside here we actually use two
little question marks okay and the top
tag you write the word PHP okay so this
are these are our PHP tags okay that's
the opening tag and that's the closing
tag so inside here is where our code
will go okay so now that we have a PHP
file on our computer let's try and test
that everything is working correctly so
what you guys need to do is inside of
these tags type the function PHP info
and put in the two brackets and a
semicolon now if you guys don't know
what a function is yet then don't worry
we will get into this later on in the
series but basically what this is going
to do is print out all of the
information of our PHP
installation on our computer okay so go
ahead and save this and then this one
more thing that we have to do okay it's
not as simple as a HTML document where
we could just go ahead and you know run
this in Firefox and hey presto it works
okay one does not simply run a PHP file
okay instead what we have to do is make
sure that xampp is working so this is
the program I got you guys to install in
the last tutorial and make sure that
your Apache has been started so right
now it says stop which means it is
started and it's working MySQL we don't
really need right now but I've started
mine just out of habit okay so instead
what you have to do is go ahead and open
up your browser and in your URL you're
going to have to type the following
address okay so you're going to type in
the word localhost and then you're going
to type in the word tutorials okay
because that's the folder that we saved
our file in and go ahead and hit enter
now you can see we've got this PHP page
displayed with the PHP version and
everything so this is our PHP info
function that printed all of this stuff
out okay so that's what PHP info does
this function over here it makes this
thing print out now the other
alternative is instead of typing
localhost you could type the address 127
dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 okay and that
basically means localhost so if we go
ahead and type in the word tutorials
after that we come to the same page okay
and the reason for that is because
localhost and 120 27.0 to 0 to 1 they
basically mean the same thing
I basically prefer to type the word
localhost now it's probably worth
mentioning that if we hadn't made a new
folder via and instead if we saved it
directly in this htdocs folder as
another file so let's go ahead and just
I'll save it as first dot PHP
okay yes that's fine then to get to this
page all I'd have to do in the browser
is type in localhost and then firs dot
PHP okay
and now I've actually reached that PHP
file but right now it's blank okay now
that is because htdocs is the root
directory okay and if we want to go one
folder further than htdocs we have to
type that folders name in the URL which
is why we typed in the word tutorials
okay and what we're actually doing on
the top in tutorials we're going to a
file called index dot PHP which is what
I saved it as so that's just the way
your folder structure is going to have
to work with xampp
I just made the folder the tutorials
folder because I wanted to keep
everything nice and tidy because having
a whole bunch of PHP files over here
would probably look very untidy so if
it's all under one tutorials folder it's
going to look a lot neater and that's
why I did that so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we will learn how to
print something out in the browser and
as always don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment give
the video a thumbs up or share the video
it's really going to help my channel
grow so thank you very much
and
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
