here and welcome to tutorial number 39
and in this tutorial we're gonna take a
look at a few other input elements that
you can use in the browser or in HTML
and yeah to get started with this
tutorial I've gone ahead and cleared out
all the other code that was in our form
so now we have just a form and an input
element of type submit' so that's our
input submit button and if you look at
that in the browser so let's look at
Firefox this is pretty much what it
looks like in fact of course you guys
will see it like this when it's zoomed
out so that buttons all small and stuff
but I'm just zooming in a little bit so
that you guys can see very clearly
what's going on here and for the purpose
of this tutorial I'm also going to be
using Google Chrome because I just want
to show you guys where certain input
elements might look a little bit
different and also yeah basically
there's some input elements that were
going to look at that is supported by
Chrome but are not really supported by
Firefox and yeah that's the reason why
I'm using two browsers in this video so
let's go ahead and start by looking at
the input element of type submit' or
type file sorry so let's get a little
type in input and I'm gonna give it a
type of file and I'm gonna give it a
name of file upload or something right
so whatever you're expecting the user to
upload with this input element you can
go ahead and just put that as the name
and then I want to put in a double break
tag just to space everything out a
little bit better right so let's save
come back over to the browser and
refresh and now you can see in Firefox
we have our submit or not our submit
button bar file upload button over here
and the great thing about this is you
can click on it and it's gonna open a
little window where you can then select
a file that you want to upload to the
server or to the website hit open and
yeah
the name is gonna appear there right but
this doesn't automatically upload a file
to the server when I click Submit you
can see it goes through to login dot PHP
which is our action over here on the
form right so whatever action you put in
there that's where it's going to take
you and hopefully this file whatever
this file is has some smart PHP code
that allows the user to upload and save
the file if not yeah then that data is
kind of lost right and yeah we haven't
learned about PHP just yet so we'll
learn about that in future okay
anyway so now we've taken a look at the
file submit there are a few other
options that we can look at one of those
input one of the other types of inputs
that we can take a look at is something
called an email input and this is new to
html5 so some of the elements that I
have most of the elements that I've
shown you have been around in HTML for a
really long time but some of the
elements that I'm going to be talking
about now have only been around since
html5 so they're fairly new and some
browsers support them other browsers
don't support them it just depends on
what browser you're using most of the
good browsers do but yeah you'll see in
certain cases
oh why I have chrome open here as well
all right so let's go over to the input
type of the second input and change that
to email and then for the name we can
also just set that to email right and if
we save this and jump back over to the
browser you can see what we have what
looks like an empty text box it's
probably better if I place a placeholder
in here just to make that tell us what
we're needing to put in there right and
now you'll see if I type in James just a
name James or whatever you want it to
type in you'll see that when I click out
of that text box or that email box we
now have a red line
around the element and if I hit submit
the browser won't let this form submit
without a valid email address so right
now this is just a person's name it's
not an email address the browser
automatically knows that because of this
type being set to email and so this is
something that like like I said it's new
to html5 if these elements were not
around before but basically it
automatically validates an email so you
don't have to use PHP or JavaScript to
do it for yourself although it's still
recommended that you check on the server
with PHP if it is an actual valid email
but let's type in a valid email here so
James ATS email comm right now if we go
out of this box you can see that we
don't have an error and I can actually
submit this form because this is a valid
email address the email address might
not actually exist but we do have a name
we do have an @ symbol and we do have a
domain at something.com
or add something dot c @ @ za or
whatever it is so the browser knows that
this looks like an or like a valid email
so we'll go ahead and let the user
submit the form right so now we've gone
ahead and looked at email let's look at
the next one I want to show you guys
which is telephone number and so this is
not going to look very different in the
browser at all if we refresh you can see
that this just looks like a normal text
box and even if we type letters in here
it lets us type the letters and it's not
automatically validating anything but
the nice thing about this one is it will
if you open it on your phone give you a
keyboard that has numbers only so
instead of popping up with the entire
QWERTY keyboard it just pops up with the
numbers 0 to 9
a hash symbol and a star symbol or
whatever and basically that the same
keyboard that you have when you're
phoning somebody is the same keyboard it
gives you when you want to fill in a
telephone number
so basically users who are on their
phone will find it a lot easier to place
a telephone number in this input element
because they can only select numbers
right so that is telephone by the way I
should have changed that name to
telephone not that it matters now anyway
right
the next element I want to show you guys
is going to be the month element so
let's go ahead and change the type here
to month and the name to month and the
placeholder to month right so save that
come back over the browser hit refresh
and in Firefox this looks like a normal
text box and the users actually going to
have to type like January or whatever
month they want to work with right
whereas if you look at it in Google
Chrome
so let's come back here and refresh all
these other elements look pretty much
the same but you'll see that this month
element looks very different to the way
it looked in firefox and if you click on
this you can actually use these little
arrows to select a month and it'll only
give you the option of January through
to December and the nice thing about
this one as well is if you look at it on
your phone it'll also give you just a
little drop-down list so you can pick a
month easier on your phone rather than
having to type out the entire month name
you can just select it in a drop-down
list and you'll see also it gives us
another second option here which allows
us to select the year right and so
that's the difference between Firefox
and Chrome is that chrome actually
supports this date element or the state
input type whereas Firefox doesn't
actually support that a month input type
and therefore it just shows as
a normal text box right then there are a
few others that we can work with so
let's take a look at what time does or
let's go
time time time time I don't think I've
even actually used time ever but again
in Firefox it just looks like a normal
text box but in Google Chrome and also
if you look at this on your phone it'll
give you a little bit of a better
elements to work with so now you can
actually pick a time down to the hours
minutes and I think this will be a.m.
and p.m. yeah okay so there we go
these are some of the input elements I'm
not going to run through all of them but
if you go over to w3 schools I'll leave
this link in the video description you
can go ahead and check out some of these
elements in fact you will have to scroll
down the page somewhat but all of these
types are listed down here one of the
ones that might be worth looking at is
range because this one works in Firefox
and Chrome so let's just take a look at
range as well let's go down here range
range and range sort save this jump back
and go to Chrome and let's take a look
and you can see that you can now select
a range of basically a number but we
don't actually have a number count over
here so there's still some missing kind
of info that we definitely need a place
in this element and you might want to
just read about that somewhere and then
the same thing in Firefox you've got
this little range selector but again you
don't know actually how much you're
selecting so yeah you definitely want to
use JavaScript or something to to put a
little number next to here so you can
see ok that's 100 and this is zero right
and yeah now that we've taken a look at
the different types of inputs
and you guys know what they look like in
different browsers and you know that it
also works differently on a phone you
can go ahead and play around with those
I just want to send a shout out to my
