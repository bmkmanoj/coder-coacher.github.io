here and welcome to tutorial number 6 in
my JavaScript series and in this video
what I want to talk to you guys about is
operators so I've got it written up
there now if you guys are confused and
you don't know what an operator is well
let me explain it's basically all those
plus and minus symbols that you see
whenever you are writing a maths
equation okay so let's start off by
making two variables and I'm going to
make one variable called apples and I'm
going to set that equal to five then I'm
going to make another variable called PI
and I'm going to set that equal to three
okay now what I want to do is I just
want to cover addition and subtraction
that the addition and subtraction
operators okay which is pretty simple
and it's basically just the plus sign to
add and the minus sign to defy subtract
so let's go ahead and make a variable
here and we can call it apple pie and we
set this equal to apples plus PI and
what this does is it adds the number
five to the number three and we'll land
up with the answer of eight so let's go
ahead and print this out on the screen
document dot write and we can write the
word apples so go ahead and save this
and if we run this in Firefox then we
should get the number mmm I've printed
apples instead of apple pie okay go
ahead and save this and when we run this
in Firefox we should get the number 8
printed on the screen so as you can see
JavaScript does indeed use the plus
symbol to add two numbers together and
that's the same with the minus symbol if
you go ahead and just use the minus sign
there
those two would subtract and we get the
answer to okay now what our actually
want to talk to you guys about is the
multiplication sign because that's a
little bit different to what you might
expect so whenever you have to multiply
a number in JavaScript you don't use
like a letter X or anything like that
what you actually do is you use the
asterisk symbol which is the little star
if you hold shift and push number eight
then you get the little star which then
says five times three which means that
we should get the answer 15 printed out
on our screen so let's go ahead and
click refresh here and we've now got 15
so javascript does indeed use this
asterisk symbol to multiply two numbers
together and what about divide you may
ask well to divide two numbers you use
the forward slash so now we can go ahead
and divide five by three and we'll get
the answer one point six six six six six
whatever okay so one point six recurring
and that's pretty much how to divide two
numbers but those were all pretty basic
those are all pretty simple now what I
want to talk to you guys about is
something called modulus and some of you
guys are probably thinking what the heck
what is modulus well modulus is the
remainder of two values okay or two
numbers so let's say we have five and
we've got three okay if I divided five
by three you saw I got one point six six
six but what if I didn't want a decimal
number what if I actually wanted the
remainder of the two numbers well 3 goes
into 5 once which means we have a
remainder of two okay so when we want to
work with modulus in JavaScript we use
the percent sign okay so apples percent
pie means apples
Mud Pie okay which is 5 mod 3 and that
should equal 2 so let's go ahead and
refresh this and as you can see we have
to print it out on the screen so that's
pretty easy actually and if you guys are
still confused we could choose some
other numbers so let's say I had 4 and I
had 12 okay 4 goes into 12 exactly 3
times which means that there is no
remainder so let's go ahead and click
refresh here and as you can see we've
got 0 printed out on the screen so that
is correct okay now I actually just want
to change these back to 5 and 3 and we
can talk about something else called
increment and decrement ok so what I
actually want to do is just turn this
back to add again as well okay so now
we've got apple pie is apples plus PI
which is 8 okay we know that to be 8 but
whatever what if I wanted to add one to
apple pie just before I printed it out
well I can use the increment value to
add one to apple pie so let's go ahead
and type in our variable name here which
is apple pie and what I could do now is
use the increment symbol which is
actually two plus signs and then end it
off with my semicolon and what this
means is apple pie plus 1 so we know
apples is our apple pie is equal to 8
now plus 1 that will be 9 so let's go
ahead and click refresh here and as you
can see we've got 9 printed out on the
screen
ok so that's pretty cool I can add one
to a number very easily
well what happened if I wanted to minus
one from my variable really easily
well that is called decrement and that I
can do with two minus symbols so if I go
ahead and say apple pie minus minus
then what this does is it subtracts one
from Apple by so we know apple pie is
eight over here now after this line it
should be equal to seven so let's go
ahead and go back to Firefox and click
refresh and as you can see we now have
seven printed on the screen okay so
that's all quite easy and what I want to
talk to you guys about now our
assignment operators okay so the most
common assignment operator that we work
with in javascript is actually the equal
sign with you can see we've been using
it the whole time okay so the equal sign
is called the assignment operator and
what that does is it like you've seen
for the past few tutorials is it assigns
this value to that variable okay so
whatever it assigns whatever's on the
right to whatever variable is on the
left so that's pretty simple and we've
been doing it the whole time
but what happened if we wanted to use
something called an a compound
assignment operator well what we could
do there is a if if I deleted this line
I could actually just add apples to PI
another way and what I could do is I
could type my variable apples and then
if I put in the plus and then the equal
sign what this is is the compound
addition operator so it's going to take
apples and plus it and assign whatever
value is on the right so let's say I
said apple pie well apples plus equals
PI and then I print it out apples down
here on the bottom apples we should now
get eight again but we've just done it a
different way
so let's go ahead and run this in
Firefox
and there we go we've got eight okay so
basically this just means compound
addition so instead of creating a new
variable what we did was we just use the
one we had existing over here and added
three with this symbol over there okay
and that's pretty easy to understand so
what if I wanted to - what's a compound
subtraction I could then go ahead and
say - equals and that will take five and
minus three and then assign that very
that value to apples so we can use minus
equals as compound subtraction and we
can even use multiplication equals to
basically multiply five by three and
then the new variable or the new value
is stored in the variable apples and
then again we can do the same thing with
divide so they all have their own
compound assignment operator as well
okay so that's quite cool and that's
pretty much all I had to talk to you
guys about in this tutorial so thank you
