here and this is tutorial number 42 and
in this tutorial we are going to
continue talking about tables and I'm
actually going to be talking about
colspan and rowspan specifically so
colspan and rowspan allow us to make a
column that spans over multiple cells or
we can go ahead and use rows band to
make a row or a henna cell span over
multiple rows so by the way that's
supposed to make a cell span over
multiple columns I might have mixed that
up a second ago but yeah okay so now
let's go ahead and learn how to do that
so I'm going to be using this table
which we made in the previous tutorial
okay and if you guys don't have this
table because you didn't watch the
previous tutorial go back and watch that
and you'll be good to go so if we take a
look at this in the browser we've got
something that looks kind of like this
where we have our caption and then our
table but what I want to do is actually
make this caption part of the table so
the first thing I'm going to do is make
this caption appear in the first row and
actually take up or make a cell that
spans all four columns in the first row
for that caption so let's go ahead and
do that so to do that I'm going to start
off a table row and I'm going to end off
a table row so we're going to get rid of
that caption tag okay then the next
thing I'm going to do is create a table
cell over here so we're going to do that
by just making one called table data and
we're just going to close that off but
we now want to make this cell actually
spot span over multiple columns because
if i refresh this right now you can see
we've got this table data or this table
cell over here span
over only one column and that is kind of
annoying because now you've got these
other three columns over here that
actually have nothing above them and
this first column called rank is
stretched way out much further than it
needs to be because you know we only
have a one num one digit number in here
so it really doesn't need to be as wide
as it is right now
so I'm going to go ahead and add an
attribute over here called colspan
and I'm going to set that equal to how
many columns we want this cell to span
over so you can see that the rest of our
rows all consist of four cells so that
means that we want this column to span
over four cells so that it'll take up
the full width of the table so let's go
back and click refresh and as you can
see we now have this new cell up here
that actually spans over all of the
other columns so we've got one one
actual cell that spans over multiple
columns and that is what colspan
is used for and we can do the same thing
except make it span over multiple rows
and that is called row span so to do
that I'm going to go back over to CSS or
HTML I don't know why I keep calling it
CSS and what I'm actually going to do
here is take this cell and I'm going to
cut that out I'm going to get rid of
this row because we don't actually need
a blank row and what I'm going to do is
add that table data or that table cell
into our first row okay and if I go back
to Firefox now and click refresh things
are going to look a little bit funny
because we now have this one cell over
here and to be honest it let's change
that call span as well because we don't
actually need that attribute there
either okay because we're not going to
take a look at colspan anymore we're
taking a look at rowspan so click
refresh we now have this column over
here and then we have our actual rank is
out of place because the rank the
numbers 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
neither appear under this heading rank
and Tetris needs to appear under the
title not under the rank so everything's
shifted over 1 and you know that looks
kind of weird but what I want to do here
is actually make this cell span over
multiple rows so to do that I'm going to
go back to our table over here and I'm
going to go back to this this actual
table data and I'm going to give that an
attribute of row span and we're going to
set that equal to how many rows we want
this cell to span so if we take a look
at this we've got 1 2 3 4 5 rows that we
want that to span over so row span I'm
going to set equal to 5 click refer save
and come back and click refresh and as
you can see we've now pushed everything
back to where it's supposed to be so the
rank now has the numbers 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 a
title contains all the titles the
release here contains the years copy
sold has the copy sold but over here
we've got one huge cell which contains
our actual description of the table and
you know this probably isn't the best
way to do this but you know it's just an
example so if you guys ever want to make
a cell that spans over multiple rows
then that is how you do that and if you
want to make it span over multiple
columns then I just showed you guys how
to do that as well so yeah that's pretty
much all I have for you guys in this

really gonna help my channel grow and I
will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
