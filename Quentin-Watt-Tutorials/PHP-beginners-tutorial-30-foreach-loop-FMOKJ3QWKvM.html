here and welcome to tutorial number 30
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to use something called a
for each loop okay so let's talk about
why a for each loop is useful okay and
if you guys watch the previous two
tutorials then you will know that I
showed you guys how to loop through a
normal array so basically an array with
numbers in the index so like with a
number in the square brackets here like
zero or one or two okay and you guys
know that if we wanted to loop through
an array like this then our counter
could be substituted into the square
brackets over here and that way we could
loop through our array just fine okay
but that's because we were using numbers
now you guys know that I also showed you
guys how to use something called an
associative array where instead of using
a number in the square brackets okay we
were using a keyword or a name like Ryan
or Kyle okay but how do we tell the
computer to start looping at Ryan and
end looping at Quentin because the
computer is not going to know how to
loop through from Orion Kyle Sean
Quentin I mean even you guys didn't know
that I was going to loop through in that
order okay so this is where we will use
a for each loop okay that's where it
comes in handy and the reason that a for
each loop would work here is because a
for each loop doesn't use a counter it
doesn't use a starting point and it
doesn't use an ending point basically
you just give the for each loop an array
to loop through and it will loop for
each element
in that array so that's kind of where it
gets its name from now you can also use
a for each leave for a normal array and
there are a few other collections in PHP
that aren't arrays that you can use a
for each loop for as well but we're just
going to take a look at how to use it
with an array in this tutorial so let's
take a look at the syntax and basically
you're going to type in the word for
each put into parentheses and then the
curly braces and obviously the repeating
code would go here and in these
parentheses this is where it starts to
look a little bit different because like
I said we don't use a counter we don't
use a starting point and we don't use an
ending point so basically we just give
the for each loop an array that it needs
to loop through so we are basically
putting array over here and then we type
in the keyword as and then this next
part can look different depending on
whether you are using an associative
array or a normal array so if you're
using a normal array then you're just
going to go ahead and type in one
variable here and you can name it
anything you want I'll just call my
value for this purpose okay because it's
going to actually hold the value of our
array element okay and again if you are
using an associative array then you're
actually going to put in two variables
here so the first one would be your
array key so I'm just going to call my
variable key but of course you can call
it anything you want and then I'm going
to put in this little symbol which if
you guys have worked with associative
arrays then you know that that just
describes the relationship between the
key and our value so the second part
would then obviously be
our value so those are the two different
ways a for each loop can look oh that
probably didn't make much sense but
that's the two different ways or two
different methods that you can use for
each loop okay so let's take a look at
how to use an associate first normal
array and then we'll take a look at how
to use an associative array with this
loop okay
so let's make two arrays the first one
I'm going to call normal array surprise
surprise and I'll set that equal to
obviously array and we'll put three
names in here so just three girls names
I guess so the first one can be Sandra
the second one can be Courtney and the
last one can be Samantha okay then let's
also make an associative array so I'll
call this a sock array what a creative
naming convention I have and obviously
this will be an array that is going to
be an associative array so the first one
can be Ryan or that's going to be our
key and the value is going to be 150 so
straight from the previous tutorial then
the next one will set in ask Kyle and I
think he owed me 20 195 and my dogs are
barking okay I told him to shut up
okay so now we're going to put in our
third value which will have a key off
Sean and we all say that Sean owed me
$0.99 okay so now we've got these two
arrays let's loop through each of them
so because our first array that we're
going to loop through is a normal array
don't actually need this key so just go
for each and we've got to put in the
actual array name here which is going to
be normal array as value and now that we
actually have an array on our page it's
a lot more clearer or a lot more clear
to see what this value is going to be
equal to so the first time our loop runs
or the first time it iterates value is
going to be equal to sandra then the
second time it iterates value will be
equal to courtney and the third time
value will be Samantha so you guys kind
of get the point
so let's echo out value and then we'll
append on our variable value and then
we'll also append on a break so that
everything appears on a new line so
break okay so now when we save this and
go back to Firefox
we should get value Sandra or yeah okay
so value Sandra value Courtney and value
Samantha
so we basically printed out what the
value of our variable was each time the
loop iterated okay so that's basically
how to use a for each loop with a normal
array let's take a look at how to use it
with an associative array so I'm just
going to go ahead and throw in our
variable here or our array a stock array
and because this is an associative array
we're going to have to use our key as
well so key value okay
and now we can do some pretty cool stuff
because we can type out or we can echo
out our key which would obviously be the
first time the loop iterates it would be
Ryan and the second time a loop iterates
our key would be Kyle and so on so we
can say key which would be in this case
be Ryan
owes you and then we can echo out value
obviously don't forget to put in your
little period symbols which append
everything on and then we'll just type
in the break tag over here as well so
that everything appears on a new line so
basically what we're printing our j is
ryan owes you then the amount that ryan
owed me which is 150 again next time it
ran Kyle owes you 2195 and you guys
obviously get the point
so let's go back here and click refresh
rhino's you 150 carlo's you 2195 and
Sean owes you 99 cents so that's how you
guys use a for each loop in PHP I hope
it comes in handy and as always thanks

and all that other good stuff it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
