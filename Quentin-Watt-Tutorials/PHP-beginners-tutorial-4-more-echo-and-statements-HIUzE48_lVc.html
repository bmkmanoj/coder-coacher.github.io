here and welcome back to tutorial number
four and in this tutorial I'm going to
speak to you guys a little bit more
about echoing text out to the browser so
in the previous video we left off having
learned all about the escape character
and how we can use the escape character
to escape quotation marks that would
otherwise give us an error okay but
there's a little bit more to it than
that because not only can we print out
normal text or plain text like this we
can also print out HTML tags as well so
let's say I wanted to print out the
words welcome to PHP but I wanted those
words to be a header I could go ahead
and put in an h1 tag and an ending h1
tag and type welcome to PHP in here and
when I go ahead and save this and go
back to Firefox and click refresh you
can see I've got welcome to PHP
displayed as a header so it didn't print
out the actual smaller than and greater
than sign with the h1 in the middle
anything it actually read that or
interpreted that as HTML and printed
that out as HTML as well okay so that's
one cool thing about PHP is that we can
that we've got the ability to print out
HTML elements as well okay and using our
escape character we could also go ahead
and give this heading an ID so we could
use single quotation marks or we could
use the double ones again and just
escape them to give to give this heading
an ID so let's say we set the ID equal
to something like heading they
that would work just fine as well okay
so if we actually had like some CSS to
control that ID it would change as well
but we don't actually have anything like
that at the moment okay and the next
thing I wanted to speak to you guys
about is called string concatenation and
that is whenever you take two or more
different strings or sentences and you
join them together so let's go ahead and
just make two different sentences over
here so I'll just say hi my name is
Quinton Quinton couldn't even spell my
own name right that's embarrassing okay
so hi my name is Quinton and then the
next one can say I am 21 years old okay
so if we try and run this just as it is
in Firefox right now we're going to get
a bit of an error okay
so let's go ahead and refresh and as you
can see unexpected I am 21 years old
okay
that's because we ended our string and
again PHP didn't know what this was okay
so we actually have to join these two
different strings together somehow and
that's where this little full stop or if
you guys might call it the dot separator
or a period symbol okay that's where
that comes in handy okay because it
joins this sentence or the string to
that string so if we go ahead and save
this and now we refresh this in Firefox
you can see I've got hi my name is
Quinton I am 21 years old so they have
joined together if you guys want it to
look a little bit tidier and have a
space then you just need to include that
space in your string so if we go back to
Firefox now
you can see we've got the space there
okay and another way to actually print
out two completely different strings is
if instead of using the full stop you
could use the comma so it does the exact
same thing really if we go back here and
click refresh you can see nothing
changes and that's because this comma
was joining the two strings exactly the
same as the full stop was okay so it was
just printing out one section and then
the next section now whenever you want
to print out more than one line okay you
could have also done it like this okay
so we could have had echo and then echo
again okay but whenever we have more
than one statement because this thing in
PHP would be that would be one statement
and this would be another new statement
okay so whenever we're going to print
out or use more than one statement in
PHP we have to use a semicolon just to
end off our statements okay so that's
something I didn't tell you guys in the
last tutorial which I knew I had to work
it into this tutorial somehow and that
basically just tells PHP okay this is
the end of this statement okay so the
semicolon is the end of the statement
and this semicolon is the end of the
statement it's the same thing as using a
full stop in English at the end of a
sentence in programming or in PHP we
just use a semicolon at the end of a
statement just to tell the computer okay
that is the end of the statement so just
remember if you ever want to have more
than one statement in between the PHP
tags you have to use a semicolon if
you're only going to have one statement
then semicolon isn't necessary but if
you're going to have to then
you have to have a semicolon otherwise
you'll get an error okay and the last
thing I should probably mention is that
I've been teaching you guys how to print
stuff out on the screen
using the word echo okay but if you guys
want to use the word print that works
exactly the same it does pretty much
exactly the same thing as echo except
it's one character longer so it's longer
to type so I guess it saves you time
when you're coding to type echo instead
of print okay and the other thing is
most people always type echo anyways
they don't type print so if we go ahead
and just change that back I'll be using
echo in the series but if you guys want
to use print then that's up to you so
