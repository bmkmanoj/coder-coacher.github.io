to tutorial number 8 and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to make links on the same webpage so
some of you guys are probably wondering
why I am at the Wikipedia website and
reading up about the University of South
Africa and there are two reasons and the
first reason is actually that this is
the university which I go to now I apply
the last year and I got accepted to
study information technology so that's
programming and networking and stuff
which is pretty cool so this is the
university that I'm going to and I just
thought I'd I'd share that with you guys
and if any other cars from your niece
are watching don't be afraid to leave a
comments and I'll reply back to you and
the second reason why I'm here is
because I wanted to show you guys how to
make a link to the same webpage so as
you can see Unisa
or Wikipedia sorry has got a whole table
of contents here which you can click on
and then link down to the paragraph so
let's say I wanted to read up about when
Unisa was founded I'd go here I click on
Unisa Foundation and BAM there we go I'm
at the paragraph about Unisa foundation
Unisa was founded and established in
1966 now imagine I wanted to come here
and that table of contents wasn't there
I'd have to come read Unisa you know
like looking for foundation ok that's
not there I can when was in isa founded
and I don't know confound it
and like eventually you know our Unisa
foundation okay so you know that's
that's how the linking to the same page
is useful and that's what I'm going to
show you guys how to do in this tutorial
so yeah let's just close Wikipedia and
let's get started and I prepared a web
page in the just before this tutorial
hold on I've lost my mouse Wow where are
you there we go no I lost it again
look there we go found it cool it was
lost on the other screen somewhere
embarrassing but anyways so I prepared
this web page I guess if you can call it
just before this tutorial it's basically
just like a whole bunch of rubbish
really it's like some content lorem
ipsum whatever all you know what is that
Latin and then we get to this paragraph
down here that says this is the only
paragraph that makes sense let's see if
we can find this paragraph and then
there's an image of year when you scroll
further down and then just some more
rubbish again so let's go back to
notepad plus plus where I've got all of
this code in over here already so this
is just an example you guys can probably
make up all your own rubbish as well
just as long as you've got a really long
page that you have to scroll to get to
whatever you're looking for and then
what we need to do is we need to find
that paragraph there we go
if we want to make a link that will link
down to this paragraph over here that
says this is the only paragraph that
makes sense the first thing I have to do
is make a target over here so let me
just add in my anchor tags and I'm not
going to put anything in between yet
because I don't want it to be actually
clickable but oh I don't want any of the
text turn blue or anything and then I'm
going to give my my first anchor tag and
attributes called
aim so obviously I told you guys that
when you make an attribute it's the name
of the attribute and then equals and
then to quotation marks and inside there
you put your attribute so I'm just going
to give it a name called sense seeing as
it's the only paragraph that makes sense
and yeah that's pretty much it we're not
going to make an HOA for anything
because this is just the destination
which we want to land up at once we
click our link and right at the top of
the page if I scroll all the way up we
can make our link so let's just give
some space so that it looks tidy and
there we go we'll just add in our anchor
tags and then we can you know put a link
up here that says cents or something so
that we can link to the only page that
makes sense and then we'll add in our
href attribute which we learnt about in
the last two tutorials and in here we're
going to put the pound sign or I'll call
it the hash I don't know what anyone
else calls it and then we're going to
put the name of our name attribute down
here which is cents so let me scroll all
the way up there again and just type
since and when I save this and I run
this in Firefox we'll end up with this
link at the top of the page here and if
I click this link we go straight to the
page that makes sense or the paragraph
that makes sense how cool is that since
and I'm there and if I scroll all the
way back up yeah so that's pretty cool
that's you know it's quite easy to make
actually so why don't we just go ahead
and make another one
so let's why don't we just link down to
that image over there cool so let's make
my target here a and in da and in here
we'll just type in name equals and then
we'll just call it image or something
yeah and when I scroll back up to the
top of the page obviously I just need to
do the same thing again just making a
link
so mother just put that on new line what
did I call it I call that image if I'm
correct and then we'll just stop the
image over here I'll soon and if I go
back to Firefox and refresh I should
have two links at the top of the page
there we go
so now when I click on since I land up
here by the paragraph that makes sense
and if I scroll all the way to the top
and I click on the image I get the image
how cool is that
so there we go guys that's how you make
a link within the same web page and also
how it's useful so thank you guys for
