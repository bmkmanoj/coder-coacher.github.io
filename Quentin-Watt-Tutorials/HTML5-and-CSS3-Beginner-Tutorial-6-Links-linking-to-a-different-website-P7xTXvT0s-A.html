and welcome back to tutorial number 6
and in this tutorial I promise to sound
a little bit more interesting guys
because you know what I went back and I
watched my previous videos and yeah I
have to admit they are quite boring but
anyways like I said I am working on that
and I'm going to try sound a little bit
more interesting from now on and then of
course the main reason why we are here
is to learn a little bit of HTML so
let's get back to our HTML tutorial and
in this video I'm going to show you guys
how to add a link to your web page and
links are quite cool because they allow
us to travel between different web pages
quickly with a simple click and then we
don't have to type in the URL at the top
of our Firefox browser every single time
we want to go to a new page we can just
click on the link and bam we add our
next page so you know imagine going to a
website where they didn't have any links
at all I mean how boring would that be
like I mean you'd go to the web page and
it would kind of look something like
this and you just be stuck staring at
like one web page and you know not be
able to doing anything and yeah not the
greatest web page in the world so let's
go ahead and make a link and to do that
we have to use what is called the anchor
tag so you have to go ahead and use a
smaller than greater than salon and
inside there the keyword is just a for
anchor so that's pretty cool and then to
end it off obviously just /a and there
we go anything in between these two tags
over here will be a link and I'm just
going to type in this will be a link to
my youtube channel also and then when
you go ahead and save that if you go to
Firefox now and refresh you'll see it
says that this will be a link but when
you click on it nothing happens just
it's highlighting the text so that's not
exactly what we were after and that's
because I left out one thing and I left
it out on purpose just so that you guys
remember this a little bit better and
that is that when we use a link
it also requires one attribute and the
attribute that a link requires is called
href and that stands for hypertext
reference and we actually have to set
that equal to something and what we do
is we set it equal to the website which
we want our link to go to so we go link
I mean href equals and then my youtube
channel is HTTP like as you can see you
guys actually have to type in the entire
webpage address you can't just type in
youtube.com or something so HTTP
www.youtube.com forward slash and then
I'm going to go straight to my channel
so it's forward slash user for - and
then my name Quinton what and that
should take you guys to my youtube
channel straight away when you click on
it so let's go ahead and save that and
run that in Firefox and there we go we
have a link and when I click it if I
typed in my URL correctly I did there we
go we land up on my YouTube channel and
yeah like I said my browser is a little
bit small at the moment but there we go
that's how to link to another page in
your in a new HTML website and as you
can see when you guys take a look at
this there's my youtube channel I got a
couple subscribers couple views and it
would be really nice if you guys just
went ahead and click on that subscribe
button because if you do something
amazing what happened but I can't tell
you because it's a secret so that's all
I got for you guys in this tutorial guys
come back next time
and we can do something awesome and
amazing don't forget to subscribe please
