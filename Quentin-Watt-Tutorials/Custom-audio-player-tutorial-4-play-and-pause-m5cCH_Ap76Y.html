here and this is tutorial number four
and in this tutorial we are going to
continue with our audio player and I'm
going to show you guys how to play and
pause the audio track or the audio file
using javascript so something I'm going
to do here is just go over to my audio
file and add the controls attribute and
the reason why I'm doing this is not so
that like we can take a shortcut or
anything like that we're still going to
continue with the JavaScript but we're
just going to need certain controls over
here while we're testing so while we're
testing I just want these to be here
okay and they're just showing up right
there if you're using Chrome they might
look a little bit different but our
custom controls will look the same so
yeah okay then the next thing we're
going to have to do is go over to our
controls file and we're going to have to
link this controls file to this index
page right so the way I'm going to do
that is by adding a script tag and I'm
going to say script and ending scripts
like that and I'm going to give my
script tag a type and I'm also going to
give my script tag a source okay so my
type is going to be a text slash
JavaScript and my source is going to be
controls dot jas and the reason why my
sauce is controls j/s is because the
source is going to be whatever file I
want to link to and in this case we're
going to be using that controls dot j/s
file which just so happens to be in the
same directory as my html5 file so we
just specify the file name we don't have
to go into any depth with the file path
or anything like that okay and the
reason why I gave it a type is just to
give the browser
some information and let it know that
we're using JavaScript over here okay
and some guys might be asking well why
is my script tag down here and not in
the head and it's completely possible
that people will put it in the head and
it'll prolly still work but I like to
have my script tag at the end of the
page just because let's say you're
calling functions that happen on the
page load while a while the page is
loading then certain things might not
work but when you have your script file
down here before the closing tag of the
body then this entire page has already
loaded by the time we get to the script
so it gets rid of any of those weird
issues that sometimes people can't
figure out how to solve so I'm just
going to go ahead and put that there and
if we want to test this javascript file
then we can go ahead and just type in
window dot alert and we can say
something like works and now when I go
over to Firefox and click refresh I've
got this alert box that pops up and says
it works okay so if if you type in this
to check if your controls file is
working or not and you don't get that
then it's not working let me just point
that out but if it is working then we're
safe we're good to go and we need to
continue with the rest of our code so
I'm going to show you guys how to play
and pause content or play and pause our
audio track and the way we do that is by
first of all making a variable so I'm
going to make a variable called my track
and I'm going to set that equal to
document don't get element by ID and
we're going to get the element my track
so my track
okay and the my the element that has the
idea of my track happens to be our audio
file over here so that's why we gave it
that ID and basically an audio tellement
has a method called play so whenever I
type my track dot play just like that
then this will play our audio track so
if I go back here and I click refresh
you can hear that the audio is now
playing let me go ahead and click pause
on those controls and yeah that's why
those controls are this that I can pause
it um because my controls don't work yet
so we still need to make my controls
work then the other attribute that or
not attribute the other method that we
can use here is pause and that will
pause our content or pause our audio
whenever this is called so now that we
know that we can pause and play content
or pause and play our audio with those
two methods we need to find some way of
actually calling those methods whenever
we need them right because whenever we
type them just like this then it means
that every time the the browser is
refreshed then that code gets cold right
and we don't want it to be called
whenever the browser's refresh we want
it to be called whenever a button gets
clicked or something like that so let's
create a function and call play call it
play or pause and basically now we can
call this function whenever a button
gets clicked so we need to know now or
we need to be able to check whether our
content is paused or whether it is
playing so we're going to use an if
statement and I'm going to say if my
track dot paused okay
and I've got my exclamation mark here
which means not and paused is obviously
going to return true if our track is
paused and false if it is not paused so
if my track is not paused and my track
has not ended my track dot ended then
this means that our track has to be
playing because if it's not paused and
it hasn't come to an end yet it's
playing so that is good good logic right
there and then we need to what we need
to do then is pause the content whenever
this function gets called so I'm going
to say my track dot pause and this will
then pause our content if our content is
playing but what happens you know if
it's not playing well then we want to
make our content play or our audio play
so then we can just say else let's just
play the content so that should be my
track the dot
play and that is going to play the audio
so now if I go back to our HTML file
over here and I call that whenever this
button is clicked so let's say on click
play or pause then this should play or
pause our content or our audio whenever
this has been clicked so go back to
Firefox here click refresh click the
play button and it's playing click the
pause button and it's paused awesome so
you can see our logic is working here
now we need to do something else and
that is a noticeable in the browser
because whenever I click play
this play button doesn't change it still
says play and we want a pause button to
show obviously so I'm going to click
play again and again you can see now
that's paused the content but we need a
pause button to show up so let's go over
to our JavaScript file over here and use
JavaScript to change the background
image on our button so I'm going to
create a new variable here and I'm going
to call this play button and I'm going
to set that equal to document dot get
element by ID and I'm going to grab
whatever element has the ID of play
button and that just happens to be our
actual play button right so now that
we've got this play button stored as a
variable I can access some of its
properties by saying play button dot
whatever property I want to access so
I'm going to grab the style property and
then I'm also going to grab the
background image property so what this
is going to allow us to do is change the
background image of our button and I'm
going to set that equal to and we have
to have single quotes whenever we're
working with styling of a natural
styling of a well whenever we're working
with the style property we have to have
quotation marks here because this is
going to turn out to be CSS code which
we all know like can turn out to be a
string so I'm going to set that out to
URL and then basically we're going to do
the same thing we do here to set and a
background image in CSS so URL that I
did so that thing okay cool put that in
over here accidentally chopped up my
quotation mark there
but URL huh okay
so if our track is playing then we want
to pause it and we want to add a play
button so this line of code like that is
correct because this is going to turn
our button into a play button whenever
the track gets paused but whenever we
play our track then we want our button
to change to a pause button because we
want the user to click the pause button
to actually pause the content so play
and pause for the function so let's go
back here now and click refresh and you
can see I'm getting so lost into my
actual code I'm not even looking up the
camera anymore but when I click and play
I've got my play button showing and when
I click hmmm something funky happening
here aha semicolons perhaps in the wrong
place
let's see play aha
there we go okay so now we've got our
pause button showing up when I click
that again then we've got our play
button showing up click again pause
playing pause play pause play cool so
we're able to play and pause our con our
audio with JavaScript and it works
perfectly fine something else
that would come in handy though is
instead of using the unclick attribute
over here we can use JavaScript to
determine whether this button has been
clicked or not so I'm going to go over
here and add an event listener so I'm
going to say play well we're actually
gonna have to do it underneath the
variables heaven aren't we so I'm going
to try and listen up for anytime this
play button gets clicked so play button
dot add event
listener listener like that and we're
going to listen for if it is clicked so
that is our first argument that we have
to supply into here then we're also
going to have to add a second argument
which is what function do we want to
call whenever our play button gets
clicked and that is going to be this
function over here play or pause so I'm
going to add that in over here and then
this last argument that we place
whenever we're adding an event listener
is going to be either true or false and
for the most part that is always going
to be false so I'm just going to leave
that as false for now and if I ever tell
you guys to put true in there then you
can put true but for the most part it's
almost always going to be false okay so
now let's test it without the unclick
attribute over here so click refresh
click play and it plays click pause and
it pauses so we've used javascript to
listen for an event rather than waiting
or adding that event in as an attribute
over here so the Hat is how you play and
pause content or playing pause audio
using javascript and that is all I have
for you guys in this video so don't

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys in the next
