here and welcome to tutorial number 26
and in this tutorial I'm going to talk
to you guys about using a timer in
JavaScript to change an image on our
website okay
so right now I'm actually using all of
the code from our previous tutorial
where we had it that if I run this in
Firefox we have a Facebook image that is
showing and when I click on it it
changes to the Twitter image and when I
click on it again it changes back to the
Facebook image okay so I decided why not
do the exact same thing but instead of
having it that we have to click the
image we make it that the image changes
by itself over time okay and that way it
would look kind of like a rotating ad on
a website I'm sure most of you guys have
all been to web pages where they have
like an ad or a banner that like changes
every couple seconds just to attract
your eye towards that area and then
hopefully if it's an ad
maybe you click on it or something like
that okay so that's what we'll take a
look at doing in this tutorial so what
I'll do now is I'm going to show you
guys the syntax for the first method
that we can use and that is called the
set timeout method and the way you do
that or the way you use that is a you'll
type in this word set timeout but you're
also going to give it some properties or
some arguments actually okay and the
first argument is basically what
JavaScript code do you want to run when
this timer reaches the time okay so
you'll put in your code in here and then
the second argument you have to put in
is basically how long you want the timer
to wait be
for it execute this code okay so this is
going to be a time in milliseconds okay
and basically what that means is one
second is 1000 milliseconds so that
means that our timer will run after one
second but I don't want it to run off to
one second that's a little bit too fast
so I'll just make it two seconds okay
and what I'll do now is we need to put
in some JavaScript code here but we
already have code that changes that
image on our website it's over here it's
this function so we can go ahead and
instead of typing all this code in here
we can just call that function so
function change okay and now what will
happen is if we save this and go back to
Firefox and click refresh it starts off
as a Facebook image and then and then it
doesn't change and the reason why is I
made a typo so this method over here is
not set timeout
it's a set time out okay now when I save
this and I go back to Firefox and click
refresh after two seconds the image
changes okay so that's that's pretty
cool but now as you can see it's only
changed once it's not changing again why
is this not happening okay well that's
because this sit
timeout method only happens once okay so
what happens is this that I set when you
use a set timeout method it occurs once
it runs this code and it never happens
again
okay so if you want the timeout or you
want the timer to repeat and you want to
keep changing the image
then you can use this method called the
set interval method and this takes the
exact same arguments as the set timeout
method for exactly the same reasons
except now it will repeat every two
seconds because that's what I've put in
here two seconds so if I put in five
thousand then it would take 5 seconds to
repeat okay
but for now let's just keep that at two
and we'll save this and go back to
Firefox and click refresh and as you can
see it changes and then it changes again
and then it changes again but someone's
texting me so let me go ahead and read
that okay so I'm back and I told those
idiots to stop texting me okay cool so
we've got this image now that changes
every two seconds but if we want to be
able to use more than one interval or
more than one timeout on our webpage we
actually need to give these set timeouts
or set intervals a variable name so that
we can work with them later okay so I'm
just gonna call this one timer and we
can set it equal to that okay so now
we've got this variable here called
timer and it's it equal to this timer
now this doesn't actually change
anything to our program just yet so if
we refresh this every two seconds this
image still is going to change but now
if we ever get to a point in time where
we decide hey I'd really like to stop
this time I don't want my image to carry
on repeating well then what we can do is
we can clear that timer or clear that
interval using the clear interval method
okay and what this does is it will stop
this interval from happening
okay and the only argument needed in
these parentheses here is the variable
name of our time or of our interval
which I've called timer so we go ahead
and put that in there and what this does
is it stops our timer from actually
running but there's no point in putting
these two lines of code right next to
each other because we kind of make a
timer
over here oops make it time over here
and then we go ahead and clear it over
here there's no point the time is never
going to run so what I'm going to do is
just cut this out and instead we'll use
that on an event in our webpage so I'm
going to go ahead and on the click of my
image instead of changing the image will
tell the timer to stop okay and now when
we save this and go back to Firefox
click refresh as you can see the image
is still changing and I'm not clicking
on a yet but now when I do it's going to
stop so there we go you can see I've
only clicked on at once and it's not
changing anymore so that is how to clear
an interval so once once you've made it
and you decide well you want to clear it
again then you can go ahead and just
clear it like that okay so that's
awesome and that's how to make an image
that basically rotates kind of like an
ad but I should probably mention to you
guys that as you can see right now the
image is just changing it's not actually
like fading in or fading out or doing
any sort of weird effects like that okay
if you want to be able to do that you
guys need to learn something called
jQuery and that is actually a JavaScript
library so it's really best if you know
JavaScript first and then go on to
learning that so that's what I'll
probably do is I'll after I'm finished
making my JavaScript series move on to
making a
series like that so as always guys
