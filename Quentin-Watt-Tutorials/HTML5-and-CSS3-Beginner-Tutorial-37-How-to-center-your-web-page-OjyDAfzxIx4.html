to tutorial number 37 and in this
tutorial we can go ahead and start
actually styling our web page so before
we actually do that there's still a few
little things that we have to change on
our HTML but there's not many and the
first thing is actually just something
that's irritating me a little bit and
that is in my header of the website I
went ahead and I style or I used my
hitter to at the top of the page and
then further down I used a heading one
as the article header so I actually
think I need to go ahead and change that
so these should actually be hitter twos
and the top of the page should be a
heading one so that was just actually
irritating me a little bit that I did
that and I'm just gonna go ahead and
click Save and the next thing I want to
do is I need to we need to give
everything an ID so all the main parts
of our website that we want to go ahead
and start styling all need to have IDs
so that we can identify them so at the
top of my page I have my header and I
actually just want to give this an ID
and I'm gonna call it page under school
header header and then my navigation I
decided I'd give this an ID of top
underscore nav and underneath that we've
got our section and I decided I'll give
that an ID of the section seeing as
there's only one section so we're going
hit and we can skip everything here all
the articles and the footers in etc and
so we get to our ending section tag and
then we've got our aside and this is the
part of the website that needs to be on
the side of the browser so like it needs
to get moved over to the side and I'm
gonna give that an ID
offside underscore news and then last
but lost knee lot not least while what a
time to is there the footer of our web
page and I'm just gonna go ahead and
give that an ID and I'm gonna go ahead
and call that page underscore footer so
that's just the footer of our website
over there and there's one last thing
that we actually needed you and that is
just to put everything inside of a div
that we can use to Center our website so
as you can see you there's my ending
body tag
so I'm gonna select everything above my
ending body tag all the way to the top
of the page until I get to my starting
body tag and then I'm gonna go ahead and
push tab and that's just indented
everything one line further and I'm
going to go ahead and add in a new tag
called oh it's just gonna be a div tag
but I'm gonna give it an ID of Center
underscore maker and that's just gonna
be used to Center the whole webpage so
that's why I called it that and just
before we close off our body over here
we just need to end off that div so
there we go we now have everything that
we need to start styling our web page
and we can go over to our CSS and the
first thing whenever you start styling
your web page like this is you wanna get
rid of of all the defaults so as you can
see I've got an our website of yeah
we've got like a lot of space between
our image and our header and then again
with a lot of space between our header
and this link so via the navigation so
we want to get rid of all of that space
because you know it's actually kind of
annoying that it's there and you'll see
why later if you ever try style a web
page without getting rid of the defaults
so let's just get rid of defaults and
just in case you guys didn't know how to
make
comments in CSS that's pretty much how
you make it you just start off with your
ford slash and then you use the little
asterisk symbol and then you end it off
with the asterisk symbol and the forward
slash and anything and inside of that is
a comment so there we go that is one
comment and what we want to do now is
just get rid of the defaults so I'm
gonna use a little asterisk symbol over
there and what that does is it selects
everything on the webpage so let's just
go ahead and we can comment that there
so it selects everything on the web page
cool and now I'm just gonna go ahead and
set the margin to zero pixels and the
padding to zero pixels and now nothing
on our webpage should have a margin or a
padding and if we go back to the browser
and we click refresh you can see there
is no more padding or margins anymore
everything is like pushed up against
each other and there's like no space and
it's kind of difficult to read but we'll
go ahead and fix that later and now what
I want to do is I just want to select my
body tag because I want a different font
on the web page I don't want to use that
standard I guess this is Times New Roman
or something I don't want to use Times
New Roman so I just want to go font -
family and I completely set this to
Arial or something but then it might not
work on browsers or computers that have
Linux or something I don't think Arial
is on Linux or maybe it's Apple Mac I'm
not sure so I'm just gonna go ahead and
set this to sans-serif and now no matter
what browser they have or what operating
system they're on it'll get displayed as
a font that looks like Arial or close
enough to it and the amount we can do is
just text
align Center and that's just going to
throw everything into the center of the
page and now what I want to do is we can
get to work on starting to center our
webpage so let's just comment that yeah
centering the web page cool and what we
can do now is we have to obviously have
to grab our div that are labeled Center
maker which is this one right there and
we can go ahead and Center maker and
what I want to do now is obviously just
set that to a width of 960 pixels now
the reason why I chose 960 pixels is
because actually a lot of web designers
use a 960 pixel wide website and the
reason why they do that is because it
divides into three parts really well in
other words you can now have a three
column layout that's 320 pixels each so
we'll have like 320 pixels over here
like and then 320 pixels over here and
then 320 pixels over here so if you know
about Web Design that's just they use
columns to like lay everything out and
then after that we can go ahead and set
a border just to show you that the
website does indeed get centered so two
pixels solid red cool and then I'm gonna
go ahead and set the margin equal to
zero pixels and auto and if you don't
know what that does that pretty much
centers our web page so let's just go
ahead center centers the web page okay
what it actually does is it sets zero
pixels of margin on the top and zero
pixels of margin on the bottom
but then Otto goes ahead and it makes
the same amount of pixels on the left as
there is on the right and essentially
that sense is our page so that is pretty
easy and then I just want to go ahead
and say font no no no text a line lifts
because otherwise it would inherit this
text-align:center that we put in the
body and I don't want that but this is
just to helps in to the web page as well
so now if we go ahead and click Save and
we go back to Firefox and we click
refresh you can see we now have a web
page and everything on our web page is
now nice and neatly centered the same
amount of pixels on the left as there is
on the right and if I make my brows a
little bit bigger you can see the space
over there got bigger but if I move it
over here so you can see they've got
bigger on both sides so it kept the
browser or our little dev inside of our
browser exactly in the middle so that's
pretty much how to Center the web page
and in the next couple of tutorials will
obviously go over styling the rest of
our web page so thank you very much for
