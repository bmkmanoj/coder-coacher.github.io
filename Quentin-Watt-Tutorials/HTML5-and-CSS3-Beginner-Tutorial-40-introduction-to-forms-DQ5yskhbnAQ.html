back to tutorial number 40 and in this
tutorial we're actually done with this
whole little mini website that we're
making and I know you guys are pretty
sitting there like oh but it's
incomplete how can we be done well it is
incomplete yes but that's just because
the whole point of this tutorial was
actually just to or the past few
tutorials was actually just to show you
guys how to layout your website so how
to get your logo position correctly and
your header in the right position and
how to get to Dov's floated next to each
other and that kind of thing so that's
pretty much what we've done and if you
go ahead and you use all the old stuff
from the all the old tutorials like the
from the ones that we started with that
at the beginning you now have like all
the tools that you need to like add
background images in here and background
colors and change the fonts and that
kind of thing and actually make your
website look really really good and
really really pretty so now we've like
done the basics on how to make a website
you guys all know how to make a basic
beginner website and what I want to do
now is I just want to start talking
about films because that's something
that we're going to need to know for a
future and that's also going to tie in
with JavaScript or PHP tutorials later
on so we can go ahead and close this
like I said we're done with this and as
you can see I've already prepared my
documents here and like I said I wanted
to talk about forms so there we go the
title is forms and this is pretty much
all the basic stuff that we always start
with the only difference is we've got an
empty body over here and what we can do
now is we can go ahead and add in a form
onto our page so to add a form onto your
page it's you started off with a
starting form tag and then you end it
off with an ending forms
and if you cannot stand our what forms
off that's basically like a section of
information that the user can fall in
like if you've ever gone to Facebook or
YouTube or something you probably had to
register before you use the site so you
had to fill in your name and your
surname and your email address and all
that kind of stuff so that's what a form
is it's just where you fill in your
information and yeah that's pretty much
it so we've got our form on our page now
but this actually doesn't display
anything so if I go ahead and I save
this and we run this in Firefox you can
see this doesn't actually display
anything this just tells the browser
okay our firm is going to start here and
it's going to end here and everything in
between you is going to be our form and
there are lots of like special elements
that all actually though they're really
lost is about four or five of the
special elements that you can only put
inside a form and the most common
elements is an input input element and
that's a single tag so you can go ahead
and just end it off there and the input
element can determine whether we're
going to have a button a text box a
password box and all that kind of thing
on our in our form so let's just go
ahead and say type so this is the
attribute that we use to determine if we
want a button and input box a password
box a radio button and that kind of
thing so if we just go ahead and type in
text then that means we're gonna have a
text box on our website so if I go ahead
and I save this and we run this in
Firefox then you can see we now have a
text box and we can type whatever we
want in here so that's pretty cool and
that's just very much our introduction
to forums but there is a few more things
that I should probably talk about and
that is that I do know that we actually
have two
some attributes over here okay so I know
we have to have some attributes over
here but we're gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna leave this out for now and I'll
explain where we're going to use them
later on and what they're for but for
now just keep in mind that we have to
have some attributes for our form and
then the next thing is just before we
finish forms are pretty much useless
unless we actually have some clever
scripting languages on our website so
unless we're using JavaScript or PHP we
can't actually process any of the data
that we catch catcher capture in a form
so just because this falls under HTML I
have to teach this in this too in the
series but we'll go on in the next
series I'll have a JavaScript series
later on where we can start actually
manipulating all the information that we
get from the user so thank you guys for
