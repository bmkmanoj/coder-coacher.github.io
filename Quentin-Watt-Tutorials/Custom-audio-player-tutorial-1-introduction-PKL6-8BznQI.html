here and welcome to tutorial number one
in my custom audio player series and
some of you guys are probably noticing
quite a big difference in this video
compared to all my other videos and that
is that I finally have a webcam so I'm
showing myself in my videos for the
first time and I just thought that this
would be a cool new addition or yeah
addition maybe just for the video so
that you guys will be able to see me
talking to you and you know maybe it
helps carry the conversation through to
you guys as it were because you know you
can see me talking to you guys and yeah
just thought that would be cool
but I do understand that the lighting
and everything isn't very perfect behind
me but we'll work on that and yeah right
now I've got my index file which you
guys should know how to create all of
this content it's basically the html5
template that we work with in almost all
of my videos so go ahead and create this
code just like that okay and I'm going
to speak to you guys about everything
we're going to need to make our custom
audio player but I'm betting a lot of
you guys really want to know what this
audio player is going to look like so
I've got my audio player over here
opened up in my browser and this is
pretty much what we're going to be
making and this is very different to the
default audio player whenever you
specify controls so I'll go ahead and
show you guys the difference later on in
the series but basically this is what
we're going to land up with and it's
going to look the same in all browsers
which is pretty cool okay and what we've
got here is a play button we've got a
mute button we've got the current time
of where we are in this audio track
displayed over here and we also have the
full length or full track duration of
the audio track that is playing
and that is displayed over here and then
we also have this progress bar up at the
top which will let us know how much of
the track has passed and how much we
still you know have to listen to so let
me go ahead and click the play button
over here to show you that everything
works and when I click play you can see
the track starts playing we've got our
current time getting updated and changed
every second so we're about ten seconds
into the song right now the play button
has changed to a pause button so if I
hit that then we pause the track I'm
going to go ahead and play this now and
mute the track so my mute button works
and as you can see the image changes as
well okay if I go ahead and unmute that
we've got the track playing again and
yeah I'm going to go ahead and actually
just stop that because you can see our
progress bar up at the top here has been
updating so now we can see that the blue
section is how much of our track has
played and that the dark grey section is
pretty much how much of our track has
left to play okay and a cool thing about
this is if the track is playing we can
skip by just clicking anywhere on this
bar okay but if the track is not playing
so if the song is not playing and I
click anywhere on this bar then nothing
is going to happen okay so that's pretty
much what we're going to be making now
let's take a look at all of the
resources that we're going to need so
the first thing that you guys are going
to need is obviously a good knowledge of
HTML and CSS which you know if you guys
don't have that then you can go watch my
HTML and CSS videos I just released a
you know a whole new series on that okay
otherwise you can well not otherwise the
other thing you're going to need is a
good knowledge of JavaScript so I do
have my own JavaScript series out there
and if you guys don't want to go ahead
and watch
that then you'll be able to understand
what's going to go on in this javascript
file okay and I do realize that my
JavaScript series doesn't cover how to
save and add an external javascript file
to our web page but we're going to do
that in this video so it's not too
difficult so don't worry about that but
I will show you guys how to do that and
yeah what else are we going to need yeah
okay images images so if I go over to my
images file over here okay you'll see
that I've got my mute button my play
button my or pause and play button and
my unmuted button all displaying as
images over here so if you guys want to
be able to get cool images or icons like
that the website that I used is called
icon monster so icon monster.com spelt
kind of funny there's no e and if you go
ahead and search for play buttons or
pause buttons you should be able to find
the exact ones that I used otherwise if
you scroll around and take a look there
are definitely quite a lot more that you
could use in your own project so yeah
we've covered everything we need and I'm
going to go ahead and end the video here
but in the next video we're definitely
going to be taking a look at the HTML so
the mark-up for creating this exact
video player so I'll see you guys in the
next video but until then don't forget
to subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
again if you guys are enjoying the
series then you can go ahead and donate

the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
