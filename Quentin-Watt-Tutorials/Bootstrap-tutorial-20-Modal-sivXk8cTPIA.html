here and welcome to tutorial number 20
and in this tutorial I am going to be
talking to you guys about bootstrap
modal's now bootstrap modal's or modal's
are probably one of the like coolest
things about bootstrap they're so easy
to implement and they're really
effective actually so if we take a look
at my browser over here you can see I
have a button that says press me and if
I click on this button we have a modal
that appears and there is a title there
is some content over here and there is a
footer so there are three different
sections to this modal and that's kind
of important for just now oh I guess
just now is again a South African term
you guys might not know what I mean but
it's important for later on in the
tutorial great so let me go ahead and
close that and I'm going to jump back
over to my text editor here get rid of
that content and let's start coding it
anew so let's get rid of that refresh
here and it's empty and I see I didn't
actually change the title so let me go
what is this modal's
awesome great so now we can get started
with coding our modal and you know what
to be honest you might not even need
this container and this row and that
column but I'm gonna use them anyways
and I'm gonna add in a button over here
and this button is going to have some
text of click me and then I'm going to
give this button a few attributes so one
of the attributes that I'm going to give
this button is a type and I'm going to
set that equal to button and this is
something I should have been doing for
my other tutorials as well and I haven't
been doing it because it is not
necessary but it is kind of good
practice to add in type I believe by
default it is type button anyways so
let's go to class and I'm going to set
that equal to be TN and BTN - primary
and that's just going to make a blue
button as you guys know and then we're
going to be using data toggle again and
that's going to be set equal to
something and we're also going to be
using data
- target and that's going to be set
equal to something so as you guys know
data targets are usually always going to
be the ID of whatever needs to be
affected by this button and data toggle
is kind of what we're doing with the
button
so we're toggling a modal because this
is about modal's and I'm going to create
another div now which is going to be for
my modal and I'm going to end that div
off and this div needs to have a class
of modal and fade and then it also needs
to have an ID of something so let me
just say my modal because that's what's
in the example and you need to take this
ID and place it in the data target of
your button as well so I'm going to
paste that in there place a hash always
remember to put that hash in there and
yeah now we have our button and we've
got our modal linked to that but we
don't have any contents in our modal so
it's not going to like display anything
so now what we need to do is actually
add some content to this modal and I'm
going to start doing that by creating a
nother div so we kind of have to nest
this div inside adaptive and give this
one a class of a modal dash dialogue
then we need to add an another div and
that div is going to have a class of
modal dash content and inside of here
we're going to have three more divs so
they really didn't make this easy for us
there's quite a lot of nesting going on
but let's let's create that div and I'm
going to give this a
a class of whoops Moodle - header and
you kind of guessed it if we're having a
modal header we're going to have a modal
body and we're also going to have a
modal footer so let me go ahead and get
these classes in order and from here I
need to give my header some content and
I'm just going to say like let's put in
an h3 and in there I'll just say a title
for my modal oops okay great contents in
then for the body let's just add in a
paragraph and I'm going to give this
paragraph some content so let's just say
some content goes in here great and for
our footer really we could put anything
in here but I guess something that would
be nice is a close button there is also
a close button that could go in the
header but yeah I'm just gonna copy and
paste that sorry this is a button with a
type of button and a class and data
dismiss so this is important data
dismiss just tells the browser that when
this button is clicked we're going to
close the modal so let's go ahead and
save come back here and hit refresh and
now we have a button that says click me
and when I click on it we have our title
we have our content and we have the
footer with the close button great and I
just want to show you guys that you
don't have to have the footer or the
header so I we can run this without the
footer and the modal works just fine it
looks great it's not like sharp corners
on the end like indicating something's
missing or anything like that and we can
get rid of the title as well if
you just want to have content in the
modal so let's hit refresh and you can
see now we just have our content we
don't have the header we don't have the
footer and as always thanks for watching
