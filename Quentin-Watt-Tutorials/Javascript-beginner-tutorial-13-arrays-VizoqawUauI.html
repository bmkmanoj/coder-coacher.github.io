here and welcome to tutorial number 13
and in this video I want to talk to you
guys about arrays okay so basically an
array is a variable that we can use to
store a group of data all represented
and one variable name okay so you can
think of an array as a collection of
variables and then if we ever want to
store like a list or a group of related
data we can use an array and then we
only have to deal with one variable name
whenever we want to work with our
variables okay so before if I wanted to
make a list of say five cars okay I'd
have to go ahead and make a variable for
each class over call one and then I
could set that equal to Ferrari and then
I'd go okay okay
car 2 and then I'd have to set that
equal to something and then a four three
equal four call five so to just get like
tedious you actually have to write our
five lines of code to store each of the
variables okay and it'll just get quite
messy so rather what we can do is we can
actually use an array to store all five
car names okay so first of all let's
take a look at how to make an array and
what we do is we just type in the
keyword var whoops okay and then we type
in our array name so I want to call my
array name cause because I'm going to
store a list of five car names and then
I set that equal to new
arrey okay and you have to type the
words new array whenever you want to
make a an array otherwise it's not going
to work and a has to be a capital for
array okay if you use a small letter
it's not going to work okay
and then what I do is I put into
parenthesis and I can end that off with
a semicolon cool
so effectively what I've done here is
I've declared a new array okay that is
the technical term for this line of code
if you're ever writing a JavaScript exam
or a JavaScript test and they ask you
what this is then you have to say this
is I've declared a new array okay oh
this is called declaring an array so now
that we have this array what we can do
now is I can actually store five values
in this array by just typing them up
here in the parentheses so I can go
ahead and the first one can be Ferrari
and then the next one can be Porsche
okay
and make sure to separate each one of
your values with a comma
okay so Porsche then I can go ahead and
say Jaguar and then Lamborghini and the
last one can be mclaren okay cool so now
we've got five car names or five values
all stored under one variable called cos
so that means that our cos variable
consists of five values and each one of
these values is called an element
okay so Ferrari would be our first
element then Porsche would be our second
element and Jaguar would be the third
and so on okay
so now if I wanted to print this out
onto the screen what I can do is I can
say document dot write and I can print
out just our variable cause but what
that's going to do is going to print out
our entire array so it's going to start
from Ferrari and print all the way
through to McLaren if we go ahead and
save that and and run that in Firefox
then you'll see that we get our entire
array printed out on the screen okay but
how do we break that down to work with
an individual array element so let's say
I only wanted to print out the element
Ferrari okay well what I can do then is
I can use an array index now what an
array index is is that's basically the
position of the element inside of the
array so like Ferrari would be in the
first position and then Porsches in the
second position okay that's what we have
to do now we have to tell JavaScript
okay we just want to work with the first
element inside of our array okay and to
do that you add in these two little
square brackets and in here you put in
the number of the element in the array
that you want to work with okay so you
would think because Ferrari is the first
element that that must be one so let me
go ahead and put one in here and then
I'll save this and we can refresh this
in Firefox and see what we get okay and
what the heck Porsche we didn't want
Porsche Porsche is the second element we
wanted Ferrari okay
the reason why this happened is because
when we working with arrays our computer
starts counting at zero instead of one
so like people would look at the singer
okay well this is one two three four
javascript looks at this and goes okay
this is zero one two three four so if I
wanted to print out the first element in
my array I'd have to start with zero so
let's go ahead and just put a zero in
there and then go ahead and save that
and now when I go ahead and click
refresh you can see the word Ferrari is
printed out on the screen so that's much
better okay
and just like if I wanted to print out
the third element in my array let's go
ahead and see yeah we go
zero one two okay
that's the third element Jaguar but we
start counting from zero so zero one two
I'd have to print out number two
go ahead and save that and we'll go
ahead and click refresh then we've got
Jaguar printed out on the screen okay
so that's basically how arrays work and
let's recap for just a second okay so
what we did at the top of our page was
we declared a new variable but our
variable is actually an array which can
store more than one value inside of this
variable cards okay so what we then did
was we stored our five variables each of
these variables was called an element
okay so don't go don't forget that and
then we printed out one of the elements
on the screen okay but don't forget that
whenever we had to print out our
variable we had to use this little thing
of Eire
called an array index and whenever we
work with an array index we start
counting at zero so don't forget that
either
okay so we'd start counting zero one two
three four okay got it good I hope so
because that's actually all I have time
