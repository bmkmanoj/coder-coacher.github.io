push that button dude it's not screaming
I'm just gonna go check the live page
for now
well okay screen house starting screen
your audience will get to see it in a
moment to get ready okay looks like I am
live let's go over to this page okay
right so it looks like this is live and
I think people can actually see me
although I don't know who's watching
right now
cool I have I have absolutely no idea
this is kind of crazy playing with live
YouTube live okay it says 21 people are
watching right now if you guys tuned in
a moment ago and it basically the black
me staring at a screen not knowing what
I was doing
yeah I have absolutely no idea what I'm
doing right now I'm just trying to try
to start a live stream with software
that I've never used before so this is
this is going to look a little bit
tricky but I guess right now you guys
can see me and you can see my screen
that I'm sharing with you right now so
maybe I should just hide these bookmarks
the Facebook is gonna is there for a
reason I want to show you guys that but
yeah let's see okay Wow there's I've got
some comments already okay
so early squad hit that like button hey
buddy okay well hey everybody um Anisha
I'm learning JavaScript from your
tutorials these days cool thank you
hi Nilesh hi Suraj yeah I do apologize
if I pronounced a few people's names
wrong hello vignette cool so guys I
thought that for this video
I would I would put up a splash page for
my website
is uh right now if we take a look at my
website if you go over to Quintin what
calm it says indexof and there is
nothing there and there was actually a
website here and then I was I took it
down for some reason I can't remember
why lost the files and yeah I haven't
had a website for a while so I logged
into Facebook and I see a few people
have suggested that I I say that I don't
have a website anymore because you go to
Quentin what obviously there's nothing
here
so I do need to work on getting my own
website back up again and it's probably
going to take some time but I can put up
a splash page or just something at the
moments that when you go there it
doesn't say this so yeah I thought I'd
clear up what was in my local host so
basically I've got two got MAMP
open over here I don't know if you guys
can see that
Oh cleanly okay looks like you should be
able to see that so I got map open over
here and if we go over to my htdocs
folder that is all empty and so now we
can work on building a splash page for
me and then a building that two to my
current web site so I looked around on
my computer for a little while and I
thought I would use this picture which
is called pretty good-looking coffee and
this is a photo I took quite a while
back which is just a photo of a coffee
mug and my Mac laptop this is at my
aunts house and I think I'm going to use
this as a background and then maybe just
put well here just put some text over
here to say like I don't know something
yeah I'll get my website up soon have a
coffee or enjoy a coffee while you wait
or something Adam can get a little bit
cute with our wording later right so
let's see what you guys are saying in
the comments real quick okay so unless
you want to learn angularjs awesome I I
don't actually work with angular I've
never actually good with angular so I
should probably take a look at that
myself as well uh Anthony hi Calvin
who is Calvin
anyway okay yeah let's jump back over to
the screen sharing okay so like I said I
wanted to to make a splash page for my
site so let's open up that picture over
there in Photoshop and like I said I
just maybe want to put some text on here
so I can't play around with a silly
little design although like this is
going to be so so simple it's probably
not even worth designing it because
literally all I want to do is maybe
change this font here to open sans okay
Computers not responding open sans bold
right yeah okay and yeah
I literally just want to put a message
in here like hi that should probably be
white I'm changing the color by the way
just something like hi I promise I'll
put something better here soon but for
now check out my youtube channel
and then suppose could could make this a
little bit look a little bit better as
well by making that bigger and I'm just
putting a button down here that links to
youtube like a big red button and in
fact I don't know maybe we should move
this high to be like on its own line
nice and big and then the paragraph and
then the button so it's getting another
text box in here okay cool just to make
that a little bit bigger so yeah make
that massive I yeah like I said just put
the paragraphs on over there and then a
button to youtube so if you guys don't
know how to use Photoshop yeah don't
worry about this but yeah I'm just going
to I'm just basically showing you guys
what I'd like to do here and yeah I want
to read I don't know maybe I should use
green some green or something like that
I think the green looks way better
doesn't it
hey that was my magic mouse sometimes
that Scrolls when it really doesn't need
to anyway that's March 101 or is that
exactly how you spell it
awesome okay so basically what I'm
seeing here is that I have my message I
have my paragraph and I have what I'm
going to use as a button so I'll just
use like a green color like this with
the some text on it like that but you
can see that right now because the text
is white there are certain areas by the
coffee mug where you can't actually see
what this text says and sort of
disappears into the background and
that's obviously because the background
is white so kind of a trick to get
around this that most people will use in
development and I use it all the time
is to the drill you go over to your
background image that you're using which
in this case is obviously this one with
the mug and I'm just going to darken
that a little bit so I'll place a
transparent layer over that and
literally just get a paint bucket
painted black and take the transparency
down to like 40 or 35 or yeah some words
the text is readable but the image is
still visible so 20 percent 15 percent
something like that okay cool yeah so
now you can see the image you can see
the text and yeah the design is pretty
simple and straightforward so we should
be able to work with this quite easily
and we should be able to build this
quite quickly so hopefully
have I'll build this and then by the end
of the livestream just push it live and
we will have done I will have made a
video and also done something for myself
for my website that I haven't had the
chance to do for a really long time yeah
so basically knocking out two birds with
one stone right now cool so let's take a
look at what you guys are saying in the
comments team Plutonian needs my help
well you know what T what is this team
Pluto in yeah do if you if you need help
you can send me an email I do have a
video explaining how you can contact me
via email if it is within like the
constraints of something that I actually
want to do or something that I can
actually do for you I will definitely
help you if you're asking me to do work
for you in terms of like I don't know
building a website or helping with the
project obviously there are some things
that I just cannot do so then I I just
have to say no but yeah send me an email
and I'll let you guys I'll let you know
if I can help you or not so you say
Pluto in calm is your website and your J
has files on loading actually didn't I
didn't read your comment further but
yeah dude and I say just look into your
URLs or something um anyway let me move
on with this and yeah yeah maybe maybe
what I'm doing in this video will help
you realize what you did wrong with your
Jas or well actually don't anything I'm
going to use be using Jas yeah but your
CSS so like this is literally the kind
of website that I want to make right now
so let's let's work on actually making
this so I'm going to minimize Photoshop
and go over to my htdocs' folder and I
want to actually create this file now so
I'm going to not right-click and say new
file instead I'll go to sublime and say
file save as and I'll put this in my
htdocs folder and I'm going to call it
index.html right because every time you
create a home page or a splash page or
the first page that a user one needs to
land on in your site you'll either call
it index.html or index.php if you're
using PHP or HTML like I am obviously if
you're using a different language and
English index tab whatever the coding
languages I guess
okay so save this right and now we need
obviously open up our template so
sublime is pretty awesome because it
just did all that stuff for me right and
I'm just going to say Quinton what
splash page for the title okay in my
head I'm also going to link to a CSS
file because obviously I need CSS so
let's go link type style sheets what
type is text dot CSS relationship
stylesheet' href we don't actually know
yet because I need to make the the CSS
file so let's go file new and then let's
just call this sort of ctrl s to save
saving it in the same place as my index
file and I'm going to call this main dot
CSS I guess main dot CSS SSSs it's safe
right and now I have my CSS file and for
a splash page because this is going to
be fairly simple all I want to do is I'm
just going to keep my files in the same
directory so index and CSS it's fine
that they're all going to be here
because this isn't going to get
complicated we're not going to have like
some insane file structure with an
insane website it's just a splash page
so I'm just going to leave my index and
my
main.css as they are I would like to
copy that image that's on my desktop and
paste that in here as well so now I have
the image here as well with that super
long name and now I can go back over to
my HTML file right and now I know the a
trip for my CSS it's just going to be
main don't CSS and yeah a team Latoya
thank you ever left the comment just now
yeah if if your JavaScript not loading
that is probably going to have to do
with your your file path and this is
something that I get asked about a lot
viewers tend to send me e-mail send me
Facebook messages and like complain
about this problem all the time my file
is not loading why generally it's
because you made a mistake here
I either you didn't specify the correct
file path or you've gone ahead and then
like folded your JavaScript away like in
a folder somewhere like in a Jes folder
somewhere and then you didn't include
that in your file path and your H ref or
in your source because JavaScript as
source like that and if you made a
typing mistake or something then your
JavaScript isn't going to load right
okay so now that I have made the a
stylesheet or link to the stylesheet
let's go ahead and put some text in the
body so what do I have in my HTML right
I had a background image I have one big
text a paragraph and a button so I'd say
when you're converting a design to HTML
you kind of just need to look at the
structure of how you've laid things out
in your design and I mean like I said
this is just one paragraph this is one
big heading and
this is basically a button or a link
that is style to look as like a button
right so let's go back over here I will
add this image as a background to my
body and I will then add in a well let's
add it div in here
so the div will just hold the content
and for the stiv I can just give it a
class of something I don't really know
what that is going to be yet so let's
just leave that for now I also want to
create a heading one that's going to say
hi with the exclamation mark I want to
have a paragraph that is going to say
whatever I put in here and I don't want
that line break okay so this is all one
length line by the way guys okay
and then I want a link so a okay let's
let that end it off for me and say what
I have in the design now just okay my
channel
and for the hrs obviously that is going
to link to my YouTube channel which is
youtube.com slash Quinton what I think
I'm going to just get the link
youtube.com slash Quinton watts
just like that alright save this let's
let's take a look at what this actually
looks like in the browser by opening the
HTML file I'm going to pull that over
here okay yeah there we go now you can
see it right so yeah basically I have an
empty web site almost that needs a lil
bit of styling because it doesn't look
anything like my design and I've got a
lit of a problem here with stuff not
converting so what is this okay that's
probably going to be better
hi I promise I'll put something yeah
okay that's better yeah so I think that
that was kind of just like an illegal
character in there which by the way
reminds me that I haven't actually
declared my what do you call it
mater charset right
mater charset utf-8 okay because we're
going to need that great so now I have
some stuff on my black time in my head
and some stuff in my body what should I
call this div just content give it a
class of content right and then I can
jump over the CSS and style this so
let's go over to my CSS file I'm going
to select the wealth first of all
when it comes to CSS I want to throw in
a few resets so let's just say star
which is going to select everything on
the side and say padding:0
and then margin zero pixels great back
here and refresh okay so now that got
rid of padding's and margins which is
what I wanted to do because I you don't
want to be working against browser
default pairings and margins so you just
want to get rid of all of those right
and then I want to select my body and if
we look at my design over here you can
see that I have a picture in the
background of my website and it's taking
up the entire website or this is just a
splash page but yeah it's taking up the
entire splash page so it just makes
sense to add that as a background image
for the body so let's go back over to my
CSS file and then say background URL and
that's going to allow me to set a
background image for the body of my
website and what I'd like to do here is
grab that image name right again to the
guy who is coming about javascript files
not loading this is like 99.99% of the
problem sorry I hit the mic I hope that
didn't make a weird noise
right this is like always the problem
when somebody sends me a message saying
that files on loading or images aren't
loading or something they generally make
their mistake here in specifying the
file path so I made it easy for myself
right now because my image is in the
same location as my CSS file and it's in
the same location as my index file but
had this image been in a folder called
images or had this image been you know
somewhere else on the site I would have
had to have put in a completely
different URL right here
and if I put in the wrong URL of course
the image won't load or the javascript
file won't load so yeah you just need to
make sure that you're always using the
correct file path okay
so let's save this now and jump back
over the browser see my progress
hopefully I have a background image and
I do and that takes up pretty much the
whole site but what I'd really like to
do is position this background image so
that it starts in the center so that
hopefully this coffee mug is pretty much
almost always visible so I want to go
background position and I think I want
to set that to Center Center and center
I don't know if that's actually a value
but yeah okay turns out it is alright
because you can have it on the center of
the x-axis and on the center of the
y-axis so what happened here was Center
and center sensitive on the x-axis and
then on the y-axis which pull the image
like a little bit this way and then a
little bit up as well so it basically
started over there I don't know if
that's actually what I'd like I think
maybe Center and then bottom hopefully
this was x and y and not Y and X let's
see what happens okay yeah that looks a
little bit better something else I want
to do is set this to cover and head is
actually a completely different value by
the way I think if we see a background
oops
background size cover right that will
then stop the repeat no it
not stopping the repeat okay so let's
get rid of that nasty repeat by going
background-repeat:no-repeat and I'm
using fairly like low little CSS right
now I'm like there's actually a shortcut
where when you use background you can
put in the URL you can put in whether
you want it to repeat or not there's a
whole bunch of stuff that you can do
basically all in one line as a shortcut
instead of having five different rules
but for the for simplicity sake I just
want to use one rule at a time it's
going to be a lot easier let's come back
here and refresh okay so it I think I
see my problem
right I need the background of the body
to go 100% of the browser size right now
it's only going as far as I have content
which is only those three lines so how
do I fix that
well I'm not quite sure at the moment
actually neither thing I guess if I say
height 100% nope
I wonder guess that div is going there
the body is going taking as much space
as the div how do I make this go 100%
that is interesting oh by the way you
see this shortcut over here see Firefox
basically shortened everything that I
wrote out on multiple lines and Firefox
shortened it so that it can literally
just be all in one line so if you're
ever looking to get a short code of a
bunch of rules and you don't really know
what order they're going to be in
you can always type them out and then go
over to your element ex-inspector which
in this case I use Firebug and inspect
the element and yeah then you get a
shortcode like this by the way I haven't
checked at the comments but I'm sure
some people are probably confused stream
health is bad Oh No
nobody asked me to do this Ahmed I'm
just doing it because I want to do it I
did kind of explain that at the
beginning of the video
okay guys I'm just reading some of your
comments here because I'm seeing
I saw a message that said the spring
health is bad I don't know what the
quality is like on on your guys's side
it doesn't look too bad
me the quality of the video right now
can you guys see everything fine or not
ready okay cool
sorry I've got a I've got a message over
here that says the video screen is not
good so I'm kind of panicking right now
and if it looks blurry I'm sorry right
so yeah let's
that's uh sorry I'm reading the comments
come in somebody said I'm so busy ha ha
ha ha I don't know if that's sarcasm or
not but yeah guys look if if you just
joined in what I'm trying to do is just
make a splash page for my site I did
kind of announce this at the beginning
of the video I guess maybe I'll just
keep announcing it every now and then
but yeah I'm trying to make a splash
page for my website right now I don't
really have poor Wi-Fi at DJ n DJ n my
speed if we do with this is like not so
bad actually it was who wants to see me
do a speed test got nothing to do with
the video but let's do a speed test does
it this site take really long to load
for everybody else because it always
takes long to load for me even though my
speed like when it finally listen loads
is quite high so we'll see what's
happening yeah is that is that slow
internet for actually that is only half
or so I'm supposed to be getting I'm
supposed to be getting 40 megabits per
second download so I'm going to get 20
right now not sure why
also seems to be a little bit unstable
but yeah I think it's probably because
I'm screaming at the same time that I'm
doing this so that's going to affect
things and yeah this is supposed to be
20 Meg's upload as well and I guess I
have almost that
speed test had absolutely nothing to do
the video cool guys let me just continue
with making this splash page
for you so
or I should probably have been viewing
the website of the index.html file here
through map through my local host
hopefully you guys can see this anyway
yeah let's uh let's get this content
where it should be sorry
get rid of that duplicate style what did
I want to do I want to make the body
take up 100% of the browser so sometimes
I don't know how to do things I have to
Google things as well so let's try see
force by the way I don't maybe maybe I
didn't just come right without that high
it's 100% what happens if we just take
that away again I know that that
probably is going to keep the same
result that's fine
background position background size
cover cover should actually be forcing
the body to take the full browser width
let's get rid of these two for now and
see what happens again because it was
pretty much the whole browser before
background sighs 100% no which will bro
get that's what I like that probably
this rule background positions into
bottom let's get rid of that because it
kind of works right now without it and
then I'll figure out how to fix that
later but for now what I'd really like
to do is be able to have this font big
and white and open sense so I need to
link to a Google font so let's go to
google fonts and then look for what is
it open sans so if you guys are ever
wanting to get fonts to your website
then this Google font directory is
pretty awesome I don't know if you've
ever heard about it or not but yeah
hopefully you have hopefully you're not
living under a rock but Google has this
pretty awesome font directory and there
are a lot of fonts here there's okay I
want to use open sans but there are like
a crazy amount of fun so go ahead and
search through all of them yeah there
are a lot and they're all web safe
because they're all hosted by Google but
we want open sense that's it's a pretty
popular one most people tend to use it
and all you need to do is then click on
little plus button this box appears and
then you can copy and paste a link and
that's going to help you get a font on
to your website so whoops that needs to
go up here in the head a set a link to
the open sans font
and you can see if you take that URL it
literally just brings a CSS file with
all of the fonts through to your site so
what I like to do by the way I'm really
nervous as I do this guy's because I've
never actually livestream and build
something at the same time I just
thought this would be cool to do but
yeah let's uh let's take a look at
something anything that change right now
but now I can go over to my CSS file and
also under my body set font family equal
to open sense but I want it written that
way actually Google will tell me exactly
what I need a type you have to type this
as a style with font family is equal to
open sans or sans serif and I don't
think I've ever actually actually
explained this in a tutorial before but
this comma and then having a secondary
font over here basically just tells the
browser use open sans but if for some
reason open sans fails to load then just
skip to any sense serif font as a backup
like it doesn't matter what's ten serif
on any sense they're a font is good and
that's basically what that that style
will means ok so if we jump back over
the browser now and refresh the font
should change which it has not sure if
you saw everything just kind of
straighten up and become a sans serif
type font right and then I think what I
want to do is select the this div with
the class of content
and now just make all the tanks within
this white so let's just say color ffff
what else do we want to do we just want
to make everything really really really
big so let's just say font size I'm
going to make this something ridiculous
like 3m just to test and see what
happens
okay is that actually made it quite big
already sweet okay
and then I think I want to Center all
the text so text-align:center awesome so
that's looking pretty close to what I
had in the Photoshop design I do want
that high to be bold it doesn't look
very bold right now it also doesn't look
anywhere near as big as I wanted it to
be and the paragraph also doesn't look
big it's also not bold and then the
button so less let's increase the size
of everything but instead of doing it
that way
let's select all headings within that h1
or all H ones within that content and
give that a font size of and I can come
to Photoshop now and then click on this
that's a paragraph that's the heading
Wow 490 pixels Wow okay I really made
that big but cool let's uh let's try 400
pixels for now to see what happens okay
awesome that is insanely big
cool well that's let's fry 200 and let's
also Center set the font weight here to
900 hopefully that gets a little bit
older it didn't think it's as bold as it
can be already I'm just trying to figure
out now why this looks a lot bolder than
that
did I include okay so when linking to a
Google font sometimes you might want to
customize this a little bit and right
now we only have a regular font weight
at 400 but because I want the bold
version I want to tick that box and if I
come back over here to the embed link
you might notice that our link has
actually changed a little bit so let's
go back to my index.html and let's
replace this link with the new one and
you'll see that now we have open sans we
have 400 and 800 in the URL which
basically just allows us to pull through
the bolder font and now I have a much
bolder hi which is also because I've
actually pulled through the the actual
bold font so I customized that over here
right okay so now I have my high the
next thing I want to do is also fix the
paragraph and fix that link so let's
jump back over the Photoshop how big do
I have this paragraph if I look at that
text it is 72 pixels
okay let's try work with that 72 pixels
so let's con select all the paragraph
within our content class and try setting
that to 72 pixels and the font wait
should we leave that bold at 900 and
soon okay that is really really big so
let's decrease that size a little bit
let's try 34 I think 34 is going to be
good
not too bad maybe a little bit bigger
try 45 something like that right and
then let's try and get that button
styled a little bit better so I'm going
to give this class a out this link a
class because right now it's not a
button it's a link and I keep calling it
a button if there's a reason why so
let's give this a class of button link
and copy that save this file and then
select this button link class I'm going
to give it a background and now I need
to go back to photoshop because I want
to know what color I used there so
that's good and I drop a tool by pushing
the I and that's going to select the
color from Photoshop and now I can get
the HTML hash right which is 3 9 B 5 4 8
and paste that in over here remember to
put my little hashtag in front of that
that should add a background color to my
link then I also want to maybe just give
this a little bit of padding so we'll
give it like 10 pixels on the top and 20
pixels on the left and the right and
then I also want to make sure that any
text on this button is also bolded so
let's get the font weight of 900 or we
could just say by the way I've set the
font weight to 900 here and actually the
only font size or the weight of the
boldest font that we have is 800 so that
actually means my CSS is a little bit
wrong because there should be 800
instead of 900
and the reason why that was actually
working and everything was getting
bolded to the boldest it could be is
because when I set this to nine hundred
it would just fall back to the boldest
fondant could find which was eight
hundred hopefully that makes sense it's
probably going to confuse a few people
okay
okay cool so now I have my button
looking a little bit more like a button
over here but it doesn't quite look like
the design so let's see if we can fix
that first of all I'm going to add a
paragraph tag around this link okay that
made it much much bigger and now I think
I need to give this button or either the
paragraphs and margin and I need to
change the text color so let's come back
here to my CSS okay button link color
wash FFF that should change the text
color okay we also want to get rid of
that underline text decoration because
that looks kind of ugly text decoration
let's by the way can you guys see you
all of this or should I make it bigger
you know why it's been in quite a while
that the video has been running an hour
now I'm offering to make the code bigger
text-decoration:none and that should get
rid of the underline on the link over
here awesome right so let's take a look
at that compared to the design the text
does look a lot smaller here doesn't it
and the big text on the button also does
look a lot lot smaller
so it also looks a lot less bold doesn't
it so let's just try 400 for the
paragraphs and for the links okay 400
isn't quite as quite what I wanted is it
also you can see that the paragraph and
the button and kind of overlapping each
other
so that could be due to not having a
margin underneath a paragraph which yes
okay that comes from not having a margin
and our paragraph so remember we set the
margins to none for everything that's
that's what we did up here so actually
paragraphs are going to need to have
oops
paragraphs are going to need to have a
margin below them of something so let's
just say margin bottom and suppose we
just want to make that 20 pixels I'm
just going to guess right now okay so
that looks a little bit better although
come on that could have been a better
way to do this like use a percentage
although this is might break everything
that's just yeah that's that's a really
crazy amount so let's just say let's
let's say 30 pixels okay cool that looks
that looks better and there is some
spacing between the paragraph and the
actual button also my content right now
is going like completely towards the end
of the browser like this so when the
browser was smaller there's no space on
either side I think I want to fix that a
little bit so
let's go to this div with a class of
content and actually give it a max width
so I'm going to select that div which
we've actually all got already got a
selector for it over here and I'm just
going to say max width 1000 let's
actually say 80% right come back here
and refresh alright so now that looks a
little bit better because it's like not
going all the way to the end of the
browser but it is all on the left side
and not in the center so to fix this
let's go say margin:0
well actually just zero and auto should
do the trick so this is going to set a
margin of zero on the top and the bottom
and then auto on the left on the right
which will automatically center the dev
so there we go awesome now it is in the
center hmm
what else can we do I actually would
like this to be in the center of the
page as well instead of hit well you
know I'm saying I'd like it to be this
whole thing should be here more or less
than the center there is a trick to this
not sure how to get this done
see if I take this class of content and
I say position:absolute top:0 bottom:0
left zero and then right zero and it's a
key
let's actually put this all at the
bottom okay so this is a trick that
senses everything so if I come back here
let's see if works it doesn't does it
okay interesting say relative I have
done this before
it's just been a while since I last use
this trick but basically it's supposed
to stretch everything and Center it but
let's just see how to Center a div in
the center of its parent that's that's
how you google stuff like get as direct
as you possibly can
yeah like ask the question to Google and
you'll probably find and on that margin
zero pixels Auto that's what we've
already got no I think CSS tricks
there's a website called CSS tricks
there we go that is it CSS tricks is
where I learned this trick from so I'm
pretty sure this is actually the link
that I was looking for just gotta wait
for it to load well we know about
horizontally I want to Center it
vertically is it inline or black it's a
block level element do you know the
height of the element can you use
flexbox is the element unknown this is
the one okay so the parent needs to be
relative the child needs to be absolute
top 50% why translate 50% cool
and then essentially this is the result
right where you have the Block in the
center vertically so what they're saying
I should do is take the parents and give
it a position of relative which in this
case will be my body so a position
relative and then the child which is the
thing that I want to Center and in this
case it is my content div so let's make
that absolute top 50% so let's get rid
of these lips and whites and bottoms and
all that kind of stuff top 50% let's
take a look at what that does so far
okay everything is not scented this way
again
and actually not scented the other way
either transform just take that last
rule and just paste it in here see what
happens okay that pulled it out so that
one isn't working
awkward
pretty I'm not sure how I'm going to fix
this now let's go back to what I had so
let's get rid of all of this and get rid
of that over there let's go back to what
I had I want to send to this vertically
the how and I'm going to do that
yeah sometimes just got a play around
like it doesn't it doesn't work straight
away just checking out some of you
guys's comments yeah everybody seems to
be from India are they talking about
Nepal and places in India
I suck at technology this makes me feel
like I'm getting some what getting some
game watching this getting some game
girl lost bill got lost
what game are you getting right anyway
uh yeah if you guys have just joined in
I haven't said this for a while but I
want to make a splash page for my
website and yeah we're kind of almost
there right now I just want to be able
to Center this content vertically and I
suppose es online is trying to help me
here at HTML height is equal to 100% it
actually should be already know it isn't
let's try it try that HTML height 100%
okay cool thanks now let's try that
trick that we had again so
position:relative and actually let's
force that to be 100% as well just check
if it actually is rendering at 100% so
guys I keep opening the element
inspector and yeah if I hover over the
body tag I can see that it now is forced
to be 100% which means if I take this
content
give and I set that position to absolute
top 50% that's going to push it down a
little bit and then what was the other
one
what was that last rule that he had
transform translate so I think if I take
all of these right now and I place them
there hey
I should have everything centered
awesome kind of but not really because
it's got this space here and that's
because of the position being absolute
sumo I suppose you can also go left 50%
and then
not
it doesn't look so bad they're like that
what happens on a different screen size
though iPhone
yeah we're definitely going to have to
change some settings for iPhone iPad I
suppose we could leave it at that okay
so let's get rid of that max width and
let it be 100 percent as a dip would
normally be okay now I need to fix this
this problem where you can't see the
image and the text
now I did talk about that in Photoshop I
said all you need to do is darken the
actual image so let's hide all of these
things and now I have the darker image
and I'm just going to file export save
that to my desktop
I guess Gary hi what are my sins now
let's just bring that down a little bit
actually
60% 172 kilobytes save this and I think
we can put it in htdocs' and we can just
save over the current image that's there
replace that come back up at the browser
and I should have a darker image so now
the text is a little bit more visible to
you guys I do think that I need to
actually shrink this a little bit but
for now it kind of works for desktops so
that is a little splash page and
interestingly enough it did take some
time to get done so not everything you
know like when I make my tutorials
generally I plan everything beforehand
like and then I kind of just coded out
in front of you without actually
figuring things out but I hope you guys
could actually see from this livestream
that sometimes you know if you haven't
actually planned something else it does
take a little bit of time to to figure
out what CSS rule you need where and
know sometimes you do have to think a
little bit about certain things by the
way this button I do think there are
certain rules that I want applying
because it's not displaying as a block
so let's look at this I definitely gave
this button some padding 20 pixels right
let's try 50 okay so it's not that it
wasn't applying it's just that I didn't
really give it as much padding as I
wanted or needed I think okay so let's
fix that up a little bit change the
padding to 50 pixels
okay that's better
and I think what I want to do now is
maybe just work on okay the iPad iPad
resolution is 768 by 1024 that doesn't
look too bad actually for an iPad splash
page but definitely if you take a look
at 375 actually I think the heights is a
little bit wrong and iPhone is actually
a little bit higher than 585 yeah I do
definitely need to fix this though so I
think the best solution here would be to
just make the text a little bit smaller
so right now I think we're sitting at 45
let's try and make that like 25
yeah about probably about 30 or
something will do and then they're
heading by the way guys when you see me
changing things on the fly it's because
I'm changing them here in the element
inspector font size here we can do 100
for the high and then it works on iPhone
as well more or less
I kind of need to find out about the
height of an iPhone is but even if even
at the height it should be fine so
basically what I want to do here is use
a media query when I by the way when I
make changes in the element inspector
obviously these are not permanent
changes these are just there to to kind
of test I guess but yeah to make changes
permanent you obviously want to put them
in your text editor and obviously what I
want to do to fix things on an iPhone is
use a media query so at media what is it
at media screen and Mac's with but I
feel like I'm getting something wrong
here
and max with equal I forgot this way I
type this so fortunately we have Google
media query syntax
so yeah like it's okay to Google stuff
if you can't really remember it of
course nobody wants to remember the
syntax of how everything was written as
long as you know the tools that are
available to you you're good but I want
I don't think that this is the exact
media query rule I want so let's go to
w3c I think there is a better ad media
screening and Max would mimic again
alright so they're working with
min-width
here I want to use max with and instead
of 418 okay so at an iPhone size this
seems to be fine but I'm going to then
stop changing everything at seven six
seven pixels which means seven six seven
is the value I'll put in here seven six
seven so basically a medium screen like
an iPhone or an iPod and iPad is always
going to show what's displaying at seven
six seven six eight but once I go one
pixel down to 767 whatever code I place
within this media query will start to
show so if I go over to my content
paragraph and my content h1 over here
and I just make these a little bit
smaller let's make that text I think I
said 30 pixels and then I think I said I
was going to make this 100 pixels it
should now change at this screen
resolution which is fine because now
when people look at this either on a
Samsung or iPhone
this is pretty much what they should see
this is pretty much what they should
look like so we have a splash page that
is not only responsive it works on
desktop and mobile so it's responsive
but yeah it's pretty awesome I don't
know where I was going with that it's
not only responsive but yeah that's
pretty cool I just think you know my
image is not quite where I need it to be
right now either because if I ever have
a screen that is larger than 1920 I
think I can actually change this so if
somebody has a screen that's 2,000
pixels like a 4k screen my image doesn't
quite go past that that width so we
still need to fix that a little bit and
the way that we need to do that is
obviously that background cover rule
also background cover let's play around
with that see what happens
background sighs I want cover though so
I should be able to just set the
background size cover but that's what we
had earlier let's try this
background sighs oh right
come back here fast
I also open up my mobile viewer okay so
my background image seems to cover the
sides right now but there is no answer
hand pressure nah it's not centering the
content on such a big screen 1:19 funny
look good I think that's only because of
the line break absolutely
so I think a quick way around this is to
go over to my content div and give this
some pattern ah make it 50 pixels or
something big which then means I bet
we're going to have to change this in
our media carry I don't know what it's
going to be just yet but let's let's
take a look at this on a mobile phone
okay doesn't look so bad on that side
but let's see what happens here
doesn't look awful but I think we could
just decrease that a little bit so let's
take that padding and make it something
like let's make it 20 pixels and if
you're wondering what I just by the way
is it blurry
it's blurry right this is my live
connection thing
by the way if you guys were wondering
what that last little section was that
was just me putting padding so basically
this purple line that you see around the
content that is that is the padding I
just put in so that just gives us some
spacing along the sides of all of the
content so it basically just doesn't
push against the side but yeah look as a
splash page I think this is going to
work perfectly okay I don't think it
needs to be any more complicated than
this so what I'm going to do is take all
of this content that is in my main CSS
file and in my HTML file and of course
that image over there by the way there's
nothing in that I'm going to take all of
those content and I'm just going to push
it live so when you go when you go to my
website Quentin what com instead of it
being a blank website will have the
actual splash page and hopefully I will
design a much better website soon and
have a much better website up there but
for now you know we're going to work
with this splash page it doesn't exactly
look 100% like my design but I'm ok with
that
right I'm okay with where it looks in
the browser so yeah I think I'm going to
end the live stream off here hopefully
this helps a few people I think you know
a lot of time I get questions from
viewers you know like just assuming that
I know everything or that you know I
just think CSS in my head about
hopefully you guys got
to see a little bit more about the
building process I mean this is
something super super simple but yet it
still took me a fair amount of time to
complete and yeah I just wanted to to
livestream this to kind of show you guys
that like this is the process this is
how I go about doing things you know I
could probably have sped this up a
little bit by preparing beforehand but I
just didn't I just didn't want to
prepare beforehand because I want I
didn't want this to go super super
quickly I wanted this to be like you
guys watching me do something simple
like this from start to finish and you
can actually see that it does take time
to get things right and sometimes yes I
do make mistakes and sometimes I do have
to Google stuff that is just like the
job of developer you're gonna you're
going to be you know asking yourself
questions you're probably going to hit a
few errors and you're going to have to
be fixing things all of the time so yeah
it's just a much much more realistic
look at development and yeah I'm gonna
end the video of there so I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
