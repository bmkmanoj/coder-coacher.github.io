here and welcome to tutorial number
three in my my sequel series and in this
tutorial I want to show you guys how to
select information from a database and
then just display it back to you so
we're going to run our first select
query but before we get started with
that I just want to mention that if you
guys haven't done this already then you
need to go back and do this so you need
to download the sequel database that I
have set up for you guys I did show you
guys how to download this and import it
in the first video so if you haven't
done that you need to go back and watch
the first video and do that and then you
can come back and watch this video and
the next thing I want to talk about just
before we begin this tutorial is I want
to send a shout-out to my sponsor dev
Mountain so if you guys are trying to
become a web developer and iOS developer
or a UX designer and you're struggling
to make that career change I know that
sometimes pitching yourself code can be
kind of difficult but if you guys want
to speed up the process a little bit and
become a developer even faster go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description below and if
you do contact them make sure to tell
them that I sent you right so now let's
take a look at running our first query
so go over a PHP myadmin
and I'm just going to zoom in here so
that you guys can see everything a lot
more clearly so I'm going to make
everything nice and big and yeah if you
guys don't really know much about PHP
myadmin
on the left side over here we have a
bunch of tables so these are all the
tables on our server and we are going to
be working with the learning over here
table which is the table that I set up
for you guys
so go ahead and click on that and now
you can actually see am I saying tables
all the time sorry this is a database
it's not a table it's a database and
everything within it is a table so the
addresses field over here this is a
table order that's a table products at
the table and users these are all tables
within my database and if I click on one
of these tables names I can actually see
any information that was that is within
this table right
so now that we have gotten that out of
the way let's take a look at a few more
of these tabs up here so you should have
already seen the import tab when I
showed you guys how to import the
database into phpMyAdmin so if you guys
ever want to import information into a
database you can use the import option
over here you can also export
information out of a database using the
export tab but yeah this is not a PHP
myadmin tutorial this is actually a
sequel tutorial so I want to show you
guys how to write some sequel code so
let's go over the over to the sequel tab
over here and you can see that when you
have this selected we have an input box
over here to type in queries and it's
quite straightforward so we type in a
query we hit the Go button if there's an
error our error will appear below here
and if there's no error if our query
makes sense it's going to display the
information that we want to have
displayed right so what you need to do
is make sure that you have a database
selected so in this case I'm going to
click on learning over here that's the
database and you can see that it has a
purple background that means that this
database is now selected so I can go
over to the SQL tab and run a query and
so for our very first query we're just
going to run a very very very simple
query I'm going to type the word select
and actually we want that to all the
caps so here's the thing whenever you
work with running queries in sequel
anything that happens to be SQL related
or sequel related you're going to type
that all in capital letters right so
make sure that the word select is
capital then also type the star symbol
so the star symbol over here in this
case means select all right that's what
the star symbol means it means select
everything and what I want to do now is
type the word from so select star from
and then we need a table name so
basically this word from is always going
to be followed by a table name
and I'm going to type in the table name
of uses but I want that to all be small
letters so you're probably wondering
okay why the heck is this all caps and
this small letters well the reason for
that is because this is a table name I
named the table and so yeah this is not
sequel related this is me related
because I name the table and so because
of that I'm going to type it in small
letters and that way I can very easily
tell the difference between what's equal
and what's not sequel what's actually my
table name
so sequel stuff is all caps and stuff
that happens to be something that I
named that's all going to be small
letters right and then another question
you guys might be wondering is what the
heck these things are so these are not
single quotes that would be a single
quote these things are backticks and the
back ticks are located next to the z key
if you have an English keyboard so next
to that button right right above the
control key and next to the shift key
and you want to surround any table name
or any table field that you use when you
run a query you want to surround those
with the Mac ticks it's just sequel
standard that you do that so that sequel
knows that this is actually a table name
all right so now that we've gotten all
of that out of the way let's click go
and you can see that we now have a
successful query that ran so this box is
green and it took 0.0002 seconds to run
my query and it selected everything from
the users table so we have ID names user
names passwords user emails first names
and last names of every user in our
database all of the information is
showing but here's the thing right
sometimes you're probably not going to
want to select all of the information
within a database sometimes it's just
easier to select the information that
you find necessary to select so in this
case let's say I only wanted to select
all usernames and all passwords of the
people within my database it's a lot
easier for me to go back to
the SQL tab over here and type the word
select and then specify the exact fields
that I want to select so like I said I
want to select the username username
comma and password so if you ever want
to select more than one field out of a
database you need to separate the fields
with a comma so I want to select the
username and the password from and the
table is going to be users right so
let's click go and that is going to
select only the user name and the
password from my users table and so now
you can see I have all of the user names
and all of the passwords from my table I
don't have any of the other extra
information that I didn't need so I
don't have the email addresses and
passwords and so on so let's do that one
more time so I'm going to go over to my
database here and then select the sequel
tab and type in my query again so it's
the word select followed by whatever
fields you want to select out of your
database and if you do if you aren't
interested in finding out what fields
are in your database you can actually
just go over to the table that you want
to select information from so I'm going
to click on the users table it's telling
me that I haven't made any changes
that's okay
but yeah I want to go to browse or I
could actually look at the structure so
I can see that in my users table I have
an ID field a username a password user
email first name and last name if I
click on browse I can see those same
fields here but I can also see what
information is inside of them so that's
how I kind of get the field names that I
want to select and something else I
could do is actually just click on the
sequel tab while having only a table
selected and you can see that I then
have the columns showing up on the side
of my screen over here so now I know
that there
is an ID section or a username section
there are also buttons that I can click
that will write a query for me but this
is a sequel tutorial so I don't want to
show you guys how to use PHP myadmin I
actually want to show you guys how to
write sequel queries right so instead
let's type the word select and I'm going
to then put in the fields that I want to
select so if I was going to select
everything then star is a nice shortcut
but if I don't want to select everything
then I only want to type in the fields
that I do want to select so let's select
the first name and the last name of
everybody in our database so we can see
who's here so select first underscore
name comma and we want to select the
last underscore name from the users
table so anybody who is in users right
and if I wanted to add another field to
this it's as simple as adding comma and
then typing the next field which we
could say user name right and they will
actually appear in this order so for
example in the database they are in
order ID username password and first
name and last name are actually at the
bottom of the database but I can make
first-name appear first by just
specifying the order in which they are
typed right so now first name should
come before username because I typed
them in that order in my query so let's
hit go and now you can see we've got
first name appearing before username and
then we have last name and we have user
name right so now that you guys know how
to select stuff from a database I want
to encourage you to practice playing
around with this between now and the
next video so practice selecting the
first name the last name and the ID of
every user or try play around with the
order that you're displaying these items
and yeah once you feel comfortable
selecting stuff from a database move on
to the next video where we will take a
look at
something a little bit more complex and
before I end off the video I just want
to send a huge thanks to these guys so
