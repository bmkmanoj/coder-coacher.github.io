here and welcome to tutorial number 21
and in this tutorial I am gonna talk to
you guys about the bootstrap carousel
some people actually prefer to call this
a bootstrap slider that's what I prefer
to call it but yeah whatever you guys
want to call it it's up to you is this
this is just what we're going to be
making in the tutorial and you can see
in the demo over here we have a
navigation to kind of move the slider
either way we have this little dot nav
at the bottom which we can use to swap
between slides if I had like 10
different slides I could skip all the
way to the end by hitting the last dot
nav then we also have a caption which is
text it's not something that I
photoshopped onto the image this is
actual text which can be indexed by
search engines and it can also be found
in a search so like when the user hits
ctrl F in their browser and like
searches for a word like let's just say
assorted then it'll show up so that is
pretty awesome that you don't have to
photoshop the text onto the image
because people use to do that back in
the day and yeah the most important
thing is the image in the background as
well so now that we've run through all
of that let's actually get started
looking at how to code so I am starting
off with this container and a row and a
column and that's kind of giving me this
look where the slider is centered with
the rest of the content but I know a lot
of people like to do this where they
have like the content all centered over
here but the slider goes all the way to
the end of the browser to meet the sides
so if you guys wanted to do it that way
then your content would have to be in
another container like down here below
and the container with the with the
slider should have a class of container
- fluid so that's if you guys want to do
it that way I'm not going to do it that
way
so yeah I'll let you guys play around
with it at the end of the tutorial
but for now let's
go ahead and create our parents div that
holds the rest of that slider so I'm
going to create a div over here and I'm
going to end that div off and this div
takes three attributes the first one is
an ID which we have to have the second
one is a class and the third one is a
new attribute which I've never spoken to
you guys about before and that is data -
ride so let's start off with the ID
first and I'm going to give this div an
ID of my slider you could call it
anything you wanted but you know just
for tutorials sake my slider great then
from here I need to go ahead and add
some classes so I'm going to add a class
of carousel and I'm also going to add a
secondary class of slide and what this
does is it pulls through the styling
from bootstrap that we need for the
slider so if you don't have these
classes the sliders probably not going
to work
yeah and now after we've done that let's
go ahead and add in this new attribute
that I spoke to you guys about which is
data - ride and you guys have probably
worked with the data
- toggle attributes which I mentioned in
the previous tutorials so this kind of
works in a similar way where that data
- toggle attribute kind of told
JavaScript not JavaScript it told the
browser while I'm tripping over myself
yeah but that attribute told the browser
when this element is clicked you need to
call some JavaScript that's going to
toggle the function or whatever and so
this attribute does a similar thing what
it does is when the browser loads it
tells bootstrap okay this slider needs
to start sliding and that's as simple as
it is okay so let's go ahead and just
set that data - ride attribute equal to
carousel and that means that when our
page loads this carousel should start
binning or you know start sliding great
so from here there are three other
groups or three other containers that we
have to add and I'm just going to create
a lot of space over here because I'm
going to leave some comments so the
first comment I wanna leave is gonna be
for indicators while I'm Decatur's know
okay calm down breathe Quinton
we won't make any more typos from now on
great
in the indicators great well and this is
also known as dot nav so it's going to
be these little dots down here and I can
go ahead and in that comment off so that
is where our indicators are going to be
from or below that we're going to have a
wrapper so I'm going to create another
comment here that says wrapper for
slides and this is where all of our
slides will go make sure we in that
comment of properly great and then below
the wrapper for our slides that is where
we put our navigation so that is going
to be these left and right buttons over
here so let me go ahead and make a
comment for that it's actually called
the controls or next and Prive buttons
great so now we know exactly what we're
going to do and what we're missing and
so yeah let's go over and start off with
the wrapper for the slides first seeing
as this is like the most interesting
part and I'm going to create a div over
here which is going to hold all of the
images and that is going to have a class
of a carousel - inner and you need to
make sure that that is spelled correctly
then let me go ahead and give this a
roll which is going to be equal to list
box this role attribute is not necessary
but it helps like explain to the browser
what we
using this div 4 so yeah it's it's just
useful for like screen readers and those
kinds of things but again we might not
or it's not it's not necessary so you
don't have to add it in basically then
from here we need to create a bunch of
divs so I'm going to open up a div tag
and I'm going to close that off and just
drop that down a line and each one of
these divs is going to be a new slide so
if we have one slide we'll have one div
but if we have 10 slides then we'll have
10 of these divs in here great so let me
give this a class and the class is item
which kind of explains itself and then
I'm going to give this one a secondary
class which is active and this active
class should only be on one of your
slides because that is going to be the
slide that the slider opens on when you
open the web page great so right now
that one's active and generally I guess
it will be your first slide it makes a
lot of sense for that to happen but if
you guys want to change it and use the
last one you could do that up to you
great so let me go ahead and add an
image inside of here so this is going to
be the image that shows in the slide and
an image requires two attributes the
first one is the source and the next one
is an alt attribute and I am going to
give the first image a source of fruits
dot jpg but that is actually in a folder
called images which is relative to my
index file over here so that means I
have to go into the images folder to
look for the images right so that means
I need a source of images slash and then
my image name which is fruits and that
is
a JPEG image then for an alt attribute
I'm just going to type the word fruits
hopefully this image is always found and
there's never any trouble so I don't
need that old but that all what that alt
does is actually also explain to search
engines like Google what this image is
actually about so if you guys want to
put something more descriptive in there
go ahead and do that so now we've got
our image underneath the image this is
where we add a caption which is another
div tag so I'm going to go ahead and hit
enter make sure that that div is like
over two lines we've got some space and
this div needs a class of I think
carousel - caption so let's say class
carousel - caption and inside of this
div you guys could put pretty much any
text that you wanted to put in here so
I'm going to just add in an h1 but if
you guys wanted to use paragraphs or
something like that you could go ahead
and do that that's fine and it's totally
up to you how much content you want in
this caption but let me go ahead and
close that h1 off and I'm just going to
say assorted fruits as the content and
now I'm going to go to the browser and
refresh for the first time so let's hope
everything works and it looks good to me
so we have one slide with a caption we
don't have any navigation at the moment
and we don't have any buttons at the
moment but let's go ahead and continue
coding so we can finish this slider and
like I said each one of our slides is
going to be the same as this content so
I can actually just copy all of that and
oops paste that down here I need to
remove that active class because only
one of these items should be active and
I'm going to use the first one but you
guys could use any one you wanted great
so from here we now have two slides I'm
just going to change the content in this
caption to be raspberries and I also
want to change that image to I believe
it's called raspberry dot JPEG let me go
ahead and open double check yeah it
looks good
great so save that and if I jump back
over the browser now I should have two
slides but I can't navigate between the
two of them just yet because we haven't
created any buttons so that is the next
step and the reason why I was just like
kind of waiting is I was waiting for
that slide or the timer on that slider
to run so we could see that both images
are indeed here great so that is our
images side sorted let's take a look at
how to create the next and previous
buttons which will be the two buttons on
the side and that is quite simple it's
actually two links that we need to
create so I'm going to create an a tag
and we can just end that a tag off but
there's going to be some content inside
of here so I'm just going to drop that
down a line like that and this a tag
needs a class first of all and then
we'll have the href in just a second but
I'm going to add a class of left to this
first one and that is because it's going
to be for the left button then we need
to add another class which is carousel -
control and this is basically telling
bootstrap that this is going to be a
control you kind of need that class
there so don't skip it and then the href
that is actually going to be set to
whatever ID you used up here
so whatever ID you use for the like
container of the slides go ahead and
copy that paste that in here and make
sure to put a hash before this because
this is going to be calling some
JavaScript so yeah href my slider and
that just means that it is calling back
to the slider and not like linking to
another page or anything like that great
and then I'm going to add a roll now
this is I believe not necessary but it
is good to have so let's go ahead and
just add this roll is equal to button
and what that means is it's telling the
browser and it's telling screen readers
and stuff out there that we are using
this link not as a link but as a button
because if you think about it when you
click on this link you're not going to
another page you're just switching
between different slides on the on the
slider great so now that that's in there
we need to add one more attribute which
is data - slide and we need to set that
equal to something and this attribute
basically tells the slider which way to
slide when the link is clicked so I'm
going to add a text of it of Prive over
here and that means that when this link
is clicked we need to move to the
previous slide which is also the left
slide or the slide to the left so yeah
now that that's done we need to actually
add in our arrow our left arrow
so I'm going to add a span tag over here
and I'm going to give the span a class
woo class is equal to glyph icon and
cliff icon
- Chevron - left so that it is an arrow
that points to the left we could also
add a secondary attribute of area -
hidden is equal to true not necessary
but what it does is hide the arrow if
you're not hovering over it or something
great so that is our span tag sorted and
then if you guys want to take care of
screen
because if you want to take care of
people with disabilities coming to see
your site that are using a screen reader
you might want to add a secondary span
and that will have a class is equal to
SR - only and that just needs some
content so I'm going to say previous and
what this does is hide the span tag so
basically it won't be visible to people
who are not using a screen reader but
people who are using a screen reader
will know that this is actually a button
to go to the previous slide yeah that's
just what it's there for
great so we've got our left button
sorted all I need to do now is copy that
link and paste it again and then change
the content or the class from left to
right then we also need to change data -
slide from previous to next and we need
to change this glyph icon to go to the
right instead of to the left so let's go
ahead and hit save and now if I come
back to my browser and hit refresh you
can see I have two arrows over here that
we didn't have before and when I click
on them the slider is moving to the left
and to the right great so that's done
the last thing we need to do is add in
our indicators or our dot nav so I know
this is taught this tutorial is getting
kind of long but it's almost done this
one or this part should go quite quick
all we need to do is open up an ordered
list and go ahead and close it again
give this ordered list a class and I'm
going to give it a class of carousel -
in the caterers and that is necessary
what it does is pull through the styling
to turn each unordered list item into
just one little dot and put it down here
great so now we need to make a list item
and I'm going to go ahead and close that
off and
this list item needs two attributes so
I'm going to go ahead and say data
- target and this is a necessary
attribute what it does is references
back to that slider so when you click on
the list item it's going to change to
the slide that we wanted to change to
and what we need to do is actually grab
our ID for our slider paste that in here
and also use a hash and that just
references back to that slider again so
we know that the target or the data that
we want to change is in the slider and
then we need to give this another
attribute which is data - slide - - and
that is the slide that we want to slide
to and the first slide in bootstrap is
slide number zero because we start
counting at zero with computers great so
that's now done I can go ahead and copy
this and I'll paste this down here and
for the second button we'll just add a 1
to here so that means we'll now have two
dots because we have two sliders and the
first dot is going to link to the first
slide or the zero with slide and the
second dot is going to link to the
number one slide or the second slide
actually which is the rasberry slide and
then what you guys need to do is
whichever one of your slides has the
active class in my case it's this first
one I'm going to go ahead and copy that
and I'm going to come back up to the top
here and just add a class to my zero
width slide which is this one and I'm
going to add that as active as well and
what that does is just turn our dot
active for the active slide great I hope
hopefully you kind of understood that
basically whichever slide is there kind
of needs to have the active class great
and here is our active button there is
our non active
click the non-active button and I can
slide between the different slides great
awesome we have now made a slider or a
carousel in bootstrap how fantastic is
that and that is all I have you in this
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
