here and welcome to tutorial number
forty Wow can you guys believe that I
have rarely made 40 of these tutorials
and we're going to be approaching 50 in
the next few days so that's actually
quite exciting definitely something to
celebrate celebrate about in the 50th
tutorial but anyways for now
in this video I actually just want to
explain a topic called variable scope so
whenever you guys are programming in
pretty much any programming language you
are going to hear about something called
a global variable and then something
called a local variable now these
variables pretty much have their own
scope of where they are allowed to be
used and where they can be used actually
so for example let's say I had a
function so I'm just gonna make a
function here and we'll call it scope ER
and I'll declare a variable enya called
value and we'll set that equal to 800
okay now because this variable is stored
within our function or created within
our function that means that this
variable is a local variable meaning
that it is local to this function okay
so if we go ahead and we try use that
variable outside the function so let me
just echo out value then you'll notice
we're probably going to get an error so
let's go back to Firefox here click
refresh and define variable and that's
pretty weird because we did actually
define this variable over there in our
function so let's go ahead and maybe
call the function so go ahead and call
scoper and then see what happens so
let's go back here and save and click
refresh and still an defined variable
and like I said that's because this
variable is local to
function scopa so that means that we can
only use the variable inside the
function so whenever we're trying to
print out value over here the computer
doesn't know what value is in fact
whenever you create a variable inside a
function this variable doesn't even
exist until the function is called and
this func this variable will only exist
while the computer is running the code
inside of the function so whenever you
create a function and there's a variable
inside of it this variable only exists
while the code is running that function
and as soon as that function ends or as
soon as the computer is finished working
with this function then all of the
variables that were declared in that
function cease to exist so they they're
no longer there for the computer to use
and that's why the computer didn't know
what value was down here if I maybe just
push ctrl Z and get that back so that's
why the computer didn't know why that
value or what this value is but now if I
go ahead and I take this echo statements
and I actually echo out the value inside
the function obviously this will work
because we we declared a local variable
here and we're using that local variable
inside of the function so we're keeping
everything obviously local so that
should work now let's talk about global
functions okay
I mean global variable sorry and a
global variable is basically any
variable that you declare outside of a
function in your code so let's say I
declared a variable over here and I'll
also I'll call this one value as well
and we'll set this equal to four okay
this means that this variable is a
global variable so if we ever try and
use this value inside of our function
you'll probably notice that we're not
gonna get
for printed out so let's let's go back
let's save this okay
and go back to our browser and click
refresh and as you can see we still have
800 echoed out so even though we have a
variable over here called value and a
variable over here called value these
two variables actually have their own
scope so this one was global and this
one was local but the function obviously
preferred to use the local variable when
it had to echo out value in fact if I go
back here down here and then I echo out
will echo out global so global value is
and we'll leave space there just append
on value and inside the function will
echo out function cut put my string
these function value is that and we'll
spend on value and we're probably just
gonna have to append on a break tag as
well don't forget the equation box cuz
it's the string break okay cool so now
if I go back and save this you'll see
that what did I do wrong okay
I forgot to append on the value with a
full stop or a comma or something okay
so let's go back here and click refresh
and you can see that we've got function
value was 800 and the global value is 4
so we're still using the local value in
our function okay so this means if you
ever want to use a global value in your
function then you have to type in the
keyword global and then you'll put in
your variable name
whichever the global variable was now
I'm just going to take that equal to 800
outs so that we do not change the value
of our global variable and now what our
program is doing is we've declared a
variable over here called for time
called value and it's set equal to four
okay and we're making use of that global
variable inside of our function by using
the keyword global and then we're
echoing that global variable out here
and we're occurring that global variable
out over here so now we should get the
same value for both of the variables
function value is 4 and global variable
value is 4 I'm getting a very
tongue-tied at the moment I don't know
why but yeah okay so that's how you make
use of a global variable inside a
function and I've already shown you guys
in the previous tutorial how to pass a
local variable from a function back to a
global variable so if you go back and
watch the previous tutorial then you'll
know how to take a local variable in a
function and send it out to a global
variable and the last thing I want to
mention to you guys just before we end
this video is creating variables inside
a function so obviously creating local
variables inside a function is obviously
more efficient because it'll take up
less memory space on the computer okay
so that's because the variables will
only be stored in memory while the
functions running and while the when the
function finishes running or ends
running then you've got all that space
in memory back to use again and if you
were creating a global variable then all
of those variables would have to stay
stuck in memory and it would probably
slow down the computer if you had quite
a lot of those
global variables so obviously it's up to
you as a programmer to decide which
variables you really need to be global
and then which variables can I don't
really matter if they're local or global
or not okay so it's a good obviously
good programming practice to try keep as
many of your variables local and that's
actually all I have for you guys in this
video so don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
or share the video it's really gonna
help my channel grow and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
