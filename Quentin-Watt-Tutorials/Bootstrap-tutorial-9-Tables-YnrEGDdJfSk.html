here and welcome to tutorial number nine
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about tables and bootstrap so
I'm going to show you guys how to use
tables in bootstrap and also a little
bit of cool functionality that bootstrap
has added to some of the tables with
some classes and stuff so right now
you'll notice that in my browser I
actually have a table but right now it
doesn't look very good in fact it looks
pretty crappy and that is because
bootstrap doesn't add any styling to
your table whenever you add a table
without any class okay so what I've got
here in my code is a table and it's got
some information in the rows so I don't
know if I should expand these and just
show you guys that there's information
there but there we go
so we have this table but it doesn't
have any class and therefore it doesn't
have any styling and the reason why this
happens is because the guys at bootstrap
or the guys who created bootstrap kind
of decided well people actually use
tables to create calendars and all sorts
of other things in HTML and they don't
want bootstrap to like be
counterproductive and add its own
styling to your calendar that you try to
make with a table so what they decided
to do was instead of having default
styling for a table you actually have to
add a class to the table so if I jump
back over to my code and I add the class
of table then we will land up having a
table that looks a lot more like a table
because now what we're doing is we're
pulling through the bootstrap styling
with this class and I know it seems a
little bit redundant that we've got
table with a class of table but like I
said that's there for a reason so if we
jump back over to the browser and I hit
refresh
you can see that now our table looks fan
tastic it's all spaced out we've gotten
see what's a header we can see which
ones are different rows and different
columns so it's pretty awesome
okay and I want to show you guys a few
other cool things we can do with
bootstrap because it doesn't only stop
with that class so we can go ahead and
add a few other classes as well and I'm
going to go ahead and add a secondary
class of table - striped and if I save
this now I should land up with a striped
table so as you can see that now I've
refreshed this I have the first row of
my table has now got a dark background
and the second row of my table also now
has a dark background and so that's what
table stripe does is it just makes every
alternating row every 2nd row a
different color which is pretty cool and
there's a few other things we can do
over here so if I change this class from
from table striped to table ordered I
should land up with a bordered table so
this is just going to add borders around
pretty much everything so there we go we
have a border around each one of the
cells so now it looks a lot more like a
scientific table or something like if we
were actually presenting some real
statistics over here we could go ahead
and do that and there are a few other
classes so I'm going to run through a
couple of them and well I'm going to run
through all of them actually so we've
got striped we've got boarded there's
also a class called table hover and what
this does is just change the row that
we're hovering over so I'm going to go
ahead and hit refresh and you can see
that right now we've got a table but
none of the rows are highlighted or
darkened or anything like that but as
soon as I move my mouse over one of the
rows the background changes color which
is pretty cool
in fact this is kind of like a little
directory or something I don't know
maybe it's just there so that users
don't lose their place as they're
reading a really long table or something
that's quite useful so we could do all
of that and there is another class that
we can use which is called table -
condensed and what table condense does
is just condense the entire table so it
takes away some of the padding and stuff
and it just makes your table smaller so
if we go ahead and hit refresh you can
see the table kind of shrunk a little so
that's what the table condensed class
does and we can use all of these tail or
all of these classes like together as
well so not only can I use table
condensed I could also use table striped
so now we have three classes on this
table but when I go ahead and hit save
and I come back over here to the browser
I have a condensed table so it's smaller
than a normal table but it also has the
striped columns which is pretty cool and
I know I'm saying that quite a lot in
this tutorial it's pretty cool but hey
yeah you guys are gonna have to deal
with it so here we go that is how we
work with tables but there is actually
one last thing I'd like to show you guys
and we can and that is that we can
actually add different classes to the
rows as well so I'm going to get rid of
those two classes and I'm still going to
keep the class of table but I'm going to
go over to a couple of these rows and
I'm going to add some classes to them as
well
and what I want to do is just add a
class of active to the first one and
active is going to apply the same
styling that hover would apply so if I
go ahead and save this and jump back
over to the browser you can see that now
the first row is kind of highlighted or
darkened so that's kind of just like
if you wanted a row to display active by
default you could go ahead and add that
class otherwise you could use any of
bootstraps colors or words for the color
scheme so we could use success info
warning danger primary and what that'll
do is pull through the colors which I
have kind of shown you guys before so we
now have a table row that is marked with
the success color which kind of just
indicates that the user has done
something positive or you know bootstrap
terms you could read through the the man
I totally forgot the word I meant that
you can read through the documentation
to find out more which what each of
these colors is supposed to represent
but the names kind of give it away if
you think about it and that is all I
have for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share this video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys and girls
