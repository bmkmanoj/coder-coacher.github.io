here and welcome to tutorial number 12
and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about variable scope so
variable scope is basically where am I
allowed to use a variable inside of my
program because you actually get two
different kinds of variables you get
global variables and then you get local
variables so I've titled the page quite
nicely over there okay and global
variables are basically variables that
are declared outside of a function and
they can be used anywhere inside of my
program but a local variable on the
other hand is a variable that is
declared inside of a function and that
local variable is only allowed to be
used inside of the function in which it
is declared so you guys understand not
really okay well let's go ahead and take
a look at an example real quick and what
I'm going to do is at the top of the
page we can just declare a variable so
I'm going to clear it and I'm going to
call it champion and I'll set that equal
to fizz because I play a lot of League
of Legends and fizz is my favorite
champion by far so basically what this
means now is that this is a global
variable it can be used anywhere in our
program so I'm just going to go ahead
and we'll leave a comment of VLC global
and now what we can do is also just want
to make a function so we can we can't
have a local variable without having a
function so we'll just go ahead and make
a function here and I'm going to call
this function print champion and right
now it's job is just to print out the
champions name so let's go ahead and
break that down and we'll just say
document dot right okay and I'm going to
write out my champions name so a
champion plus I actually want to
concatenate a little bit of extra
information on the end there so I want
to concatenate inside function so that I
know that this line came from inside of
the function and then I'm also just
going to include a line break on the end
there just so that the next line starts
on a new line and now what we can do is
uh obviously we have to call our
function so I'm going to call print
champion and below that I'm going to
print out one more line onto the page so
we go ahead and say document dot write
whoops and what we'll do now is we'll
print out a champion name plus we'll
concatenate outside function and then
we'll also include a break just for good
measure okay cool so now when we go
ahead and save this and then we run this
in Firefox you can see that we get two
lines of code printed out on the page we
get furs inside function and then we get
furs outside function and I actually
made quite a few typos embarrassing okay
cool so we get these two lines printed
out on the screen so what does that mean
we got the one that was printed from
inside the function and then we've got
the one that was printed from outside
the function and the reason why this
worked is because this was a global
variable meaning it could be used
anywhere in our program and
would work ok but now let's take a look
if we go ahead and we cut this out and
we declare this variable inside of our
function instead so now instead of being
a global variable it's a local variable
ok and let's go ahead and save this go
back to Firefox and watch what happens
when I click refresh ok now I only get
one line printed on the screen so why
did that happen why I've only got one
line well like I said this is now a
local variable ok which means that it
can only be used inside of this function
because this is the function that our
variable was declared inside of ok so
you can basically think of it like this
function is greedy and basically what
it's saying is ok you declared this
variable inside of me ok that means no
one else is allowed to use it
so when we try to use the this variable
name over here we couldn't because it's
it's not global it's a local and it's
only local to this function ok so
basically that's the difference between
a global variable and a local variable
and I should probably just say this
before I end off don't go because you
watch this video don't go ahead and make
all of your variables global variables
and think okay well because global works
everywhere I'll just make them all
global okay that is bad programming
practice and if other programmers there
are a lot more experienced than you see
you just like making everything a global
variable even if it doesn't have to be
then they're kind of just going to label
you as a bad programmer so you as a
programmer know where you're going to
use a global variable or where you're
going to use a local variable that is
your decision to make but you'll get
better at it with practice
so the more you practice the more you'll
realize okay well I'm going to use this
variable all over my program so I'll
make it global
but then I've got another variable that
I'll use just only inside this function
and that one I'll make local so just
that that's a decision that you guys
will have to start making in future
whenever you guys start programming but
that's actually all I have for you in
this video so don't forget to subscribe

you guys have a good programming joke to
share then leave it in the comments
section below
and we can all have a good laugh so
thanks for watching and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
