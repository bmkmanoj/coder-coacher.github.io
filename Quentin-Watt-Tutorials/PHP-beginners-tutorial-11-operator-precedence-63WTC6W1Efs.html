here and welcome to tutorial number 11
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about operator precedence in
PHP so what do I mean by operator
precedence well I'm simply talking about
the ranking or the importance of certain
operators over others okay
because there are some that are more
important than the others and they
actually get calculated first so let's
say for example I had a variable called
apples and it always seems to be apples
these days but hey okay and I set that
equal to 5 plus 3 times 2 okay now some
people might be thinking ok well 5 plus
3 is 8 times 2 okay well that's 16 and
that's actually not good maths so let's
echo that out and see what we get as
apples save this now and go back to
Firefox yeah I'm just going to have to
type in this whole thing localhost
tutorials tutorial this is 11 okay so as
you can see I've actually got the answer
11 printed out on the screen or echo it
out on the screen so why is that well 3
times 2 is 6
ok then plus 5 is 11 now the reason why
this happened was because in mathematics
the general rule is that you should
always do multiplication before division
okay so that's what PHP did because PHP
knows that so I've been 3 times 2 is 6
plus 5 well that's 11 and then I printed
out 11 on this
with this line of code yeah okay so PHP
actually knows most of our general rules
in mathematics because of this operator
presidents thing that I'm talking to you
guys about now okay so one thing my
teachers always told me when I was doing
maths was to always remember bad math
okay which is basically brackets of
division multiplication addition and
subtraction okay so that is actually the
order that calculations must be done
with in maths
okay so always do the brackets first
then you can go on to division
multiplication addition and lastly
subtraction okay and that's the same
thing in PHP so if I wanted this sum
over here to be done first so if I
wanted five plus three to be done first
and then multiply by two I could go
ahead and put some brackets in here
because brackets hold a higher
precedence in PHP than the
multiplication symbol so when we save
this now and go back to Firefox and
click refresh we now have the answer 16
so that was indeed 5 plus 3 which was 8
times 2 which goes to 16 okay and if you
guys want a much more detailed table
then you can go back to this link over
here I will leave this link in the
description below so you can go ahead
and just click on it and you'll get this
table here of operator presidents in PHP
and as you can see there's a whole list
here so we've got the multiplication
symbol and the division symbol above the
addition and subtraction symbol so
obviously whatever's higher up on this
table is more important than the stuff
that's lower down and
boots are getting annoying okay so
whatever's higher up is more important
than the stuff that's lower down so
multiplication and division and modulus
will all be done before addition and
subtraction likewise if you scroll even
further down you'll see that over here
we've actually got all the assignment
operators as well okay so not only does
PHP know that it has to do
multiplication before division and that
it has to do anything in brackets before
it does multiplication it also knows
that it has to complete this entire sum
going this entire calculation before
assigning this value to the variable
okay so that's why the assignment
operators are so low down on the
president's table okay but like I said I
will leave this link in the description
below and you guys can come and check
this out if you guys need any help or
you guys want to understand it a little
bit more there is a little bit of a
article that you can read as well so
thank you very much guys don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share the video it's
really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
