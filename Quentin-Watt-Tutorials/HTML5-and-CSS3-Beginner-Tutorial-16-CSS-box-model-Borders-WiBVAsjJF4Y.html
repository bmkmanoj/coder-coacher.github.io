to tutorial number 16 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to be talking to
you guys about borders and I'm pretty
sure all of you guys know what borders
are and there's no point in me even
explaining even though in the last
tutorial I kind of made myself look dumb
and I said a border is a line that goes
all the way around your box so yeah I'm
pretty sure all you guys know what a
border is I don't really have to explain
it but before we get started I just want
you guys to take note that I'm still
using the same HTML code that we used in
the previous tutorial and I'm still
using all the exact same CSS except for
the fact that I changed my padding to be
20 pixels all the way around so if you
run this in Firefox you should get a
nice even 20 pixel padding all the way
around our header so let's go ahead and
make our borders and to add in a border
you have to add in three properties so
you actually have to go border - width
and that's going to be the width of your
border how wide do you want your border
to be so let's just start that off at 4
pixels so that you guys can see it but
usually you'll set a border to be around
1 or 2 pixels I don't really see too
many websites have borders thicker than
that and then we can just go border
color border - color and we can set that
to red and then we've got the border
style now the border style is and
there's actually a whole different bunch
of styles that you can use so you can
use solid borders - borders dotted
borders and I'll explain the rest to you
later so let's just go ahead and set
this border - style to be solid that
just means it's going to be one color
all the way
on so let's go ahead and save that and
when you go back to fire clock Firefox
and click refresh
watch what happens we're going to get a
nice red border all the way around our
blue box look at that okay pretty
awesome so that's how you add a border
in CSS but you know what to be honest if
you go back to your CSS if you take a
look at this I mean every time you want
to add a border that's three lines of
code that is a lot of coding and you
know what if you want to be lazy like me
you don't really want to type three
lines of code every time you want to add
a border so I'm just going to show you
guys a shorter way real quick now what
you can do is you can actually just tap
in the property border and instead of
adding in any of these keywords what you
then do is you just put this the width
of the border you want so four pixels
and then you put your style so solid and
then you can put in your color which you
want is red and then we can actually get
rid of all this code because we are
needed anymore and if we save this and
we go back to Firefox you're going to
see it's exactly the same nothing's
going to happen so our this code still
works it does exactly the same as all
three of the other lines but it's all in
one line so if you guys are lazy like me
then that's the way that you guys
actually want to add a border to your
page it's just a lot shorter and it's a
lot easier and yeah basically just for
me a lot better that's how I prefer to
make a border and then the next thing I
want to show you guys is I've already
showed you guys that you can change the
color which with a hexadecimal number so
if you went and grabbed the hexadecimal
number like that and put it in here
you'd be able to change your color and I
mean you guys obviously know how to
change the width of your border I mean
just the bigger pixels the with more
wider it's going to get the smaller the
pixels the thinner it's going to get
but Styles like I said there are
different types of styles that you can
use for your border so we've used solid
which was a solid white solid color all
the way around now what you can do is
let's just go ahead and change this to -
just so that you can see that there are
some different styles and watch what
happens when you change it to - now you
get these like dashed lines all the way
around our header which is you know
pretty cool if you wanted to make like a
coupon or something and you also get
dotted I sold it I'll show you guys what
dotted looks like and that's basically
just dots all the way around our page or
our header sorry and yeah there's
actually a whole bunch of them there's
dotted this inserts and outs it's and
you guys can go ahead and play with all
of those different styles I'm actually
going to put them all in the description
below so go ahead and take it the
description take a look at the
description and then try out all those
styles and see which one you like and
the last thing I want to explain to you
guys is in the previous video you guys
watched you would have seen that we
could put padding different padding on
each side of our content now over here
we can also do the same thing with the
border so if I wanted my border on the
top and only on the top then I could
just go border - top and when we refresh
this we're just going to get one solid
border all the way along the top of our
header so let's refresh and there we go
and you can also do that with left and
right and so on but I'm not going to
explain that all to you guys because
it's pretty obvious what it's going to
do so if you guys want different borders
then you can actually specify different
styles for the top left right and bottom
and you'll actually get
different styles so that's all I've got
for you guys in this tutorial and I hope
you guys join me for the next tutorial
where we will be talking about margins
