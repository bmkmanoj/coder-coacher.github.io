number 23 and in this tutorial I'm just
gonna talk to you guys about pseudo
classes so pseudo classes are actually
built into CSS and they're just to give
you guys a little bit more control over
your styling rules and like I said they
are actually built into CSS so you can't
go ahead and you know try use your own
pseudo classes and expect them to work
there's actually quite a few that are
built in and then you have to use those
specific ones so let's just go ahead and
use an example real quick and what we
can do is just make fair paragraphs so
that's paragraph number one and I think
I'm actually just gonna copy this
quickly and what we can do now is just
say you and our next paragraph can be
only and the next one can be live and I
guess you guys can kind of see where
this is going once so Yolo because why
not and now what we can do is go over to
our CSS and what I want to do is
actually want to use a pseudo class to
style the first letter of every single
one of our paragraphs as you can see I
haven't actually you know surrounded our
the first letter of our paragraphs with
any sort of tag or anything like that I
haven't actually done anything to them
but what we can do it now is you can use
a pseudo class to actually just select
the first letter of our paragraph and to
do that we obviously just gonna go ahead
and select our paragraph first and now
we're going to use the colon symbol just
to say that we're gonna start using a
pseudo class and like I said we want to
select the first letter so there's a
pseudo a pseudo class for that which is
called first - letter
and that helps us just select the first
letter obviously and what we can do now
is maybe just change the color to blue
and we can probably change the font size
to you know 30 pixels or something go
ahead 30 pixels and now when we go back
to our HTML and then run this in Firefox
you'll see we land up having this
paragraph or four paragraphs all with a
really big letter at the front the first
letter is already big it's actually 30
pixels and then blue so that's pretty
cool and that's pretty much how to use a
pseudo class in CSS and like I said they
are actually quite a few different
pseudo classes that you can use so
there's actually first letter first
child last child before after and I mean
there's actually so many but I'll be
covering a few of them over the next
couple of tutorials so that's all I have
for you in this tutorial and I'll see
you guys next time

I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
