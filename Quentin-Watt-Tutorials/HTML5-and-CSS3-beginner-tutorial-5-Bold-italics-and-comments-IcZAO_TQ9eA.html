here and welcome to tutorial number five
and in this tutorial I'm going to talk
to you guys about bold and italics and
comments actually so I've got a
paragraph that I prepared before this
tutorial just kind of like save time so
you wouldn't have to watch me type all
of this out and I'd like to bold this
sentence and then I'd like to put this
sentence and I
tallix now there are a couple different
ways to bold text in HTML but using just
pure HTML know CSS I'm going to show you
guys two different ways now the first
way I'm going to show you guys is
semantic markup now semantic means that
the HTML actually means something you
want most of your text or most of the
markup on your page to be semantic
because well semantic is read out in
screen readers differently so let me go
ahead and just type all this stuff out
then I'll come back to talking about
semantics semantics so let's say I want
to bold this text well the semantic way
to bold this text would be to use a
strong tag and then to go back over to
the end of that sentence and just close
off my strong tag if you forget to close
this off then it will bold the entire
paragraph so let me go ahead and save
this now and come back over to the
browser refresh the text that you saw
displaying here was from the previous
tutorial let me go ahead and maybe just
zoom in on this a little bit so you can
see it more clearly but you can see that
all of this is normal text or all of the
rest of this is normal text but over
here we have some bolded text so that is
how you bold text semantically and then
to do it the non semantic way you could
just bold it using a
be tagged now this is the non preferred
way you shouldn't actually be simply
using the B tag you should use the
strong tag whenever possible so let me
go ahead and hit refresh in the browser
and as you can see there is no visual
difference between using the B tag and
the strong tag so if you're simply just
trying to bold text for visual purposes
then you know the B tag and the strong
tag no visual difference but to Google
search robots or to screen readers for
blind people or to other user agents
that use HTML whenever you use the
strong tag like I said this is semantic
markup now semantic markup you can go
ahead and google the definition but
basically this is HTML that means
something a screen reader would read
this out in a different voice so if this
was this is normal text then this would
be strong text you know it would it
would carry more weight behind it I hope
that was not too loud in the microphone
and yeah let's take a look at the
italics so I want to italicize this
sentence so I'm just going to go ahead
and surround that in an e/m tag now
eeehm stands for emphasis and this is
the semantic way of creating italics so
let me come back here and hit refresh
and now you can see this sentence has
been italicized
so again semantic markup would just mean
that a browser a screen reader may read
this out differently or a search robot
like google may read this up differently
so we'd have normal text again and now
we'd have some italics I don't know how
you'd put emphasis on that in your voice
but yeah basically emphasis is the
semantic way of marking this up
and you could also do with the
non-semantic way using an eye tag but
this again is non semantics so it's not
the preferred way of italicizing text
but you know go ahead and create the eye
tag and come back here and refresh and
you'll see there is no visual difference
between the eye tag and the emphasis tag
it's just that people prefer to use e/m
over the eye tag so now that we've taken
a look at how to bold and italicize text
I want to talk to you guys about HTML
comments because this is something that
we're probably going to be using in the
next couple of videos and it's just nice
to know right know here at the beginning
so an HTML comment is created using the
smaller than sign and exclamation mark
and then two hyphens or two minus signs
whatever you want to call those and then
you end off your comments by creating
two hyphens and the greater than sign
you'll notice anything in between those
two symbols turns gray
so it's commented out this basically
means that text within these comments
does not display in the front end it
does not display in the browser but it
does display in the text editor so that
we as the programmers can read this and
it's it's great for leaving notes to
yourself explaining code to yourself or
maybe like you have a paragraph like
this that you're not quite sure if you
want to display on the website right now
so you can just comment that out and you
know when you refresh it it's not going
to display on the webpage so right now
I'm not quite sure about this text I
don't want it on the side so I'll
comment it out but then when I do want
to display it I'll just take my comments
away and
it will now display on the site but like
I said it's also good for leaving notes
to yourself so we learned bold and
italics with this tutorial hopefully you
spell your notes correctly that's kind
of important to yourself you want to be
able to reuse so yeah like I said
anything within these comments is not
going to show up in the browser and that
is all I have for you in this tutorial
so I will see you guys next time
I just want to send a shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain they run a
coding bootcamp with courses on iOS
development UX design and web
development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
I thank you hey thanks for staying until
the end of the video that really means a
lot to me
now while you're still here there are a
few things that you can do to help first
of all if you haven't already subscribe
and watch another one of my videos and
if you want to help me make more content
more often or if you feel that my
content is just worth paying a little
bit of money towards you can check me
