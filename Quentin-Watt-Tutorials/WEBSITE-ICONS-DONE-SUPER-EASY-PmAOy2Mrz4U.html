here and welcome to this tutorial on
adding awesome icons to your website
using font awesome so if we take a look
at my screen right now you can see that
I've got a website open which is font
awesome dot IO so you can go ahead and
type that on your browser or I will
leave a link in the video description
below so go ahead and check that out and
one of the reasons why font awesome is
so awesome it's not just the name but
yeah and the way we can use it it's
super super easy to use and there's a
bunch of different icons available in
font awesome but also all of the icons
work as a font which means if you want
to apply a font property to this using
CSS then you can go ahead and do that
which means you can easily change the
color of an icon you can easily change
the size of an icon
there's no using Photoshop or Adobe
Illustrator to have to change the sizes
of these icons and that's why font
awesome
is so cool so yeah if you go over the
font awesomes website the first thing
you're gonna see is this big old
download button over here and you can go
ahead and click on that if you like and
download font awesome
but before I get into any of this I do
want to show you guys the code that I'm
using for this tutorial so let's jump
over to my text editor and actually I
just want to remove that line of code
over there for now but this is the code
I'm starting with so yeah if you guys
really want to look into this then just
read or look at the comments over here
pause the video read the comments you
can see what each one of these lines of
code does and then the same thing for my
CSS file pause the video here and take a
look at what each one of these lines of
code does but yeah hopefully you've
paused the video you've typed out that
kind of code and we can move on with the
rest of the tutorial so what I'd like to
do now is add font awesome to my website
and there are two ways to do this the
first way is to basically use the CDN so
I can just link directly to font awesome
and the second way is to download font
awesome and then
build a link so I think the easiest way
the the way that's going to be easiest
for you guys is to just go over to
Google type font awesome CDN and yeah
use the first link that shows up so in
this case I'm just using bootstrap CDN
comm font awesome and that is a link to
font awesomes CDN so if you click on
that that's gonna open up this page
which has a link to font awesome and I
think the best thing to do is maybe just
click that little drop down arrow and
copy the HTML link so go ahead and copy
that and go over to sublime and paste
that in here and that is definitely the
easiest way to link to a font awesome
and I think that's where a lot of people
go wrong is building this link or
building this href link whenever you're
linking to a style sheets so you could
go about another way by actually
downloading font awesome and then
finding out where the font awesome file
is and then linking that over here as
well so if you want to go ahead and do
that it's up to you but I think using
the CDN is definitely the easiest option
and so now that you've got fun - awesome
link to your website the first thing we
can go ahead and do to test that out is
add some code to your site so jump over
to the font awesome website again and if
you click on the icons page that's gonna
take you through to a list of all the
icons that you can actually use on font
awesome so if you scroll down a little
bit you can see there are some new icons
in font awesome version 4.7 so take a
look at those if you think any of those
are usable or scroll down and you can
see some of the really old historical
ones and I think for the purpose of this
tutorial one of the ones I wanted to use
was the coffee icon so if you go ahead
and click on that you can see that now
adding an icon to your website is as
simple as copying this code and going
over to your website and pasting it in
wherever you want the icon to appear so
this is just a simple
I icon with a class of fa4 font awesome
so FAA stands for font awesome and then
we've got the next one over here FA
coffe or FA - coffee so that just tells
font awesome which icon you're going to
apply and in this case it is the coffee
icon so if you save this now and jump
back over to your browser and come back
and hit refresh you can see that now we
have the icon showing up although it is
really really small so something we can
do to change that is to just add some
CSS properties so like I said the great
thing about font awesome is that you can
add any font property to this icon and
treat it exactly as it as if it were a
font so I can add a style property over
here and then I can change the font size
to make that 80 pixels if I wanted the
icon to be a little bit bigger so if I
come back here and hit refresh you can
see that now the icon is quite a lot
larger also if I wanted to change the
color of this icon I can jump back over
to my text editor and add another style
rule over here to change the color to
something like red and that would change
the color of the icon to red as well so
there we go and yeah it's really really
easy to use these icons and also yeah
you can change the colors you can change
the sizes so quickly and so easily
that's why font awesome has yeah become
quite popular in the web development
world or actually any kind of font icons
have become really popular so font
awesome is not the only one and yeah
once you figured out how to use font
awesome you can do some really cool
things with it so let's remove this
style link and I prefer to actually do
the styling for my icons in an actual
stylesheet
I don't like inline styling so don't use
instant don't use inline styling when
you don't need to use inline styling
rather jump over to an external
stylesheets and your styling them so
something that I want to show you guys
how to
do real quick is ya take an icon like
this like this coffee icon and basically
just add some cool effects to it so one
of the things we can do here is add
another class or I'm going to add a div
around this icon so let's open up a div
and close a div and take that closing
tag and paste it below the eye icon and
then I'm gonna add a class to this div
of big - text or it could be big - icon
whatever you want to call it and now I'm
gonna add in all of my styling for that
so let's take that class - my style
sheet and start styling this class so
what I'd like to do here is of course
make the font size really big I think
something like 80 pixels will do quite
well right I also want to make a
background circle around this icon so I
think something that would be really
cool is if I take the icon itself and I
set the color either to white or I could
set it to maybe what the background
color of my website is so for this
example maybe I can set it to the same
color gray as this background and then
let's jump back over to my CSS file
again and then we want to actually add a
background color for the icon so in this
case let's add a background color of 30
30 30 and that's just gonna be a really
dark background color so if I go back
over to Google Chrome and hit refresh
now you can see that I've starting to
get the icon correct so I've got the
background color in here I've got the
icon appearing at more or less the size
I want it to appear at but something
that I said I wanted to do was have a
circle as a background so the way we go
about doing that is to add a border
radius of 100% and that's going to round
all of the corners off
and and then after adding the
border-radius something else that's
really really important to do is
obviously chop off all this extra space
because right now we've got all this
extra space but if I were to refresh you
can see our icons over here and we've
got an oval-shaped figure so we don't
want any of that extra space over there
so to chop that off we just go over to
our CSS file and say
display:inline-block because right now
our text is within a div and that div is
displaying as a block so I'm just gonna
change it to display as inline block and
that means that it goes from taking up
as much space as it possibly can to as
little space as it possibly can which in
this case makes it really really small
in fact it's a little bit too small so
now what we need to do is add in a
little bit of padding so I'm just gonna
add in some padding of I think 25 pixels
for the top and for the bottom and then
30 pixels for the left and the right and
the reason why I'm making the left and
the right a little bit bigger than the
padding on the top and the bottom is
because yeah it wasn't going to be a
full circle otherwise
so let's come back here and hit refresh
and yeah now you can see I've got my
icon going over there and it is in a
full circle but we don't have any hover
over effects just yet so let's work on
adding a hover over effect by just
adding in the big - icon or grabbing
that class again and then adding a hover
effect by of course selecting that
pseudo-class and now for hover let's
just change the background to be a
slightly lighter color in fact I'm not
sure what color I used before let's go
ahead and take a look at my notes if -
yeah I'm just going to go ahead and grab
that color and use that over here and
then for the color
the text or the color of the icon we can
also just have that background or that
color stay white alright and now if we
come back over to the browser and
refresh when I hover over it you can see
the background of my icon actually
changes and something that we can do
just to make that look a little bit
nicer is to ease the background a little
bit so if you have worked with
transitions in the past what you want to
do is just go over to the big the big
icon class and just add in a transition
over here so let's type transition and
I'm going to select all transitions so
anything that changes about this icon it
could be the background color it could
be the size it could be anything let's
just select all transitions happening on
this icon and over a period of 0.5
seconds I would like the the color to
change so let's go back over to my notes
I know I'm missing something here
eze yeah so over a period of 0.5 seconds
or 0.4 seconds and then yeah the
transition that you wanted to make so
you can have ease or whatever other
transition settings you want to play
around with and yeah I find it just
works really well and so now when I
hover over it the color changes really
slowly instead of just going really
sharp from gray to read it like eases
into the red so that is how you make an
icon kind of like that and let's do
another one
for just a border so instead of having a
full on instead of having a full on
circle in the background we can have a
transparent background with a border
that also creates a circle and to do
that I'm essentially going to reuse this
big icon class but I think what we can
do is also just copy this here and add
an extra class onto this if a coffee I
on to say border right so now anything
that has the big icon class and also has
the border class let's just select them
like this so hopefully you guys know how
to use css3 selectors but yeah this
selector basically means anything that
has a big icon class and a class of
border let's go ahead and do some stuff
to this and the first thing I want to do
is take that background away so let's
make the background transparent so
essentially we're piggybacking off of
this class and we're taking some of
these the styling but I want to get rid
of the background and then I also want
to add in a border so let's add in a
border here of 5 pixels solid and
whatever color I choose so I think
because we're using 30 30 30 there we
can use it again here and at the same
time I think the color of our icon
cannot be white it's going to have to be
the same color as the border so let's
paste those in there and now if we come
back here and refresh you can see I have
got a very similar looking icon except
there's no background it's just a border
and there's no hover effect on that at
the moment so to get that hover effect
going we're going to have to just copy
this class again piggyback off of that
and essentially take the border class
that we created and add that in here as
well
so now anything that has a class of big
icon and a class of border and when it's
hovered over will change the color of
the text or the color of the background
so in this case I think we can still
keep the background transparent or in
fact if I just don't use that styling
rule it'll stay transparent but
something that we are gonna want to do
is change the border color and also the
text color to whatever color we had
chosen which in the case of our previous
example here was this red
so let's put that in here you can put
that in here and also maybe just leave a
comment to say red color right so
anywhere where this is used this color
code is used that's a red color and now
let's jump back over to Google Chrome
hit refresh and when that's done
refreshing you can see when I hover over
this icon we have our icon changing red
and when I hover over this icon we have
the background changing red so that's
pretty cool and like I said you can use
these icons pretty much any way you want
with font awesome
so now that you guys know how to use it
I'm gonna go ahead and grab some of my
code that I had previously prepared and
just paste that in here so I can show
you my example one last time
and so yeah this is basically how I went
about using my icons I thought that they
look pretty cool to use this on a
website somewhere like this and if you
guys want to be able to get this code
you can download it I will leave a link
