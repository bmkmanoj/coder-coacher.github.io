welcome to tutorial number 11 and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to use the new audio tag in html5
now this works in a very similar way to
the video tag which I talked about in
the previous video so a lot of the stuff
is the same except now instead of
playing a video we're actually playing
audio so I've got my index file over
here and I've also got a audio track
which is an mp3 file make sure that
you're using an mp3 because well not
there aren't really any other audio
types that are supported by this tag so
mp3 is the safest option if you're using
something else it's probably not going
to work
and now that you've got your mp3 sorted
let's take a look at how to add that to
our browser so right now I'm starting
off with an empty body my website is
blank at the moment and I'm gonna open
up a new one of these audio tags so
let's type audio and then I've got my
ending audio tag so that is how to well
add the tag but just like I talked about
in the previous video with the video tag
this may not be supported by some
people's browsers hopefully by now it is
supported by pretty much everyone's
browser but you know if there is that
like lazy person who's using a ten year
old computer and never bothered to
update it and never bothered to switch
over to a new browser and they're still
using Internet Explorer for some reason
this audio tag will not work for them so
you just want to put in a little error
message over here if if you can see this
update your browser now hopefully if you
save this and come back over to the
browser and hit refresh you don't see a
message that's good right because if you
do see this text appearing is you've got
a really really old out-of-date browser
and you need to update your browser okay
now that that message is there let's
move on to adding a source tag so let me
go ahead and type source and just like
the previous video this allows us to set
a source or to set which file we
actually want to use in the the browser
so as you can see I've got my mp3 in the
same folder as my index file so I'm just
gonna copy and paste that name if you
wanted to folder your tracks away you
could do that just make sure you
understand how file paths work I do have
a video explaining that already okay and
I'm just gonna go ahead and pop the file
name into the source and then and it or
in the type attribute I'm also going to
specify that it is a type of audio slash
MPEG and that should mean well that base
but basically tells the browser that we
are using an mp3 there is only one other
file type which is supported and that is
an OGG but again the OGG is only
supported by some browsers and not by
others so to be safe the safest file
type is actually an mp3 so just use an
mp3 like don't even bother trying to use
a different file type okay so now that
we have our source set if I pop back up
to the browser and refresh I'm probably
not gonna see anything because I need to
add one more attribute in the top here
and that is controls now controls
doesn't have to be equal to anything so
I can just remove the equal sign and the
quotation marks let's save this now and
come back over to the browser hit
refresh and now I have my audio tag
showing up some people like to complain
about it not showing up but if you don't
have this controls attribute here it's
not gonna work right
but let me go ahead and hit play
I was kind of loud but that is an audio
track that I downloaded from the YouTube
audio library if you guys are interested
and yeah it sounds very arcade gaming
like so yeah that is how to add an audio
file to your website there are actually
a few other attributes that we can add
to this audio tag one of them would be
autoplay and what that does is
automatically play the file as soon as
the webpage loads so if i refresh us now
the file is playing as soon as the
browser loads there is also a loop
attribute and what that does is loop the
song so if I go back over to the browser
now because I have autoplay and loop set
it will automatically play and if we get
to the end of the track
it should loop around and play again
just give it a few seconds one or two
gether there we go great so the looping
works there are also a bunch of other
attributes that we could use here like
muted but that almost seems pointless
like why would you mute an audio track
so muted and what this does is by
default mute the audio track and tell
somebody hits unmute so let's refresh
and right now yeah like it is muted I
can unmute it and then meet it again but
it's all play it's it's still playing
because of the autoplay and well just
because the autoplay attribute so this
is is they're actually for JavaScript
purposes later on if you want to be
to mute and unmute the track although
right now you know it does seem kind of
pointless to load the audio file muted
and something annoying that you could do
is take away that muted attribute take
away this controls attribute have the
audio on autoplay and loop and refresh
and now the track is playing in the
background I can't stop it from playing
because there's no controls and yeah if
you just wanted some background music on
your site you could do this it's just
probably going to be somewhat annoying
because users wouldn't be able to let me
mute that users wouldn't be able to mute
the soundtrack and they probably just
like leave your site especially if
you're sitting like I work in an open
plan office environment and I sometimes
open up websites that have an audio
track playing that I can't stop and I
usually have to like just leave the
website because I mean you can't stop
the music or I hit that little mute
button in the top corner there but that
wasn't always available so just be
careful you know and I chase people away
from your website when you use this and
that is all I have for you in this video
so I'll see you guys next time
I just want to send a shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain they run a
coding bootcamp with courses on iOS
development UX design and web
development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead

in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
I thank you hey thanks for staying until
