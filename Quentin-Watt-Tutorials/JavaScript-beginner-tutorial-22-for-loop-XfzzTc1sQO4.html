here and welcome to tutorial number 22
and in this tutorial I'm going to speak
to you guys about the for loop okay so
by now some of you guys or hopefully all
of you guys have watched my previous two
videos on the while loop and the
do-while loop and maybe on purpose or
maybe by accident
you left out your counter variable or
you forgot to increment your counter
variable inside the loop and by doing
this you made an infinite loop okay and
what you would have noticed that when
you try to run that loop in Firefox or
something you would have made Firefox
crash and then you would have had to
push alt control deletes and you know
try and end your program in the task
manager so you would have learned that
infinite loops are bad but for the smart
ones that actually listened to me then
hopefully you guys didn't do that okay
but now a for loop kind of solves that
problem for us so we don't have people
making infinite loops by accidents okay
and the reason why for loop can solve
that problem for us is because it
includes a built-in counter and also a
way to increment our variable every time
the loop restarts or reiterates okay so
we don't have to do that ourselves
physically we don't have to like declare
our variable separately and then worry
about incrementing it inside of the loop
or anything our for loop does all of
that for us so let's take a look at the
syntax and then this will probably make
a lot more sense okay so to make a for
loop we type in the keyword for because
this is a for loop duh so after that we
put in our parentheses and then our
curly brace
and by now you know that all of the
statements that we want to execute will
go inside here so that would be our
statements okay and I spelled that wrong
but who cares okay
now inside our parentheses this is going
to be a little bit different okay you
guys are used to going ahead and just
putting in a condition but that's not
what happens in a for loop okay
I'm saying okay a lot but yeah okay so
in a for loop we actually put in three
separate statements so they all get
separated by a semicolon the first
statement is where we tell JavaScript to
start counting so this will be declaring
our counter so we start on the first
statement the second statement is our
condition so this is going to tell
JavaScript basically way to end the for
loop and the last statement is our
increment okay that is where we increase
our variable by one or by however many
you want to increase your variable by
every time the loop runs again okay so
let's go ahead and just delete all of
this and to tell JavaScript where to
start our variable we have to go ahead
and we declare a new variable but we
don't have to type in the keyword var or
anything like that okay all we have to
do is type in our variable name so I
could go ahead and type counter in over
here but I'm not going to do that and
the reason why I did that in the
previous tutorials was just so that you
guys kind of understood what that
variable was for but as programmers or
you're most likely C programmers
whenever working with a loop
they just named their variable one
letter and it's usually I or J okay
sometimes X but not too often okay so
I'm just going to go ahead and name mine
I just to be like everyone else and I'll
set that equal to zero put my semicolon
in there and this just means that our
loop is now starting at zero because our
counter starts at zero then we have to
put in our condition so this will be
when do we want our loop to end or how
long do we want our loop to continue so
we can just say keep repeating while I
is less than 10 so that means as soon as
I becomes 10 stop and don't go any
further okay now we've got I starting at
zero and we know it needs to end when I
gets to 10 but we need to increase I
every time the loop runs so that this
condition will hopefully be false one
day so let's go ahead and just put in
our increments which is I plus plus so
that just means increase I by one every
time the loop runs again if you wanted
to you could be fancy and you could try
and increase I by three or something but
yeah let's just keep it at one for now
so I plus plus that is the most common
increment for a loop anyway and now
let's give our loop something to do so
we can probably just type something out
on the screen pretty basic like document
dot write and then we could write this
loop ran so many times so we'll include
our I variable and that'll tell us how
many
how many times the loop ran and I'll
just concatenate on the word times and a
break tag just to be clear on how many
times are you actually ran so let's go
ahead and save that and run in Firefox
and as you can see our loop has run ten
times because zero to nine that is ten
times you can go ahead and count it if
you want if you don't trust me but
basically that's what happens so every
time our loop ran it printed out the
sentence this loop ran however many our
counter was sitting on at the time which
when we started we started at zero so
this loop ran zero times and I guess
that doesn't make too much sense but hey
I I will
I started at zero so there we go and I
have a text and it's just a girl I asked
her if she's playing sport or she plays
sport and she told me no gross hmm okay
whatever
cool so back to the tutorial so why did
this happen well let's go ahead and look
at our code and then I can explain
everything so basically what we told our
variable or our program we told
JavaScript we're going to write or we're
going to use a for loop okay and then we
told our for loop to start counting from
zero and end when our counter gets to
ten so keep going until I is equal to
ten or or what keep going well I is less
than ten which means when I gets to ten
stop okay and then we just increased I
by one every time and we printed that
out on the screen cool so I'm pretty
sure some of you guys are wondering
going to use a for loop or a while
already while loop and let me just say
that there are going to be certain times
when a for-loop works better than a
while loop and certain times where a
do-while loop works better than all the
rest so it basically just depends on the
problem you are trying to solve and
you'll just have to know basically which
loop is going to work the best so you
can go ahead and test each one of them
but here are some helpful hints I guess
basically use a for loop when you know
how many times you want your loop to run
because you can control that ok
then a while loop and a do-while loop
you can use when you don't know how many
times you want your loop to run and then
a do-while loop is basically you don't
know how many times you want your loop
to run but you do know that it must run
at least once ok so that's actually all
the help I can give you and that's all I
have for you guys in this tutorial
actually so don't forget to subscribe

video helpful because it's really going
to help my channel grow and that's all
so thanks for watching and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
