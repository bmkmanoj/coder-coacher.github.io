here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and this tutorial is gonna be another
little quick time-lapse so if we take a
look at the time lapse here I started
off by adding in a big blue block so
this is our primary colored block and I
was just getting the spacing right and
what I thought I'd do here is introduce
the customer to our team so you see I
spent a couple minutes just getting the
columns right so I wanted to have a
three column I wanted to have three
columns in my block but because 10
doesn't really divide into three so
easily I base those out two to nine
columns and then I just stretch them to
fit the tenth and then I added in a
heading so meet the team and I thought
that would be like the coolest thing or
one of the best things to show the user
as they move over to the about page is
just to see who they're going to be
dealing with who they're gonna be
talking to so it's nice and personal and
yeah I'm just using images from pixabay
so I don't know who these people off I
just grabbed the images of off of
pixabay and decided to use those for
this section
and for the last column I thought I'd
just use somebody familiar and then I
decided to get the sizing right for all
of these cuz I thought that those images
were just a little bit too big and then
filling in the names and the filler
content I didn't really want to focus on
you know being really creative just
threw some names in there and then paste
it in some lorem ipsum
right so it was as simple as that
getting the meet the team section done
that was only adding those three columns
and now I needed to move those over to
the mobile design so I just wanted to
make sure that everything works and fits
on the mobile as well so here I am
adding in the heading and just getting
that spaced out correctly it doesn't
have to be 100% but as long as it's
close enough and then just getting in my
first team member making sure that
that's all correct and then copying over
the rest of its new members and spacing
them out correctly so I opted for circle
images because UIKit has a class that
can instantly turn any image into a
circle but the CSS for that is quite
simple as well it's as simple as adding
in a class called
image circle and then just giving that a
property of border radius 50% and in the
next section I thought I'd let the
customer know why they should choose or
why they should travel with our company
so why would you travel with link we're
safe we're fun and we're affordable
those were the three points I really
wanted to drive home I guess this is all
just dummy content anyways I wasn't
focused on you know really coming up
with something factual
and Here I am just grabbing in some
icons so I thought we'd just make use of
icons for each one of these blocks it's
a it's actually quite amazing how if you
just keep everything simple one icon
with a bit of text and a plain old
background color keeping it simple makes
it look good although sometimes in an
attempt to make something look good we
get a little bit too creative with
colors and we start throwing in more
colors than are actually needed or we
throw in more images than are what I
actually needed to try and make a design
look interesting but keeping it simple
actually keeps it clean and interesting
anyway
and for my last block on the home page
or the about Us page rather I thought
I'd just add in a gallery so my idea of
my thinking behind this was that we'd
have images of each one of our team
members in all of the locations where
we're offering holidays and this would
just try drive home to the user that we
have tried and tested our own product
and because we've tried and tested our
own product we know what the quality is
like so that's what I wanted to kind of
give the impression of here I suppose I
should have also added in a paragraph of
text that just says we've been or we've
tried all of our holidays and we know
you'll enjoy them something like that
but I mean my main goal was just to add
in a gallery somewhere so that it would
it would be useful or I could show you
guys how to actually use a gallery in
uikit so here I am just spacing and
sizing everything out correctly
and then I started moving my gallery
over to the mobile design but instead of
keeping all the images I I thought I'd
save a little bit of time here and just
get the idea right so instead of using
all eight of my images I think I just
ended up using the four and deleting the
other four and that was basically my
design done so all I had to do now was
get my footers in place and take one
last look over the design so that's
pretty much what they looked like mobile
compared to desktop and that's all I
have for you guys in this video so don't
