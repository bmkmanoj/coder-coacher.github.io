back to tutorial number 38 and in this
tutorial I'm just gonna show you guys
how to start styling the rest of your
webpage because in the last tutorial we
left off having liked our web page
centered but we didn't make anything
inside of here
look any better or any prettier so right
now it just looks pretty stupid still
and all we did was we centered our page
so that our dev is always in the center
so let's go ahead and start working on
the rest of them for styling and I like
to style my websites from the top down
to the bottom so I'm going to start with
my header and we can just go ahead and
copy that and what I want to do now is
I'm just gonna add in a comment just to
say that my header CSS starts here and I
just like to have comments in my CSS
that I know exactly where the styling
for one part of my website starts and
where it ends just so it's easy to find
everything and we go ahead and before I
actually style my page header there is
something I want to do and that is this
red border around my web page I really
don't want that there I don't need it
there it doesn't serve any purpose it
was just there to show you guys that the
dev was indeed centered so I just want
to go ahead and delete that red border
and now we can start styling our page
header so the first thing I do is I just
want to go ahead and sit a border of two
pixels solid blue da-dun and margin top
of 10 pixels and that's just going to
just give a little bit of space at the
top of the browser so that everything
doesn't look like holes scrunched up
like as you can see now the
head of our website is just like scrunch
right up in the top of the browser but
when I click refresh you can see we've
got that little bit of space so it just
looks a little bit more you know tidy
and now what I want to do is I want to
get this header of our title or the head
of our website and I want to get this
sitting next to our image so there's a
couple things that I need to change for
that and I actually have to go into my
HTML of ear and for my image I just need
a set a width and I just need to set
that equal to whoops
set that equal to 232 and then height
which can be set to 100 and then I just
want to make a class over here and I'm
gonna call this class logo logo finally
and heading 1 I'm also just gonna go
ahead and set a class here and I'm gonna
call this class head underscore text
cool and now we can save that and go
back to our CSS over here and give
myself some space to work cool now we
can go ahead and select that class so
class of logo and I want this to be
displayed inline because right now that
image gets displayed as a block and
that's why the header appears underneath
it and then the next thing I do is also
just want to select that head text and
I'm gonna set that to display inline as
well because our header is also a block
element so if I set them both to display
inline and we save this and go back to
our browser and click refresh you can
see there are next to each other but our
header is kind of at the bottom here and
it looks kind of stupid and I want it in
the middle so what I can do now is just
go to my logo
and because this is a image I just go
ahead and I said vertical-align if I can
spell it right vertical align to middle
and now that lines up to the middle of
the text so in other words the image is
now in the middle of the text and our
text will now move up so go ahead and
look at that that is super cool so now
we can go back to CSS and just carry on
going start styling yeah so that is
pretty much the end of header styling
and as you can see the comments can go
over multiple lines and what I want to
do is actually want that on a new line
and then I say start navigation styling
and over here we can start styling the
nav so our top Navs ID was top
underscore now and walk into you now is
just go ahead and give this a boarder of
two pixels solid red and we can go ahead
and set the margin equal to five pixels
and zero pixels and obviously this style
is pretty much the same thing as what
that top one did it puts five pixels on
the top and the bottom and then zero
pixels on the left and the right so
there's going to be no white space on
the side of our navigation or no extra
white space other than this the white
space that made it get centered so
what's that what that's done is just
giving us that little bit of space on
the top and the bottom of our navigation
but we still want to go ahead and get
rid of these bullet points and we want
these links to obviously be all in one
line so we want home about and then
contact next to each other we don't want
them and any
each other because no navigation looks
like that on any website so we can go
back over here and just go ahead and
copy that and instead of using top nav
obviously we have to go ahead and top
nav ul and that just selects the
unordered list which is this unordered
list over there
and we're just gonna go ahead and set
that list style type equal to none and
that takes away the bullet points and
then we want to do pretty much the same
thing as this actually so just go ahead
and copy that and then paste it over
there now I want to select the list
items and the reason why they display
all underneath each other these list
items that's the it's just because
they're all block level elements so we
just do the same thing that we did at
the top display:inline and instead of
being a block level element there now
inline and they'll all appear next to
each other and the last thing I want to
do is I just want to style the link
inside of everything so that would be
this link over here and obviously the
link there and there I just wanna just
so that they're not all right next to
each other just give them a margin of 10
pixels and we can go ahead and click
Save and we're gonna go over here and
click refresh you can see we now have
all of these list items displayed next
to each other the bullet points are gone
finally and I guess the margin didn't
appear so well so we've got the margin
on the left and the right and
technically it is actually on the top
and the bottom but you can't really see
it right now so a better thing to do
we just go to our top nap and we'll sit
in a padding of ten pixels and that'll
just create that space around our
elements over there so hmm okay cool so
now we have a nice bit of white space
around it and to be honest I lied
actually what's a padding over here I'm
not a margin and I will show you why in
a second
padding 10 pixels cool go ahead and
click refresh so the reason why I wanted
padding instead of margin is because now
as soon as I get over that little line
over there I can now click on the link
so I don't have to be exactly on top of
the text I can be just a little bit off
and that's pretty much a nice trick for
your navigation if you ever want to have
your users be able to click the
navigation sometimes they don't really
need to click exactly on the text just
that little bit away and then they can
go ahead and just click on the text so
that's pretty much all I actually have
time for in this tutorial but in the
next tutorial we'll definitely start
styling our articles over here and
actually getting the side news onto the
