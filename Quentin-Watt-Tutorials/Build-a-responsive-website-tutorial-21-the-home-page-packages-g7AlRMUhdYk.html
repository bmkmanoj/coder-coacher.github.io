Quinn said here and welcome to tutorial
number 21 and in this tutorial yeah I'd
like to move on past our slideshow so
we've got our slideshow done and if we
take a look at the next kind of things
that we have in our design here it is
the content for our homepage so one
thing to work on is probably this
packages section here where you know
we're just showing the user some
packages and yeah they can book or click
on one of those to find out more then
then we'll probably take care of this
little blue line over here so yeah let's
jump over to a sauna I'm gonna move my
homepage slider tasks and testing so
somebody can go ahead and check that out
and test it for us but now let's move on
to building the content for our homepage
so I don't think these these two things
will be the first two things to focus on
so let's jump over to the text editor
and I suppose to keep everything nice
and neat and tidy we could probably put
our slideshow in and include that would
also mean that we could include it on
other pages so might be useful but I
suppose for now let's let's just put our
content down here so homepage content
starts here alright and let's let's
actually add in our content so the first
thing I want to do is create a div and I
think I'm gonna give this div a class of
whatever we had on our other files here
so what was this UK block and UK block
secondary so that's the class I want to
use here
okay and the reason why is because
there's that black background that is
our secondary color so adding in that
that block over here is just going to
add that secondary color in for us
something that I think I left out
design that I should probably affixed is
to put in a heading here but I don't
know I didn't use headings on my
homepage and then I went ahead and on my
other pages in my design I had headings
here so not quite sure what I should do
with that maybe I should just put a
heading in here for now to say let's add
in and nothing yeah suppose let's let's
use an h2 but we'll give it a class of
UK - h1 and then we can add in our text
so let's just say some of our awesome
packages and I think all of this is
gonna be capitalized anyway so it's fine
and from here we can start adding in our
packages right so I think let's open up
a div let's add in a class here of UK
well UK container UK contain a - Center
I'm just kind of intrigued I should
probably have put this within our
container so let's remove that and put
that in here and then also give this a
class of UK text center right and then
the packages will probably come inside
of here so over there
sooo let's create a div give this a
class of UK - grid and the reason why is
because we have to enclose all of our
columns in a grid so I'm gonna add three
columns here so there needs to be an
outer grid to align all of those next to
each other that's just how you like it
works right so let's create a a div here
and let's give this a class of UK with
one of three now if I do this it's also
going to split the columns into three
columns on a phone screen or a mobile
screen and those that's probably gonna
make these columns too small and also my
design is not having columns on my
mobile phone screen anymore so to kind
of counteract that all we need to do is
type the word medium over here right and
that's gonna make sure that on a large
screen or anything larger than a medium
screen we're splitting our website into
three columns like this or we're
splitting just this div into three
columns but on a mobile screen we'll
kind of ignore that and let our columns
take the full width of the page so yeah
now I can go ahead and actually create
three columns but instead of cutting
this down three times let's get one
perfect and then we'll just copy and
paste that one down another two more
times so the next thing we need to do
here is add in add in an image so what
do we have yet we have an image we have
a heading we have text and then we have
a button so let's add in an image then
we'll also add in our heading which I
think should be an h3 then we'll add in
our paragraph of text so for this I'm
just going to type and lorem and hit tab
and that's just going to generate some
lorem ipsum for me and then we can go
ahead and end this off with well we
might as well open up a paragraph for
that and then add in an a tag over here
with a class of UK button and you
a button primary and I can just say book
now right so let's take a look at what
this looks like in the browser so far
it's nowhere near ready but
let's refresh okay some of our awesome
packages hmm alright so something I need
a fix here is to give this a another
class so on the outer block let's give
this a class of UK - contrast and that's
going to turn everything within the
block white hopefully so let's refresh
boom so our text is now white okay as
far as the rest of the stuff goes we
need to add in a white background here
so essentially we need to turn this into
a UI kit panel so let's get you Ike it
and let's look at the documentation here
there should be a documentation for
something called a panel alrighty okay I
found it so we've got the panel and
let's take a look at some of the
examples here because I think I actually
copied one of these examples for my
design aha
there we go so UK panel UK panel box and
I think we might even need UK panel box
- default or something well let's try it
with this so I'm not sure if we should
put that on the actual I'm not sure if
we should put our panel here if we
up should put our panel here but let's
try like that at first and then let's
also create another div here take this
image and throw it in there and this
needs to have a class of UK - panel -
Tizi
and I think this also needs to have a
class of UK - paneled
hejdå or something like that let's
let's take a look at the documentation
again UK panel teaser for our image and
for our headings I saw it now hmm
UK panel - title UK panel - title suite
right so let's come back to the browser
and take a look at that now tada
okay so we have a white background we
have our package kind of showing up
right we've got the text we've got the
button it's literally just the image
that needs to be fixed so I think I
don't actually have my images saved just
yet so let's go over to photoshop and
yeah I basically want this image well
yeah I want all of these so let's see if
I can find those in my documentation
okay so yeah I'm back and I just went
ahead and exported those images for us
because I didn't actually have them
ready and exported for us but there we
go I now have all of them done they are
all 500 by 330 pixels and yeah they're
probably going to display slightly
smaller than that on the site but just
to be safe that's the size I decided to
use and yeah I just wanted to point out
that they are all exactly the same size
it's very good to try and crop your
images to all be the same size don't try
and mess about or muck about by having
images that are different sizes because
it's probably gonna push things out of
alignment so it's gonna make the heading
like display slightly lower down and
that kind of thing and that's just gonna
be really annoying so try to not do that
by just cropping your images to be
exactly the right size from the
beginning and now let's let's just copy
this packages folder and let's go over
to my builder web know that htdocs and
then images okay so
this is where we are gonna paste our
images and yeah that I mean this is my
basic website set up here can probably
throw that zip file away and yeah inside
a folder called packages that's where my
package pictures are going to be so yeah
now we can start using those in my text
editor so let's see under images will go
images packages is it images or is it
image interesting images packages the
first one was going to be sunrise
holiday so Sun Rise - holiday dot what
did I save them as JPEGs duh JPEG right
and now we can go ahead and probably
copy this down three times let's see
just space them out a little bit and now
let's take a look at them in the browser
and okay we go we had some issues first
of all my image is still on showing up
that's interesting see why images
packages sunrise holiday maybe I got the
name wrong and then also the other thing
is there's no spacing between all of
them so we need to we need to fix that
and I think the way we fix that is just
to take these classes and put another
div around them so let's let's get rid
of these two duplicates and fix
everything from the beginning and then
we'll start again we'll copy them down
again so let's create a div here and for
that div let's give it two classes and
end that div off down there
wait down there yeah okay that's that's
best and then move that in one that's
right okay cool
so that should fix our spacing problem
then we just need to fix the image
problem so images packages oh just just
sunrise and then the other one was beach
- holiday so let's just change let's
change that one to just beach and that
one to just sunrise so just sunrise
let's just double check and make sure
there's loads for now boom okay so
that's that's one seems to be working
fine let's let's pull the rest through
soon actually yeah we want that that
whole one okay so there's a second one
and there's a third one and hopefully
all of these display perfectly so let's
come back here and refresh and tada
that's amazing so all I need to do now
is change the pictures so let's go back
here and do that so for this one we can
say elephant that is the last one and
this one can be beach and then we just
need to change the titles so I don't
know what I had in my design
island-hopping beach holiday African
safari let's let's try that Island
holiday beach holiday or African safari
and no my battery is oh okay save that
battery um now let's let's take a look
at this in the browser
so let's come back here refresh sweet
that's looking much much better
everything is just looking a little bit
too small ahead
my design or compared to the size of
these headings so let's go back to
photoshop and see what size I actually
made the texture oh that's that size 36
pixels that's way too big how big that I
have the heading on the slideshow
let's see head on the slideshow that was
whoops
am I on the slideshow no I'm not okay
okay so how big was this text 52 pixels
Wow okay I really advocate it on that
design hmm okay okay so this video is
getting kind of long or you know at
least a little bit longer than I thought
it was gonna be so I'm gonna end this
video up here and I'll catch up with you
guys in the next video where we will
definitely be adding some more space
above some of these packages and then
also I might want to relook at the size
of some of these headings but anyway
