here and in this tutorial we're going to
take a look at the difference between
the load and the ready event handlers in
jQuery so you'll notice that I'm
starting this video off with two images
and these are the same two images as the
previous tutorial where I was just
grabbing them off the internet and this
actually is not over three lines I'm
actually word wrapping my text so if I
turn that off you can see that this
image is actually all on one line and I
forgot to mention that in the previous
tutorial but you know if you guys were
having issues with your image not
showing up or something make sure that
it's all on one line and that you didn't
actually accidentally type enter or hit
enter a couple times to make it appear
on multiple lines then if I go over to
my script file over here I've got my
window a dot load function which is
basically the same script that we ended
the previous tutorial off with which was
waiting for the window to load and then
alerting out that the window has loaded
or all elements on the page have loaded
so now let's take a look at the
difference between this and document
ready so I'm going to select my document
which we do as always with the dollar
sign and parentheses and we'll say
document and I'm going to say dot ready
and when that happens we're going to run
a function so I open up the parentheses
the curly braces and the semicolon at
the end all the normal housekeeping
stuff for jQuery and now will alert out
the Dom is ready so basically this
document dot ready event handler
actually happens when the Dom is ready
when the document object model is ready
and that's pretty much as soon as the
page opens
whereas window load or the slowed event
handle
actually only occurs once the entire
window or whatever selector you have in
here
has loaded completely so let's click
Save and you'll be able to see see the
difference if we run this in Firefox I'm
going to click run and as you can see as
soon as the page loads we've got the Dom
that's ready if I click OK the rest of
our page is still loading at the moment
and there we go so that second image all
the way at the bottom of the page has
loaded now and we have the window has
loaded so let's scroll down and see and
everything has in fact loaded so as you
can see there's definitely quite a big
time difference between the ready event
handler and the load event handler
depending obviously on how big your
images on your web page are or basically
our big whatever is on your web pages
because obviously the more stuff you
have the longer it's going to take to
load and I just wanted to show you guys
this difference because you know
sometimes you can start running code as
soon as the document is ready so if you
wanted to maybe hide some paragraphs
away or make a paragraphs fade or
something then waiting for the document
to be ready is fine that's perfectly
okay but other times like let's say you
have an image that you want to
manipulate or something you might want
to wait until that image has actually
loaded before you start changing that
image up with some jQuery code so I just
thought I'd mention that and I'll show
you guys the difference between the load
event handler and the ready event
handler because there is obviously quite
a big time difference between the two
and you know what you don't really want
to start working with your image if it
hasn't actually been loaded yet so you
might want to in fact when you're
working with images wait until the image
is loaded and then do something rather
than wait for the document to be ready
and then start working with this image
that
the browser doesn't even actually know
is on the page yet and that's all I have
for you in this video so don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
