here and welcome to tutorial number 49
and in this tutorial we are going to
talk about a new topic called form
validation okay
and this just basically means we are
going to start checking if the user has
actually fold in the data or their data
in the form correctly okay
so in other words you want to check that
the users not trying to submit an empty
form because if a value in the form is
empty you can't really you know do
anything with it what are you going to
what are you going to do okay so you
want to check that they actually fold in
some data you also want to check that
they maybe fold in a username that
wasn't too long like you might decide
that all people that sign up on your
website or something need to have a name
that is only 30 characters or less so
you want to make sure that they're there
they actually fold in a name that is
less than 30 characters you don't want
them to go over like 55 or something
okay so those are all things that we're
going to start covering in this video
and to get started let's go ahead and
just create like a fake register form so
this tutorial is actually going to span
over quite a few tutorials so this is
actually just going to be part one but
let's go ahead and create a header here
so h2 and ending h2 and I'm going to
type in the word register just because
this is going to be a fake register form
we're not actually going to register use
anyway because we haven't learned about
databases yet so let's go ahead now and
put in some input elements so I'm going
to ask the user for the username and
they can fill it in over here so
username is equal to going to be an
input of type
texts and we're going to give this a
name of username and we're pretty much
done okay then we're going to need the
user to supply a password so password
and this is going to be equal to
something quite similar so copy that and
put that in here it's going to have a
type of password and also a name of
password okay and I'm actually going to
just duplicate that line and we're going
to say password again and then we'll
leave that as a type of password but the
name will set your password again okay
and there are probably a few other
things that we could put in here like
maybe gender and then we'll ask the user
maybe to so we'll say male and then the
user can put in an input of type and
we'll make this a radio button okay so
type is equal to radio and name is equal
to gender and then we'll also ask them
obviously if they're female
because only be males input type equals
again radio and name we're going to
leave the name the same so gender okay
and there's probably a few other things
we could add to this but I think well
let's let's add a text area so we'll say
tell us about yourself okay and we'll
add a text area with a name of
we're info and we'll end off our text
area as well so text area and this is
you know probably like a decent form for
now I don't think it needs to be any
longer than this no we haven't done
checkboxes yet or select lists but I'm
sure we'll be able to fit one in later
so let's go ahead and just take a look
at what this will look like in the
browser I'm getting for open up Firefox
here and localhost tutorials and
tutorial 49 okay I didn't put any brake
tags in so it's here all appearing on
one line let's go ahead and just fix
that break and let's actually just copy
paste that paste that there and we'll
paste it there and we'll paste one there
I guess and here okay cool so now let's
take a look at this okay not very tidy
at all but we're asking the user for the
username password password again
whatever the agenda is and just some
information about themselves okay and we
could probably put in a break tag over
here made me make these ones all doubles
that should make it appear just a lot
nicer okay okay there we go that's
that's much better got a lot more space
and this tutorial is actually getting
kind of long so right now we've just set
up the form but in the next tutorial
we'll actually take a look at validating
if any of the starter that the user fold
in is correct so thanks guys for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
