Quinton here and welcome to tutorial
number 22 and in this tutorial I think
there's a few good things that we can
knock out real quick so I want to add
some spacing above these packages
because right now they're you know
squashed up right against the heading up
here but also if I inspect elements and
I look at this in my whoops if I look at
this in my mobile design you can see
that they lose spacing in between each
other as well and that's somewhat
annoying so I think one way to fix this
that will fix it both on desktop and on
mobile is to go over to each one of
these panels and just add in a margin
here so let's type in UK - margin -
large - top and then is going to add a
large Mahajan on the top of this panel
but we want to go ahead and repeat that
for the other two as well so let's copy
that down mmm okay and I think I put it
on the middle one not the top one so
let's put it on the top one now and yeah
taking a look at this we now have a
large margin on the top which sort of
puts a similar amount of spacing between
our slideshow and our heading and then
our heading and our packages and that's
cool right and if we inspect this on our
mobile design as well we've got spacing
here we've got some spacing here we've
got some spacing here so all of that is
looking pretty good I think something
else I might want to do is just make
this button stand out a bit more so in
order to do that I think I'm just gonna
make it a little bit bigger so let's
just on the buttons add in UK - button -
large - all of these as well so let's
copy that down and already did it for
that one okay
so yeah you see this buttons a little
bit bigger than the others because I I
was testing things out a little bit okay
so yeah now these buttons are all a
little bit bigger and they stand out a
little bit more and yeah if we take a
look at this in mobile I'd say that's
pretty much sorted as well now one thing
I do want to do yeah you can see the
spacing here on mobile changes so now
it's small spacing with huge spacing hmm
we're gonna have to work a way around
that even this spacing it looks somewhat
even but I don't think it is so that's
something that we can definitely you
know pick up in our snags that's why we
have the snagging quality control
section although yeah it is good to kind
of do these things before this we get to
that section so if we can fix it now we
will but I am not sure how I'm going to
at the moment and so but I think I'm
just gonna power on through this build
for now so I'll I'll try think of a
solution for this stuff and get back to
you but let's add in another block down
here so if we take a look at our design
the next block here is supposed to be a
primary block or a blue block with the
text
thousands of people travel with links so
you know let's let's try get that in
there so let's go back to our text
editor and I guess underneath the
package section but yeah right
underneath this div down here let's
create the next if I don't know what we
want to call this just like our or let's
just say
thousands of people travel with link
right ok so now we can put in our
classes and I think we're going to be
using a similar set of classes as to
what we've put up here so let's just
copy those down paste them here and
instead of the secondary background
let's use the primary background and
let's throw in what I want to be it's
going to look like a heading one but
instead let's just use a heading two and
give it a class of UK - h1 UK h1 not UK
button primary and let's just put some
text in here so what was it
thousands of people travel with the link
right so we can just put that in there
save this and go over to the browser
refresh awesome so yeah that looks
pretty good except for the fact that the
text is aligned to the left so what we
could do to fix that is just add in UK
text center and then maybe around this
just for mobile responsiveness we're
probably going to need a div around the
heading here that has a class UK
container and UK container center right
so let's refresh and look at that now
okay so that's looking much much better
thousands of people travel with link
awesome so we got the slideshow we've
got our packages but this thing what
else did we have in our design ah yeah
ok so the next section was a session
with the white background an image to
the left some text to the right and this
can be done quite easily so let's do
that
and I guess I don't know what we're
gonna call this Testament testimonies
it's probably the right word I don't
know how you spell testimonies is it
like that or like this mm-hm
might have to look that up and then
let's open up a div for this one I'm
just gonna give it a class of UK - block
will leave the primary and the secondary
colors out and because of that we'll
also leave the UK contrast class out
because we want dark text not contrast
at white text and let's create a div
here and the stiv off obviously needs
the class of UK container and UK
container center right and in here we
can put in content right so the first
one is going to be a div and if we look
at this it is gonna be an image and then
a testimony so it is an image taking up
half the screen with the testimony
taking up the other half of the screen
and I think we might want to just use UI
kids documentation here to figure this
one out okay so this thing that I wanted
to look for in the documentation was
this vertical align section so that's
under call and utility and if you scroll
down yeah you've got this example here
where you've got text displaying in the
middle and then we can have our image on
the side yeah that's pretty much what
I've got going on in my design as well
so we've got our image and then our text
isn't starting up here in line with the
image is actually starting in the center
so it is vertically aligned with the
vertical align component or utility
component here so this is something we
are going to be adding in and I guess we
need to figure out how how to work with
this so I guess something I'd like to do
here
maybe just add in my claw a class of UK
- grid and then inside of that grid
let's create a div here and we'll give
that a class of UK - with - medium one
of two rights and that's just because
we're splitting the screen into two and
one for the picture one for the content
of the text so we can copy this down one
and our image will go whoopsie I tagged
image tag come on our image will go here
and our heading probably gonna be an h2
or h3 should go here so let's see Shaun
and guppy story
Shaun and Guppies story right and then
for the text let's just go ahead and
type and where is the + button and lorem
hit tab that's gonna generate some lorem
ipsum for us and then i'm not sure if we
need a button for that now we just need
lorem ipsum and we can probably use one
or two paragraphs all right so now let's
save this and let's see what we've got
in the browser
so let's come back here and refresh okay
so we've got our our text we just don't
have the image and that is something
that is my bad so let's see if we can
get this image and the story story one
okay so I got my images prepared here
cropped and sized at the exact same size
600 by 400 so let's copy that stories
folder over to my images folder let's
paste that in here so basically I mean
here's the code for our entire website
we've got our images and images and our
stories in stories so let's figure out
how to use one of these images there
right so for the sauce let's go
images packages oh not packages stories
Shawn and guppy and when we should
probably do we can do the exact same
thing for the next one here which is
going to be Tazz and Sam right so let's
let's take a look at that in the browser
refresh awesome so we've got our image
we've got our text our image our text
okay Shawn and guppy again let's change
that title tags and Sam's story
Taz's and Sam story Shawn's and Guppies
and guppy should be with the capital
okay cool well hmm I still had a lot of
