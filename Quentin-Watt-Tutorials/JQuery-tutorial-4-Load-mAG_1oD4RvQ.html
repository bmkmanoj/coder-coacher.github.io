here and in this tutorial we are going
to take a look at the load event
listener in jQuery so I'm going to show
you guys how that works
but first thing we need to do is
actually add an image to our web page so
I'm going to add an image here so image
and I'm going to give this an ID which I
will set equal to IMG one for image one
and I'm going to give this image a
source of some really complicated
information just kidding but I'm going
to copy this URL over here and paste it
in over here and the reason why I'm
using a URL for my image is because I
want this image to have some loading
time I don't want it to just load
immediately which is what it would do if
this image were on my local computer so
I'm grabbing one of the internet and
hopefully this will take some time to
load and that way we will really get to
see this load event handler working so
we now have this image and it's got a
URL of something that I just actually
got from Google so I just went ahead to
Google Images clicked on the image right
clicked and said get URL or copy image
location okay and I'm going to click
Save and we're pretty much sorted on our
HTML site just make sure that you do
have your script linked at the bottom
and your jQuery linked at the bottom as
well and we should be able to go and
start scripting so the first thing I
want to do here is select my image that
I added to this file and I'm going to
select it by ID so to select in jQuery
we use the dollar sign and then our
parentheses and inside of that we're
going to add quotation marks because we
want to select by ID and I'm going to
add in a hash tag as well because this
is also going to help us select by ID
and then I'm going to
grab the ID of the image that I want to
select which is image 1 and what I want
to do well I want to wait for when this
image loads so I'm going to add dot load
and inside of these parentheses here I'm
going to type the word function which
basically just means okay when this
loading of this image happens we want to
do something so I'm going to add in more
parentheses more curly braces break down
a couple of lines and end that off with
a semicolon so we basically have this
code like this and this is pretty much
what every jQuery statements ever going
to look like and inside over here is
where we're going to start putting our
code that we want to happen whenever
this image has loaded so I'm going to
just alert something else I will alert
out the image has loaded and didn't
spell it right but yeah we'll fix it
cool click Save and if I go back over to
this file and click run in Firefox we
should have our image load and as you
can see it's taking some time to load
and eventually once it did load we've
got this alert box popped up that says
the image has loaded so there was
definitely some time involved and now
you can see it's quite immediate because
the image has already loaded and we can
also do this with multiple images as
well so if I scroll down you can see
that this is actually just one image of
Super Mario but if I go back over to my
browser I mean mine text editor and I
load in another image which I already
have the code pasted on the side here
just fix this up a little okay we now
have another image which is also linked
somewhere on the internet and I'm going
to click Save
and now whenever I go back over Noel
wait we want to do the scripting side of
things too so we could do this we could
have two separate statements two
separate jQuery statements one for image
one and one for image two as you can see
the second image does have an ID of
image 2 and if I click save and go back
to my browser and click refresh you can
see that image 1 loads and then after a
while image 2 loads so there was
definitely some loading time there and
I'd actually don't want to prevent that
it's ok if I scroll down here the second
image was the image that took quite a
while to load this time around but if I
just go back here and I clear my history
quickly that's fine that's just going to
get rid of those images from my cache
because I want there to be some more
loading time again and I'm going to
delete that second line because instead
of waiting for every single one of our
images to load individually like instead
of having a separate statement for each
image what we could do is actually just
wait for all images on our web page to
load and we can you do that by using
this image at selector which will select
all images by their tag name image so in
other words we can get rid of these IDs
and I'll get rid of that one as well and
now we're going to be selecting the
image by their tag name which is image
or IMG and if we go back over to the
script over here we'll just say the
images have loaded so this is going to
wait for all images on our web page to
load and then it's going to alert out
that the images have loaded so I'm going
to keep save and we can go back over
here run this in Firefox and we're now
we're going to wait for those two images
to load so the first one is loaded the
second one loaded and the
we got the images have loaded and if we
scroll all the way down the page you can
see that they have both indeed loaded so
that's how we wait for specific elements
on our web page to load but we could go
back over here to jQuery and I could
actually select my window and I'm just
going to do that by selecting window
click Save and this window actually
needs to not be in quotation marks
because it's going to be a key word in
jQuery so we'll select our window and
we'll wait for that to load and then we
can say that the window has loaded and
this will wait for every single element
on our web page to load so if you have
really big images or videos or anything
like that that might cause your web page
a long time to load then you can wait
for that to load by just waiting for the
entire window to load and then do
something so it doesn't actually have to
be alerting something else I'm just
using this as an example but you could
do a number of different things so let's
go back over to Firefox and I'm just
going to clear my recent history again
so that we've got some loading time
click refresh and we're going to wait
for those images to load and eventually
once everything is loaded on the web
page we get this alert box popping up
that says the window has loaded so
that's how we wait for an entire window
to load and that's all I have for you in
