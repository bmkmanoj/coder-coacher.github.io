sunglasses like somewhere over here and
it's not really enough to see I mean
when I look at them like this I don't
see the scratch but when they're on my
face I really notice it by the way you
probably can't see this but yeah I
record in this little window over here
and it's really really bright right now
also this video responds by day of
mountain so I'm going to leave the link
in the video description below go ahead
and check that out and I'll speak a
little bit more about them towards the
end of the video so sometimes people ask
what's the best programming language to
learn and the answer to that the
quickest answer I can give you guys is
it depends so this is a question that is
often asked by people who are still just
getting into programming I think once
you've started learning a few
programming languages or at least once
you've learned your first program
programming language oh yeah
once you've learned your first
programming language you start to
realize that most of the programming
languages are very similar and so they
all kind of follow the same structure
where you have the same kind of tools
you have functions variables objects and
methods and once you know how to use all
of these different principles of
programming switching between one
switching from one programming language
to another is as simple as just learning
different syntax so the best language
for you to learn is going to depend
entirely on what it is you want to do
you actually need to decide up front if
you want to be a mobile developer a web
developer or if you want to be
developing software as in apps for
Windows or for iOS OS 10 because each
one of those job roles is going to
require a different language in fact if
you're doing mobile development
depending on what software or what
operating system you actually want to
operate on you're going to need to know
a different language so for iOS you're
going to need to know swift and for
Android you're probably going to need to
know Java so you're going to need
- no two different languages there if
you're working in the web development
space you're going to need to know
front-end languages like HTML CSS and
JavaScript if you're going to be working
in the backend side of things as a
developer then you're going to need to
known languages like PHP or Python or
Ruby so you're going to need one of
those languages right and if you move
over to the software side of things so
if you're trying to develop apps for
Windows or apps for iOS for Mac OS 10
you're probably going to need to know
C++ or C sharp or again Swift is one of
those languages for Mac so basically
each programming language has a specific
job role and learning a programming
language depends entirely on what it is
you actually want to do but what I'd say
is the most important question you
should be asking yourself is not what's
the best language to learn but rather
how do I get into learning programming
if you are still new to the programming
world and you're trying to discover
which programming language is right for
you or which field is right for you then
I'd say the best language to start off
learning if you've never done any other
languages before is okay get your feet
wet with a little bit of HTML and CSS
because that's not really real
programming as much as it is just
learning how to display code and you get
to learn how to do things like work with
a text editor some of the basic things
and once you get those out of the way
I'd say the next best language to learn
is JavaScript because once you know a
little bit of JavaScript you'll start
learning some of the basic programming
principles that you as a developer need
so you're going to learn what variables
are you're going to learn about
functions loops what objects are what
methods are you're going to learn how to
do all of these things and work with all
of these things and when to use all of
them and once you know this kind of
stuff switching over to another language
isn't going to be difficult at all
so once you've learned all of these
basics in JavaScript you could switch
over to Ruby if you like if you want to
do you could switch over to Python or
PHP or c-sharp as long as you know the
basic prints
Bulls switching to a different language
is gonna be simple and the reason why I
say that is because pretty much all
languages are gonna make use of a
do-while loop a while loop functions
variables they're all gonna be making
use of these similar concepts the only
thing that really changes is your syntax
so the only thing that changes is where
you put your semicolon at the end of the
line or if you actually need a semicolon
or not and some of the keywords or the
way you type out a function name or the
basically how to declare a function all
of these things might change slightly in
the way you type it out but the tool the
fundamental tool of actually using a
function or actually using a variable is
pretty much the same across all of the
different languages and before I end of
this video I just want to send a huge
shout out to dev Mountain so dev
Mountain is a coding bootcamp that'll
teach you everything you need to know to
become a web developer and iOS developer
or a UX designer and they'll do that
within 12 weeks which is quite an
impressive timeline so if you're looking
to change career if you're looking to
become a programmer check out their
courses and of course if you like my
video and you like the advice I give to
you guys then please don't forget to
subscribe leave a like comment on this
video because that's gonna help my
channel grow and I'll see you guys next
