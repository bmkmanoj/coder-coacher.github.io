here and welcome to tutorial number 18
and in this video I want to start
talking to you guys a little bit about
the different types of loops that we get
in PHP okay so in this tutorial we are
going to start off with the for loop and
it actually turns out that computers are
really good at repeating tasks so this
is something that we as programmers can
use to our advantage because there will
often be times where we want to repeat
one line of code or maybe even a whole
bunch of code more than once and that is
where we will use a for loop or any kind
of loop actually but for this example of
obviously we're talking about four loops
okay so let's take a look at the syntax
for a for loop and then I'll explain
everything as we go along so we're gonna
start off by typing the word for fo our
and two parentheses opening an a closing
one okay and inside here we're going to
put in an expression or actually there's
going to be three expressions so we'll
go expression one semicolon expression 2
semicolon and expression 3 now I'm gonna
come back and explain these expressions
in just a moment but for now let's just
finish like this whole syntax so I'm
going to put in my curly braces and now
the code that I want to repeat would go
here so code goes here so this will be
all the code that I want to repeat one
two or three times or if that can go in
here okay now let's take a look at these
expressions again because there's prob
a much better way to remember this okay
and expression one is always going to be
a counter which is going to obviously
count how many times this loop has run
okay so this is actually going to become
a new variable which we will use inside
of our for loop then expression two is
going to be a condition so this is
basically how long should the loop keep
running for or keep executing for and
that is what we handle with this
condition now the last one is actually
going to be the increment and this gets
called at the end of our loop and this
just tells our loop okay how much do we
want to increase this counter by so
those are what those three conditions or
expressions do and now let's take a look
at actually making a loop that runs ten
times and then you'll see all of this in
action okay so like I said our counter
is gonna be a new variable and most
often we always just make a variable
called I you'll see a lot of programmers
will do this when they make a for loop
the variable is usually always I and I'm
going to set that equal to zero okay so
that means that we're gonna start
counting from zero then the next thing
is our condition so how long do we want
this loop to continue executing so I'm
gonna go ahead and say while I is less
than 10 so we're gonna start at zero and
then we're gonna start counting and
we're gonna keep executing as long as I
is less than 10 so how much are we going
to increment
I buy every time the loop runs well
that's what we handle over here so I'm
just gonna go ahead and say I plus plus
and that means we're gonna add one to I
so I will start off at zero then it'll
go to one then two then three and
eventually it'll be nine and it'll still
run at nine it'll still execute
something because nine is indeed less
than ten but once we increment I to ten
then I or ten is no longer less than ten
so that's when our loop will finally
stop okay so let's go ahead and actually
just echo something out here we can just
echo out this is iteration and iteration
is just a word for the current execution
of the loop I guess kind of a difficult
word to explain if I if I didn't explain
it properly you guys can just look it up
on Google or something okay so this is
iteration I so put in our variable here
I'm gonna leave a space there so that
makes sense and I want to also append on
a break tag just so that every time the
loop runs it starts a new line okay so
now I can go ahead and save this and
looks right looks like it should work so
let's go over to Firefox click refresh
and I've missed the semicolon somewhere
okay I actually put a semicolon where I
don't need one and that is after the
last expression in these parentheses I
don't need a semicolon over there so
let's go ahead and save that go back now
and click refresh and as you can see we
now have this is iteration zero all the
way to this is iteration nine which
means that this loop did indeed run ten
times and as I said once we got to
I equals 10 then 10 is no longer less
than 10 so I'll loop stopped and that's
where that's where it would move on to
any code that was down there okay
the other thing we can do is we don't
always have to count up we can also
count down so if I go ahead and say I -
- and we'll keep going while I is
greater than zero so we'll set hi to ten
to start off with and I'm going to
actually just delete this line as well
just so everything kind of makes sense
when we print it out go back here click
refresh and as you can see we now start
at 10 and count down to 1 so that's
pretty cool and that is how you use a
for loop in PHP don't forget to
