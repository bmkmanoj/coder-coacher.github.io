here and welcome to tutorial number I
think this is 35 and in this tutorial
I'm going to talk to you guys a little
bit more about tables so we started off
in the previous tutorial just creating
this really basic table which has three
rows and three columns right so that's
what the table pretty much looked like
in the end and I want to show you guys a
few more things that you can do with
tables in and then in the next video
we'll take a look at styling the table
with some CSS so let's go ahead and just
modify this table a little bit because I
want to show you guys something called
colspan and rowspan so colspan means
that we can take one column or one cell
like this and make it span over two
columns or actually you could make it
span over many more right so let's jump
back over here into our code and i'm
going to under person's name or on the p
h4 person's name I'm going to add an
attribute here called colspan
and I'm going to make that span over two
so whatever value you put in here is the
number of columns that this cell will
span over right and then what I'd like
to do is maybe take the surname out of
this table data and I'm going to place
it in a new cell so let's create a new
cell or a new table data over here and
we'll do the same thing with the next
person right oops don't forget to add
the table data's right so save this now
and if you jump back over to the browser
and hit refresh you will see that
basically what this does is this colspan
attribute makes this cell span over two
columns and then what I did was I added
an extra column to each one of these
table data or to each one of these
bottom rows so this one has three
columns but these ones have four columns
and that way it means that this table
data spans over two columns basically so
it's fans of a Quinton the first name
and what the second name and the same
thing for Shaun and Puli first and
second names right so if you guys wanted
to split data up like that you could do
that using colspan you can also use
something called row span so let's say
for instance Quinton had two
nationalities so yet one nationality
which is South African but he had
another nationality which was German or
something right then I don't want to
repeat the same data over again I don't
want to repeat Quinton what the same
name but I do want to have a different
nationality over here so let's say
German or I don't know just because I'm
learning German that was why I popped
into my head right and let's get rid of
these two cells and now for Quinton and
the surname what we can actually go in
here and add a row span of two and then
another one of row span two and that'll
make Quinton wats span over two rows so
let's come back here and hit refresh and
now you can see that my name Quinton
what spanned over two rows instead of
just one row like it used to before so
you can have basically one row span over
multiple rows or one cell in a row span
over multiple rows all right
and the great thing about this is you
can have as many rows spans and Col
spans as you like so just go ahead and
increase the number you can see I just
threw the table off a little bit but
yeah if you want to add whatever value
you want to put in here that's why many
rows is going to span over so now
Quinton wants spans over three rows but
unfortunately what we did was we threw
this
information of so to get it looking neat
and tidy again we might have to just
remove Sean from the database or Sean
from the code and now we have it looking
a little bit better again so yeah just
keep that in mind when using row span
and colspan if you span over too many
columns or too many rows are you going
to throw your table out and it's going
to look a little bit weird but yeah
otherwise it pretty much that's that's
how it works is pretty simple I'm just
going back if you think maybe put those
rows bands back in right so something
else I want to show you guys whoops
something else I want to show you guys
is something called a table caption so
tables have this caption tag which you
typically put right here underneath the
opening table tag and before your first
row you'll add a caption and then this
can say pretty much anything you want it
to like personal data and this caption
basically just explains what's going to
be in the table so that users kind of
know what what information they're
looking at in the table right so let's
come back in and hit refresh and you can
see that now we have our caption
displaying above the table like that and
yeah it's it's pretty clear that this
table obviously contains information
about someone's personal data or
personal information right so that's
captions there are other elements that
tables have such as a table body so you
can under your first row or around your
first row create a tea head tag and
maybe just put that below with the
heading ends so now this is our heading
and that's why it's surrounded by the
tea head tag whoopsie that was a blank
CSS file by the way right so that's just
this
table hitting and the only reason why
you would do that is if you want to do
specifically style your table hitting
different keys so if we save this right
now and come back over the browser and
refresh nothing actually changes this
tag doesn't change the appearance of the
table at all in any way until you use
CSS to style it so we might look at that
in the next tutorial
maybe styling the heading a little bit
differently to the rest of the table
then you also get because you have T
head for table head
you also have P T body right and
obviously you want to maybe move that
closing tag to the bottom of the table
and then you also have something called
the table foot or T foot which at the
end of your table you might want to just
place one row in there and have it span
over over all of the columns so you
might take one just have one table data
in there and have it span colspan off
three columns and you just say and the
table whatever don't even worry about
spelling it right now okay okay that's
four columns now so just make sure you
adjust that to fit the rest of the table
and there we go
right so that's that's our table looking
a little more like a table just kind of
doesn't look very nice right so in the
next video we're going to take a look at
actually styling this table may be
making alternate rows change color or
something like that and I'll see you
guys in that video I just want to send a
shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain
they run a coding bootcamp with courses
on iOS development UX design and web
development and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks so check out their
website the link is in the description
below and if you do contact them make
