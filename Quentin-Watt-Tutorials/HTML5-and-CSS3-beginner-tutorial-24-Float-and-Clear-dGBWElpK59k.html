here and welcome to tutorial number 24
and in this tutorial I want to talk to
you guys about float and Kalia so if you
take a look at my browser right now this
is blank and that is because I've
cleared everything out of my body
I've also cleared everything out of my
main CSS and let's take a look at how to
float and clear some objects and I'm
gonna be showing you guys this with an
image so I've added an image to my to my
directory over here you can see it with
CSS the index dot HTML file and my image
so that is very conveniently named me
JPEG because it is a picture of me and
let's add an image over here source me
dot JPEG please make sure that you are
using the correct file extension every
time I get a comment in my HTML
tutorials if I follow up with the guys
it's because they're always using the
wrong file extension okay and then let's
add this alt attribute just because that
is necessary and I'm gonna say Quinton
what as the alt attribute right and then
I'm going to create a paragraph so let's
open up a paragraph tag and type in an
and lorem and hit tab and that will
generate a paragraph of lorem ipsum yeah
if if you're not using sublime this is
not gonna work so you're gonna have to
type out a paragraph of some nonsense
but let's hit save come back here and
hit refresh and now you can see i've got
an image appearing and then I've got my
paragraph appearing below that and this
is technically what you would expect to
happen right you'd expect the image to
appear here and in the paragraph to
appear below that and this is normal
document flow but let's say for instance
I floated my image what that does is it
pulls the image out of the normal
document flow so just to demonstrate
exactly what's going on here I want to
create a slightly longer paragraph so
I'm gonna just add in a little bit more
lorem ipsum and then I'm gonna go over
to my CSS file and I'm gonna select that
paragraph and I just want to give it a
border of 3 pixels solid and red and the
reason why I'm doing that is just to
show you guys what happens with the
normal document flow so right now we
have our paragraph and everything
appears within the border of that
paragraph there's no spacing there's no
nothing over here and watch what happens
when I float this image so let's go back
to our index file I'm gonna add a class
to my image and I'm just gonna call this
float or you could call it float left or
right whatever you want to do and I'm
gonna select that image by the class so
float and then I'm going to float that
to the left
now you can float elements any which way
you want so floating to the left means
that our image will be on the Left if
you float to the right it means our
image will be on the right
so let's hit refresh and now you can see
we've got our paragraph appearing to the
right-hand side of our image and again
you'll notice that the paragraph text is
pushed all the way up against the image
but one thing you'll notice is that the
border of this image or the border of
this paragraph is kind of missing all
right and the reason for that is because
that border actually goes all the way
behind this image and we'll be able to
see that a little bit more clearly
perhaps if I stop zooming in and out and
I just come back over to this image and
let's give this image a width of 150
pixels and maybe make this paragraph
slightly longer
so where do you think I should add or
make it longer from there perhaps all
right so let's hit refresh and now you
can see that the border of our paragraph
goes all the way behind the image and
basically what happened here was that
this image was above the paragraph and
the paragraph was below the image and
then what happened was I decided to
float the image and that pulled the
image out of the normal document flow so
pulled it ahead of the paragraph and the
paragraph slipped in behind that so
that's basically what happened here
right and now the paragraph is behind
the image but the text doesn't display
behind the image so the text will always
move over and give the image a little
bit of space and something we could do
to make this look a little bit nicer is
whenever you floated your image just
give it a margin to the bottom of 20
pixels or something and then give it a
margin to the it depends now if if your
image is floated to the left like mine
is you want to give it a margin to the
right of 20 pixels and now if I come
back here and hit refresh you can see
we've got a little bit of spacing there
so that the paragraph is not pushed all
the way up against the image and the
only reason why I've left this border
here is to show you guys that that's
exactly what happens right the image was
here and the paragraph now that it's
floated the paragraph pulls in behind
the image but if I remove that border so
let's remove it you get to have
something that looks a little bit more
like an actual website this is what
people would you how people would
usually use floating right is just to
pull the image to the left or to the
right so let's let's float right and
just show you guys what that looks like
so if you look right that means I want
the margin on the left
of the image come back here and hit
refresh and now we have our image to the
right of our content so it depends it's
up to you where you want to place it in
fact this might look a little bit better
if our paragraph was aligned to the left
and I'm gonna pull that back to the left
I'll place the margin back on the right
again just to make it look exactly how
to look before and I'm gonna make this
image just a little bit bigger again so
let's let's make that image 200 pixels
the reason why is I want to show you
guys what happens if I have a second
paragraph over here so I think 200
pixels was still too small it's good 240
pixels okay
just that we've got this little bit of
space and the reason why I'm doing that
is cuz if i duplicate this paragraph by
the way all I did was hide the text in
that paragraph start document looks a
little bit neater but we've got these
two really long paragraphs so if I save
this and come back over the browser now
and refresh you can see I've got
paragraph 1 and then I've got paragraph
2 right and paragraph 2 because that
image is so big and has floated
paragraph 2 is also appearing next to
the image instead of below the image and
this might be a look you're going for
you might decide like hey I really like
this and I want to use my image or my
text this way
but let's just say for some reason you
didn't like this and you wanted the
second paragraph to absolutely no matter
what display below the image right then
we've got to make use of something
called clear so I'm going to create a
class over here called clear and then
I'm going to give it and give it a
property called clear and I'm gonna set
that to both and the value for both just
means that we're clearing items that
might be floated to the left or to the
right it doesn't matter which way this
image is flow
we're clearing both sides right so save
that and then I'm going to go over to my
second paragraph so not the first one
but the actual second one and I'm going
to give this a class of clear save this
now jump back over to the browser hit
refresh and now you can see what we did
was we forced the second paragraph to no
matter what display below the floated
contents and so like I said before this
we had this image over here and it was
above everything and then we floated the
image so everything kind of like fold in
behind the gap of the image and what we
did with the second paragraph was we
said okay we don't want you to fill in
anymore behind this image we want you to
just display on a new line and so that
is floating and clearing or the basics
of floating and caring and there's a lot
more that we can do with this and we
will be looking at that in future videos
