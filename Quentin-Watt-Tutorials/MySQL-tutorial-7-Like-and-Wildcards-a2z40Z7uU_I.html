and welcome to tutorial number seven and
in this tutorial I'm going to talk to
you guys about the where clause and more
specifically we're gonna be talking
about wild cards and the like comparison
or comparator whatever you want to call
that thing right so yeah basically if
you haven't watched the video on where
clauses you need to go back and watch
that because we are going to be making
use of a where Clause in this tutorial
and it's going to make a lot more sense
if you've already seen one of those
videos and just before we start off this
video I want to send a shout out to my
sponsors at dev Mountain so dev Mountain
is a coding bootcamp and their website
is linked in the video description below
go ahead and check them out if you are
planning on becoming a web developer I
know that sometimes learning at home can
be a little bit of a struggle and you
might want to just speed up that process
a little bit and become a developer even
sooner so yeah go ahead and check out
their website and they can teach you
everything you need to know to become a
web developer an iOS developer or a UX
designer and I'll do it within 12 weeks
and if you do contact them don't forget
to tell them that I sent you now let's
jump into the tutorial so yeah over the
past couple of tutorials we've been
making use of the where Clause a little
bit and in this tutorial it's going to
be more or less the same thing but the
table that I want to work with is the
products table so let's type in our
query here select everything from and
make sure that's capitalized otherwise
our boss might fire us so select
everything from the product table and I
want to add in a where clause over here
so we don't select absolutely everything
and the where clause I want to make use
of is going to be where the product name
product underscore name is like
something else right so the like
comparison allows us to like basically
compare when the name is is like a
certain piece of text so for instance if
the user was typing in the word light we
could compare a product name where that
name is equal to or similar to the word
light so if I copy this and hit go you
can see right now we've got a little bit
of a problem zero rows have been
returned and that's because whenever
you're using the like comparison you're
probably also going to want to make use
of something called a wild-card and that
is actually this percent sign over there
so when you put one of those in it
basically means yeah it's going to be
kind of like this word but there might
be some stuff after this word right and
that's what that percentage sign means
and most often we'll make use of two of
them so we'll have one afterwards and
one before and it basically means okay
there might be some stuff before the
word light there might be some stuff
after the word light but the word light
is the word that we're looking for over
here so let's copy this and hit go and
now you can see I've got two results so
we were searching for the product name
and where the product name was like
light and it just so happens that I have
two products that are like the word
light and they're both light sabre one
happens to be light saber blue and the
other one happens to be light saber red
so both of them have the word light in
the name and that's why both of them
showed up because we're searching for
anything with the word light and it
doesn't matter if there's something
before it doesn't matter for something
after it as long as it has the word
light in the name we wanted to find it
alright so let's take a look at another
example and I'm just going to go back
over the sequel tab and search again and
I think something else I can search for
is where the product description is like
a certain something so I think most of
the products on my website are using one
specific description so let's look for
the product description and let's just
say for instance somebody told me hey
you're using a lot of dummy data on your
website
there's a lot of lorem ipsum showing up
everywhere you probably want to get rid
of that lorem ipsum so you might want to
find out what products are using lorem
ipsum and yeah a query like this might
be quite good to throw in there so where
the product description is like the word
Epsom let's just go ahead and see how
many products are actually using this so
that it go and you can see wow there's
actually quite a few results yeah all of
these product descriptions are using the
text lorem ipsum or have Epsom in the
description somewhere but this does give
us a little bit more time to play around
with this query because now you can play
around with the wild cards and let's say
I search for Epsom without a wild card
at the beginning over here you can see
we land up with zero queries and that is
because basically like I said the wild
card means there might be something
before this and there might be something
after this but the word Epsom definitely
needs to be there so if we hit go the
word getsome is here and there is some
stuff before lorem ipsum or the word
Epsom and there is some stuff after the
word ipsum so yeah basically when you
have wild cards like this it just means
that you've got the possibility of
returning the most results whereas when
you have a wild card only at the end
obviously the sentence has to begin with
the word Epsom so if we type in the word
lorem let's copy this and hit go you can
see all of these sentences start with
the word lorem so there is something
after them and therefore this one will
also return results but only if it's
also the word lorem and there happens to
be some stuff after it yeah the key
thing here is that I just want you to
realize that placing your wild cards in
there is important and where you place
your wild cards in the query is also
going to be important I think for most
of us searching with two wild cards is
usually the best option but there might
be times where you only want to find
something that begins with the wood and
then has some stuff afterwards right so
that is the end of the video and I just
