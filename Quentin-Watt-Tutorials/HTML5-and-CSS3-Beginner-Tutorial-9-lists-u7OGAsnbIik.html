to tutorial number nine and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to make a list in HTML so now why don't
we just change our title because we
haven't changed this in the past 9
tutorials and just say this is the list
tutorial I think I spelled that right ok
awesome so like I said in this tutorial
we are going to make lists and the first
thing I want to let you guys know is
that there are actually two different
types of lists in HTML you get unordered
lists and then you get ordered lists now
unordered lists are basically lists that
have bullet points next to each item and
like you can write them each item in any
order that'll it doesn't have to be a
specific order to each item that you
that you want in the list and then you
have ordered lists which have the
numbers next to them and then obviously
those are items that have to be in order
like if you were going to give someone
steps to doing something so why don't we
go ahead and your staff straight into
this and make an unordered list so to
make an unordered list we use the tag ul
and then to end it off /ul and there we
go now we've told HTML that we want to
make an unordered list but to actually
give our list some content we need to
add in a list item so that is basically
smaller than greater than sign and then
Li for list item and then obviously you
need to end this all for the /li
and there we go now we can start adding
items to our list so I'm just actually
in a copy-paste this quickly and why
don't we just make it a list of foods
that I don't eat so I'm just going to
give this list a title real quick and
I've showed you guys how to make headers
so don't lose track of this
let's go food
I don't eat so now you guys get to learn
a little bit more about me in my
tutorial how cool is that
and the first food that I don't do not
eat is tomatoes now I call this Tomatoes
you guys might call it tomatoes or
something but I absolutely hate Tomatoes
whether they're cooked or not just there
and the second food that I don't eat is
bananas I really don't like bananas
bananas bananas or a banana depending on
where you are in the world again and the
third food they do not eat is grapes I
do not like grapes and seeing as all of
them are fruit to Madison will throw a
vegetable in you and be like spinach I
absolutely hate spinach so there we go
let's go ahead and save that and now I'm
going to run this in Firefox and there
we go that's what an unordered list
looks like with a whole bunch of bullet
points next to each list item and yeah
there we go we've got foods that I do
not eat tomatoes bananas grapes and
spinach yeah really don't like those
foods anyways so that's how we make an
unordered list let's just go ahead and
make an ordered list quickly and then we
can tell the difference between the two
so I'm actually just going to go ahead
and copy this this header real quick as
well
and seeing as it's an ordered list we're
going to have to give it some order so
let's just give it a title you have luck
how to write awesome websites and now
the keyword for an ordered list is going
to be oh L for ordered list and
obviously /au L for ending old list and
in here
we're going to have to put in a whole
bunch of list items like we did in the
previous list for /aa
and let's just go ahead and copy paste
that because I am feeling lazy Q will
and now what we can do is add in our
first step and our first step to
learning how to write awesome websites
is open your web browser and the second
step can be like go to my YouTube
channel because you guys really should
visit that channel it's pretty awesome
and the next one is uh watch my HTML Oh
what the hell how did I okay so let's
just go ahead and move that text uh put
on a how I ended up getting that down
onto the next level so the next step you
need to do is watch my HTML series and
then I guess the last step would be to
practice and the more you practice the
better you get and the better you get
yeah then you can start writing your own
websites and going to publish them and
stuff so let's run this info in Firefox
now and now we get two different types
of Lists over here we've got our ordered
unordered list which is the bullet
points when you guys saw that already
and then over here we have our ordered
list which is basically numbered and
with all the steps in order and what
order to do them in so guys thanks for
