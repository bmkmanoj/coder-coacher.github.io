here and in this video and over the
course of the next few videos we're
actually going to be taking a look at
some different selectors in jQuery so
you guys have probably seen me using
selectors in my previous videos and you
guys should already know or have an idea
of what a selector is but it's basically
what we use in jQuery to select an
element and then we start creating
functions for that elements to actually
start manipulating our webpage whenever
that element is clicked or hovered over
etc so first of all let's actually take
a look at the old selector and this
selector will select every single
element on our web page and to do that
I'm actually going to go over to my
script file which by the way is linked
down here and my jQuery file is also
linked over here so if you guys don't
have these two links then your tutorials
not going to work so you just better
make sure that you have these and you
should be fine
and I want to select all the elements on
my web page so I'm going to do that by
opening up my parenthesis here and
adding my dollar symbol and in between
that I'm going to add quotation marks
and in between that I'm actually going
to add an asterisk and the asterisks
will select all of the elements on our
webpage so it's pretty much the same way
we select an elements using CSS whenever
we want to select all the elements we
add in an asterisk and this by itself of
course isn't going to do anything so we
still need to make this actually do
something and what I decided to do was
that we should actually create a
variable here so I'm going to create a
variable called count and we'll set this
equal to the count of all of the
elements on our webpage now how do we
get the count for all of our elements on
our web page well the first thing we're
going to do is
select all our elements and then we're
going to append on dot length as an
attribute over here or not an attribute
but a property rather and what this is
going to do is or what this entire line
of code does actually is create a
variable called count and then we count
all of the elements on our web page and
we actually store that value in this
variable called count so if I go over to
a new line here and I alert this out
I can alert the variable counts just
like that
well this variable count if I click on
it making sure that both turn green and
what that's going to do is when we run
this in Firefox if I jump back over to
here and run this in Firefox it's going
to alert out the number of elements on
our page which evidently is seven so you
might be thinking well what the heck
this is actually a blank webpage where
did those seven elements come from and
those seven elements are actually these
elements here so head or HTML will be
our first element and this includes the
ending HTML tag then we have head then
that's that's our second one and meta
that's our third one title that's the
fourth one body is the fifth this script
tag would be six and that script tag
would be seven so we do indeed have
seven elements on our page and actually
if I go back there and we add some more
elements to this so let's create a div
and I'm going to end this div off and we
can throw in a few paragraphs yes so
let's just say this is a paragraph and
in that paragraph off we can duplicate
that a couple times so what have we done
yet we've added three four elements to
our page and if I go back over to
Firefox and we click refresh you can
see we now have the number 11 printed
out and if you go back and obviously
count that or pretty much just add the
four to the seven that we had previously
then that is indeed 11 so this count
again worked perfectly
but of course whenever we're using the
all selector or the Select over here
we're actually selecting all of the
elements on the page so we're selecting
this HTML tag we're selecting everything
here in the head we're selecting this
body tag and if we are trying to
manipulate elements on our page we
probably don't want to select all of
these tags I mean we probably don't want
to change anything with this HTML tag or
this head or anything in the head
actually and we probably don't to change
this body either so a better way to find
an element or find some elements only if
they're inside of another element is to
actually first find one element and then
look at all the elements that are inside
of that element and I'll show you what I
mean by that if we get rid of all of
well actually let's not get rid of all
of this we'll just change this part over
here and what we want to do is actually
select one element on our page and to do
that
I want to grab the I'm going to give
this an ID and I will just give it an ID
of parents a hand I'm going to copy that
and save that and we'll go over here and
we'll select all of the elements on our
page that have an ID of parent and to
select by ID we're going to be using
this hashtag and what we want to do now
is actually append on dot find and in
this find function or find method over
here we're actually going to select all
the elements that are inside of this
parent element and that's where we can
add in our all selector so basically
what we're doing now
creating this variable called counts and
we're first finding our parents elements
and then or first selecting our parent
element and then finding all of the
elements that are inside of that parent
element and then actually counting the
length of how many fields or how many
elements we actually have in this parent
element and alerting that out so if we
click Save and we go back here you can
see we've got three paragraphs inside of
this div parent so the number that
should be alerted out here is three so
let's click refresh and as you can see
we now have the number three so that is
how we use the all selector and also how
to use the heat find and find function
and the length property and that is all
