in here and welcome to tutorial number
21 and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to use break
statements to break out of a loop or
terminate a loop early and then I'm also
going to show you guys how to use the
continue statement to not break out of a
loop but just skip one iteration in the
loop okay so let's get started by
creating a for loop so let's go ahead
and say four and it's been a while since
I did something comical so we'll start
off with I as zero and that is in no way
funny but let's just do something
ridiculous like make this loop go or
repeat one thousand times so while I is
less than a thousand and that's kind of
ridiculous and then we'll just increment
I by one each time
okay and inside my loop we'll just echo
out some really stupid message like hey
I'm going to do this 1,000 times and you
can stop me so the computers just being
really evil and I should probably fix my
time for no reason whatsoever other than
the fact that being OCD about this okay
so let's go ahead and save this now
click refresh and as you can see we have
this printed out a heck of a load of
times and it will probably be better
just to put a break element in here okay
so let's go back to Firefox just click
refresh okay so everything appears on
one line or on its own line okay so
believe it or not this is printed out
one thing
thousand times and obviously 1000 times
is a bit much to print something out so
let's try and break out of this loop so
that's what I'm going to show you guys
how to do now so we'll go ahead and put
in an if statement because we can't just
break we need to have a condition to
break okay so if I is exactly equal to
ten then let's just say okay you know
what this loops gone on for long enough
let's stop this loop okay so go ahead
and say break and now when we save that
and click refresh you can see we have
this printed out a lot less times so
basically that is how you break out of a
loop if you decide that it has been
going on for way too long you just check
for a condition and then you'll go ahead
and use the break statement inside of
the if statement okay now let's take a
look at how to not break out of a loop
completely but just skip one iteration
so let's go ahead and just remove all of
that and I think a thousand times is a
bit much so let's just make this loop
run ten times okay and I think what we
can do is just echo out our variable
I followed by a break tag just to make
sure that all of the numbers appear on a
new line so now when we go back and
click refresh we've got the numbers zero
through two nine print it out nothing
special about that but as you can see
we're still including zero to four so
basically we're still including all of
the even numbers now let's go back to
Firefox I mean to notepad plus plus
and see if we can't get this program to
make all the even numbers get skipped
but all the odd numbers get printed out
okay and it just so happens I know
exactly how to do that so we're going to
start off by using an if statement to
check if our number is even or odd so
we'll go ahead and check if I mod 2
equals equals zero so basically if I mod
2 is equal to zero that means that our
integer or our variable I is storing an
even number okay so I forgot the word
for even for a second there but yeah
okay so I is storing an even number if I
can be modded by two and have a
remainder of zero so then we'll go ahead
and just say continue and basically what
this continued statement does is it
tells the computer don't worry about
anything else or any of the other code
in this loop which is this line over
here just ignore this and start the loop
right from the beginning again
okay so it'll start for zero check if
zero is even number and it is so
continue go back here I guess now I is
equal to 1 is 1 an even number no it's
not ok print it out and then go ahead
and check for 2 well 2 is an even number
let's skip it then it'll go to 3 is 3 an
even number
no ok let's print it out that's
basically what the computer is going to
be thinking the whole time while it
prints all the stuff out so let's go
back here and click refresh and as you
can see we now only have 1 3 5 7 and 9
so all odd numbers okay so that is how
you use the continue statement to
you basically skip one loop iteration at
a time okay and that's actually all I
have for you guys in this video so don't

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
