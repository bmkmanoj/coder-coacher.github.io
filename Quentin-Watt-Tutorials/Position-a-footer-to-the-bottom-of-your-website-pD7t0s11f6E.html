here and welcome to this tutorial on
fixing a footer to the bottom of the web
page and as you can see from the
beautiful city behind me I am in Zurich
so if you guys want to know a little bit
more about why I'm here and how I got
here you can go ahead and check out the
link in either this corner or this
corner I'm not sure which corner is
going to be in but check it out the
reason why I don't know which corner is
going to be in is because I'm totally
filming this with my camera upside down
at the moment but I'm going to flip it
around later anyway now that I've got
that out of the way let's take a look at
how to fix the footer to the bottom of
your web page and I think the best way
to just explain this is if you take a
look at my browser real quick you'll see
that right now I have a really simple
kind of website set up with a logo and
some navigation and a footer and this is
the problem that a lot of people have is
when you don't have that much content
within the body of your site then the
footer kind of just pulls all the way up
the top of the page and it hangs right
from where the body is so basically like
your website's not long enough to fill
the computer screen and that way the
footer actually doesn't sit at the
bottom of the computer screen and you
kind of want to get rid of that problem
because it doesn't look very nice so let
me show you how to fix that now if you
right click on this and inspect with any
kind of element inspector so go ahead
and use Chrome or use Firebug if you've
got Mozilla Firefox and yeah if you just
pull that down and hover over the body
tag you'll notice that the body of the
site is only as long as my content is
right now and we if we do the same thing
over the HTML document
whoopsie I don't think I've refreshed
but yeah if you do the same thing over
the HTML document it should show you the
same result where you have the HTML
document only as high as your website
actually is so the way you want to get
around this is to first of all position
your HTML elements 100% and position it
relative
so let's jump over the CSS and do that
so I have got all of the CSS code here
right now and I'm going to make it
available for download for free if you
look at the description below
go ahead and salt with this code and the
first thing you want to do is add two
lines of code to your HTML element so go
ahead and select that and the first line
of code is to just say height 100% and
then you want to also set the position
to relative now the reason why you want
to set the position to relative over
here is because if you don't set the
position position to relative later on
we're going to set the position of the
footage to absolute and it just going to
mess things up if you don't actually
position the HTML element relatively you
should always do that right so the next
thing you're going to want to do is add
some code to the footer of your site so
I've already given the footer of my
website a class of TM footer and that
would be this footer tag right here so
right now the current code just turns
the background black sets all the color
of the text in the footer to white and
gives a little bit of padding and margin
the next thing I want to do now is
actually add some code that I've got
over here that I can just copy paste and
yeah this is just code that is going to
force the footer to the bottom of the
page so I'm going to just copy and paste
that into here and take out the comments
well that one actually needs as they
come in to that right so we're
positioning the footer absolutely and
that's why we have to position our HTML
element relatively early on and then I'm
also just setting the bottom the left
and the right to 0 pixels which
basically just makes our footer yeah
jump down to the bottom of the page and
yeah having it positioned at left 0 and
right 0 just stretches it across the
screen now you can take a photo sorry
I'll wait so we're going to be awhile
right so now our footer is fixed at the
bottom of the webpage but there's going
to be a little problem because if I jump
back over my code but in all of this
HTML back again we're going to spot the
problem so let's come back here and
refresh and you can see that right now
if you take a look at this the footer is
kind of appearing above the content
that's overlapping some of our content
so if you have a
of content on your page when you've done
this this is the problem that you might
come across if you don't have everything
set up correctly so something else that
you really need to do is to add some
styling to the body of your tag or to
the body tag of the site so let's jump
back over to here and I'm just going to
copy paste this code that I've already
prepared so let's copy that
and yeah essentially what I want to do
is add that into my body and just
comment this line out so long I want
coming out right and essentially what
I've done here is I've used min height
so I've set a minimum height for my body
of for my body tag so the minimum height
of my body tag should always be 100%
which means that the minimum height of
the body will always take up as much
space as I possibly can but what I've
actually done is I've used a css3 calc
function so this is only available in
the latest version of css3 it'll work in
most recent browsers but if you're
really trying to get this to work in
something like Internet Explorer 7 or 9
or 6 or whatever yeah it might not work
but yeah I don't think we should really
cater for people who are using browsers
that old so let's forget about them all
right and essentially what this calc
function allows us to do is calculate
the height of something so I've taken
the minimum height of my body to be 100%
minus 171 pixels and the way I got that
179 71 pixels is because that is the
height of my footer so basically what
you're trying to do here is just take
the body set it to the absolute minimum
width of 100% which means it should
always take up at least the browser size
window and then minus the footer you
also want to position that relatively
and give it a padding of the same size
as what the foot actually is now all of
that together if you come over to the
browser again and refresh you should now
have a footer that sticks to the bottom
of your page even when you have removed
all of the contents so if you remove
everything and then come back over to
the browser and refresh again you'll
notice that you will now have a footer
that sticks to the bottom of the page
even though the content doesn't actually
reach all the way to the bottom but as
