here and in this video I'm gonna show
you guys how to use the global
configuration in Joomla to turn off a
whole bunch of default settings or
display settings that Joomla actually
has where it displays all these weird
little bits of information that we don't
really need on our website okay and just
for an example I'm actually on my first
article which we created a couple
tutorials ago and as you can see on this
page we actually have a little block
over here that says details and then
we've got written by super user and that
really doesn't make any sense to someone
visiting my site who the heck is super
user now I happen to know that that's me
but the people reading my website won't
know who's super user is so that's kind
of information that I might want to hide
again category is set to and categorize
we party don't really need to show that
to the user so we can go ahead and hide
that okay
we've also got a publish date which
actually sometimes people like to have
that on their web site still but you
guys can keep it if you want I'm going
to show you guys how to turn that off
and then we also have a hit counter over
here and you know what to be honest a
hit counter is something that maybe in
the early 2000s and in the 90s we always
wanted people to see how many hits our
page got nowadays not so much okay so a
hit count is something you can hide away
and then the users or the visitors to
our website on the front end don't
actually need to see that because it's
it's information that's irrelevant to
them actually okay so I'm going to show
you guys how to turn all of that stuff
off and to do that you're gonna have to
log in to the backend of Joomla then go
over to system global configuration and
basically here you're able to change a
whole bunch of settings and we might
still pop into the global configuration
later on in other tutorials just to
change a few things but for now I'm
actually going to go over to articles
because that's the six
I want to work with right now okay and
if you guys ever want to change
something about the Smart Search all the
languages then you can do that but I'm
actually not going to cover that in this
video so we're just going to be talking
about articles and if we take a look at
options over here you can see that we've
got an option to show the title and the
title is actually this up here so if you
guys don't want the title to appear on
the page then you can go ahead and hide
that although I think it makes sense to
have that there so I'm gonna leave that
okay link titles means that it's making
this title a link and to be honest I
think this is really stupid because if I
go ahead and click on this link it links
me straight back to the article which
I'm already on so that I think is a
little bit dumb so we can go ahead and
turn link titles off intro text we can
go ahead and actually turn that off
we're actually not using intro text I
didn't show you guys how to use that so
turning this officing and I don't really
do anything but yeah if I ever make a
tutorial intro on intro text then I'll
come back and I'll set this to show so
you guys can see exactly what intro text
does but for now I'll go ahead and leave
that off okay category we don't want
that there and linked category we can
obviously set to no so that's actually
just this category over here and then
that's linked to Uncategorized
so we just went ahead and turned that
off now okay show author again that's
the part that says written by super user
I don't want that to show up so I'm
gonna go ahead and hide that show
publish date also I don't really need
that to show up so I guess I can go
ahead and hide that show navigation also
that is this little next button at the
bottom here it's not really necessary I
guess if I had a whole bunch of articles
I could flip through them going next
next next back back back or whatever but
to be honest I don't really want to use
that so I'm gonna go ahead and hide that
okay read more buttons and things like
that we're not using at the moment
so it's probably safe just to turn those
off and actually tags we are using at
the moment or one of my articles is
actually using them so if I go over to
the getting started article this is the
article that came with Joomla you can
see that there's a little blue box here
that is actually a tag and it's just a
German attack so tags would just be to
help that article gain some SEO ranking
and stuff okay we can go ahead and
actually just turn that off for the user
so the user doesn't actually see that or
the visitor because it really might not
make sense to them what the tag is doing
there okay
icons we're gonna have to go back to my
single article to show that again but
icons is this little Settings section
over here which doesn't make much sense
to me but then you got a print button
and an email button so people can print
or email this webpage again that's not
something that we use very often
nowadays on the web so I'm gonna go
ahead and hide those so hide icons
should actually hide everything but if I
just go hide hide hide then that'll also
just hide the print icon or an email
icon and then the last thing we're
talking about here is hits and like I
said this is pretty much a dead trend we
don't really show users how many hits
our website or our webpage or the
article on the webpage has gotten so we
can go ahead and click hide for that
because that's not something where user
needs to see okay and that's pretty much
the articles we could also change these
settings for categories so I could maybe
hide category tags and again over here
category descriptions might want to hide
those I don't know
again we can always come back and change
these things but for now I'm gonna go
ahead and actually just save this as it
is hopefully I didn't lose all my
settings there and I'm gonna click Save
and now if I go over to the
my website and click refresh you can see
all that stupid information that didn't
need to be there is gone ok now the rest
of this stuff like these breadcrumbs
this whole sidebar and this image here
those are all modules and modules are
something else in Joomla that we'll be
taking a look at in the next couple
tutorials but for now just know that
those are modules and that's actually
something else we have to turn off in a
different place so it's not it's not
gonna be in the global configuration and
that is all I have for you in this video
