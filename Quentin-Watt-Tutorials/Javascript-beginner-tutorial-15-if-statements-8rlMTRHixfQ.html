here and welcome to tutorial number 15
and in this tutorial I'm going to take a
look at something called if statements
okay so basically what an if statement
is or what an if statement allows us to
do is we can give the computer a test or
a condition to check and if that
condition or test evaluates to true then
we can execute a line of code but if
that condition or test evaluates to
false then we can just go ahead and skip
all of the code altogether and carry on
with the rest of our program as if
nothing ever happened okay so this will
probably make a lot more sense
if I just explain the basic syntax for
an if statement and syntax is just a
clever or fancy word for the structure
of what our code looks like okay so to
setup an if statement on your website
then you'll go ahead and just write in
the word if followed by two parentheses
and inside our parentheses this is where
we will put a condition okay so we'll
put our test over there and if that
condition evaluates to true then we'll
run some code here and if we want to run
more than one line of code in our if
statement then we actually have to use
some little curly braces so I always
start off my if statements with curly
braces just in case I want to run more
than one line of code just like that and
if you guys are new to programming then
you won't know this but guys that have a
little bit of experience in programming
know that there are two kinds of
programmers there are the guys that
start off their curly braces like this
and then they our programmers who decide
that this little curly brace deserves
its own line I don't know why they think
that but
anyways they do so then they go ahead
and they set up their if statements like
that but you can do either all that's
fine although just to save some space I
like to keep my little curly brace up
there at the top with the rest of the if
statement ok so now let's take a look at
an example real quick so if I go ahead
and I make a variable up at the top of
the page here I'll just call it var de
okay and we'll set this equal to
Thursday because let's say I wanted to
have a website that displays a special
weekend message on Friday then what I
can do is in my if statement I can check
if day is equal to Friday so the way I
do that is I'll type in my variable name
day and then I want to check if my
variable day is exactly equal to the
word Friday so the way I do that is I
actually use a double equal sign and the
reason why I use two equal signs is
because the single equal sign in
JavaScript is already taken it already
has another purpose its purpose is to
assign this value to this variable so I
can't use a single equal sign they I
have to use a double equal sign when
comparing two values so I want to see if
de is equal to the word Friday and if it
is then I want to do something okay and
what I'm going to do is I'll just print
out a message so document dot write and
we can write a message on the screen
that says well we'll just go for
rebeccablack song so but it's Friday
it's Friday Friday gotta get down on
Friday anyways
cool so go ahead and
save that and now if I run this in
Firefox
we should get nothing printed out on the
screen and the reason why that happens
is because Thursday which is our day is
not exactly equal to Friday so that's
why this line of code didn't run the
computer just went okay is Thursday
equal to Friday no okay then I look at
all of this and then it would have
carried on with whatever programming or
code was down here but if I set my day
equal to Friday and then I go ahead and
I save this and go ahead and refresh
this in Firefox you can see I have it's
Friday it's Friday printed out on the
screen
okay so the reason why that happened was
because day which is our variable is
Friday and Friday is equal to Friday
therefore this line of code can run so
this line of code will only run if this
condition evaluates to true and this
doesn't have to be just with strings we
can go ahead and use numbers as well so
instead what I'll do is let's change
this variable at the top here to age and
we'll set the age equal to 17 and since
I know that this line of code will only
get printed out or will only get
executed if this evaluation is true our
models will just change this message
here too yay it's true okay go ahead and
save this so now we can check if the
user is exactly equal to 18 years old
and the way we do that is we just change
this expression inside the parentheses
to say if age is double equal sign equal
to 18
okay then go ahead and write yay it's
true okay
but now if we go ahead and we look at
this H is actually equal to 17 so is 17
equal to 18 well no it's not so we're
actually going to get nothing printed
out on the screen and if I go ahead and
run that in Firefox instead of
minimizing it then you can see we've got
absolutely nothing printed out on the
screen but if I go ahead and I change
this so if I go ahead and I change my
age variable to exactly 18 then 18 is
indeed equal to 18 and we should get
this message yay it's true printed out
on the screen so let's go back to
Firefox again click refresh and there we
go yay it's true but let's go ahead and
minimize this and it's kind of pointless
just checking if the user is exactly
equal to 18 you know for most websites
we might want to check if the user is
older than 18 or younger than 18 and
then make a response judged on that so
the way we do that is instead of using a
double equal sign to check if these
numbers are exactly equal to each other
what we can do is we can go ahead and
use the greater than sign or less than
sign to check if the user is older than
18 or younger than 18 and create a
response judge under that so let's say
we were creating an online gambling web
sites or something like that
okay the user would have to be older
than 18 or at least in South Africa you
have to be older than 18 before you can
go into a casino so if H is greater than
18 then we can go ahead and run this
code over here so let's go ahead and
change our age to 16 or something like
that then you can go ahead and see when
we refresh this in Firefox we don't
anything printed up on the screen
because age which is 16 is less than 18
so this expression is false okay
and therefore this line of code does not
run but if we go ahead and we change our
age to be 21 then 21 is indeed greater
than 18 so this will be true and we can
go ahead and refresh this in Firefox and
there we go yay it's true
okay but now we kind of have a problem
because if a user is exactly 18 years
old then he or she should be allowed to
go into this online casino because
they're exactly 18 so they're our age
but when we're testing to see if they're
greater than 18 we're not including 18
as part of our expression so if you can
if I save this and I'll run this in
Firefox now I'm going to get nothing
printed out on the screen which kind of
means that age obviously 18 is not
greater than 18 so this is false and our
test would kind of not let the user into
our casino so if you want to include 18
as part of the expression then you can
say if age is greater than or equal to
so greater than or equal to 18 then we
can go ahead and print this line of code
over here so let's go ahead and save
that and when I click refresh you can
see yay it's true because 18 is indeed
not greater than but it is equal to 18
okay so let's go over that again real
quick and if you're wanting to compare
two values in an if statement okay to
test if each value is exactly equal to
the opposite one then you go ahead and
you use a double equal sign
we'll check if this value is exactly
equal to this value but if you want to
see if one is greater than the other
then you can go ahead and use the
greater than sign and if you want to
check if they're less than then you can
go ahead and use the less than sign then
like I said you can also use greater
than or equal to to include this value
or you can go ahead and say less than or
equal to to include this value as less
than or equal to okay then the other
value which I didn't explain to you guys
yet and it's actually rather simple is
not equal to so the way we do that in
JavaScript is we put an exclamation mark
and then an equal sign and this means if
age is not equal to 18 okay so if we go
ahead and we save this now we can see
that we've got our age set to 18 at the
moment so 18 is actually equal to 18 so
this message shouldn't print out on the
screen so if I go ahead and i refresh
there we go
nothing but if I change this value to
anything other than 18 so 15 or any
other number other than 18 this becomes
true again because age which is 15 is
not equal to 18 so when we go ahead and
refresh this now there's our message
popped up on the screen so that's pretty
cool and that's basically just really
simple maths so that's actually all I
have for you guys in this video so thank
