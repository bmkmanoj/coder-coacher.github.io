here and welcome to tutorial number 5 in
my JavaScript series and in this video I
just want to talk to you guys about data
types so there it is over there now I
just want to start off this video by
talking about my previous video for a
second and if you guys can remember in
that video I spoke to you guys about
variables and I told you guys that we
can use a variable to store data inside
of the computer's memory but what I
didn't tell you is that there's actually
a whole bunch of different types of data
that we can use so that's what we're
going to go over in this video and the
first data type that I want to talk to
you guys about is called an integer so
I'm just going to make a comment here
and we'll say integer okay and if you
guys did maths at school then you know
exactly what an integer is it's a whole
number which means there's no decimal
places and it can be positive or
negative so basically any number without
a decimal place is an integer so for
example in a real world example if I had
a website and I wanted to collect the
users age then I would have a variable
and I probably call it user age so let's
make that variable now and then I would
later on set that variable to the users
age as an integer because you no one's
ever 21 and a quarter or 21 and a point
three or something like that it's always
21 or 22
but I'm 21 so I'll go with that and then
we end that off with a semicolon
obviously because it's a statement and
now what we can do is we can just print
this out on the page to see that it
works so document dot write and whatever
goes inside here which is our variable
user a
okay and if we save this and we run this
in Firefox whoops okay you can see the
number 21 is printed out on the screen
so JavaScript can handle integers just
fine then the next data type that I want
to talk to you guys about is called a
float okay
and some of you guys might know this as
a floating-point because that's its full
name or if you guys do maths then you'll
know this as a real number but in
programming we call this a floating
point and a floating point is basically
a number that's allowed to have a
decimal place so that's different from
an integer because an integer no decimal
place floating number is allowed to have
a decimal place and it can also be
positive or negative so let's go ahead
and as a real-world example let's say we
were working with the price of something
like maybe my website was selling books
then I could have a variable and I could
store the book's price so we'll make a
variable name book price and then we
could set this equal to any value that a
book would cost so 3995 out of my head
sounds like a good price okay so now
what we can do again is actually just
print this out on the screen
to show you guys that Java scripts can
handle floating floating points
perfectly so let's go ahead and print
that out document dot write and inside
here we just put our variable name which
is book price go ahead and end that all
for the semicolon go back to Firefox
click refresh and now we have the number
3995 printed out on the screen so
javascript can handle variables with a
floating point value just fine
okay then the next data type that I
actually want to talk to you guys about
is called a string and if you guys have
never done any programming before then
basically what a string is is it's just
a collection of text so a string can be
one word it could be one whole sentence
it could even be a whole paragraph if
you really wanted to store that much
information okay so whenever we work
with a string in JavaScript we always
have to surround our string in quotation
marks so just like that so and then
whatever whatever we want to be in our
string has to be inside of the quotation
box so string is here now there's a few
reasons why we use those quotation marks
and one of them is because inside our
string we can include all sorts of
symbols like brackets and stuff and we
don't want JavaScript to think that's
all programming we want JavaScript to
know that this is a string and we can
also include spaces as you can see here
so with the quotation marks basically
it's all JavaScript ok our string starts
here and then our string ends here so
everything inside of this is going to be
our variable so let's say I had a
variable and let's say on our website I
wanted to store the user's name okay
then I could create a variable called
user name and then I could store my name
which is Quinten as a variable and now
what I can do is I can go ahead and
print this out so let's go document dot
write and whoops and we just put in the
variable name which is user name and
we'll go ahead and save this run in
Firefox and now you can see my name is
printed out on the screen so the
quotation marks are left out they're
ignored okay but my name is printed out
on the screen so that's pretty cool but
now we kind of have a problem because
let's say I wasn't actually storing a
user name but
maybe I let my user type in a paragraph
maybe they were making a facebook status
or something so we could go ahead and
put a status there and let's go ahead
and say something so let's say our user
wanted to put in a quote as their status
okay then they might have said something
like Billy said and then whatever
beliefs it in quotation marks
programmers Creed has the best tutorials
okay so that's pretty cool but what have
we done here we've actually started our
string here and then we've accidentally
ended off our string here and now
javaScript doesn't know what any of this
stuff is until we get to these two
quotation marks where it's like okay you
started a string and you've left it
empty and then you've entered your
string so JavaScript at this point gets
pretty confused because it's like what
the heck is going on and if you save
this in file if you save it and then you
run it in Firefox you can see you don't
get anything here and you'll actually
get an error okay so this doesn't work
so if we wanted to actually make this
work and tell JavaScript okay no no this
is actually a saying we want these
quotation marks to be part of our string
okay what you have to do then is you
have to use something called an escape
character and what an escape character
does is it says it says the JavaScript
okay ignore the character immediately
after me so an escape character in
JavaScript is actually just this slash
over there well there we go and
basically what that slash does is it now
says okay JavaScript ignore this
quotation mark so now this quotation
mark is part of our string and then we
can go ahead and just ignore this one on
the end as well and go ahead and save
this and now when we go back to Firefox
and click refresh
and it's not working because I didn't
change the username of ear so it's going
face that they're cool save go ahead and
click refresh
and now you can see we've got Billy said
programmers Creed is has the best
tutorials and our quotation marks are
actually part of the string now because
we've used the escape character over
here to tell JavaScript that this
quotation mark was part of our string so
that's pretty much what we use when we
working with strings okay and there's
one last data type that I want to talk
to you guys about and that data type is
called boolean so I'm going to comment
that out here boolean and that's quite a
funny name actually but what a boolean
is is that's a data type that is only
allowed to have two values it can only
be true the word true or the word false
so these are the only two values that a
boolean can have and the reason why we
would use this is let's say for example
we wanted to check that our user was
over the age of 18 okay you can see
we've stored the user age over here as
21 so we could then check is 21 greater
than 18 and then if it was then that
would evaluate to true otherwise if my
variable was 17 then 17 would not be
greater than 18 and then our variable
would be equal to false okay so that's
just what a boolean does is it just will
we'll test for something and if that
thing fails then it'll be true or false
so yeah that is what we use a boolean
for in programming and it's kind of hard
to think of an example right now because
we have we haven't gotten that far in
programming to actually work with if
statements and functions and so on so if
you guys don't understand what a billion
is right now
then don't worry you'll understand soon
enough so thank you guys for watching
and I will see you guys next time
don't forget to subscribe don't forget
to like the video and don't forget to
sign up on my forum and all that other
stuff so thank you guys and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
