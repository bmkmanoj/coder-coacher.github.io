here and welcome to tutorial number 13
and in this tutorial we are moving on
from setting up our website template and
we're actually gonna start coding or
building our website header so I've gone
ahead and take that task off and let's
take a look at what we've got set up so
far so we're just like primary button
setup and what I'd like to do is
actually remove that so let's jump over
to our text editor and let's remove that
link so let's save this now and just to
make everything look a little bit tidy
what I'm gonna do is close my header the
code is still there it's just minimized
so that it looks a little bit more tidy
for my video and what I'd like to do now
is also just create a comment here and
let's say start the header and I'm also
going to leave a comment slightly
further down the page to say and of the
header right and now we can start
building the header for our website now
fortunately because we're using uikit a
lot of this is already going to be set
up for us so all I need to do is go over
to UI kits documentation and under
navbar I can get some of the code for
our navbar over here so pretty much all
of the code has been set up for us in
this section but I think if we scroll a
little bit further down we might be able
to find one with a brand so basically
with our logo and then some links and
then the buttons so see if we can find
one that looks exactly like that
not really well I mean this is more or
less what we're looking for here so I
think what I'm going to do is grab all
of that code and the reason why I'm
grabbing this one is because we can have
our brand we can have some links and
then we can also have this little you
can see there the last line of this is a
toggle button so that's going to be this
little toggle button that's in the nav
over there right so I'm going to copy
all of that and let's paste that
in for our heading and then I'm just
gonna indent that to look like it should
look and yeah we've pretty much got
everything set up so in our brands
section we're gonna have to put in our
logo in our list over here we're gonna
have to put in our mm okay yeah so this
makes a lot of sense so in our list over
here we're gonna have to put in our
links then we've also got some nav bar
content which I don't think we're gonna
be working with so I can just remove
that one and then we've got UK nav bar
content Center which is something that I
don't think I'm going to be using right
now so let's just comment this out but
it is going to be useful for mobile
later so let's just let's just keep that
there and the reason why it's going to
be useful for later is if I take a look
at my design and I go over to the mobile
side of things I have a scented logo
yeah right so basically I want my logo
to be in the center later on and I think
when I do that or when I set that up I'm
gonna put that logo here but for now my
desktop side of things I want to put my
logo here now you can see that I've got
my nav gar mine mine Ave gah
come on Quintin navbar list set up here
but I haven't actually got any list
items set up inside of this nav bar so
let's go ahead and get some list items
set up here and what I want to do for
that is go back over to this nav bar
page scroll up and essentially just copy
everything that's in here but only in
the unordered list that I want the nav
item outside of that and I can go ahead
and paste those in here so that's kind
of gonna set up my nav bar for me
right and what I'd like to do is maybe
just add in some links so if I go over
to my home page you can see that I've
got
or my design sorry I've got my home link
my about page my services and my contact
link so let's let's just add all of
those in here so home about services and
I need one more so let's copy this list
item down and turn that into a contact
link now services might have some
children in future but I think for now
and especially in my design I haven't
really accommodated that as a setting or
I haven't really accommodated that in my
design so I'm gonna go ahead and just
remove this parent class but we can
always add it back in later so let's
save this and if I jump back over to my
browser and I take take a look at our
website now and I hit refresh you can
see there we go I kind of have a website
almost set up so it causes a little
toggle button that's that's also going
to be useful for mobile later so we
pretty don't need to be looking at that
right now and we also need to add in our
logo so I think what I'm going to do
here is jump over to finder and I'm
gonna go back to the root directory of
my website so there's my index file and
what I'd like to do is create a new
folder here and we'll call that images
and in the images folder I'm gonna put
in a logo so I kind of already have that
prepared somewhere I think it's in my
tutorials under resources there's logo
dot a I do you think I have it as an SVG
hmm oh you know why it's an i I because
I think if I open this up in Adobe
Illustrator and I guess I'm just gonna
skip all of this stuff what I'd like to
do here is use this as an SVG so if I go
a file and then I say save as it doesn't
really matter where I save it I'm not
actually gonna be using this so let's
just click Save okay I can replace it
whatever
what I'd like to do here obscene
let's go file again save as what I'd
like to do is not save this as an AI
file but as an SVG file so let's hit
save and now with all of these settings
exactly as they are so make sure if your
settings are not the same as mine that
you make them exactly the same as mine
click the SVG code button and that's
going to give you code that you can use
as an SVG for the logo right and if I
come back over to my browser I can then
paste all of that in here in this link
and right now that's quite a lot of code
so let me just indent this and make that
look a little bit better I think we just
get that spacing right and then also get
that spacing right what I don't need is
this style tag so I'm going to remove
all that I'm also going to remove
everything to do with linear gradient
because I'm not using any gradient on
that but we do want all the polygons and
so on and so forth so let's that's
interesting okay I think I think I might
format for my logo here just need to go
object expand expand and then again
object expand okay now the reason why
I'm doing that is you can see there's an
L and then for some reason there's a
whole bunch of space and there's a Inc
so I don't think that this is going to
work out very well for me so I'm not
going to invest my time into that I
think I'm just going to get the code
again so let's go file save as try to
turn this into an SVG save again and
then get my SVG code
copy that again and paste that into here
now again I don't need anything to do
with the linear gradient so I'm gonna
remove all of that I don't need anything
in the style tags I'm gonna get rid of
all of that and just tidy up my code a
little bit I also don't need this style
tag
right so now I kind of have my logo in
SVG form in my header but that kind of
takes up a lot of space so I'm just
gonna close that and if I save this now
and jump back over to my browser and
refresh you can see that this logo is
absolutely massive right now so what we
need to do is just fix that up somewhat
so if I come back here and just change
the height to 80 pixels at max I think
actually 60 and then I don't know what
we're gonna have to do for the height
maybe about 100
that should kind of fix fix a little bit
so there we go now I have my lower kind
of setup it is a little bit difficult to
see where my navbar ends right now so
what we can do just as a placeholder is
underneath my nav create a block so I'm
gonna just create a div here and we can
give this a class of UK - block and then
UK - block - secondary and then just put
some text in here doesn't really matter
what it is but that's just going to
allow us to tell the difference between
our navbar which is up here and where
that navbar ends and where the content
starts because our nav bar is white so
it's kind of difficult to tell the
difference between our nav bar and just
a blank space right now right so an app
bar has kind of kind of set up we still
have this little thing that we need to
get rid of and what I'd like to do is if
I look at my design you can see that
everything is supposed to be centered
right so my nav bar should be centered
in the same container that everything
else has been centered in so to do that
I'm gonna jump back over to my text
editor and I guess now we can hide my
logo that's here and what I'd like to do
is take all of the content that is
currently inside of my header and we'll
just indent that one and then create
another div here take that ending div
tag and paste that just above the ending
nav tag and I want to give this div a
class all right and the class that I'm
gonna give it is UK - container and then
I want to give it a secondary class
which is UK - container
- Center okay so without this center
class basically you land up having a
container that isn't scented I don't
know why UIKit actually did it this way
I guess it's just nice if you're trying
to have a container but you don't really
want it centered but yeah if you do want
to send it container then it's you have
to add two classes right now we can go
back over to the browser and my
navigation has been scented but we've
still got this kind of this thing that I
think we're not really gonna be using
right now but we are gonna use it when
we start setting up our mobile header so
I think what we can do here is just take
that comment and pull it down cuz all of
this stuff is going to be nice for our
mobile hitter but not so nice for our
desktop header so if we save this up
desktop header has been pretty much set
up correctly okay so looking at my head
and now I can see that compared to our
design it is pretty similar although if
I go ahead and hide my guides here I am
missing the content along the basically
right hand side or right top corner of
my nav so in order to add that in let's
go over to Google Chrome and let's take
a look at the nav bar component again
and here you can see we've got flips
navigation at the end of our
bomb so in order to add that in we're
gonna have to just copy this whole div
section that's here and basically it's
got this class UK navbar flip and UK in
their bond map so we want to take all of
that stuff and we just want to paste
that in after this navbar
so let's paste that in here get this
settings all correct and now we want to
add in three links so we've got one two
three and I want to add in icons for
each one of these so let's just wait
let's just end off the icon and add in
an icon and we need to give that a class
of UK - icon and I think if we take a
look at my design
I use the Twitter icon the Facebook icon
and the YouTube play icon so to get all
of those we can look at the UI kids
documentation so I think there is an
icon icon section here somewhere might
be in the menu a common icon right and
now to get the basically UI kit has a
font awesome built in so to get the
Facebook icon all we need to do is type
in UK icon - Facebook for the Facebook
icon UK icon - Twitter for the Twitter
icon and so forth so let's go you can
icon - - Twitter and let's copy that
entire icon make sure that I don't have
any unnecessary smaller than and greater
than signs and paste all of these in
here so you can I can't wit ur UK icon
Facebook and UK icon YouTube - play and
that is gonna give me the content to the
right hand side of my nav so all of
those have been
setup correctly as well and now if I
have to compare my desktop design in
Photoshop to my design in Google Chrome
I think we're pretty much set up here so
