here and welcome back to tutorial number
29 and in this tutorial I am gonna speak
to you guys about something called an
associative array now an associative
array is basically an array that instead
of using an index number between the
square brackets so remember we always
use these square brackets at the end of
our reign aim instead of using an index
number like 0 or 1 or 2 we can actually
use a name inside of here instead so
let's say for example that I had an
array called debts and this was okay so
let's just say it's an array but this
was basically a list of money that
people owed me or amounts of money
rather okay so then I could go ahead and
I could set this first value to 150 and
the second one we can put as 2195 the
third one we'll just put as $0.99 okay
now I can very clearly see that someone
owes me 150 in fact I can see that the
person in debts zero owes me a hundred
and fifty dollars but who the heck is
the person in 150 okay or the person in
debt zero I have no clue okay so it's
obviously better for me to use an
associative array to associate a name
with this value okay and the way I can
do that is obviously because my name is
going to be a string it has to be in
quotation marks and I can give the value
or the name Ryan to this value and the
way I associate this name to this value
is I just go ahead and I add in this
equal sign and the smaller than sign
okay so this means that my first element
in my array
is now element Ryan or index Orion again
I can continue with this pattern so Kyle
can be person number two and he owes me
20 195 and the last one I can sit equal
to Sean and he can owe me 99 cents okay
now if I ever wanted to work with one of
these values again I can't go ahead and
use index numbers anymore
so if I try and echo out a debts zero
okay so just make sure you save that and
then come back here and click refresh
you can see I've got an undefined offset
zero so that means that this index of
zero that I'm looking to print out here
no longer exists and that's because
we're not using index numbers anymore we
are using these associative names so if
I wanted to find out how much money
Ryan owed me then I'd go ahead and print
out Ryan or debts Ryan and this would
give me the 150 that Ryan owes to me so
150 again I could go ahead and print out
debts Kyle and that would give me the
amount of money that Kyle owes me but
just make sure that you're using the
same cases over here so in other words
Ryan has a uppercase R Kyle as up an
uppercase R these are case sensitive so
you're gonna have to use epically
uppercase K for Kyle again then I say
Kyle has a uppercase R I think I meant
to say colors uppercase K not car but
yeah okay so that's basically how you
use an associative array and that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this video but if you guys liked the
