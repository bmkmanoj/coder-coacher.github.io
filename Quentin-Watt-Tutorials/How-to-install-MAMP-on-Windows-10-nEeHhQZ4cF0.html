here and welcome to this tutorial and in
this video I'm going to show you how to
download and install map on your Windows
computer now let me start off by
answering the question what does mam do
and why do I even want it on my computer
so those are technically two questions
but basically what map does is simulate
a server environment so it gives us
access to things that we wouldn't
normally have on our computer but we
would have access to on a server so we
can run PHP code we have access to
something called phpMyAdmin which lets
us create and manage databases for our
website and there's a whole bunch of
other cool stuff that mam comes with and
why do you want it on your computer well
you're going to need it to follow along
with most of my tutorials but you're
going to need it especially to run
WordPress and Joomla or any PHP code
really so go over to maps website which
is map info and I will leave a link in
the description then if you have some
unanswered questions about MAMP
there are there's a whole bunch of
information on the home page so you can
see that map stands for my Apache my
sequel and PHP it's available for
Windows and Mac and you can see some
stuff some general information or some
information about my sequel and PHP if
if you need to read up about that but
I'm just going to scroll all the way
back up to the top again and I'm going
to hit download and that is going to
take me to the downloads page and I can
choose my OS whether it be Mac OS or
Windows and then hit download and that
is going to download a version of map
now I already have it downloaded so I'm
not going to download it again because
that's going to waste my internet and
it's going to take some time because
it's about 300 Meg's
so let me go ahead and view my downloads
and I can see that I've already got map
downloaded I'm just going to open up
that file which is in my downloads
folder and then I'm going to double
click on it to run the install now I've
got a question here do I want to allow
this to make changes to my computer I'm
going to hit yes English and you know
this is kind of running an installation
I guess most of you can do it but I'm
going to hit next and then I've got an
option here if I want to install map pro
with map so mam is a free version of the
software but mam pro has some extra
features that you might have to pay for
in the future I think when you install
mem Pro this is just the trial version
and I'm just going to hit next then
you've got to read and agree to the
License Agreement so that was a good
read and I'm going to go ahead and hit
next and this part you really need to
pay attention to because this is telling
you where you're going to save or when
you're going to install map onto your
computer so in this case it is the C
Drive and then a folder called mam
now for most of you guys it's going to
be the same so I'm just going to go
ahead and hit next and then I'm going to
hit next again because that's just about
the taskbar and do I want to create a
desktop icon I think so so let's hit
next and then I'm going to run the
install now this is probably going to
take two to three minutes so I'll come
back to you when it's done okay so the
installation is now complete and I can
hit the finish button so I'm going to go
ahead and do that and now if I go back
over to my desktop if I minimize all
these things I've got a map shortcut on
my computer so I'm going to go ahead and
double click on this and it is going to
open up map and I'm gonna get an error
so as you can see the error says Apache
needs port 80 which is already being
used by another service or application
now for the most part I think Skype
blocks port 80 I'm not sure what other
programs do but I don't even have Skype
open on my computer right now and
something's blocking it so to get around
this problem I'm just going to hit okay
good preferences
and then go over to ports and I'm going
to click this button that says set map
ports to default so click on that and
now the Apache port should be quadruple
8 and the my sequel port should be
triple 8 &amp;amp; a 9 go ahead and hit OK I
don't want to say 8 8 8 8 8 and then you
can see I've got this error popping up
again I have no idea why it does it
after you've already changed the port
but go ahead and close that and then
close map and then open map again and
this time it is going to try and open
map on the new ports and you shouldn't
have a problem so there we've got Apache
running and now we've got my sequel
server running so we're not using port
80 anymore and we don't have that
blocked port issue anymore which is good
now let's go over and open up the start
page or the web start page and this is
going to open up map on your computer so
if you take a look at the URL this is
localhost quadruple 8 so I know I'm on
my local computer and over here I can
see some information about my
installation of map so if I take a look
at PHP info if I click on this it's
going to give me some information about
my PHP version so we are running on my
computer which is Windows 8 premium no
this is Windows 10 well and we're
running PHP version 7 but I'm just going
to go back and you can also see some
information about my sequel so if I
click on well yeah if I click on PHP
myadmin I can go through to a program or
software called phpMyAdmin and if you
guys don't know about that then don't
worry about it we'll talk about it in a
future video then I've also got some
information that I might need especially
if you're installing
press you're going to need to know that
this is on our localhost and that the
username and the password for accessing
our database is root and root and yeah
that's pretty much all the information
we need to see on the site but now let's
take a look at our root directory so
this is where all of our web files go on
our server so I'm going to get rid of
this word map in the URL and we're just
going to go over to localhost quadruple
eight and that's going to take me
through to my root directory on my
server and right now you can see it is
blank we've got index off and nothing
because there are no files on our Reed
directory but let me go ahead and show
you where to find this root directory if
we go over to my Windows Explorer and
then I go over to local disk C and I go
over to map this is why you had to pay
attention to where you're installing map
on your computer and then I go over to
htdocs this is our root directory so
right now it is blank but any files we
install or place into this folder are
going to show up when we visit our
localhost so just to prove my point
let's create a new text file or new text
document and I'm going to call this
index dot HTML and yes and now if I go
ahead and edit this in notepad plus plus
and I just type in something like hello
there and hit save
now this is not a valid HTML document
but it should still show the writing so
hello there so now that you know where
to place all of your files I'm going to
end the video off here and you can
