here and welcome to tutorial number two
in my PrestaShop series and in this
video I am going to show you guys how to
actually install PrestaShop so we're
going to take a look at the cloud
version and we're also going to take a
look at the download version because as
I mentioned in the previous video there
are two different versions of PrestaShop
so yeah if we take a look at my screen
over here you can see that I have got to
press the shops website open which is
PrestaShop comm and if i take a look at
the top corner over here i'm already
logged in as Quinton if you're not
logged in don't worry you can go ahead
and still click on this button and then
it's going to make you or ask you to
create an account so I'm just going to
go ahead now and click on cloud and
we'll take a look at how to install this
cloud version so go ahead and click that
and because I'm logged in it's just
asking me for a store name but if I
wasn't logged in it would also be asking
me for an email address so I'm just
going to fill in a store name and you
can see that I've had a few practice
runs over here but I'm going to go with
the best store ever because of course
it's made by me so it's going to be the
most amazing store in the world
maybe not but yeah you get the point
let's go so go ahead and hit start my
online store and that's going to take a
little while to load a few things it's
going to create a database and
essentially set up your entire store and
once that is done it's going to ask you
for some more information so store URL
what would you like your store URL to be
well I'm going to go the best store ever
dot PS webshop com now if you guys are
unhappy with this URL and you still want
to use the cloud version you can change
this later it's not like it's set in
stone once you've done this no you can
actually buy a domain as in
the best or ever calm if that domain is
still available you can buy that and
then you can use that instead okay where
are you based is the next question and I
am in South Africa so I'll just go ahead
and leave that as it is tell us more
about you well I am just trying
PrestaShop out and most of you guys if
this is the first time you've heard
about PrestaShop are probably trying it
out as well so let's go ahead and say
next and that's going to take a little
while to load because I have slow
internet again but woo I actually use
this subdomain before so let's just say
the best store and let's try that and
again probably just going to have to
wait for this to load cool so now I've
got my store pretty much set up
I just have to fill in some details
about myself and my name is Quintin
surname what password I'm not gonna say
that out loud but I will fill it in and
I gotta put the same thing in over here
and you can go ahead and tick this box
to say that you've read terms and
conditions but you really should also go
ahead and open that in a new tab or
something and actually read it because
let's face it if you break the terms and
conditions over here you're actually
going to be held liable and it's not
something you really want to be in
trouble for so just go ahead and read
all of this stuff and once you're done
go ahead tick tick that box and say
create my online store and again it's
probably just going to take a few
moments to load I apologize for the slow
internet
cool and once that's loaded you will
probably receive an email which is going
to tell you to click on the link to
activate your store but if you already
had an account with PrestaShop like I
already had a plan account then I can
just go ahead and click on this button
over here and that's not going to appear
if you just created a new account you'll
have to actually check your emails so
let's go ahead and say enter my account
and again I'm going to take a little
harder load but once we're done we're
going to be taken through to my actual
store and I'll be able to click on the
link to manage the backend so here we
are
if I click on manage my store I can
actually go through to the backend of my
store and I can edit a few things and if
I click on visit my store so I'm just
going to open that in a new tab as well
then that's going to open up a tab where
I'll be able to see the front-end of my
store so basically what my store looks
like to customers and if we go over to
that right now you can see that this is
the front-end of my store and this is
press the shops default front end for
PrestaShop 1.6 so for this current
version and you can see that we're
actually we've actually got a lot of
dummy contents over here so we've got a
slider with some dummy content and
pictures of models and stuff we've also
got a few dummy prod products with just
women's clothing and I'll let you guys
take a look at the rest of the stuff but
I mean we've also got some dummy links
to Facebook and Twitter and Google+ etc
I've got a little newsletter
subscription box and all of that good
stuff so all of that is set up for you
and you just need to go ahead and change
all the dummy data and you'll have a
working shop so to change all of the
stuff let's take a look at logging in to
the backend so I got that link by
clicking on man
my store and that's what opens this tab
and yeah if I fill in my an email
address and my password I'll be able to
log in and I'll just remember that
password okay and that's going to take
me to my back office which you guys
probably saw in the previous video and
actually the first time we ever log in
to this back office there's a little
twirl that we can take just to kind of
see where everything is so as you can
see right here we have this big
billboard type thing that says take the
tour and get started with PrestaShop so
if you go ahead and say let's start it's
gonna show you how to customize your
shop add some products configure payment
gateways and choose your shipping
options so if you guys want to go ahead
and run through that tour you can go
ahead but I don't really want to do the
tour right now because I also want to
show you how to use PrestaShop load on a
the downloaded version and then I'd have
to run through this tour again and I
really don't want to do that alrighty so
now that we have actually set up a cloud
version of PrestaShop I also want to
show you guys how to set up a downloaded
version so I'm going to assume that if
you want to use the downloaded version
that you already have a little bit of
experience in working with a server or
in working with your localhost and I'm
going to show you guys exactly how to
just extract the files and run the
PrestaShop installation from there so
what you want to do is obviously go over
to press the shops website PrestaShop
comm and I'm already logged in and I can
manage my cloud store if I really wanted
to or I could click on this download
button over here and download a free
version of PrestaShop which I can then
upload to my server or I can set up on
my localhost on my computer and that's
actually what I'm going to be doing in
this video so I'm just going to set this
I've press the shop up on my local host
so go ahead and click that button
download press the shop and then you'll
land up with a zip file so if I go over
to find over here you can see that I've
got a zip file which I called PrestaShop
- dot zip and I can extract this file
now in the correct location so if you
guys are paying for hosting and you want
to unzip this file on your server then
basically you just need to unzip this
file into your root directory which if
you guys get ftp details for your server
when you get hosting it's basically the
the root directory is the directory
you're probably going to FTP straight
into 90% of the time but I'm working on
my localhost so I've got a program on my
computer called MAMP
which stands for Mac Apache MySQL and
PHP and this is just the program that
turns my Mac into a server so I can
build websites and run websites from my
computer I don't actually have to use it
on a server or set up my website on a
server but the only thing is when it's
on my local host like this I am the only
person that can access my website so
it's not going to be access by thousands
of people it's just going to be accessed
by me and whenever you're using a
program like MAMP you're going to have
an htdocs folder so if I go to
applications and I go to map there is my
htdocs folder and that is kind of where
I want to upload my files so here I've
got my zip file and I can go ahead and
just unzip that by clicking on it and
now I have a folder called PrestaShop -
and actually I want all of these folders
or all of these files inside of here to
be in my root directory so I don't want
them to like
want to go into PrestaShop too and then
into PrestaShop and then into all my
files I want to take all of these and I
just want to copy them all so I actually
want to cut them but I don't yeah
anyways let's just leave the original
somewhere if I paste them in my root
directory then that means that whenever
I go over to my local host root
directory I'm going to be able to go
straight into my shop so in this case
because I'm using map my local host or
to visit my local website is going to be
localhost colon and quadruple 8 so 4 8
and that should take me to the front end
of my site so let's go ahead and just
wait for this to load and there we go we
can run through the PrestaShop install
so I'm going to read through some of
this information bla bla bla and hit
next
ok and that's going to take a couple of
seconds to load again and then we've got
to go through the license agreements so
basically you need to read through all
of this stuff and just agree to press
the shops terms and conditions because
if you break any of these things you
could be held liable and you don't
really want to get into trouble for no
reason so just go ahead and read all of
that then hit next ok and now we can set
up our system compatibility and stuff or
slow information sorry
so store name I can go ahead and give
this a name like Quinton's store or the
best store ever whatever I want to call
it ok please choose your main activity
so what am i selling on my website and
I'm just going to say computer hardware
and software country we can go ahead and
select I am from South Africa why do
other we go South Africa
and time okay well I selected South
Africa it's not going to give me a time
selection because we only have one
timezone here okay your account so my
first name is Quintin my last name is
what my email address is Quintin at
Josie SATs comm that is the email
address I use a shop password is going
to be something and that's going to be
the same thing again go ahead and hit
next and that's all my information
filled in and now all I have to do is
configure the eShop so you can see that
PrestaShop is asking me for a place for
database details so since I'm using my
localhost
this is going to be localhost and even
if you were uploading this or setting up
PrestaShop on a paid server 99% of the
time you're probably going to be using a
database that is on your local server so
you can go ahead and type in localhost
over there database name and all of this
stuff I'll show you where to get so what
I need to do or what I've done is I
typed in localhost / : 8 8 8 slash PHP
my admin' and that takes me to
phpMyAdmin on my local server if you
were using a paid server you just need
to go ahead and log into PHP myadmin
over there and what you need to do is
create a database and then also create a
database user and all of that stuff ok
but and mam we already have a default
user and a default password so I'm going
to go ahead and create a database over
here and the databases I'm just going to
create a new database we'll call it
PrestaShop - and i'm gonna go ahead and
hit create and there we go i have my
database so i can go back here my
database name is PrestaShop - root is
the database login as yeah forum Oh
as far as I am aware its root password I
think is also root and table prefix we
can leave that as PS by default hit next
and hopefully fingers crossed this works
okay so there we go the database has
connected and PrestaShop is busy just
creating all its tables and once that's
done we should have PrestaShop installed
and working so we just got to give this
time to run and I'll get back to you
once that's done all right so I'm back
and PrestaShop has finished installing
so all of the databases or all of the
tables in the database have been created
and set up and what I can do now is
either choose to go to the back office
or to go to the front office of my shop
so I'm going to go ahead and I want to
open that in a new tab but for some
reason I cannot but it opens in a new
job anyway so just gonna head click on
all of those ok so this is the front end
of my store and it looks pretty much
exactly the same as the cloud version
because yeah same thing really and then
over here we have the back end which for
security reasons I have to delete the
install folder so that means I need to
go back over to my local host or to the
root directory of my website go find
this install folder and then just delete
it so let move that to trash and now
it's gone and if I hit refresh over here
again I can log in so
let's go why don't I say Quinn's Annette
Josie Tut's and I think that was the
same password doesn't look like it it
takes long to load but haha there we go
okay so now we have PrestaShop
downloaded and installed on my local
server and that is pretty much how to do
that so again we've got the option of
taking the two and getting started with
PrestaShop and we can get through all of
this stuff but I am going to leave all
of that stuff to be done in a future
video so that's all I have for you guys
in this video but don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like and share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
