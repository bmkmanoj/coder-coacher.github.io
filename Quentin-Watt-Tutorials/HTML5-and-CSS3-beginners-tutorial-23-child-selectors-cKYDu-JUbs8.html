here and welcome to tutorial number 23
and in this tutorial we are going to
continue talking about selectors in CSS
and I'm actually going to talk about the
child selectors specifically now if you
guys don't know what I mean by child
selector then basically I mean elements
inside of other elements okay so in
other words let's say I had a div over
here and let me just end this off and
then I had a paragraph inside of the
stuff so end of this paragraph and we'll
just say I'm basically like I have a
parent and then outside this div will
just say put in another paragraph and
this one can just say I don't have a
parent div and this one should actually
say I have a parent div okay and
basically what this means is that this
paragraph is a child of this div element
because basically this paragraph is
inside of that div likewise this
paragraph does not have a parent div
because it is not inside a div at all
okay you basically get the picture like
as long as you've got an element inside
of another element then that is its
parent so this paragraph has a parent
which is this div and this div has a
parent which is the body and this
paragraph has a parent it's the body but
it doesn't have a div as a parent okay
so now whenever I jump over to CSS and I
want to style these paragraphs and I
only wanted to style paragraphs inside
of the div then I could go ahead and do
that using a child select
and what I mean by child selector well I
don't know why I said that twice but
whenever you want to style with a child
selector you are going to type in the
parents name first so div and then P in
this case because our parents is the div
and then the child is the paragraph and
that's what we actually want to style so
if you want to go ahead and style with
the child selectors you're going to type
the parents name and then the actual
element that you want to style so let's
go ahead and turn all paragraphs inside
of a div read so I'm going to go ahead
and type in color red okay and and now
that I've done that if I run this in
Firefox I should get two paragraphs on
the screen there we go so one is red
because this has a parent div and this
one does not have a parent div so that
one did not turn red okay and the nice
thing about this is CSS whenever you're
styling will take the longer description
whenever you're trying to style an
element so because this div P is more
accurate than if I just styled with a P
or with a paragraph tag then it'll still
turn all of these paragraphs that are
inside of divs red even if I have
another styling rule that is set to turn
all paragraphs blue okay so let's go
back here and when I click refresh you
can see that it's turned all the normal
paragraphs blue but the paragraphs that
we'd still have a div as a parent will
still turn red because CSS like I said
will choose the more descriptive
of name or yeah basically this is more
accurate because it has the actual
parents name and then the the child's
name so you can go ahead and style that
way and another thing that I'd like to
mention though is if you are ever going
to have both of these paragraphs inside
of a div so let's say that you were
creating another div around this
paragraph then both of them now have a
parent div okay
so that means that if you wanted them to
be different colors you're going to have
to combine classes or IDs with the
actual child elements so let me show you
guys how to do that so I'll go ahead and
give this one a class of red and I'll
give the next one a class of blue so
just so that you go to blue and
basically now whenever I select class
red actually I think I'm going to give
this an ID of blue just to demonstrate
that you can do it with both ID and
class so whenever you want to select
children with a class then you can go
ahead and select your class of red then
select the elements that you want to
style so basically all paragraphs that
have a parent with the class red will
turn red and what do you know over here
we have a paragraph and it's got a
parent div that has the class red so
this one should still stay red and now
that I think about it if I go and
refresh nothing's actually going to
change so let's give this next class or
next ID a class of Yi green rather just
so that we actually get the
to change okay and basically if you want
to select with parents and children or
IDs with children with IDs as parents
there we go that's probably the better
explanation then you could go ahead and
just go hashtag and then put in the ID
so the ID was green and then select your
child element that you would like to
style which in this case is our
paragraph and now all paragraphs that
have a parent with the ID of green
should turn green so let's go ahead and
just change that
okay and well you know the second
paragraph over here has a div with a
parent out or has a parent --iv with the
ID of green so now when I hit go ahead
and click refresh I get my paragraph
turning green okay so that's pretty much
all I have for you guys in this tutorial
