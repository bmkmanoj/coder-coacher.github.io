here and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this video we are going to be
taking a look at the next task I have
set up for us in a sauna so jumping into
a sauna you can see I've ticked off
design a footage that's been done and
now we're gonna take a look at actually
designing a homepage slideshow so let's
jump over to my photoshop and basically
what I was thinking here was that we
have a slideshow take up the entire
height of our screen so basically these
photos are not going to be visible
they'll be much further down the page
but as the user lands on the page
they're just gonna see a big slideshow
with a really awesome image and then
some text just to complement that image
and basically what I want to do is keep
with my whole theme here so I've decided
to make this website link travel as in a
travel website and yeah I think if we
get a really awesome travel related
image or a bunch of images will make
that nice and full screen here on
desktop and then it's kind of just
standard whenever you're using a
slideshow on a website even if it's not
gonna be full screen on desktop it's
usually standard that it's full screen
on mobile because yeah basically if you
have a slideshow that's kind of only so
big on a desktop like only that height
once it goes over to a mobile phone you
have a lot less width to work with when
it comes to having text on that
slideshow and sometimes it's just not
very visible or it can't all be visible
so yeah it's kind of standard that if
we're gonna have a slideshow on our
desktop we'll have a full screen
slideshow and I'm a mobile phone as well
and I think I'm just gonna make it
fullscreen for both so in order to have
a really awesome slideshow we need some
really awesome images and I have a
pretty great free resource for you guys
so pixabay.com is where i get a lot of
free images from so I'll leave the link
in the video description below go ahead
and check out the websites and
what I'd like to do now is just search
for travel related images and hit search
and you can see here's the image that
I'm using for the thumbnail of all of my
videos and yeah there's a lot of really
great images here to be used so go ahead
and search for the ones that you'd like
to use and yeah download them so I've
already got a couple images downloaded
if I take a look at my finder here so
I've got some images that I think will
be awesome to use and what I'd like to
do now is just drag one of these down
into my project and use that as my
slideshow now I think what I need to do
here is also create another layer group
call it slideshow and throw that image
into there and then I'm going to hit
come on T + Shift + Alt and just scale
this image up to the size I'd like it to
be and now you can see we've got a few
little problems here because my image is
going over my header so I can kind of
quickly fix that by just throwing my
slideshow below the actual header layer
here and that sort of fixes the problem
but we still need to do a few more
things to fix this problem because yeah
right now my canvas is exactly the same
size as what a computer screen is gonna
be but basically I'm gonna be adding
more content to this website right I'm
not only going to be using this little
bit of content so I think what I'm gonna
need to do is lengthen my canvas a
little bit so in order to add a little
bit more extra height to my artboard on
my canvas over here I'm gonna have to
move over to this move tool hold that
down change my artboard and now I can
add some height to my canvas and what I
like to do is typically work with
screens so I know that 900 is the height
of one of my screens but I can actually
increase this to be a little bit more so
let's say 900 times by 2 would be 1800
right and now essentially that is one
screen size or one size of my screen
yeah you can see that this is the guide
where that screen ends but my image is
actually overlapping that a little bit
so to fix that problem I'm going to
create a layer mask so I'm gonna go over
to my slideshow here and basically
create a selection over my image so
let's select all of that with the Select
tool and basically just hit this little
button down here to create a layer mask
and that's gonna chop all the stuff that
I don't need off and yeah that's pretty
much my slideshow kind of setup but
there's obviously a few more things I
need to do here like maybe adding in
another image so let's grab another
image that would be really useful and I
think that little jetty is kind of an
interesting one so let's let's place
that and hit my move tool or use my move
tool to just position that where I like
it to be something like that and
essentially do the same thing here just
select all of this and create another
layer mask so that it's not overlapping
right
oopsie let's try and get that image
above the other one because I like this
image a lot more and I think what we
need to do here is just indicate in our
design that this is a little bit more of
a slideshow it might not be immediately
obvious
so if I jump over to UI kits website and
I look at the slideshow page you can see
that they indicate that a slideshow is a
slideshow by actually having these dot
Navs down here and then you've also got
the world navigation on the side menu
but those only appear as you hover over
it so I think just to kind of simulate
the dot nav here in Photoshop what I
will do is just create a circle so let's
move over to the ellipse tool and drag
out a
chuckles somewhere in the middle of our
document while holding shift and that's
going to make a perfect circle and just
change the color of that circle to white
right and let's try and Center that so
that should be good it does look a
little bit big right now so let's hit
come on T shift and alt and just scale
that down a little bit I think about 30
pixels of 35 pixels is actually the size
and then I'm just going to hit command J
and duplicate had a few times and then
move one of those circles out here and
move the other one of those circles out
to the other side right and then the two
circles on the outside I think what I
can do is just change the opacity to
about 60% so that one and that one
60% and yeah that looks very much like
that right so it's kind of clear or
evident that this is now a slide show
and yeah all we need to do is duplicate
this over to our iPhone screen so let's
move over to iPhone and yeah basically
I'm gonna do the exact same thing here
let's create a layer for slideshow and
put that in my iPhone canvass below the
header would be a good idea and again
we're gonna drag one of these images out
and onto the canvas and I'm just going
to hold down shift and alt and scale
that up to where we need it to be
keeping the image sense it because that
is the functionality that works or
that's how this kind of works in in UI
kit is if you're using one image that's
really really big when it comes to a
mobile phone it just kind of crops off
the sides and keeps the image centered
so as long as your
content of your images nice and in the
center it'll still look good so
basically you know don't try use an
image where the main content is all the
way here on the left cuz you're not
going to be able to see that on a mobile
phone so yeah that is our slideshow sort
of set up I guess we just need to go
over to bottom slideshow here and we can
hit come on J on all those dots and move
those dots up to our mobile phone design
and where are they now
hmm get our move tool here see right
there they are
okay and move those into position which
will be in the center of the screen and
towards the bottom right so again there
we go that's our slideshow set up in the
design of course we want those in the
right place yeah so our image needs to
be Oh oopsie
our image needs to be in the slideshow
layer and so do these dots let's just
throw them into that layer there we go
and so now we can hide and show our
slideshow and again I can do the exact
same thing to increase the height of my
slideshow of my screen for my iPhone
just go over to the iPhone canvas or
artboard change to the artboard tool and
times 667 by 2 so let's get my
calculator out here and 667 x 2 is 1 3 3
4 I kind of already knew that didn't I
so 1 3 3 4 and now we have basically 2
times the height of our iPhone screen
and this is where we will be putting the
rest of the content that we start
designing for our website right so now
we've got our slideshow kind of set up
but we need to do one more thing before
we actually end this off and that is to
actually add in some text and a call to
action
because you know it is a very pretty
image as the user shows up this is
pretty much all they will see everything
above this this red line and you know
it's nice to see this pretty picture but
it doesn't really say much about the
company so because this is a travel
website we should probably just try
guide them into something we're selling
like some travel packages and I think
that's exactly what I'll do here so
let's grab the text tool and drag out a
block across the sites make sure that it
kind of goes the full width of this
container and then I'm going to just
type something cheesy like YouTube your
next adventure awaits you know just
something cheesy that gets them to click
on the button that I'm gonna put
underneath this and yeah you'll notice
that I have chosen some text sizing here
so basically I've gone for the Roboto
font again which we're going to be using
all over the site I'm using light
instead of thin and we have a 252 pixel
font size as well as if I actually look
at my text settings here I need to
change the line height here to 64 and
yeah the way I'm actually getting these
sizes is if I go over to UI kids website
so if you look under the code tab and if
you look under base you can see the size
of what a normal heading one looks like
and if you right-click on us and inspect
elements the font size is around about
36 pixels with a line height of 42 and I
find that that is a little bit too small
for our slideshow we actually want to
have some bigger texture so if you go
over to UIKit and go to utility and then
scroll all the way down the page they do
talk about having a large heading by
just adding this text or this class UK
hitting large to your text and that
allows you
have a really big heading kind of like
this one and now what I'd like to do is
create a button underneath it that just
says view our packages or I don't know
the hell think of a word while I create
my button here so let's just drag out a
rectangle here and I think the sizing
for that can be a little bit confusing
because it might depend on the size of
the text that we have in here so let's
let's try and make this around 60 pixels
in height by around 200 in width and
yeah just try and get that centered
properly and pick a color so I think
what I'd like to do is go over to my
browser and I'm going to type in
material UI colors so this is a website
that I use sometimes to get some colors
and I think yeah what I'd like to do is
use this material blue so I'm not going
to be using UI kits standard standard
colors we will be opening up the
customizer and customizing some some
colors in UI kit to actually make use of
this blue so let's take that color and
bring that over here and actually use
that color oops
use that color for my button if I can
come on where usually when I click that
button I can use a color picker
paste alrighty so that's our blue setup
and I think what we need to do now is
just add in a little bit of text yes
let's drag out some text and maybe just
change our font size well I don't know
do you think I can use it as 52 pixels
we'll see and then I think I just need
to pick some some cheesy text here with
for the button as well so travel now as
the text I think might work quite well
so let's just increase the size of that
some and put that over our button and
yeah I definitely need to change the
size of this - let's try 36 pixels yeah
right
and I guess we can get the button button
sizing correct as well so let's just try
make that a little bit higher and a
little bit wider something like that
right okay so that is basically the
slideshow for our desktop setup and we
can basically move that text over and
put it here on our mobile phone so I
think what I'll do is just take those
two layers hit command J and try to drag
them up over to my iPhone canvas and
yeah they're a little bit lost right now
so let's put them in the slideshow Leia
and hit the move tool here see if I can
find that text where did it go
no okay that was the button okay I only
kept and copied the button over let's
try see if we can put the button there
and go back here and try get our text
tool as well so command J and try move
that over to our iPhone layer -
and position that correctly so yeah I
think for our phone it's gonna have to
be over multiple lines let's just adjust
this text tool to be the correct size
yeah your next adventure awaits boom no
way yep okay
cool right so I think that that looks
pretty good and yeah this is pretty much
the same functionality that is gonna
happen with UI kit is that once our
slideshow gets down to a mobile phone
screen it's still going to stay
fullscreen and the text is just gonna
start wrapping down and yeah we're gonna
have that exact same text like that
you're a next adventure awaits just
realize now I suppose to adventure in
correct but hey we'll leave it as it is
