here and I recently got the chance to
interview john sonmez from
simpleprogrammer.com and basically what
john does is he makes a whole bunch of
like career advice related videos so
he's got videos on topics ranging from
how do i come up with a profitable side
project idea to also what programming
languages should I learn and these are
all questions that he answers on his
channel so I decided to just throw a few
more questions at him in it in an
interview and we were gonna do a live
interview but because of the big time
difference it was either too early in
the morning for me or too late in the
evening for him we couldn't really find
a time that suited both of us so I
decided to record all of my questions
and send them over to him and he's
recorded all of his answers and sent
those back over to me and yeah I've
actually included a bunch of questions
that I got from you guys on Facebook and
I just hope you enjoy the interview hey
what's up john sonmez from
simpleprogrammer.com Thank You Quentin
it is an honor to be here on your
channel I have enjoyed your YouTube
videos and it I'm glad that we could we
could sync up to do this this little bit
of a collab here so as as Quentin said
I'm gonna answer some questions we're
doing sort of this long-distance
interview this disconnected interview
and I'm gonna answer some questions that
Quentin gave me I'll try to do my best
to to make it at least entertaining for
for all of you out there that are
watching Clinton's channel I appreciate
the opportunity here and it's pretty
cool to be you know to be on the channel
of someone who I admire and respect on
YouTube to be honest with you so so
first question here is so John just in
case I left anything out in my
introduction why don't you start off by
telling us a little bit about yourself
and why you started your channel so
about me gacho's so much what do I do
so you know basically I've been a
software developer for like 15 years and
I worked a whole range of different
companies and different positions lots
of different programming languages but
I've always had this heart for teaching
right no matter what job that I've been
at
I've always been teaching and you know I
started off teaching a lot of technical
courses I've done 55 courses actually on
all kinds of different technology in
languages for a company called
Pluralsight and while I was doing that
and did my blog and stuff
I eventually found that people were more
interested in some of the soft skills
type of stuff that I started doing on my
blog and and that there was no one doing
this and so I've always had a a sort of
I've always been involved and interested
in personal development I've done some
transformations in my life I've I've
seen the value of these things and I've
and I wanted to help other developers so
what I started doing and I realized no
one else was doing this was I started
focusing on the non-technical areas of
software developers lives all of these
things that we all have that are
important to us
you know from relationships to getting a
shape fitness to money and finance to
even career development and personal
development and mindset and all of these
things psychology philosophy all of
these things that are actually really
important to us that we tend to ignore
so that's you know that's kind of my
background and that's what I do now is I
teach software developers how to be cool
right how to live other parts of their
life have a really good life that's
that's really what my focus is and so
that I started the YouTube channel you
know initially just talking about career
stuff but I really wanted to hit on
these other areas especially when my
book soft skills came out and people
were very interested in the other areas
and the mindset in psychology and stuff
like that so the YouTube channel really
just became you know I'm sharing what
I'm learning on my journey in life and
trying to help you as much as I can and
so that's that says where where it came
from and I really love you to it I just
love the interaction I love being able
to talk with so many people and to build
answer questions and into document you
know my own progress in life John I'm
subscribed to your channel and I
noticed that you publish quite a lot of
videos lately and in some cases you
publish almost two a day how many videos
do you publish in a day / week and what
is your goal so that's interesting I do
I might goal I've got sort of a
management system for managing my work
and what I'm trying to do and accomplish
during the day and every day I have
record two YouTube videos now some days
I don't some days I do more but most of
the time I'm trying to hit that quarter
of at least two YouTube videos a day
so and there's a reason for this my goal
is you know it's sort of one of the
things that I believe in life one of my
strategies in life is that you should
like overshoot your goal what I mean by
that is like you should do things that
can't possibly fail that you're
absolutely going to hit your goal so one
of my goals was I wanted to have a
hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube
I've got maybe like 47,000 right now but
I figured that if someone has 2,000
videos on YouTube they're probably gonna
have a hundred thousand subscribers
they're probably gonna get there and so
my goal is to get 2,000 videos so I said
well what's the best way to do that
quickly well I probably needed to do
about two videos a day for about a year
and a half or two years and so that's
the plan that's what I'm doing
it'll I'll get there sooner but I always
try to do that I always try to you know
do way more than than what's expected I
read this really actually a really good
book that sort of echoes this philosophy
that I didn't realize that this guy has
a similar philosophy philosophy has mean
in terms of this is grant cardones book
the 10x rule it's a really good book I
recommend it but but yeah that's the
plan if to get to 2,000 videos get those
100,000 subscribers you know and and
we'll see where we go from there I'm not
sure but but yeah I do put out a lot of
videos definitely I like it it's fun to
you know what field is most of your
experience in web mobile apps or desktop
apps and what is the main language
you've used for coding these projects
okay so what field is most of your
coding experience in well let me put it
this way my most of my coding experience
is in C++ and C sharp I would say
done quite a bit of Java as well so it's
sort of hard to put put that it you know
I've done a wide range of things I
started out in my career specializing in
printer languages and doing working for
HP in Xerox and stuff like that so in
and I did a lot of you know firmware
type of you know hardcore kind of
back-end type of work so then I started
doing Web Apps probably midway through
my career I did a lot of web development
work so I was doing asp.net it was
c-sharp
you know C as soon as I started using
c-sharp that that definitely became
predominant and then I did a lot of
mobile apps towards the end of my my
career into my career well the end of my
software development grew myself really
writing code because I enjoyed mobile so
I did actually iOS development and I
actually used objective-c but I also use
xamarin and wrote apps and C sharp um I
did a lot of job I coach Java teams so
I've kind of been all around around the
block there you know my primary language
is like I said it was seeing C++ C sharp
Java I would say those are my strongest
ones but but I've used a lot of
different programming languages from
Perl Python you know like I said
objective-c you name it I've taught
courses on go when that first came out
on dart actually you know that didn't
turn out to be too useful but yeah there
you have it how did you get into
programming as a career did you go and
study for it or do you have what I like
to jokingly call a QBE
which stands for qualified by experience
I I studied some but I but I'm also QBE
mostly QBE
right qualified by experience so I went
to school I studied before I went to
school so I you know to make the long
story short I downloaded a mod I used to
play these multi-user dungeons they're
text-based versions of the EverQuest a
fear or wow let's go with Wow so some of
you are a little bit a little bit young
and so you haven't been around forever
quest and mods and stuff but look it up
there it's pretty interesting but
but anyway I started happy on that not
knowing what I was doing because I want
to create my own version so I kind of
learned see kind of taught myself
without any books or anything just
looking at the code and figure out what
it does and and then I took a class in
in school in college on Java and it
bored the hell out of me just I almost
gums quit being a programmer during this
summer I got this job at HP has a summer
job as a tester and I sort of moved up
and started actually doing some
development work on the printer
languages cuz I was interested and I
ended up not continuing school and just
continued just going on my career and my
career kind of took off from there
and I and I never looked back at end up
going back to get my degree through
correspondence school just to have it
but I self-taught myself from that point
forward learning C++ read just a ton of
books and really you know taught myself
and just worked really hard at every one
of my jobs and tried to like expand my
capabilities and roles and just do
whatever I could it could I get in there
and can I'd code could I do something
you know I was that was just kind of my
attitude and so that's that's how I got
into my programming career eventually
end up getting a you know real
development job and and from that once
you have one then it's much easier based
on your previous answer what is your
opinion on starting to become a
programmer do you think it's necessary
or would you even recommend getting a
degree you know I've talked about this a
few times I think the thing is like I
actually kind of recommend today coding
boot camps and the reason why is because
it's practical hands-on knowledge it's
focused right and and you're doing it
you know when you spread things out
sometimes you don't absorb as much
quickly there's there's an advantage to
like being focused for like 12 weeks on
one thing and working really hard on
that you're gonna just like get a lot of
experience like immersion is is what it
would what it is and there's some real
value to that you know so do I think you
should study or it were to recommend in
a degree you know there's a lot of
options for learning on your own
as well I mean there's companies like
Pluralsight lynda.com treehouse code
coding school there's free free coding
bootcamp comm there's like just a ton of
these places and
of course YouTube duh right here right
you're getting YouTube tutorials here
right there's tons of places where it's
either cheap or free to learn online and
so I think that you know well I'll say
this okay regardless of what you do your
education is your responsibility to
anything right you have to learn you
have to you have to teach yourself to
some degree it has to be you know your
your choice you can go to college and
get straight A's and get good grades and
not learn anything it's up to you you're
you're responsible for your own
education so regardless of what you
choose to do you still need to
self-educate to some degree even if you
were going to college you need to still
be going on YouTube or reading books or
going in and learning and teaching
yourself more than what they're going to
teach you in school so you still need to
self-educate so i think that you know i
would say starting to be a programmer
yes absolutely you've got to do it going
to college that's optional I think that
it depends you know there's what I'd
recommend is if you do go to college
don't spend a lot of money and go into
debt right it's not gonna be worth it
instead this is what I recommend to most
most people that say okay if you're
gonna go to college and I understand you
know that you might want to do this go
to Community College for two years or
three years if you can and then finish
up at a university and get your degree
and try to do it low price get a job
while you're going to school so you can
pay for things so you don't go into debt
just don't go into debt and get this
huge debt and think that that's gonna be
worth it it's gonna pay off when you get
your real job it's not gonna happen
right it's you this stuff is available
right there the value of college is not
as high as it used to be because back
you know if you go 20-30 years ago this
stuff wasn't all over the internet right
there wasn't highly available now you
can learn you can teach yourself but
having some kind of guided program can
help some people especially if you're
not self-motivated then college may help
you but you still are gonna have to go
and you're still gonna have to do it
yourself and still have to educate
yourself but I actually like coding boot
camps like I said I would if I were up
to me and I were learning today I would
go to a code I find a really good coding
boot camp I'd study my butt off before I
got there while I was there work as
as I could and then afterwards I would
go back and get some of the more
traditional computer science stuff maybe
even get a degree but but I'd get a job
as quickly as possible so I could
actually start start doing do you feel
that not having a degree can limit your
career opportunities of course it can it
definitely can because there's gonna be
more jobs that are going to require
degree but you only need one job at a
time so you know it depends right I mean
today if you can qualify if you can show
your skills if you've got experience if
you can show that you can write code
that you're good you're gonna find a job
as a developer if you if you're really
good you have less jobs available to you
because some people are going to say I
want a degree or I'm not gonna hire some
without a degree for this job and that's
just just how it is
so you got to choose but again you're
sacrificing for maybe five years of your
life and a lot of money is it worth it
or do you think you can in that time can
you make enough money can you overcome
that can you figure out other ways
that's what you know they're just that's
again why I start to point to the coding
bootcamp because I'm like well for 12
weeks and maybe ten grand or three
months and ten grand or whatever it you
know depending on the length that's the
same thing hahaha anyway you know
depending on the length of bootcamp it
could be worth it for you but but yeah
you're definitely gonna be living your
options if you don't have a degree you
could always go back and get one later -
something I get asked by my viewers
quite a lot is how much do I have to
know before I'm employable and I think
that's quite a tough question to ask
because like I can't guarantee anyone a
job and I think a lot of that also
depends on the person and what kind of
career they're trying to get into so it
is a bit of a tough question to answer
but I'd like to know what your advice is
on the subject how do upcoming
programmers know when they're employable
and what steps do you recommend that
they take to get a job so I'm writing a
book right now called tentatively called
the ultimate career guide for software
developers or they or the software
developers ultimate career guide I think
that sounds a little better and I
actually give him giving away free I'm
giving away for free on my blog on
simpleprogrammer.com you
sign up your email and stuff to continue
to get the chapters so I'm covering this
really in-depth but I'm gonna give kind
of a short answer here I'm saying that
because I don't want to give a very
shallow answer here and then you say
well you know John I also want to be
respectful of your time here because
this is I mean I've got a lot of
questions here and I'm I'm actually
answering them short I used to do like
14 15 minute videos so so this is kind
of short if you want more detailed stuff
for any of this stuff you can always
check out my channel I've got you know
like I said like points 200 zuv videos
almost a thousand videos now so anyway
so okay here's the thing if you're if
you're trying to get started do make
sure put creeps and projects create some
things like I always tell developers get
started by creating some apps and
putting in the App Store right if you
can develop apps and put them in the App
Store like let's say a few apps that's
gonna work for a portfolio for you and
and then you can go out and you can
start applying for jobs and you can
start showing them what you already have
you know as far as you know how do you
know when you're employable or what
what's up sheet should you take you know
this is tough right how do I get a job
how do I know how much how much do I
have to know before I'm employee well
nothing you can start you could get a
job if someone would give you the
opportunity the right opportunity you
could know nothing about programming and
take the job and sit down and pair
program and learn on the job and do it
so the reason why I say that is because
there's not gonna be a time when you're
ready right in much like life in life
you don't have this time when you're
suddenly great you're never ready to
have a kid you're never ready for you
know whatever happens you gotta do one
of the things you got to learn to do in
life is to dive in over your head to get
in over your head and then then that's
when you know you're real resources come
into plane and you figure out you become
you you have ingenuity you have to just
figure out what you have to do to get
things done and so it's the same thing
is getting a job as a programmer it's
like you try to try to be proficient
right or if you can write some apps if
you can you know if you can write an
application you can get a job right
that's that that's the thing is so so
I'm not saying that just go
why for jobs without knowing anything
but study right you know but study by
doing don't just read books go in write
applications and write as many as you
can and that's how you're gonna be
comfortable and you're not you're never
gonna know what all there's too much
focus down into two specific
technologies specific stack so that you
can apply for jobs and that and that
stack but you know start creating
applications start doing it and and
start coding and then the whole time as
soon as you as soon as you can write in
just a simple application
you know then go start applying for jobs
you might as well start applying and
getting rejected and learning and and
and as you're getting asked questions at
the interview and you're seeing you know
and they're looking at your experience
and you're seeing what you're lacking
take note of that and figure out what
are the areas you need to work on and
then work on that right and then go back
and apply for more jobs and get rejected
some more and then figure out you sue
them saying this is the process this is
what you have to do you're never gonna
be ready ready right and if you if you
think you are you're gonna be sorely
disappointed when you still don't get
the job and you know is it getting your
foot in the door is difficult so you
know just go ahead and like I said learn
but learn by doing and then go and just
start applying for jobs and what's the
worst that's gonna happen you're gonna
get rejected you're gonna get
information that's gonna help you to
come back and and figure out where your
gaps are and then learn it and then go
back out there again and apply again and
that's you know just keep on doing it
don't be afraid and don't feel like you
have to know at all every single job
I'll tell you this this maybe helped you
every single time I've ever taken in my
career including being an entrepreneur I
was not ready for it I did not feel I
was ready for it but when I got there I
figured it out within two weeks I felt
confident and easy just remember that
always take the job that you're not
ready for jump in just and go ahead
what's the worst that could happen right
is you you fail and you learn one thing
we're all you gonna do is make money I
see this in my interaction with my
viewers quite a lot finding a job is a
little bit tough but there are
alternative ways to make and money or to
earn an income without having to go and
work for somebody else how can I use my
skills as a developer to earn an income
if I can't find a full-time job great
question so first of all you can become
a freelancer again I talk I do a lot of
videos about this one of the important
things is to market yourself to build up
a personal brand and reputation like
Quinton has done here awesome job
creating a YouTube channel right I'm
sure that I mean he'll never have
problem finding a job again because he's
a guy who's giving out advice on YouTube
that actually creating valuable things
on YouTube right is so you know he'll be
able to find a job he could find
freelance work you know you can use your
programming skills as a freelancer but
you can also start your own business
right that's gonna be hard it's gonna be
a lot of work but you know anyone can
create a few apps and put them in the
App Store or create a small application
and try to sell that app the App Store
makes it easier because you don't have
to know all this marketing and stuff
you're not gonna make a huge amount of
money you know I've put some apps in the
App Store and and I've made some money
from them but but there's a lot of
different opportunities out there you
know consider being an entrepreneur
consider you know that that you could do
that it's gonna be hard it's it's not an
easy route it's much easier to find a
job I'll tell you that but if you're
willing to put in the time and the work
in the effort you can you can do it you
know and if you're willing to live on
less you know sometimes we think we need
to have these huge salaries but you
don't need that much to live on right
you know I can I could live on $2,000 a
month I could do it it wouldn't be the
most comfortable thing but I could do
that you know 2,000 US and and that
might be what it takes to become an
entrepreneur is to save up a bunch of
money and sacrifice and you know so
there's a lot of ways that you could you
could you could utilize these these
skills as an entrepreneur as a
freelancer you know if you didn't want
to get a traditional job one other
alternative to you is to get a regular
job and then on this side build your
side business that's what I did that's
how I got out of the rat race and got to
the point where I could be an
entrepreneur full time and I didn't have
to work for someone else
you know it's it's so much better than
just trying to make it try to build a
start-up without any experience if you
can get a job and then work on the side
so we've got some viewer questions here
I've asked my followers on Facebook to
send through a few questions
and most of the questions that came
through a very web focused seeing us my
tutorials are all in that category so
we're trying to answer some of these
questions I'm gonna go through with them
real quick here but I'm not gonna have
very many good answers for these since
I'm mostly fucking on those soft skills
gary ramirez wants to know what steps do
you take before beginning the
development process so gary what's up ty
taken before the big game development
process I think about how it's gonna end
I always think about the the I have the
end in mind what do I plan to do today
what do I think I can accomplish during
this time you know what are my
expectations I plan it out I plan out my
time I plan out how much time I'm gonna
spend you know writing code I try to be
as realistic as possible and you know as
far as the actual coding I tend to be a
tester of a development person so I'll
write up the test first I want to write
up whether are the requirements
sometimes I do it actually doing real
test-driven development sometimes I do
it in a mock test-driven development
where I'm actually just coming up with
the requirements and then writing the
code that's gonna make that that
happened in planning that out but I do a
lot of planning I believe it's important
to plan first before you do something I
just did that today before I did these
videos as I said okay what am I gonna do
today
Christopher Hugh wants to know which
programming languages and why that's a
pretty broad question which programming
languages and why if you're starting out
you know I like languages like Java or C
sharp personally or Python right though
I think those are really good starting
out languages because they're fairly
simple they will give you enough of an
of an understanding of general
programming concepts there's a lot of
help and support for those languages you
know and and they're gonna be very
valuable and useful in your career
they're gonna be widely applicable
there's a lot of different reasons to
choose other programming languages but
you know I'd say c-sharp Java Python
JavaScript of course you know if you're
doing web going but you have to know
JavaScript it you know there and there's
different levels of quota knowing
JavaScript really come on
wants to know Java or Python for web
development Oh top one today I think
gosh I don't know
I think Python you know I don't know
this I haven't been too involved in that
too much but but Python just seems to be
faster a little bit to learn to get up
to speed on there's a lot of new stuff
being developed in Python I think I
think Python is is pretty good I mean
either one is is good but the consider
c-sharp though to write that time I like
you if I'm pronouncing that correctly
wants to know do you use bootstrap I I
did use bootstrap in the past I'm
currently not doing development like I
said but but I would use bootstrap if I
was I think it's it's a great a lot of
developers I always get this question
about design and a lot of developers are
not good designers but bootstrap makes
it easy to have something that looks
good so you can feel good about it you
know you can write all this good code
and if it doesn't look good at all
sometimes it's um you you know I mean
it's like you feel bad like you haven't
created something and people do look at
first impression so bootstrap is a real
good way for you to not have design
skills and being able to create
something that actually looks really
good to start off especially if you're
creating a new a mock-up for something
or you're you know creating a startup or
something like that all right so that is
the end of the interview I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I want to send a huge
thanks to John for doing this video with
me and to all of you viewers who have
more questions like this check out
John's channel because these are the
types of questions he answers on a daily
basis if there are any questions that he
hasn't got answered for you then you
know follow him on social media tell him
that I sent you
and ask him these questions and maybe
you will even be in a future video of
his so that is all I have for you
I'm going to end the video off with
John's thank you message make sure to
click on the annotation check out his
channel and tell him that I sent you
thanks for for for giving me the time to
do this interview really appreciate it
hopefully I've answered your question
it's like I said I try to do this really
quick and we're still like 25 minutes
but you know I do do long long video
answers on my channel there's a lot to
cover here there's a lot of good
questions so anyway I think probably a
real interview would be like an hour so
maybe I did maybe I didn't maybe this is
quick enough so anyway I think Quinton
will probably fill you in but obviously
you can check out my my channel simple
programmer you know I'd appreciate it if
you if you subscribe if you'd like you
know the kind of the the non technical
side of software development you know
definitely come and check it out and be
happy to answer your questions there as
well thanks again and you know Thank You
