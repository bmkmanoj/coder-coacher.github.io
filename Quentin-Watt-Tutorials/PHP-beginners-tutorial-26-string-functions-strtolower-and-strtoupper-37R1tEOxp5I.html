here and welcome back to tutorial number
26 and in this tutorial I am gonna speak
to you guys about the string to upper
and string to lower functions in PHP now
these functions are actually really
simple and they do pretty much exactly
what the name implies
okay string to upper converts every
single character in a string to
uppercase and then string to lower
obviously converts every single
character in the string to lowercase
okay so I've got some code here from the
previous tutorial and I actually just
commented these two lines out so that
they don't do anything for now but we
will come back and use these later okay
but for now we've got a string over here
it's called apples and I'm gonna show
you guys how to convert this entire
string to uppercase
so all you have to do is obviously type
in the function name which is string two
app' and obviously our parentheses and
in here all we need to do is put in one
argument and that is the string that we
want to convert to uppercase so there we
go we are converting the string of
apples okay so let's go ahead and just
actually echo that out so when we save
this now and refresh us in Firefox you
can see that even though over here it's
all been typed in lowercase
with the exception of this if it's all
printed out in uppercase of here okay so
that's because of that variable and
again if I use this as string to lower
and we actually make some of this
capital or uppercase so we'll make the
word new uppercase now when we save this
and
click refresh you can see everything is
lowercase even the word noob which we
converted to uppercase ourselves over
here ok so now that we know that we can
use these string to upper and string to
lower functions to make text either
uppercase or lowercase now we can
actually get back to what we were doing
in the previous tutorial and that was
trying to filter out a few curse words
or make-believe curse words really
because fudge is not actually a curse
word I just didn't want to swear ok so
I'm gonna go ahead and just remove all
of this and get exactly to what we were
like in the previous tutorial ok so
we've got this string here fudge you
noob and fudge this and fudge that okay
and we were looking for the word fudge
okay but I already showed you guys that
this doesn't work when there is a
capital F in the word fudge okay
because we're looking for a small F and
if we went in head and change this to
capital F and we went back here then it
wouldn't work for the other two fudges
okay so we need to try and make a way of
making this case sensitive and the best
solution to this really is just to make
another variable here so we'll call it
apples lower and then we'll just convert
string to lower okay so we'll just
convert apples to lowercase and then
when we use this over here we'll just
use the apples lower variable okay so
what we've done now is we've taken in
the string let's say it was taken in
from the user or something then we've
converted everything to lower okay
and then we've looked for the word fudge
in lowercase because now it's all gonna
be in lowercase and replaced it with
these Asterix symbols and then we just
went ahead and printed that out on the
screen so when we click refresh I made
an error because I forgot a semicolon
gotta watch out for those okay click
refresh and there we go we now have all
of the words fudge being censored okay
and that's probably the last tutorial on
string functions that I'm going to do
for the series for now okay but there
are actually tons of other string
functions that we didn't learn about so
if I go back to Firefox you just need to
go over to the PHP manual I'll leave a
link in the description of the video
below and all you guys have to do is go
over to that link and you'll see there's
a whole bunch of function names here
that you guys can use and if you go
ahead and click on one of those
functions there's also a nice
explanation of how to use it as well
okay so if you guys want to learn more
about string functions go over to the
PHP manual and you'll be able to take a
look at everything over there but for
now thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share the video it's
really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
