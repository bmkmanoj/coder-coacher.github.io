here and welcome to my very first video
in my jquery series and in this series
we're going to take a look at how to
make our websites a lot more interactive
using jQuery so to follow along with the
series you're going to need to know or
at least need to have a basic knowledge
of HTML and JavaScript and if you don't
know any HTML or JavaScript then I do
have a separate tutorial series on both
HTML and JavaScript that you guys can
watch and then come back and you will be
ready to follow along with the series so
first of all what is jQuery well jQuery
is a JavaScript library and what it
allows us to do is manipulate HTML in
our document and also add events and
even add animation to our web page
really easily so before we can use
jQuery the first thing we have to do is
actually download it and I'm going to go
over to jQuery comm so I'm going to open
up my browser over here and as you can
see I'm already at jQuery comm and how's
this for a cool demonstration of
something that jQuery will allow us to
do if I hover over this image you can
see it rotates 360 degrees and that's
pretty cool and that is something that
we're going to be able to do when we
learn how to use jQuery so I'm going to
click on this download button over here
and that's going to take me over to
jQuery comm slash download and this is
the download page where I can obviously
choose what version of HTML or version
of jQuery
I'd like to download and as you can see
in the paragraph below jQuery 2x
we can see that it doesn't support
Internet Explorer 6 7 or 8 and since
Internet Explorer 8 is relatively common
we recommend that you use version 1 so
we're not going to make use of version 2
for now we're actually going to just
keep with version 1 and I'm going to
click on this and as you can see we now
have this really weird mumbo-jumbo file
like it's not even readable but this is
actually compressed JavaScript so I
clicked on the compressed version of
jQuery and this is actually the
compressed file of jQuery in here and
I'm going to hit ctrl a and that is
going to select everything and then I'm
going to hit ctrl C and that's going to
copy all of this to my clipboard and if
I go back over to my text editor and
click file new I can paste that all in
here and this is going to be my jQuery
file so what I want to do now is
actually save this so I'm going to click
file and save as and make sure that you
keep note of where you are saving this
in my case I'm actually saving it in my
tutorial 1 folder next to my HTML file
and I'm actually going to create a
folder over here called Jes and that is
going to contain all of the JavaScript
that we're going to be writing over the
next couple tutorials so I'm going to go
into that folder and in here
I'm going to save my file as jQuery dot
J s and make sure that you're saving
this as a J s file otherwise it's not
going to work so I'm just going to hit
JavaScript over here from the drop-down
and now we have a JavaScript file so I'm
going to click Save and there we go
jQuery has been saved and we actually
not going to need to work in this at all
so I'm just going to click close and
that is jQuery done it's saved on our
computer now we actually have to add
that jQuery file onto our web page and
the way we're going to do that is by
opening up a source tag or a script tag
my bad
so script and I'm going to end this off
with ending script and this is going to
add that script file or that JavaScript
file to our web page so I'm going to
give this a type of text slash
JavaScript and then I'm also going to
give this a source of j/s slash jQuery
dot is and the source is obviously the
location of my JavaScript file and if I
actually just go ahead and say open over
here you can see that we've got my index
file here got the J's file here so we're
going down that folder and into this
jQuery file right there that's why we've
got j/s slash jQuery so I'm going to
click Save and now we actually have
added our jQuery to the web page with
that line of code right there and I'm
actually going to keep this line of code
at the bottom of my page so all of the
rest of my code is actually going to go
above this tag so now that we've
actually added jQuery to our web page
the first thing I want to do is actually
test to see if JavaScript is working and
then I also want to test to see if
jQuery is working so I'm going to add a
paragraph to my body over here and this
doesn't really need to say anything
important so we can just say hey there
what's up and that's our paragraph but
like I said doesn't need to say anything
too important and I really need to get
rid of this phone because that just made
a really loud vibration okay
so now what we need to do is add an
event to this paragraph so I'm going to
say
click and we're going to set this equal
to something so I'm going to say alert
and inside parentheses over here I'm
going to say I'm going to add two more
quotation marks these are going to be
single quotation marks as you can see
and I'm going to say this works and I'm
going to end that off with a semicolon
and this is actually a JavaScript
statement so when I click Save and I run
this in my browser let's go ahead and
run this in Firefox you can see when I
click on this I should get an alert box
that pops up and says this works
that means JavaScript is fine JavaScript
is working correctly and if this doesn't
happen
that means you either made a error when
you were typing this line or JavaScript
has been disabled in your browser and
you're going to have to fix that some
way I'm not sure how you're going to
have to fix that because you're going to
have to do some research into why it was
turned off in the first place now the
second thing we need to do is actually
test jQuery and so I'm going to delete
all of that stuff in this on-click event
handler and I'm going to add some jQuery
code and the first thing we're going to
do is add in a dollar then I'm going to
open up parentheses and close them and
I'm going to type the word this and
after that I'm going to add a full stop
and I'll type the word hide and I'm
going to follow that with some
parentheses and we're going to add in a
semicolon and what we're doing here is
we're actually selecting an element so
in jQuery we select elements by adding a
dollar and then some word in brackets
and in this case we want to select this
paragraph so we're typing the word this
but there are a few other selectors
which we will learn about later on in
the series and then we're going to or
what we've done in the second part here
is actually just added this function dot
hide and that is going to
hide the paragraph when we click on this
so let's click Save and let's go back
over to Firefox I'm going to click
refresh because of course we want our
new JavaScript code to be loaded and I'm
going to click on this and boom the
paragraph disappeared so that means that
jQuery is working and JavaScript is
working and we should be good to go with
the next few tutorials so I'll see you
guys next time don't forget to subscribe

or share this video it's really going to
help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
