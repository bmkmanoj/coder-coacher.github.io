here and this is tutorial number five
and in this tutorial we are gonna
continue looking at this audio player
and we're actually gonna be taking a
look at how to mute and unmute our audio
okay so if you guys can remember from
the last tutorial we left off having
this audio player over here which we
created and right now the only
functionality it has is to be able to
play and pause our contents or our audio
okay so I'm going to play and there we
go we've got our audio playing and I'm
gonna pause it and now it is paused and
the reason why I'm showing you guys this
is because our mute and unmute function
is pretty much gonna work with the same
kind of logic okay so whenever we click
on this mute button obviously we want
this buttons background image to change
to a speaker with an X just to say okay
this content has been muted then we're
also going to click on it again and it
needs to change back to this normal
speaker and in the process we're also
gonna have to mute and then unmute our
audio okay so it's pretty much the same
thing except instead of playing and
pausing content we're muting and
unmuting our content or audio okay so to
do this we're gonna grab this audio or
this mute button over here okay
so copy that and I'm going to create a
variable called mute button which is why
I copied that and then it's going to be
set equal to the mute button that is on
our page so I'm going to say
document.getelementbyid d and we're
gonna be grabbing the button with the ID
mute button okay so now we have a mute
button stored in the variable the first
thing we have to do is listen up to see
if this button has been clicked so to do
that we're going to add an event
listener onto this button so
it's pretty much the same thing as this
except we're gonna be calling a
different function so mute button dot
add event whoopsie add event listener
and we're going to listen if the button
has been clicked okay then we're going
to pause no we're going to mute or
unmute the content so mute or unmute
okay there we go finally so this is the
function that we're gonna call to mute
or unmute our audio and I haven't
created that yet so we still need to
create that but then the last argument
I'm gonna set equal to false and this is
pretty much always going to be false so
whenever you're working with an event
listener you can just go ahead and throw
false in there until I say otherwise but
for now the first argument is what
you're listening for so we're listening
for the click you could also put in
mouse over or Mouse out or something and
that'll check if the mouse leaves or
Mouse's over the actual button but you
know this is a button and we want them
to click it we don't just want them to
hover over it so we're listening for the
click okay mute or unmute is the
function that we want to call which I'm
gonna copy that now and we're gonna
create this function so function mute or
unmute and then we need to put in some
logic inside of this function so the
first thing we need to do is obviously
find out
has our track been muted because if this
audio has been muted
we need to unmute the audio otherwise
the only possible option for this audio
is that it is not already muted which in
that case we want to mute this audio so
we're gonna say if my track dot muted so
this is a property that we're able to
access
in JavaScript and basically what it does
is check if our track has been muted
okay so we're gonna say if that is true
in other words if it has been muted
then let's unmute our track so my track
dot muted and we'll set that equal to
false so that will unmute our audio
otherwise the only other option to this
if statement is that our track has to
already be not muted so it must be
audible already so we want to go ahead
and mute the track so we're gonna say my
track dot muted is equal to true and
that should mute our audio okay and we
can go ahead and test this now before we
work with our button so let me come back
here and we'll click refresh and I'm
gonna click play so the audio is playing
now it's muted now it's unmuted awesome
so now what we need to do is make sure
that we change this image to the muted
speaker and then back to the normal
speaker when it is unmuted so to do that
we're pretty much gonna be doing
something very similar to this where
we're just going to grab our play button
while we're actually not gonna be
grabbing the play button we're gonna be
grabbing the mute button so make sure
you're working with the mute button here
and we're going to be accessing the
styles of this mute button and we're
gonna change the background image from
the speaker well hmm if our track is
muted then unmuted so in other words put
the speaker back on so speaker okay
otherwise what we want to do is come
back here and I'm gonna grab the mute
button again style background image we
want to
give it the muted image okay so the
images that I'm talking about are these
images right here where I've got my
muted image and my speaker image okay
and they're basically in this file
called images and my code is over here
in this folder which is why I have this
URL or this file path which is dot dot
slash images muted ping or dot dot slash
images speaker dot ping okay so now that
we've spoken about that our mute button
should be working correctly so I'm gonna
play this content and I'm gonna mute it
and as you can see we now have a speaker
with a little X and when I unmuted we
now have a speaker with audio again so
this is really cool and yeah that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
