here and this is tutorial number 53 and
in this tutorial we are going to take a
look at how to make data persist in our
form okay so what I've got over here is
two text boxes and one submit button so
if we go over to Firefox and take a look
at that then you can see it's just two
text boxes one for the first name one
for the last name and a submit button to
submit everything afterwards okay
and if you guys don't know what I mean
by making data persist then you guys
will know from my form validation
tutorial or that short series on simple
form validation that whenever the user
tried to fill something in and we gave
an error then they'd have to refill the
entire form again because let's say I
fold in Quinton but I forgot to fill in
last name and I click submit and we gave
the user an error hey you didn't fill in
your last name
well now first names gone as well so
they have to refill their first name in
again and then their surname and so on
okay so yeah we're just going to try and
get rid of that so basically now
whenever the user falls in their first
name and click Submit we want that first
name to stay there instead of disappear
okay and to do that we're going to go
ahead and open up our PHP tags down here
in our form so I'm going to create some
PHP tags right over here PHP and I'm
actually going to end my PHP tags off
down there okay so we've got all these
elements in here looking rather funny at
the moment but I actually want to echo
them out so I'm going to go
here break down a line and type echo
open up some double quotes and then I'm
going to close off my double quotes down
here and end that off with a semicolon
so this could all be typed in one line
that's probably how you're used to
seeing an echo statement but it will
work just fine like this as well okay
and just make sure that if you're using
a double quote here that you're using
single quotes in the rest of your input
elements attributes otherwise you're
going to land up accidentally breaking
out of your string okay but the cool
thing about this is now that these
elements will be dynamic so we can
actually put in other values of you or
other attributes over here depending on
whether or not some of our PHP code
evaluates to true or false okay so what
I'm going to do here in these PHP tags
is check if the user has indeed entered
in or you're entered in the name and
then clicked submit
okay so if they try and submit this form
field blank
then they're actually going to have some
you know they can actually have going to
have submitted these values so these
values will be set so what we want to
try found out is if those values are set
or not okay so I'm going to use an if
statement here and I'm going to say if
open up my brackets my parentheses okay
and my curly braces and as my condition
I'm going to see I'm going to use
another function called is set okay and
this function will check if a value is
set so quite a cool name right there
very descriptive is set and now we want
to find out
if this first name has been set or if
our last name has been set okay so if is
set dollar underscore post first-name so
brackets nope those square brackets
there we go
first underscore name then we want to go
ahead and create a variable over here
called first underscore name and set
that equal to dollar underscore post
first-name so control-c control-v okay
so that's now checking if first-name has
been set then we're going to go ahead
and grab whatever value was set in first
name and go ahead and actually put that
in a variable okay but if first name
hasn't been set we still want to create
a blank value for first name so let's go
ahead and just say else if first name
hasn't been set let's still create this
first name variable but give it a blank
value and the reason why I'm doing this
is because over here in my input element
for first name I want to give this a
value okay and that is an actual HTML
attribute which will determine what is
typed in here
okay and we're going to go ahead and
throw in our variable okay so in other
words if first name hasn't been set then
we're just going to give first name a
blank value which will mean that our
form value is blank as long as this has
no value but as soon as we type in a
value like quinton then that Quinten
value is going to be stored in our
variable and print it out again
okay so let's go ahead and let's just
land on this page brand-new and fresh
tutorial 53 just like that type in my
name Quinton now and click Submit and as
you can see now that I've clicked submit
my name still stays there so it's not
going to disappear so we've successfully
made our first name persist now we need
to go ahead and just do the same thing
for our last name so we can actually go
ahead and just cheat and copy paste
because it's going to be quite similar I
just need to change all the references
to first name or from first name to last
name so last name and over here as well
last name and again over here last name
okay so basically now we're checking for
the last name in the same way that we
checked for our first name and we want
to also print this out in our last name
input element just give that a value
make sure to use single quotes and not
double quotes of dollar last underscore
name okay and let's go ahead and save
that now and we'll go ahead and type in
the word what over here that's my last
name
click Submit and as you can see last
name stays there or my surname what
stays there whenever I click Submit so
it's not disappearing okay and that's
pretty much it for making data persist
but we haven't actually validated the
form so we haven't actually checked if
there was an empty field or not and I
think what we're going to do over the
next tutorials or next few tutorials is
put everything that we've learned
together
make a much better way of validating our
forms okay so I'm going to go ahead and
end this video here but I hope I'll see
you guys in the next video so until then
