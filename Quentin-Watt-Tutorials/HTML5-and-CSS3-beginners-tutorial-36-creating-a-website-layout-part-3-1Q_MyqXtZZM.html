here and this is tutorial number 36 and
in this tutorial we are continuing our
mini-series on how to create a basic web
sites or website layout and this is part
3 so I'm going to scroll down here to my
side section because this is where we
left off in the previous video and this
is where we're going to start working
now so if you guys watch the previous
video then you will remember that we
created an article or we learned about
this article tag and created an article
inside of our main section of our
website
okay then we went ahead and gave that
article a heading or a header you know
some content and an actual footer and
explained how we can use all of this
stuff so we can do the same thing in the
aside section as well but this would be
somewhat less important content in fact
something that you might see in the
aside section a lot on quite a few
websites is social links so you might
have an article tag like this and ending
article or even a div tag so maybe let's
just use a div and ending div and in
here the user much or you as a designer
mark putting a heading two and an ending
heading two and in here type in
something like social links and actually
leave your Facebook and Twitter links
below so to do that let's actually
create an unordered list and ending an
ordered list and again Li and ending Li
and in here e to a to X okay so let's
just give that an edge riff of nothing
at the moment so it's blank and in here
a type in facebook
and compared to just duplicate this line
and type in Twitter and we might also
have other than the social links we
might also have like another article or
just related articles to this article
where you have like a heading just to
explain okay
this is the other article you know just
so the user can get interested and then
a paragraph just for the user to read to
see what that article is about and then
maybe a see more button you know to
click and actually read that story so
let's create an article tag here and
ending article and you know what I'm
actually going to wrap all of these up
in a div tag so let's just do that
opening the knock that in one and ending
div and in this article or in the still
rather at the top here we could create a
heading two again so ending heading two
and here's where you would say like
related articles or related stories or
something okay and then you can have an
article that was somewhat related to
this main article so the user could come
read this article and then go hey you
know there's another story over here let
me click on that and see what that's all
about so let's go ahead now and just add
in maybe a heading three and as the side
headings here okay and you know this can
be a heading for another story and below
that just a paragraph to get the user
interested so not the entire story but
just a paragraph to get the user
interested so get interested and click
below to
the more and beneath that we might have
a footer that will just contain a link
that says c-more so let's end that off
like that as a and you know href and we
won't take that anywhere but we might
say c-more and the user can click here
to read the full article and we can
actually divide this up even further
because like I said an article can have
a header and this is indeed our header
then we've got our paragraph which is
just to get the user interested in the
actual article and this is our footer
which contains a the c-more link so we
could go ahead and do something like
this create a footer there and end it
off there and again over here we could
do the same thing with the header okay
whoopsie-daisy there we go and ending
hitter and now if I save this hand we go
take a look at this in Firefox let's see
what we've got okay so we have our logo
our navigation which you know doesn't
really look like navigation at the
moment and we've got our main section
over here but underneath that what the
heck we've got our aside section
underneath the main section so it's not
actually appearing on the side just yet
and then we've also got our footer at
the bottom of the page okay so this
doesn't exactly look like a website just
yet but we do have all the content for
the makings of a good or a decent
website layout okay so in the next video
we are going to start using CSS to
actually get this logo appearing in the
right place get this navigation you know
maybe floated to the side here and
appearing next to the logo this article
can be centered
and the side side news or aside tag
should be appearing on the right-hand
side of the the browser sorry I got a
little bit confused a but yeah we'll get
that floating to the right-hand side of
the browser and we'll have our footer
you know just expand the entire browser
or something so I will see you guys in
the next video and until then do not
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share this video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
