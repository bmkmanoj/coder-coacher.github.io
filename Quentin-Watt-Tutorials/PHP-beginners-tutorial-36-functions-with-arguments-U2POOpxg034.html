here and welcome to tutorial number 36
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at how to use arguments with
a function this is also known as passing
data to a function or passing a value to
a function so you might have heard
people say it like that before okay now
if you guys ever want to make sure that
your function is going to use an
argument then you need to declare that
whenever you declare that function
you're going to need to include an
argument in the parentheses of your
function so in other words whenever you
create your function let's call my
function say hello then whenever you're
declaring this function you need to make
sure that you include an argument in the
parentheses now basically what this
argument over here does is tell PHP okay
listen whenever you guys want to call
this function later on this function
needs and arguments so if no arguments
is supplied you're going to have to give
an error and as you can see this
argument is actually a variable so
whenever you're using an argument it's
actually going to be a variable and the
reason why is because this argument
actually has to store a data so it's
basically a variable this is the
equivalent of making a new variable just
declaring an argument in a function so
now let's actually give my function
something to do and all I'm going to do
is actually echo out hello and then the
person's name so we'll just echo out
hello space and then append on our
variable name and append on a break tag
as well so let's just get that BR in
there
okay so now whenever this function is
called it's going to echo out hello plus
whichever value we pass to this function
so all that's left to do now is actually
call our function which is quite simple
we're just going to type in the function
name which is say hello
obviously have parentheses here and in
these parentheses this is where we're
going to put our arguments so let's just
see what happens if we don't supply an
argument okay so I'm just going to have
to go over to Firefox here click refresh
and as you can see when we don't use an
argument we've got this error over here
it says missing argument one for say
hello so obviously PHP knows that this
say hello function needs and arguments
so let's go ahead and supply one and
I'll just go ahead and give it an
arguments of a string which is my name
quinton so now when we go ahead and save
this what actually happens here when
this program runs is this value or this
string gets stored in this variable name
so it gets passed to the function and
stored in that variable name and then we
use that variable name inside of the
function obviously I'm just using it for
like a simple purpose I'm just echoing
it out with the word hello so let's go
back here and click refresh and as you
can see it says hello quinton so
hopefully this is starting to look a lot
more familiar to you guys you guys are
probably used to seeing us calling a
function now I mean you guys have worked
with me on the string functions and
array functions already so you guys know
that whenever we call a function we're
just going to type the function name
parenthesis with an argument inside so
the only new thing here really is that
we can actually see the code
dude behind our function and actually we
get to make our function work which is
obviously quite exciting and actually if
I go ahead and just close that function
let's pretend that that function just
doesn't exist and I create another
variable over here
called user so let's say I had a form on
my website and I was collecting data
from the user so I had a field where
they could put in their name or
something like that then let's just say
we would store that in the user variable
so they could put in their name Quinten
or let's actually use Jerrod that's my
brother's name then we could go ahead
and just throw that variable in here as
well so I could just go ahead and throw
in say hello user and now depending on
what this variable is we're going to
send that value through to our function
and then obviously our function prints
that name out so now when I go back to
Firefox and click refresh
you've got hello Jerrod so that's
actually all I have for you guys in this
video please have fun playing around and
making functions just get used to the
whole idea of that and I will see you
guys in the next video so thanks for
watching don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
or share the video it's really going to
help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
