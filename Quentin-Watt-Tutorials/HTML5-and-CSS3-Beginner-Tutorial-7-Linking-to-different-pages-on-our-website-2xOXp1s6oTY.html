to tutorial number seven in my HTML and
CSS series and in this tutorial we're
going to be working with links again
just because there's a few things about
links that I've got show you guys yet
that I still want to show you so if you
just go ahead and take it I look at our
code real quick you can see that we've
still got the exact same link that we
had in the previous tutorial which was
just a link to my youtube channel so if
we just go ahead and click that then we
get a link that takes us to my YouTube
channel and if I change this this H riff
here to HTTP wwu go calm then it
wouldn't be a link to my YouTube channel
anymore it would be a link to Google so
if we go ahead and click that we then go
to Google which is taking surprisingly
long okay there a there okay awesome and
yeah so that's how to link to other
websites but we went through all of that
in detail in the previous tutorial in
this tutorial I just want to show you
guys how to link to different pages on
your website so if you ever going to
write websites you're more than likely
going to have three or four pages at
least so you just want to be able to
make a link that links you between all
those pages so let's go ahead and learn
how to do that then and the first thing
we're going to do is I'm actually just
going to clear out this this link just
make it blank so there's no H riff and
I'll just go ahead and clear that out
and then click Save and obviously if
we're going to link between two or three
different pages on our website we need
to have those two or three different
pages so let's go ahead and just I'm
going to go new and I'm just going to
copy all the code that's here my index
dot HTML and paste it here and click
Save
okay now here's the important part um if
you're going to be able to link between
if you want to be able to link between
these two pages you're going to have to
save them in the same directory or the
same folder so as you can see I've got
my folder called tutorial seven links
again and inside there that's my
index.html file that we're working in a
moment ago now I'm going to go ahead and
just save this as something random like
page two dot HTML and don't forget to
change this to HTML wherever it is
hypertext markup language cool awesome
and now what we have is we have two HTML
pages with a link that's actually blank
and doesn't go anywhere so the first
thing I do is I just want to make some
headers so that we can see that there is
a difference between our two pages and
we are going from one page to another so
I just went ahead and made a header
there and in this header I'm just going
to type something around this is page
two so just a whole bunch of two's
should be fine
and over here we can make a header and
this is the home page so we might also
just call it home page exclamation mark
okay so now that we've made these two
headers and we know that we're going to
be jumping between different pages we
can go ahead and make our links so I'm
right now I'm on the home page so I'm
going to make a link to page two so I'm
just going to write a page two and in
page two I'm going to as the href or as
the reference all I have to do is write
in the name of this file over here so
that's the name page two dot HTML so I'm
just going to write page two dot HTML
and go back to this page now page two
and we'll might as well just make a link
to our
our homepage and as this.href we need to
obviously put the name of that folder so
index dot HTML so that's how you make a
link between two different pages you
just if there as long as they're in the
same folder on your web server on your
computer or something
then all you need to do is put in the
name of the file as the href and then
that should work so we can just go ahead
and run this in Firefox and I'll show it
to you real quick so here we are this is
page two ah there's just a whole bunch
of to users a header and if I click the
home page then there we go we on the
home page and if I click page two we go
back to page two so that's pretty cool
that's how you can make some sort of
navigation on your website going between
different pages anyways thanks for
watching guys and I will see you guys in
the next tutorial where we're probably
going over some more stuff about links
so yeah that's pretty cool see Ron thank
