here and in this video I'm gonna show
you guys how to back WordPress up and
move it over to a server the manual way
I do have a little bit of disclaimer
here because this is gonna be a little
bit of harder than the previous video so
hopefully you've watched the previous
video where I showed you guys how to do
this with a plug-in and hopefully you've
tried that method and everything worked
out this method is nice to know if you
guys want to continue with the video and
learn how to do it that's awesome but it
is also something that's and I'd say
it's almost a little bit of a last
resort when you can't use any other
plug-in and try this method because
there is a problem with URLs at the end
where you have to run some SQL queries
so you're gonna need to know or have a
little bit of knowledge with something
like SQL and you're gonna have to at
least be competent with moving files and
stuff you're gonna need to know a little
bit more it is a little bit more
advanced so let's take a look at how to
back WordPress up so I've got the
website open here in my browser but I
don't actually need to have the website
open what I want to do is grab all of
the website files
so let me jump back over to find up and
you can see I've got all of my files
open by the way I just want to throw
away that zip file the reason why I'm
doing that because I tried making this
tutorial a couple minutes ago and that
zip file is well part of my practice
when I was practicing what to say for
this video basically so now that I've
got my files on my computer open
I want to zip all of these files I don't
need to zip that that zipped file there
already by the way why is this not hello
okay yeah I don't want to select that
zip file but I'll select everything else
and what I want to do is compress or zip
all of these files so that's gonna run
my little compressor
and once that's done I should now have
all of my files in a zip file and I'm
going to just rename this to WP backup
Tots and well this is now all of my
files backed up in a zip file and I want
to copy this and paste it on on the
desktop by the way it pasted on the
other screen so I'm gonna have to just
move that over here where you can see it
by there we go
I've got WordPress backed up for this
tutorial now what I need to do is back
up the database because the files alone
are pretty much useless I need the
database for WordPress to actually work
so let me show you guys how to make a
backup of the database you could go over
to MySQL or PHP myadmin this way by
going to your web start page and then
clicking on the my SQL link over here
and that'll take you through to PHP
myadmin
but what I like to do because I don't
like to work in this little window is go
over to the URL and I'll go to localhost
and then I'll type in the address of PHP
my admin' and that'll take me to the PHP
myadmin screen where I've now got PHP
myadmin
open in the entire browser it's not just
stuck in that little window and then
I've got my database over here and this
is the database that I set up in the
first tutorial when I showed you guys
how to install WordPress or I think it
was the second tutorial so what I need
to do now is back up this database now
there just make sure when you are
backing up the database that you're
clicked on the database itself if you
click on one of these tables and you hit
export you're only going to export one
table that's gonna be annoying because
well it's not the entire database so
make sure you clicked on the actual
database like this and the entire
database is selected and you can see
all of the database tables then hit
export and if I hit custom and hit go
sometimes it doesn't always save the
file as an SQL file or sorry if I if I
leave it at quick sometimes it doesn't
save the file as an SQL file it like
throws out the text like this so I don't
want that I want to do a custom backup
I'm just going to make sure that all of
the tables are selected and then I'm
gonna hit save output to file and then
from here I'm gonna change absolutely
nothing else I mean you could play
around with some of these options if you
know what you're doing but if you don't
know what you're doing then don't and
then hit go so I'm gonna save the output
to a file and I'm gonna call this WP
demo is fine so it's just naming the
database the same thing that the
database was actually named let's hit
save and now that should have put
another file on my desktop so I've got
all of the WordPress files backed up in
a zip file and then I've got the
database backed up in an SQL file now
what I need to do is open up my live
server where I want to move all these
files and then upload these files to my
live server so I've got FTP access to my
live server and I'm just gonna open up
my my server so it is Josie Qualcomm
that I want to FTP into and I'm just
going to accept my certificate FTP into
the server and now I want to send let me
just hit refresh yeah okay that's up to
date I want to send only the zip files
to the server I'm not going to worry
about uploading the SQL file because I'm
gonna upload that a different way so I'm
gonna let this run for a few minutes and
I'll get back to you as soon as all of
the files have been uploaded to the
server
okay so the files should have finished
uploading by
let me hit refresh and I can see that
I've got a successful transfer down here
anyways but there we go the files are
now on the server so I'm gonna just
minimize this and I've already got
cPanel open and what I want to do now is
just go over to the file manager from
the file manager
I just want to unzip all of these files
so let's click on that and hit extract
if I am moving a little bit too quickly
it's because I have a tutorial series on
cPanel so if you guys don't understand
cPanel you need to go back and watch
that series let me go ahead and hit
close so great I've got my files already
on the server but I haven't actually put
the database back in so let's do that
and in order to do that I'm going back
over to cPanel the main page and if you
guys haven't already created a database
then you're gonna need to go ahead and
set one up fortunately I set up this
database in the previous tutorial so
it's already set up and ready for me to
use so what I just did before recording
this tutorial was empty the database and
I did that through PHP myadmin so just
give PHP myadmin a few seconds to load
it always takes such a long time I
understand why but there we go
I've got my database set up but if I hit
the expand button here this database is
empty and it is the database on the live
server so what I want to do is import
that SQL file that we made a few minutes
ago so when I hit import browse WP demo
is on my desktop so let me go ahead and
open that and okay now that that has
been selected I'm just gonna hit go yeah
I think all the options like that I by
default or fine I'm just going to hit go
and that is going to upload the file so
this also may take a few minutes and
once it's done the database should be
set up okay so I've got a little bit of
an area here database WP demo table
structure WP Akiba common no database
selected aha
so that is actually my error even though
I'm getting all this stuff at the top
the actual error is down here no
database selected that's because I
didn't click on
jozek Bay the actual database and then
hit import so MySQL or PHP myadmin just
didn't know where it was importing the
database so let's try that one more time
hopefully it will work this time it
should it's just gonna take a little
while to load ok so that took a few
seconds to load but once it did I got
the message here which says import has
been successful 77 queries executed so
basically it imported all of the tables
hopefully because I made that mistake
you guys can kind of gauge how to look
for errors in MySQL and if you do see an
error if it's not immediately obvious
just try Google that error and find out
what your problem is from there but
everything seems to be working for me so
now I'm gonna jump back over to the
files and I'm gonna have to do something
here I'm gonna have to edit
wp-config.php so let me hit that and hit
edit and I'm just gonna hit edit over
here again and so what we need to do is
we need to change all of these details
I'm gonna use the code editor yeah there
we go ok so now everything has been
syntax highlighted and I can see what's
a comment and what is actual PHP code
but you see where it says database name
I'm gonna change this name I'm gonna
have to change the
database user and the database password
so if you guys don't know what your
database details are go back over to
MySQL databases and when you made your
database I mean you should pretty much
know what you called your database and
you should know what your user is I
can't remember my password to be honest
so we're probably gonna have to generate
a new password so let's just copy the
database name first and let's find the
file that I'm editing so database name I
want to change that to jozek Bay
underscore WP DB that is my database
name
let's sorry this is gonna be confusing
with health it's HAP's
these are not my localhost I guess where
is it it is this one okay so databases
here finals here okay so I've got my
database name let me just copy and paste
the username for the user for the
database and we'll put that in DB user
make sure that you're not going over to
a new line and copying and pasting
unnecessary spaces like I just did so
we've got a user setup now we need to
change the database password and well
this like I said I cannot remember what
it is so I'm gonna scroll down to my
users wpe user are we using user or
we're using let me just check okay we're
using jozek Bay user so Joseph a user I
just need to change the password for
that one let me hit password generator
it's trying to look for something that
doesn't have too many funny symbols I
think that one is good copy I have
copied and save this in a safe place
let's hit use change okay okay
hello I'm saying okay okay it's a little
bit stuck
right now okay let's go back over to the
editor now and hit paste and so I've got
my username my database and my password
all set incorrectly so I'm gonna hit
Save Changes and this should allow me to
go over to my new domain now which is
Josie cope calm and the website should
run but we're gonna have a little bit of
an issue here because if I hover over
one of these links just pay attention to
what appears right down here in the
bottom corner with the mouse's you'll
see there's a little bit of a link that
shows up there all of the links still
say localhost so that one does that one
does that one does that is a little bit
of a problem because we're on the domain
Josie cocom so let's say for instance my
mam was not running if I stop this
server and I click on one of these links
you're gonna get this kind of a problem
where you're unable to connect and
you've been redirected to localhost
about us so let's hit back and figure
out how to fix this issue now the only
way to do this is to go back over to
phpMyAdmin which is open here with the
databases all imported and I'm just
gonna hit click on the database and then
I'm gonna hit query and oh not query SQL
great so click on SQL and then you're
gonna have to run a bunch of queries now
I will copy and paste these queries into
the description of this video so go
ahead and check those out but there are
five queries that we need a run we're
gonna have to run them one at a time so
I'll have to do the first one first then
the next one then the next one and to be
honest if you don't have comments or you
don't have pingbacks
on your site at the moment then you
won't need to run the bottom three
oopsie you won't need to run these
bottom three but you will still need to
run the
verse three and so basically what I've
done here is I've set these queries up
that all you need to do is put in your
old URL which if you've been following
along with me and my mam tutorials
should be localhost colon 8080 8 8 right
so you just want to change localhost 88
to your new domain whatever that is
in my case it's Josie Corp dot-com oops
and I'm just gonna remove those two for
now and when I hit go it should change
the links so everything that said
localhost should now change it to Josie
cope calm the first one the first query
should effect two rows and pretty much
always should only affect two rows
because we're actually targeting a
certain table here the next query kind
of depends on how many times you've
placed the link in your content so if I
go back to SQL and I grab the the second
query this one is going to depend on how
many links and how many articles you
actually have on your site so I can't
tell you how many times it should run
but again we want to change everything
that said localhost eight eight eight to
Josie hope comm make sure all of the
spelling is correct and you don't have
any typos because if you do have a typo
you're gonna break something and let's
hit go okay again only two rows affected
this time but yeah you get the point
we're gonna have to run all of these
queries so I'm gonna run them and I'll
get back to you as soon as I'm done
a quick note to just remember when you
guys run these queries is that you some
you might want to put in the w w but if
you're gonna do that if you're gonna use
the www in the old URL make sure you
also use it in the newer URL because
it'll take whatever is in old URL and
completely replace that with whatever
you put in here so if you make any
dub-dub-dub issues or if you have like
any extra closing slashes or anything
like that
it may cause problems so just like I
said at the beginning of the video
you're gonna have to need to know what
you were doing and you're gonna have to
need to know how to run queries and that
kind of stuff if you don't know how to
do this again it could cause problems
but now that I've run all the queries
let's go back over to the site and I'm
gonna just refresh it hopefully I'll get
all the new links and everything when
this loads and I'll hover over about us
and again if I check the links in the
corner it's going to Josie cope comm
slash about us so that seems to be
perfect contact us again that was also
perfect blog posts perfect so all of the
links on my site should now be working
correctly and that was a really
complicated process but we are done and
