here and welcome to tutorial number 16
and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about the if-else statement
okay so in the previous video we took a
look at the if statement and I showed
you guys that we could test if a certain
condition was true and if this condition
evaluated to true then we would run a
little bit of code but if this condition
was false then we'd just skip all of
this altogether and carry on with the
next bit of code in other words we
wouldn't do anything if this condition
was false but what the if-else statement
allows us to do is we can test if this
condition is true and if it is then
we'll print this line of code but if
this condition is false then we can do
something else so let's say if I was
checking if the user was at least 18
years or older then if there were I
could print out welcome and if they are
not 18 years older then we can say sorry
you are not old enough so the syntax for
an if-else statement kind of looks like
this let's just delete this and we go if
condition so very much like the if
statement then we'll do something else
we'll do something else okay
so basically if this condition is true
then we'll print all this code or do all
this code and if this condition is false
then we'll skip all of that code and
jump down here and do all of this code
instead so now that we know that let's
take a look at trying to check if the
user is at least 18 years or older and
then we'll print out a message based on
that result okay so
in my condition what I want to do is I
want to check if my value or my variable
age is greater than or equal to 18 so
I'll go if age is greater than or equal
to 18 then we can let the user in
because they are old enough so we can go
ahead and say document oops
document dot right and my spelling is so
off today document dot right welcome to
my online casino or something and
basically if they're not 18 what do we
want to happen well if they're not 18
then we'll just say you are not old
enough okay
so let's go ahead and save this and run
this in Firefox and you can see that my
age variable is set to 15 at the moment
so is 15 greater than or equal to 18
well no it's not so we're going to skip
this line of code and then we're going
to actually execute the code that's in
our else statement which says which is
going to print out on the screen you are
not old enough so let's go ahead and run
that in Firefox and as you can see you
are not old enough why because the
variable age was set to 15 so let's go
ahead and change that to 21 and now you
can see if age which is 21 if 21 is
greater than or equal to 18 then we'll
go ahead and we'll print this code over
here and we won't even worry about this
this won't execute at all we'll just
ignore it
so let's go ahead and go back to Firefox
now and click refresh and now you can
see it says welcome to my online casino
because you're 18 and you're old enough
to get in okay so that's basically the
difference between the if statement and
the if
statements okay so if I go ahead and I
actually just cut this out for now
you can see that the if statement we
tested for condition and if that
condition was true then we went and we
did this line of code we we executed
that line of code but if it was false we
didn't do anything but with the owl
statement what we can do is if this
condition evaluates to false then we can
go ahead and we can actually do
something as in print out a different
message or perform another calculation
or something like that so the awesome
thing about these if-else statements is
we can check for quite a few different
conditions so in other words let's say
we had a sneaky seventeen-year-old
trying to come in and they were
obviously 17 years old okay then we
could check if 17 is greater than or
equal to 18 then we'll go ahead and we
could print that out but obviously it's
not because they're 17 but then what we
could do is you can have another
separate else statement so else if and
we can check for another condition over
here so what I want to do is on a check
if there are exactly 17 years old so if
H is exactly equal to 17 then we'll go
ahead and we'll print out this line of
code so document dot write and we can
probably just say something like sorry
bro come back next year okay so let's go
ahead and save this and now because age
is set to 17 obviously 17 is not greater
than or equal to 18 so we'll skip this
line but now 17 is indeed equal to 17 so
obviously we'll print out this line of
we'll print out this onto the screen so
let's go ahead and go to Firefox and
click refresh and as you can see sorry
bro
back next year so what we've done now is
we've tested for two different
conditions so basically if you're older
than 18 come in if you're exactly 17
years old then you know you'll have to
come back next year sorry but obviously
if you're any younger than 17 then
you're not old enough and you can't get
in okay that's exactly what our code is
doing so that's all I have for you guys
