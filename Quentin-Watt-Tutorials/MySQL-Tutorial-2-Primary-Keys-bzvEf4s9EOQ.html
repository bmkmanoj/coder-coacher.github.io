here and welcome to tutorial number two
in my my sequel series and in this video
I want to talk to you guys about
something called primary keys and where
they're useful and also why they're so
important to have but before we get
started with the tutorial I just want to
talk to you guys about my sponsor dev
Mountain so dev Mountain is a coding
bootcamp that can teach you how to
become a web developer or an iOS
developer and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to get a
career within this field within 12 weeks
so if you are struggling to teach
yourself or I mean the whole process of
self learning can sometimes take quite a
while but if you are really trying to
change career and you really want to
become a developer pretty quickly then
you might want to consider taking a look
at their website and inquiring about a
course a link to their website is in the
video description below
and yeah if you do contact them make
sure to tell them that I thank you so
now let's talk about primary keys and
I'm going to start this video off by
just defining what a primary key is so a
primary key is a unique field within our
table right this means that it's not
going to repeat and there's not going to
be another field like that within our
table so yeah it's very very important
that we have one of these because it
allows us to be really specific when
working with elements in a table so
let's take a look at an example real
quick and let's say I have a user's
table and my users table has a name a
last name a telephone number and an
email address right this is okay when
everybody has a different name so let's
say I have a Quintin Watt and the crispy
done scanner shown clearly I can search
through my database looking for a
Christy or looking for a Quinton and if
there's only one I know that I'll only
ever receive this Quinton but it isn't
entirely impossible that there are two
Quinton what's out there in the world in
fact I'm sure there's a few hundred so a
situation like this could happen where I
have three Quinton watts using my
website and they have they might have
different
phone numbers or different email
addresses but their names are still the
same and so that becomes a little bit
difficult when I'm searching through my
database looking for a specific person
named Quinton and then there happens to
be three with the same name so you might
think to yourself okay well a telephone
number something that's not going to
repeat maybe I can make that a primary
key but if I make a telephone number
primary key and this user changes the
telephone number or changes the email
address that's also not ideal right we
don't want that to happen either so it
turns out that a better way of doing
things is to have a another column in
our table with an ID and whenever a user
signs up to our website we will assign
them an ID number so in this case our ID
becomes our primary key and we will then
assign the first user an ID of one well
I mean you could you could figure out a
way to make a specific unique ID for
every single one of these people like if
you think about it
when you have a social security number
or an identity number in whatever
country you live in whatever you call
that thing yeah your government makes
what like a ten digit or a 13 digit
number for you in this case we don't
need to get as complicated as that we
can just assign a user a number of one
and then the next user that signs up for
our website we can assign them a number
of two and then the next user that signs
up for our website we can assign them a
number of three and we can always refer
to these users as well their ID number
so now I can search through my database
looking for anybody with an ID of two
and I know that I will only ever get
this Quinton and I won't mistake this
Quinton for this Quinton who has an ID
of one right and so that's what a
primary key is therefore and we will
continue to use it even when people have
different names so even if there's a
situation where they are know repeated
you know names in our database will
still have that ID field there because
it also helps us specifically select
this row and this
Roah only so yeah the whole idea behind
a primary key is that it just allows us
to be really really specific when
working with our table so in this case
let's say I wanted to remove data from
my database I could select and remove
any user by the ID of two and that would
remove krispy dansk and it will only
remove Christy it wouldn't remove
anybody else with the same name so now
that you know what a primary key is it
is time to end this video so before I do
that though I just want to send a thank

dollars or more on patreon every month
