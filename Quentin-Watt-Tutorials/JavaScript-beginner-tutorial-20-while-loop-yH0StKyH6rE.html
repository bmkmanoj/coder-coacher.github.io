here and welcome to tutorial number 20
now in this tutorial I want to start
talking to you guys about loops and
there are a few different types of loops
in JavaScript so I should probably
mention that in this video I'm going to
be specifically talking about the while
loop now for those of you guys who don't
know what a loop is then let me go ahead
and explain we as programmers are really
lazy we like to work smarter and not
harder and for that reason we have loops
and what a loop does is it allows us to
run a bit of code repeatedly as many
times as we want without having to type
that line of code out every time so
let's say for example I wanted to write
something out on the screen ten times I
could go ahead and be boring and type
out documents dot write if you're well
ok document dot write and I could go
ahead and type in whatever I wanted to
write out like this is a sentence or
something and I could go then and
copy-paste that or duplicate it ten
times and that would be fine it would
run ten times but that's not very smart
it's not very efficient I've just wasted
ten lines of code in my text editor why
would I want to go ahead and do that so
a much smarter way of doing things would
be to use a loop tell the loop to run
ten times and then only put that line of
code in once okay so like I said in this
tutorial we are speaking about the while
loop so let's go ahead and take a look
at the syntax for a while loop and then
we can write something out on the screen
ten times use
in that loop so a while loop kind of
looks like this okay you have to type in
the word while that's why it's called a
while loop so while and after that we'll
put in two parenthesis and two curly
braces like the opening and closing ones
and in between these curly braces this
is where all of our statements go as in
all of the code that we want to run but
inside these parentheses over here this
is where we will put a condition and
basically a lot like an if statement
where you use a condition to make sure
that this code runs we do that with a
while loop as well but the difference
with a while loop is that this while
loop will carry on running these
statements over and over until this
condition becomes false so in other
words this loop is going to check this
condition and if it's true run this code
then go back check the condition if it's
still true run this code again check
this condition again obviously if it's
still true run it again and it'll keep
going until this condition is false and
then it'll just skip over and carry on
or end the program okay so I should
probably mention that every time a loop
does that every time it repeats and
starts again that is called an iteration
and that's something you're probably
going to hear a lot when working with
loops it's spelled like that iteration
okay and that just means or that's just
the name for every time a loop repeats
okay so here's the problem that you can
kind of see straight away what happens
if this condition never evaluates to
false
well that is called an infinite loop and
infinite loops are bad
okay that's basically going to make your
program like freeze and and crash or
whatever and then the user is going to
have to go ahead and push old crone alt
ctrl + delete to bring up to ask manager
and close your program it's like the
only way it can be done so just make
sure that you never have a condition
that never evaluates to false but I'm
going to show you guys how to do that
now so when using a loop to ensure that
this condition will eventually evaluate
to false we have to use a variable to
count how many times this loop runs okay
and I'm going to go ahead and create my
variable here and I'll call it counter
but a lot of people when working with
the counter for a loop will usually name
the variable something like I or J okay
sometimes X or something like that but
to keep this tutorial simple and so you
guys understand I'm going to call it
counter and I'm going to set that equal
to 1 now this means that I'm starting to
count my while loop at 1 the first time
it runs that's 1 okay sometimes people
start at 0 but just so this tutorial
makes a little bit of sense I'm going to
start at 1 you can also start at any
other number you want but what would be
the point when you start counting you
either started counting at 0 1 why would
you start counting at something like 5
or you live it but yeah it's up to you
ok so now we need to make sure that this
condition over here involves our counter
so let's say I wanted our loop to run 10
times well then I have to make sure that
while counter is less than or equal to
10 then we'll go ahead and we'll run
these statements okay and let's say we
wanted to write something out on the
screen then we can go
just put that there instead of a
statement comment document right and
what do we want to write we'll just
write this is paragraph and I'm going to
make use of my counter variable here so
I'll concatenate that on the end and I'm
going to make sure that this is all in
paragraph tags just to make sure that
every time this runs it'll appear on a
new line and if you guys don't know what
I'm doing with these plus symbols over
here go back and watch my tutorial on
strings and you'll know that this is
called concatenation and then you'll be
good to go for this video so now what we
need to do is I've left out something
very important and that is to increase
our counter okay so to do that we can go
ahead and just say counter plus plus and
that means counter plus 1 okay so now
what happens when we will run this
program in Firefox is we're going to
start counting are we going to create
this variable called counter and we're
going to start counting at 1 then we're
going to get to this loop and it's going
to go well 1 is less than or equal to 10
then write this out on the screen and
because 1 is less than or equal to 10
this is going to go ahead and execute
and it'll write this is paragraph 1 okay
then we're going to increase counter by
1 so now counter is equal to 2 then
we're going to go back and check this
condition again while 2 is less than or
equal to 10 do this so we're going to go
ahead and do that again and it'll write
this is paragraph 2 then we're going to
increase counter by 1 again so that
means that counter is not equal to 3 and
obviously 3 is
or less than ten so this is going to
carry on going until eventually we get
to ten so while 10 is less than or equal
to 10
well that's still true so it'll run
again and then it's going to increase to
11 and 11 is not less than or equal to
10 so that means that this condition
over here is now false and this code
will not run and that's the end of our
program so it'll just stop right there
it's going to print out ten lines of
code or ten lines of this onto the
screen and then it's going to stop okay
so let's go ahead and save this and then
run this in Firefox and see what happens
cool so we've got our ten paragraph
Spencer printed out on the screen
this is paragraph 1 2 3 etc which is
exactly what I told you guys would
happen so let's go back and recap for
just a minute okay what we did was we
decided we wanted to use a while loop
and we wanted to run something ten times
but in order for this while loop to run
ten times we had to keep track of this
value so what we did was we created this
counter variable to count how many times
our loop runs then we made sure that our
condition over here makes sure that this
loop runs ten times and only ten times
once we get to eleven that's too many
okay and the way we had to do that was
we had to keep counting our loop every
time it ran so we started at one then
once our loop had run once the counter
increased to two and then it increased
again every time this while loop ran or
got executed okay so that's basically
just what you guys have to do when using
a while loop you just need to make sure
that your condition will eventually
evaluate to false so you make sure you
use a counter and then make sure to
increase your counter
inside of the loop if we went ahead and
we put this code outside of the loop
then counter would never increase and
this loop would carry on going it would
be an infinite loop basically and then
we'd have to push out control delete and
end the program because we'd make our
program or our computer freeze so just
make sure that you guys never do that
and that's actually all I have for you
