and welcome to tutorial number five and
in this tutorial I want to talk to you
guys about the where clause in my sequel
so yeah the where clause is actually a
really powerful clause because it allows
us to have a lot more control of the
data that we're going to be receiving
from our database so yeah we're able to
add in some math functions and
comparisons and things like that it's
really really awesome but before we get
started with the where clause I just
want to send a shout out to my sponsors
at dev Mountain and I know for a lot of
you guys if you're learning how to code
at home through YouTube sometimes it can
be quite a time-consuming process and
sometimes it can be quite a difficult
process so if you guys are wanting to
become a web developer an iOS developer
or a UX designer you might want to just
check out dev Mountains website the link
is in the video description below and it
will teach you everything you need to
know to get a career within this field
within 12 weeks so yeah I know some of
you guys might be a little bit eager to
get a job as a developer and yeah if if
you are then it's probably worth
checking out their website but now let's
move on to the where clause in sequel so
yeah some of you guys have probably
already seen this especially over the
last four videos I know it has popped up
quite a bit but anytime you click on one
of these tables and then click on this
sequel tab the query field kind of gets
filled automatically filled with this
variable of this query writers
pre-written query which says select star
from blank where one so you've probably
seen this way close a couple of times
and been wondering what the heck is this
where clause and what does it do well
let me show you right so let's add in a
table name over here so let's use
products for this tutorial and yeah
basically this query is going to select
everything from products away one
and in this case the where Clause
doesn't really do much so where one is
kind of the same as having select star
from products right where one is just
going to say select star from products
where there is something there where it
exists right so if I run this query it's
pretty much the same as running it
without the where one clause but there
are a lot of people who consider it best
practice to kind of always end your
query with away one because if you are
going to be adding more comparisons or
more logic to your query later on and
these are things that I haven't even
shown you yet so you don't know those
things that I'm even talking about right
now but yeah if you're going to add
extra arguments to the end of this then
having away one Clause there is just
helpful but because you know you're not
doing that yet we won't worry about that
yet so now let's take a look at this
database and as you guys can see there
is a column for Product ID product name
description product image stock and
product price and I just wanted to kind
of point that out to you because let's
say I was a stock I mean a shop owner
and yeah as a shop owner it's probably a
good idea to keep track of how many
products I have in stock and if I have
less than 10 products in stock I should
order more stock right because you don't
wanna run out of stock and then when
customers come to your shop you don't
have something in stock it's really kind
of embarrassing right so let's go over
to my sequel table over here or my
sequel tab over here and let's run a
query so whoopsie Wow I had that copied
and pasted already nevermind okay so let
me just ignore that I wrote let's let's
build this query up from the beginning
so let's select something from our table
so I'm going to select the product name
and the product in stock so let's let's
add those two fields here product name
and how many products are in stock
from this table the products table so
from product okay where something right
so in this case I don't want to use a
way of one Clause because the way one
Clause is really going to help us very
much what I'm interested in knowing is
how many of the products stock is less
than ten so that is actually an argument
that I can place in here so I'm going to
say where product underscore stock so
I'm basically just grabbing this value
and placing it here is less than or
equal to ten and there are a bunch of
different mathematical operators like it
Hugh's yeah so in this case I want to
use less than or equal to but there is
also a greater than or equal to operator
it is also just equal to so this will
show me exactly how many products are
have ten in stock but I want less than
or equal to there is also not equal to
which could be written this way or this
way depending on what version of sequel
you are using so you might want to just
double-check that but in this case I am
going to say less than or equal to 10
and this should return the name of the
product and how many products we have in
stock that are less than or equal to ten
so let's take a look and as you can see
we have some product name and some
products in stock and our red light
saber is looking pretty low the bad guys
are not going to be happy about that
right so better order some of those so
let's take a look at some other really
useful queries that we could run and in
fact I want to browse my database and
just search for something here so let's
just say nobody was buying anything from
my shop and I wanted to know why and
somebody told me hey look your prices
are too high well then I could run a
query so let's get the product name and
or what the price of that product is or
was that value product price and let's
search for any product price that is
greater than or equal to let's say 200
right so anything that's greater than or
equal to $200 let's find out how many
expensive products I have in my store
let's go
and yeah the canon 600d that seems to be
quite pricey it's 350 euros Wow
light sabers are quite expensive and
yeah I don't know maybe I can bring some
of these prices down but I'm really not
the shopkeeper I'm just the guy who runs
the query so I'm going to leave that to
somebody else another case where this
could be really really useful is if I
took a look at our users table and ran a
query here we can look for a very
specific user so if I type select and
then I want to get the first and the
last name of users within my table let's
select the first name and also the last
underscore name of any user that is in
my users table so from users where and
now I can be really specific and search
for someone's ID so I'm going to search
for an ID over here and make sure that
small letters where ID
is equal to a certain value and somebody
told me that user ID 14 is pretty
interesting so I'm just going to search
for anybody who has the user ID of 14
and click go and it turns out that that
guy is Luke Skywalker right so that is
another case of we're using a where
Clause is quite interesting so now that
I've shown you guys how to use the Waya
clause and given you guys a few
scenarios where that might be useful I
hope that you guys will practice this a
little bit
come up with a bunch of cool queries and
yeah that is all I have for you in this
video so before I end up the video let
me just send a shout out to these guys
