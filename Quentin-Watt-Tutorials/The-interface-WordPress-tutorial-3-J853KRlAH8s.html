here and now that you have WordPress
installed on your computer let's take a
look at how to use it so I'm gonna run
through WordPress's
interface and explain a few
terminologies and we'll look at editing
a few posts and widgets so those are our
terminologies that you might not
understand just yet but I'm gonna
explain all of that stuff in a second so
right now I've got WordPress open and
this is the front end of WordPress this
is the front end of our site and the
front end or the way the front end looks
is determined by something called your
WordPress theme and I'm gonna show you
where to find themes in just a second
but I also want to show you that
WordPress has a back-end and you would
have seen that in the previous tutorial
and to access the backend you're going
to add back slash WP dash admin to your
url so now you're on localhost WP admin
and that should take you through to a
login screen just go ahead and enter the
details that you used whenever you were
setting up WordPress in the previous
video and hit login and from here you
can see that we've got a navigation menu
on the left and we've got some content
on the right and obviously the content
will change depending on what page
you're on so right now we're on the
dashboard and we've just got a little
bit of information about WordPress so
right now we've got like one post one
page one comment and we're using the
WordPress 2016 theme which means if you
were looking at the front end of your
site and it looks a little bit different
you might be using a different theme and
then we've got options to create a quick
draft or a quick post but we also have
options to create posts over here and
one thing I wanted to talk about before
we actually get into creating posts is
this little black bar going along the
top of the screen because this is kind
of important it is called the admin bar
and you can turn this off in the
front-end but by default is that it is
actually turned on so once you've logged
into WordPress it'll always show up in
the backend but if you have a
your website title and hit visit site
that's gonna take you to the front end
of WordPress again but now since you've
logged in this black bar will show up
and it gives you a few quick options to
like easily edit stuff that you see in
the front end so right now if I have a
wordpress demo you can see I can go to
the backend I can take a look at the
dashboard or I can take a look at the
themes which I explained is the theme is
whatever controls how the front end of
your site looks and these are coded in
PHP and CSS so you have to know how to
code in these languages to be able to
edit the theme but that doesn't mean you
can't customize a theme using a few
little theme customization options and
that would be over here in the
customizer so if I go ahead and click
customize you can see that this opens
the WordPress customizer and there are a
bunch of things that we can change about
our site now this is theme dependent so
if you switch over to another theme the
options over here might be a little bit
different but right now we've got site
identity and this is pretty much
standard for all WordPress sites but the
options over here might differ so we've
got the option to create or add a logo
we can change our WordPress site title
to something else so I can say
quinton site and that will then put
Quinten site over here I could also put
it in a tagline I can also choose to not
display those things at all but I think
I'm gonna leave them there right now
since we don't have a logo and I'm gonna
hit save and publish and I'll go back
and you can see there are a few other
options as well like widgets and menus
and so on so I'm going to get into
widgets in a few minutes but let's close
the customizer and go back to this admin
bar and you can see that I've also got
the option to create a new post or a new
page from here and those are all
settings that we can also find if we go
back over to WordPress we can also
create
posts from the backend instead of you
know editing and managing posts from the
front end of wordpress then we've got
posts and we've got pages now these two
things are going to look incredibly
similar and in fact I think a lot of new
wordpress users might confuse them for
being the same thing but they are not
the same thing so posts are actual blog
posts these are things like if you're
right if you're running a sports website
or a news website every single article
you write might be a post
whereas pages are more for static
content so they're not blog posts that
would update every week but rather just
a Contact Us page or an about Us page
those would be static pages you're not
going to release a new Contact Us page
or a new about Us page like every week
but you might go back and edit the
content so those would just be pages
whereas yeah posts would be something
that you're planning on releasing weekly
or monthly or just whenever you have
time I know not a lot of bloggers will
will post that regularly but yeah these
are our more for articles than they are
for static content then we have the
media library and actually let me just
show you how similar posts and pages
could be so if I click on posts you can
see I put a list of all the posts and
right now there's only the one if I hit
edit we have a edit screen and I've got
the option to categorize or choose a
format so these are things that will be
available in posts the ability to
categorize them and maybe pick a format
whereas pages won't have these options
but the pages screen is going to look
very similar so let's go over to pages
and you'll see the list of pages looks
exactly the same as the list of posts we
just have a slightly different title but
if I hit edit you can see that we've got
some content over here but some of the
options in the sidebar like choosing a
category or choosing
post format are not available so yeah it
it also might depend on your your theme
if I go back over the posts the ability
to choose a format this might depend on
what theme you're using so if it is not
available it just means that your
WordPress theme does not support formats
right so we've covered posts and pages
and we've kind of covered the front end
and the back end quite nicely let's take
an appearance take a look at appearance
and you can see the first thing or the
first page that we land on when I click
on appearance is themes and that's
something that we can also access from
the front end if I just hover over my
website title and I hit themes it takes
me to the same page so the nice thing is
you can always see where you are in this
menu and yeah it's quite easy to use or
simple to figure out and from here I can
customize or choose a different theme so
right now we're on 2016 but if I go
ahead and activate the 2015 theme
nothing much has changed in the backend
but let's go take a look at the front
end of our site and now you can see we
have a very different site so instead of
having the sidebar going along the
right-hand side it's now on the
left-hand side of the search and a lot
of the styling has changed so yeah that
is one way to quickly change the look
and feel of your site is just to change
to a different theme and then we can
also edit these themes if I let's
activate 2016 again just to bring it
back to what we were on and we can also
edit these themes by going over to our
editor and this is actually not a nice
editor I mean you can actually see that
WordPress is made up of PHP files
there's one called single page this one
called single post you can see that
there's some style sheets which are CSS
files but I wouldn't normally use this
editor it's there just to be able to see
some code but
generally I like to FTP in with
something like sublime which is my
normal text editor and this is a text
file from yesterday's video but yeah I
wouldn't know I wouldn't normally use
this editor I'd move over to something
like sublime and now it's closed so
there it is
and I would edit in that rather then we
have a few options for our themes so
choosing how the header of our website
looks or the background of our website
looks those are options that we can
change here and something I wanted to
talk about before was widgets and I kind
of skipped over that really quickly but
if I visit the friends and on my site
and I go over the widgets I'll get taken
to the same page so appearance and
widgets and you can see right now we've
got a few widgets over here one for a
search and we've got some for recent
posts and they have some options here so
we're gonna show the five of our recent
posts and if I go over to the front and
I'll show you where these appear because
this might depend on your theme they
might be different like like you saw in
when I switch themes suddenly all of
this content that was on the right hand
side moved over to the left hand side so
it depends where widgets are set up on
your WordPress site as to where they'll
appear but right now I know in the 2016
theme this widget area called sidebar
appears over here as a sidebar so it was
named quite well I guess and you can see
that we've got a search widget and over
here we have a search widget and a
recent post widget so these kind of
correlate and they're always in the same
order which means if I drag search down
the page and then I come back here to
the front-end and I take a look at this
now search appears further down so
depending on where you have your widget
set up in the widget area
they will appear in that order and we
can always manage widgets in the
customizer which is something we
actually had open earlier so in the
customizer if I go over the widgets I
can see what widget positions are active
and I can see that we've got these
widget positions set up here and again
same thing depending on what order
they're in we can drag and drop and
rearrange them however we like the nice
thing is we can always add new widgets
to this so if I wanted to add a text
widget that just contained some text I
can go ahead and maybe drag and drop
that all the way to the top and just say
hello there this is my widget
that will then set the winch it up over
here again it does depend on where you
have widget areas set up on your
WordPress site because if I close this
and I take a look at the widget areas
you can see I've got one widget area for
the sidebar but I've also got widget
areas for content bottom one and two and
right now I don't think they're being
used but let's say I dragged and dropped
my text widget from the sidebar to
content bottom and I came back here and
I hit refresh now my content should be
somewhere along the bottom of the page I
just don't see it interesting hmm I
guess it probably doesn't even appear on
this layout I'd have to go over to let
me go over to pages and I'm going to go
view my sample page and if I scroll down
there we go so it does depend on what
layout you're using and that is
something that I actually haven't
covered but if I go back over to sample
page and I hit edit some of our pages
can have different layouts and we don't
have a layout option over here but I
guess the home page just uses a slightly
different layout to sample page and that
is going
to depend on the code so like I said
before widgets are very dependent on
your theme and obviously this theme has
a widget area set up on pages but that
widget area is not set up to show up on
the blog listing where if I go back to
my home page this is actually the blog
listing so yeah that widget area is not
set up to show you and that's why it's
not showing up and now that we know kind
of how to navigate us our way around
around WordPress and we know what
widgets and blog posts are and we know
what the customizer is in the next
couple tutorials I'm going to show you
guys how to start editing WordPress and
making an actual website so I think
we'll set up a few basic pages like a
home page about Us page contact page and
a little blog listing so I'll show you
how a wordpress site would work in the
real world and hopefully you guys can
put that to use in the future if you
