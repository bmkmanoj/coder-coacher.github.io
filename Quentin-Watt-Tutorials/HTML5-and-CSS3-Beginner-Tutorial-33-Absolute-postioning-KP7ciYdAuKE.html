to tutorial number 33 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to show you guys
how to use absolute positioning in HTML
and CSS but before we do anything I
actually just want to go over to my
stylesheet and I as you can see I'm
using the exact same code that I had in
the previous tutorial so there is
something I want to remove over here and
that is the fixed positioning okay so
I'm going to remove that and then I'm
just gonna save this and just so you
guys can see what it looks like now and
then compare have something to compare
this to at the end then I'm just gonna
run this in Firefox and as you can see
right now we have our header and then
our off our main section and then our
footer exactly like we started off in
the previous tutorial before we started
positioning every anything okay so let's
go over to note notepad and now what I
want to do is under my main section
styling we can set this background color
to orange or any color you like really
doesn't matter it's just so that we've
got a background and then I want you to
add in the position property again and
we'll set this to absolute and then we
can use our top and left properties just
to position this anywhere we want on the
web page so let's say we wanted to have
it somewhere around 250 pixels and then
we can have the left at 200 pixels
okay and if we save this and then go
back to firefox and click refresh you'll
see that this article is now going to
like pop over to the side somewhere so
it's going to refresh and as you can see
our article has actually moved all the
way down to here so that is two hundred
and fifty fifty pixels from the top so
two hundred and fifty pixels over here
and then two hundred pixels from the
left so two hundred pixels from here
that is where our article starts okay
and there's actually quite a few things
that have actually changed the via and
the first thing is that our footer
instead of being at the bottom of our
webpage has actually moved up to take
the place where our main section would
have been before we used the absolute
positioning okay and then the next thing
is that our article is actually one
layer higher than all of our other
content and to show you that let's just
go back to note that and we can change
our top and left properties again yes
let me just go ahead and change that to
50 and 100 and as you can see we can
just move our content around however we
want by using the top and left
properties and now when I click refresh
we can see our article has now jumped up
to be 50 pixels from the top left corner
and 100 pixels from the left in the top
left corner so and like I said the
article is now about one layer above the
other two elements on our webpage so it
has been completely pulled out of the
flow of the document and has been
positioned absolutely where it is so
that's why you use absolute positioning
in HTML and CSS and that's all I have
for you guys in this video so I will see
