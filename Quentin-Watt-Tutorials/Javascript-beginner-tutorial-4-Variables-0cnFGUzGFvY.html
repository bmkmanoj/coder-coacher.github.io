to tutorial number four in my JavaScript
series its Quintin here and in this
video I just want to talk to you guys
about one of the most important topics
in programming and that is variables
okay so first of all what is a variable
well if you're watching this video I'm
pretty sure that you are either in high
school or you've finished high school
and you've at least been to or you've at
least had a few maths classes where
they've already taught you what
variables are so you know that whenever
you saw something like X is equal to 3
that X is holding the value 3 so later
on whenever someone said something like
I have X apples what this meant was I
have 3 apples and if we change the value
of x to 5 then this will change as well
to say I have 5 apples so that's
basically just what a variable is it's
just a placeholder for a value so X is
holding the value 5 right now but what
we use program or what we use variables
for in programming is we store these
values in the computer's memory and then
we'll use them again later on for
example a user might come to our website
and they might fill in their name ok and
then we might store their name in a
variable called name and because it's me
over here we'll just say name is equal
to Quintin okay and then we might print
out on the page later on so you guys
know how to print stuff on the page
document dot write and then we might
print name onto the page and that would
print my name ok so that's just how we
would use what we would use variables
for in programming
and what I want to talk to you guys
about now is just how to name your
variable because the you can name
available almost anything you want in
JavaScript but there are a few rules
okay and the first rule is that your
variable is allowed to consist of
letters numbers and underscores but your
variable has to begin with either a
lowercase letter or an uppercase letter
or an underscore so it can't start with
the number okay so just to show you guys
an example you could name your variable
my variable and that has uppercase
letters it starts with an applicative
that's fine you could name your variable
my variable okay variable if I can spell
that right not really and this starts
with the lowercase letter and that's
fine that's okay and you could also name
your variable under school my variable
and that's fine too
so you can name your variable anything
that looks vaguely similar to that but
you are not allowed to use a number as
the first character so you can't name
your variable one my variable one my
variable okay
you are allowed to use numbers though
just not as the first character so you
can name it my variable one you can name
it my one variable but you can't name
your variable one my variable or
something that starts with a number so
yeah that's basically the first two
rules done so just make sure that you
only use letters and numbers and you
always start with a letter or an
underscore okay and then the next thing
is you're not allowed to use spaces okay
so you can't name your variable my space
variable one okay you're not allowed to
do that
if you want to use a space what you can
do is you can put in an underscore and
name it my underscore variable but
not allowed to leave a blank space like
that that is will give you an error okay
and the last rule is pretty much you're
not allowed to use any JavaScript
keywords now javascript has a few
different keywords like var and function
and things like that so as you can see
they turn this funny dark blue color
will not type them those are keywords
you're not allowed to name your variable
any of those keywords and there's
actually quite a few of them so I'll
leave a link in the description below
where you can see what keywords you're
not allowed to use and then the last
thing I actually want to let you guys
know or second last thing actually want
to let you guys know is that a variable
name is case sensitive so if you name
your variable my capital v variable like
this okay that is not the same as naming
your variable my variable with a
lowercase V so variables are case
sensitive these are not the same thing
okay even though they both turned green
and I highlighted them they're not the
same thing you have to if you're gonna
use a capital here you have to use a
capital later on again okay so they're
just case sensitive I'm pretty sure you
guys understand that it's pretty basic
then the next thing is all the last this
is the last thing now a variable name is
called
an identifier so if you're writing a
JavaScript exam and one of the questions
is what is the variable name or like
what is the technical term for a
variable name it's called an identifier
so just go ahead and remember that if
you want to if you're going to be
writing any exam soon and the next thing
I want to talk to you guys about is
declaring a variable so before you can
actually use a variable anywhere in your
code you actually have to declare your
variable you have to say to JavaScript a
yo JavaScript
this is a variable so I'm going to use
it later on just make sure that you know
that this is going to be a variable so
to do that use the keyword var and then
you put in your variable name so we were
just using a variable called my variable
okay and then you just put a semicolon
there so that is a javascript statement
that just declares a variable it just
says okay computer I'm going to be using
a variable later on this is the variable
name and now what we can do is you can
actually go ahead and just use this
variable and this is the next thing on
it talk to you guys up which is called
assigning a value to a variable okay so
we can give a variable value and to do
that what we do is we type the name of
the variable so my variable okay and
then we just put an equal sign and then
we put in the value that we want our
variable to be so I'm just going to give
my variable a value of 20 okay so what
this means is my variable is now holding
a value of 20 and this little equal sign
here if you're writing a JavaScript test
don't call it an equal sign it's called
an assignment operator so assignment
operator okay and the reason why it's
called that is because it assigns the
value of 20 to the variable my variable
so pretty simple and we can probably
just neaten this up and then the next
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is just printing out a variable on the
screen so if you want to print out a
variable on the screen you can use the
document dot write feature that we
already spoke about document alright and
inside the brackets we put our variable
name so we don't put any of the double
quotation marks don't put those in there
just put in the variable name so that's
how to print out a variable with
document all right
okay so we go ahead and save this and
then we can run this in Firefox and we
should get the value 20 printed out on
the screen so there it is over there and
if we wanted to change that value we
could just go ahead and change it here
when we assign the variable we're going
to change that to 40 save it come back
here
refresh and our value now changes to 40
so now this is the last thing I want to
talk to you guys about and this is just
called initializing a variable okay so
you see how we declare our variable over
here and then we give it a value down
here
well what if two lines of code is just
too much for you like you wanted to just
be really lazy and take a shortcut in
programming well you can go ahead and do
this and we can declare our variable and
assign a value to it in the same line
and to do that we just say var my
variable equals and then we'll put the
value 20 okay and now what we've done is
we've declared our variable and we've
given our variable the value or we've
assigned a value to our variable and
this is called initializing your
variable so we can go ahead and save
this and when we run this in Firefox
it's still going to be the same output
pretty much so we print out the value
that our variable has been given or has
been assigned to our variable so that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
