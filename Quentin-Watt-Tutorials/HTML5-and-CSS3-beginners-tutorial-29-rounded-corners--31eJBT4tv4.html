here and welcome to tutorial number 29
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to you make rounded corners
using css3 now I just want to mention
that rounded corners are new to css3 so
if you're using an outdated browser then
something like Internet Explorer 8 or
something like that probably isn't going
to support these rounded corners but as
long as your browser's up-to-date then
this should work okay so if it doesn't
work just go ahead and update your
browser and the rounded corners will
display okay now to save time what I've
done is I've created a div on my web
page and I've given that a class of
rounded box and I've just written the
word apples inside of that div okay and
then I went ahead and I gave it some
styling as well so I selected it by
class which I've shown you guys how to
do this before and I gave it a
background color of orange I gave it a
width of 200 pixels
I set the text to be in the center and
then I just gave it a padding of 50
pixels on the top and 50 pixels on the
bottom and then padding of zero pixels
on the right and zero pixels on the left
and this is basically the output so we
get the word apples in a big orange box
okay now let's go ahead and actually use
CSS to round off these corners because
right now they're pretty sharp okay so
all you have to do is go ahead and say
order radius just like that so border -
radius and then you'll go ahead and put
in a value so I'm going to go ahead and
just put in a value of five pixels and
this is going to be very subtle you
might not even be able to see this on my
screen recorder or
on YouTube but if I click refresh you
can see that the corners change from
being really sharp to a little bit
rounded and if I went ahead and I just
made this a lot bigger so let's go ahead
and say something like 50 pixels you'll
be able to see this a lot more clearly
so if I go ahead now and click refresh
you can see now the corner has really
been rounded by quite a lot of space
okay so that's basically how to round
all of the corners but what happens if
you decided well hey I'd really like
only this corner to be rounded and then
the rest of them to be sharp well then
you can around only the top left by
doing it this way so let's go ahead and
just get rid of this and what we
actually have to do here is type in
border top left radius so that is going
to round off the top left corner and
we'll set that equal to 50 pixels and
we'll leave the rest okay so now when we
go over to Firefox and click refresh
we've only rounded the top left corner
of our box and again if I wanted to do
this to the top right corner then I
could just change the word right or the
word left to right and if I go ahead now
and click refresh then I've only rounded
the right corner and if I wanted to do
the bottom corners then I'd go ahead and
just change bottom so I change top to
bottom and we'd have a border bottom
right radius and I didn't save that so
let me just go ahead and click Save come
back here click refresh and now we've
rounded only the bottom right and again
if I wanted to change this to the bottom
left then I just change the
right to lift and when I go ahead and
click refresh then I've changed the
bottom left radius as well okay so this
does work in most browsers now but if
you want to make make this kind of work
in some older versions of Firefox or
some some older versions of Chrome then
they used to actually do something or
used to use something called a WebKit so
chrome used to use WebKit border-radius
and that would make the rounded border
appear rounded in an older version of
chrome okay but like I said the newer
version actually supports it without the
WebKit so you can go ahead and do that
and it'll work in the new version of
chrome just fine
but if you're using an older version of
Chrome go ahead and just include that
word WebKit and I think that handles
Safari as well and then if you wanted to
make this work in an older version of
Firefox then you'd have to include Mars
but then I think some of this stuff
actually has to change as well so it
would have to be bottom right radius I I
can't remember but that's just if it's
if it's really old you can make use of
those web kits all those will render is
just like that but like I said this
standard version like this should work
in most of the new browsers nowadays so
that's actually all I have for you guys
