here and welcome to tutorial number 12
and in this tutorial we are still taking
a look at setting up our website
template and the reason why we're doing
that is because there is something I
want to show you guys in the UI kit
customizer and it kind of deserved a
tutorial all on its own because the
uikit customizer is a little bit
complicated to work through but before
you guys quit this video and move on to
the next video I just want to mention
that I'm going to make sure that this
style that less file is available for
all of you guys as well so make sure
that you check the link in the video
description below and you'll be able to
download this less file and you can
import this list file so if you click
import less you can then import the less
file that I give you guys and it's gonna
allow you to have some of the same
styling that I set up for this video but
basically let's just take a walk through
UI kits customizer real quick and yeah
when you first arrive here you're
probably gonna have this almost flat
theme set so you can see that all the
corners of the buttons around it etc I
don't want any of that so if you go over
to default that's going to automatically
square off some of the corners for you
but they're still gonna be a few big
differences because your primary color
is pretty gonna be a very light blue
your green is kind of probably a very
different green and so is the danger so
what I've done is if you okay if you
arrive on this theme or this uikit
customizer you're not gonna have this
button ticked which means there's gonna
be a lot less options available for you
but if you tick Advanced Mode you're
gonna have a lot more options to play
with and some of those options have to
do with background colors of buttons so
the primary button background color etc
so what I did was I changed all of these
colors to colors that I got from this
website material UI colors so this red
is obviously this red over here and that
orange and the blue and so on are all
the same oranges and
using greens that I've put in over here
now I have also changed those in a few
other places so not only under buttons
they've also changed them under the
alerts I've also changed them if we go
further down and this black color make
sure that this blue color has been
changed to the blue that I'm using the
primary blue color and then yeah a bunch
of other places as well like this button
section so primary button hover that
changes the color of the button as I
hover over it so you can see that the
button the color of this button changes
as I hover over it and those are all
colors that I got from this website as
well so if I hit more I can get a darker
blue or a lighter blue depending on if I
want a darker or lighter shade of blue
from this palette all right now the next
and probably the most important part of
this tutorial is the fact that I've
changed the navigation right and the
reason why I've changed the navigation
and also these primary colors is to kind
of keep up with what was going on in my
design so if I jump back over to
photoshop this blue color of the buttons
is kind of the same blue or it is
actually the same blue that we have set
up in our customizer now but if I go
back over to my design you can see that
my navigation bar or my nav bar over
here is white when you guys first
arrived to UI kits customizer your nav
bar is probably going to look a lot like
this where it is grey you're not gonna
want that you're gonna want a white nav
bar just like me so under the default
settings
this was also a grey nav bar before what
I had to do was search nav bar so I hit
control F and I have a search going on
up here in the top corner of my website
and I searched for the nav bar but there
was a very specific nav bar option so
basically under this nav bar header this
is where you want to change some of your
settings so you want to change the
background of this to white and that's
going to change the background of this
entire nav bar to white you're also
going to want to change the hover color
unclick color and
active color to white as well if you
don't do that you're probably going to
end up having something like this I
don't know if I'm gonna get this color
right but yeah okay that's a little bit
too light if e if e if e nope well okay
let's make that f9 if 9f9
so like that right you can see that
there is a slightly darker background
color on this menu item now right and
that is because the default color is
actually sort of grey color and I just
went ahead and changed all of these to
white so that you know I can't see the
difference here and then I also click
this little more button and I change the
nav color so when you first arrive here
it's just going to be a sort of blank
file with an @ symbol you want to change
that to your actual color that you want
to use for when you hover over the menu
item and you can see that basically what
I've done here is I've put in a blue
color so as I hover over my menu items
the text changes to blue if it's active
the text also changes to blue and that's
kind of what I want to go for for my
design I don't think I actually
indicated that here but I do want these
links to change blue if somebody hovers
over them so yeah that is pretty much
most of the settings in our customizer
talked over but if you guys hit import
less you will be able to import this
less file that I make available for
download and you will have all the same
colors that I do then when you leave
this you once hit get CSS you can also
minify the CSS if you like but hit get
CSS and that's going to allow you to
download your CSS and you can take the
CSS that you get downloaded copy that
over to your htdocs directory put that
in you can put it in UIKit or you can
put it in your own CSS file just make
sure that wherever you put it you
remember and you use that exactly
I think I'm gonna put it in UI kits CSS
and I'm gonna paste that in here oops
I've already got one called UI kit CSS
so let's keep both and this one that's
called UI kit to dot CSS I'm actually
going to rename that's to UI kit custom
theme dot CSS and now I'm just gonna
copy that entire name go over to my
template and I'm gonna make sure that
I've got that text saved but I want to
copy this paste that in here
and then I can go ahead and grab that
link that I have saved from earlier and
paste that in there and now my custom
theme is also linked in the header so if
I save this and I jump back over to the
browser and refresh I don't think
anything's changes yet but if I if I
come back here and I add an extra class
of UK button - primary my primary button
should be the blue that I want it to be
and not a light blue that is standard UI
kit blue it should be the dark blue that
I chose for my customizer so now I think
our template has been set up correctly
and I will see you guys in the next
video don't forget to subscribe please
