here and welcome to my responsive design
tutorial and I decided to make this
video because there were quite a few
guys that requested this on Facebook and
also in the comments section below my
videos so if you guys want to request
the video go ahead and follow me on
Facebook and Twitter the links are in
the description below and I'm going to
do my best to help you guys and if you
guys want to know how you can help me
then leaving a comment liking or sharing
the video is really going to help and
also if you watch the video the entire
way through on YouTube instead of
downloading it and watching it on your
computer that helps me with something
called audience retention but I do
understand that some of you guys watch
the video download it and watch it
because Internet can be expensive in
some places or some parts of the world
so I do understand if you do download
these videos it's just it's much better
for you to watch the video on YouTube
because it helps me okay but let's
actually get started with this
responsive design tutorial okay and I've
got some content on the webpage already
so that we can save time but it's not
really complicated stuff it's just a div
with an ID of container and that div
with the idea of container has two style
rules the width is set to 960 pixels and
the margin is set to auto okay so what
this means is we have a 960 pixel
container that is centered in the middle
of the browser okay then taking a look
at what's inside this container we have
an image which acts as a banner and that
takes up the entire width of our
container and I'm going to show you guys
what that image looks like in just a
second then we've also got our section
which is has an ID of left column and
that has just some left column dummy
content same thing with the right column
this is an aside tag with an ID of right
column we take a look at the style rules
for those we've got a width of 700
pixels and the left column is floated
left the right column has a width of 260
pixels and it's also floated left which
means that it appears next to my left
column and two hundred and sixty pixels
plus 700 pixels is equal to 960 pixels
so these two columns when appearing next
to each other take up the entire width
of my container okay then I also gave
them background colors just so we can
differentiate between the left column
and the right column so if we run this
in Firefox okay you can see we've got
this big banner at the top of the page
and then we've got our left column and
we've got our right column so in order
to make this design responsive we're
going to take a look at a new tool in
Firefox so I'm going to go to tools web
developer responsive design view as you
can see the keyboard shortcut is ctrl
shift M so go ahead and hit that and
you'll get these little handles on the
side of the page over here that you can
use to scale the actual screen size and
there's also a whole bunch of presets up
here and you can use this to kind of
determine how your website is going to
look on certain screen sizes like a
phone or a tablet etc okay so now let's
go over to a notepad and in my index
file I want to add a meta tag now this
made the tag you probably don't need
when you're working on your computer
designing and testing this but if you do
want your phone or your website to
respond on a phone and actually change
sizes then this meta tag is necessary so
go ahead and add in this meta tag so
meta and give it a name of viewports
and by viewport we're talking about the
actual screen size and we're going to
say content is equal to width and this
is actually quite a long story here but
width is equal to device width comma
initial scale is equal to 1.0 okay and
it needs to be just like that now by
doing this we're telling the phone or
we're telling the iPad or the tablet or
whatever is trying to access this
website that the content needs to be
equal to the width of the device width
okay so whatever your phone with is that
is the width of this website or that's
the width that you must display for this
website okay and the initial scale of
1.0 just means do not scale this website
up or down to try and fit the content
just the content is actually going to
fit the actual device so let's go over
to CSS now and use something called a
media query to make our website respond
to phones and stuff so to use a media
query you're going to type in the word
at media screen and open up brackets max
width and 900 well I'm going to yeah I'm
looking at my notes but I'm focusing on
that at the same time so I'll explain
why I'm going to put nine hundred and
fifty nine pixels in here in just a
second but I just want to mention to you
guys that your code needs to look
exactly like that
okay if you try and leave out a space so
like I left out a space like this the
website doesn't work anymore doesn't
respond so this thing is so fussy that
even the spaces have to be correct okay
and I'm going to give this
a max width of 959 pixels and basically
what we're saying here is as soon as our
website gets to 959 pixels we are going
to display whatever CSS rules are inside
of this media screen and the reason why
I'm using 959 pixels is because my
container is 960 pixels so everything
bigger than 960 pixels is going to
display my web page like this so we're
going to have the web page in the middle
and it's going to be centered but as
soon as we get to 959 pixels you can see
we start cutting off part of our web
page and we want to try fix that so 959
pixels we're going to make our website
start scaling so we're going to grab
this container over here and instead of
the container having a width of 960
pixels we just want this container to
take up the full width of whatever the
screen width is at that time so we're
going to say with 100% okay and this
means that whatever the screen width is
this container is going to go ahead and
try and fit that width okay then I'm
going to grab this left column over here
and we're going to give this a style
rule as well because we don't want to
work with pixels anymore we need to work
with percentages so I'm going to grab
this width and I'm going to give that a
percentage of 70% and what that means is
this left column now takes up 70% of
whatever width is left for it to take up
and we're going to do the same thing
with the right column so I'm going to
copy that
and just paste that down here okay and
I'm going to give that a width of 30%
because we want
the left column and the right column to
still appear next to each other because
they're still going to be floated left
because of these two rules these two
styling rules okay and seventy plus 30
is equal to 100 so these two columns
will together make up 100% and take up
the entire width of our container so
save that now jump over to Firefox click
refresh and as you can see now when I
start scaling this my left column and my
right column start scaling along with
the actual webpage so this is pretty
cool but my image as you can see is
still getting cut out in the background
and we need to fix that so I'm going to
go back to notepad and I'm going to grab
this image by its image tag so image and
I'm going to give that a width as well
so width of 100% and this means that our
image can only be as wide as the
container that it is within and our
container over here also has a width of
100% so if we go over to Firefox click
refresh and start scaling this down now
you can see our image scales with the
web page so we now have a responsive
website which is pretty cool but what
happens when we get to like a really
small screen size over here you can see
that we're now only fitting maybe like
two to three words per line and that's
not great in this column so it would
probably be better to make this column
appear beneath the Left column okay so
in other words they don't become left
and right columns anymore and to do that
we're going to grab this media screen
rule and for the width I'm going to set
this equal to
hundred and forty pixels so this rule
kind of works for all the tablets
because anything smaller than 959 pixels
will scale down and this will work for
all pretty much all of the tablets but
for this rule over here sorry
squeaker for this rule 640 pixels is
pretty much the same region where we
start working with phones like the
iPhone 5 or the iPhone 4 and some
Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy
s3 or s5 or something ok and for this we
want to actually make these columns over
here appear beneath each other so I'm
going to grab these two columns and I'm
just going to paste them down here and
if I give this a width of 100% and I
give my right column a width of 100%
then it means that 100 and 100 are now
bigger than the actual container so
these two will appear beneath each other
instead of next to each other so if we
go over to Firefox and we click refresh
over here and we start scaling this down
watch what happens when we get to 640
pixels so I'm going to scale this down
and there we go as soon as we get to 640
pixels those two divs or the section and
the aside start appearing beneath each
other okay and as we scale this down
they just get thicker and thicker as the
content scales to fit as well okay and
you know that's pretty cool but what
happens if for some reason the screen
goes like that
now we've only got one word per line and
this is you know pretty stupid in my
opinion and I think the smallest screen
size that we actually really need to
cater for is around 320 pixels which is
about here
okay and 320 pixels is basically like
the old iPhone 3 and those kinds of
phones so once we get to 320 pixels we
don't really want our website to scale
down any further because it just starts
looking pretty bad so in that case the
user will have to use their thumb and
you know try you know maneuver around
the website or scale the website as such
okay so I'm going to go back here and
we're going to create another media of
screen rule and I'm going to for this
just give my content my container a
width of 320 pixels so ctrl V so when
the screen gets to 320 pixels we want
our container to also have the exact
same width of 320 pixels okay and what
this means is that the website can be no
smaller than 320 pixels so if I click
refresh over here and we start right
from a fresh we've got computers and
some of the bigger tablets we'll see a
website that looks like this as soon as
we start scaling it's smaller then iPad
minis and some of the smaller tablets
would display a website that looks kind
of like this and when we start getting
two phone widths then we've got websites
that look kind of like this with the
columns appearing below each other and
the smaller we go they just keep going
to fit until we get to 320 pixels once
you get to 320 pixels your screen is too
small to fit our content buddy so we're
going to make our content stay exactly
the same size and you will just have to
use your thumb or whatever to actually
maneuver around the website and try
scale it wherever you need to go but
like I said not many screens are smaller
than 300
20 pixels so we don't really have to
worry about that too much
and that is all I have for you guys in
