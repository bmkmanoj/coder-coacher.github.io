here and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about how to echo out variables
into the browser so you might say well
we have already echoed out some
variables into the browser and yes we
have but I want to talk about this a
little bit more using concatenation to
concatenate variables to the end of a
string so it makes a lot more sense and
then I'm also going to talk to you guys
about something called string
interpolation okay so instead of just
echoing out name and age
let's try echo out a string and
concatenate the variables okay so let's
echo out my name is and we'll put a
space there and then we'll use the
full-stop to concatenate name and then
we'll put a full-stop again there so or
period symbol and then we'll leave a
space and say and I am age
don't forget the full-stop years old
okay so when we save this now and go
back to firefox instead of getting just
Quinton 21 our two variables printed on
the screen let's refresh this and as you
can see we now have my name is Quinton
and I am 21 years old so we can see that
we can indeed concatenate a variable
onto the end of a string and we can
actually concatenate multiple strings
with multiple variables okay and this
would work the same of instead of just
using a period
we could use commas and that would do
the exact same thing so if I go ahead
and I save this now when we go back to
Firefox and click refresh nothing
changes and that's because using a comma
is the equivalent of obviously using the
full stop or the period symbol okay now
as you can see I've also used single
quotes instead of double quotes but we
can do this with double quotes as well
and as you can see there's already
something that's starting to show but
let's just go ahead and we'll double
quote everything out okay and this is
obviously going to mean the same thing
as if we had single quotes over here but
if you guys can recall from the past few
tutorials I've told you guys that double
quotes actually have a special purpose
or a special meaning in PHP that is
different to single quotes okay and
that's what I'm finally going to talk to
you guys about now and that is called
string interpolation okay so if we ever
want to print out variables as part of a
string okay instead of using single
quotes we just need to go ahead and
surround everything with double quotes
and I can go and get it and get rid of
all these quotes in the middle that'll
ruin everything up okay and as you can
see I've got my starting quotes here and
my ending quotes here and if I run this
in Firefox now okay this is still going
to work and it's still going to print
out the exact same thing because
whenever we use double quotes PHP knows
okay I'm going to have to look through
this string for some variables okay and
if I find a variable there I'm going to
have to treat it as a variable
so we've got named eeeh and we've got AJ
those are two variables and when we go
back to Firefox now and click refresh
you can see that this still works so we
still get the exact same sentence
printed out on the screen
okay however let's say I used a single
quotation mark and a single quotation
mark okay you might expect this to do
the same thing
okay PHP is going to look through this
string and find a variable and print it
out okay but that's actually not what
happens okay let me just click refresh
and as you can see I've got my name is
Darla name and I am dollar age years old
okay
so PHP interprets this literally when
you're using a single quote so it's
actually literally going to print out
dollar name instead of my variable okay
so if I want to use a variable inside of
a string I have to use double quotes so
you might be thinking well that's
awesome every time I want to print out
variables I'll just use okay anytime
I'll ever want to print out a string
I'll just use double quotation marks and
it's not that simple
because let's say for instance this
instance this string did not contain any
variables and our winds ahead may use
double quotation marks PHP would waste
its time looking for variables not find
any and then continue okay so if you're
worried about your program running the
fastest like if you actually worried
about speed then you should still use
single quotation marks like that and end
it off there and concatenate your
variables on with the comma or with a
full stop okay so it would make or for a
lot better or a lot more efficient
program if you using single quotes and
then concatenating your variable okay so
you only need to use double quotes
wherever necessary and then just try to
use single quotes as much as you can
everywhere else it's just going to help
your program run a lot faster but let's
go back to having these double quotes
here okay and as you can see my variable
doesn't actually stick out okay because
over here I've got a blue variable but
over here I've got this dark gray bolded
variable okay so this is something that
is of personal preference to me but I
like to know wherever I'm using a
variable okay I don't want to have to
struggle to see my variables and so what
I like to do is go over to the style
configurator in notepad plus plus I'm
going to look for the PHP language and
here where it says string variable
okay these would be variables that are
inside of a string as you can see the
color is set to gray so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to change that over
to pink and then I'm also going to find
where it says variable here and change
that over to pink why pink I don't know
I guess I'm just in touch with my
feminine side but I guess it shows up
and it stands out really nicely so that
I can see wherever I'm using a variable
because nothing else in notepad plus
plus turns pink so it was one of the
only unused colors so now when I go
ahead and save this instead of having
blue variables I have pink ones and I
can see them nicely and clearly so they
stand out and that is why I like to
change my variables to pink so thank you
