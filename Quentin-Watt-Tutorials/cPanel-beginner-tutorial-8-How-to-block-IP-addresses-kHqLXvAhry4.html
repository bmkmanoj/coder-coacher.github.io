inhere and welcome to tutorial number 8
and in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
guys how to use the IP blocker if you
want to block certain IP addresses so
that is under the security tab or the
security panel so let's scroll down to
IP blocker and I'm gonna click on that
and this is incredibly straightforward
all you do is follow one of these
instructions so if you want to block a
single IP address then you'll take that
one single IP address that you want to
block copy that paste it in there I
assume that you will have a list of IPs
that you want to block from whatever
program detected that someone was
spamming or hacking you and then you go
ahead put that IP address and yeah click
Add and once you've done that the IP
address will appear down at the bottom
of the page just under currently blocked
IP addresses now you can also block an
entire range so you can block from 192
168 0 1 to 192 168 0.40 or to I mean
make it all the way to the end 2 5 5 so
yeah you could go ahead and block IP
addresses like that if you wanted to but
it is not very effective I'd say if you
put some IP addresses in here because
someone hacked your site you'll probably
land up in the same situation tomorrow
and the next day and the next day as
long as you you have people out there
that are attacking you like they'll just
switch to a different IP address as soon
as the one IP address is blocked so a
more common method is just to beef up
security on the front end of your site
and WordPress or Joomla have all these
different security plugins available if
you're using something other than
WordPress or Joomla like some custom PHP
site then you really need to look into
coding something like that especially if
you wanna
defend yourself against bots you'll see
the most common thing that people do is
add captures so then you'll have to fill
in that little thing prove that you are
a human and so yeah there's a lot more
effective than blocking IPs because I
find if you block on an IP they just
change their IP and they come back at
you and attack from a different IP so
it's up to you to decide whether you
want a block IPS or not but like I said
if you block an IP today then you're
more than likely gonna be blocking more
IPs tomorrow and they won't even be in
the same range as the the one that you
currently blocked so anyway that's all I
have for you in this tutorial don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like and share this
video it's really gonna help my channel
grow and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
