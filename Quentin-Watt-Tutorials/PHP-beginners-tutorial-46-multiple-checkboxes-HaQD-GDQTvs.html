here and welcome to tutorial number 46
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys a better way to handle check
boxes okay now some people do you like
to handle check boxes this way that I
showed you guys in the previous tutorial
okay a lot of text books or well just
books that you buy the teach you PHP
will teach you to handle a check box in
this way so that's why I made this video
but there is actually a much better way
to actually handle check boxes that
we're going to take a look at in this
tutorial okay so as you can see if take
a look at the code that we have in the
previous tutorial we're actually asking
the user a yes-or-no question do you
play League of Legends
yes or no and we're expecting them to
only select one of these options okay
but a check box doesn't actually work
that way because if I go over to this
check box over here you can see that we
can actually select both of them so if
you're going to ask the user a yes-or-no
question it's probably best to use a
radio button instead of a check box
which I will talk to you guys about in
the next video but for now let's
continue talking about check boxes and
I'm going to show you guys a much better
way to handle a check box okay so let's
get rid of all of this and ask the user
a question that makes sense for them to
have multiple answers and we'll just say
what are your favorite foods something
like that and we'll say foods and we'll
give them a bunch of different foods
that they can choose from okay so let's
go ahead and give them the option to
choose a burger and then we'll put in
our input
check box for that Vegas input type
equals checkbox and then we'll give that
a value of hmm
just burger I guess burger and then
we'll give it a name but this is where I
want you guys to obviously pay attention
because I'm going to do something a
little bit different to the previous
tutorial and that is I'm going to give
it a name of food but I'm going to add
in these square brackets now what that
means is that this all of our check
boxes are actually going to be stored in
an array within the array of our dollar
underscore post array and I know that
sounds kind of complicated but you'll
see everything is going to make sense in
the next couple of minutes so let's go
ahead and actually just break down here
and add in a few more options so I'm
going to just duplicate this line and
for our second element over here let's
give them the option of maybe checking
steak as their favorite okay and then we
got to rename this to steak then we'll
set a salad value just for all the
people that want to eat healthy food
salad and let's go ahead and put in a
we'll put in macaroni as one of the
foods as well so macaroni okay so now
we've got burger steak salad and
macaroni and they all have values that
correspond to what the user takes a
burger steak salad and macaroni okay but
more importantly we've given them all
the exact same name food with square
brackets and then food with square
brackets and again same thing okay
so it means that we're actually making
an array
a called food okay so now let's go over
and handle these checkboxes and to do
that I'm going to just delete all of
this code whoops I mean to say delete
there we go okay
and we'll put in some code to handle
those checkboxes and the way that we're
going to do that is we're actually going
to use a for each loop a to loop through
our array okay and so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to echo something
out so the user quickly will just say
echo out you select it and we'll put in
a break tag and we'll loop through below
over here and echo out each food item
that the user selected okay and let's go
ahead and say for each and of course we
got to put in these brackets and these
are curly braces and you guys should
know that from my tutorial on the for
each loop so if you guys haven't watched
that tutorial go back and watch the
tutorial on the for each loop and you
guys will be good to go now of course
the first argument that we need over
here is an array and we can go ahead and
put in our array dollar underscore post
food because this food value is actually
an array so when we go ahead and do that
this is actually this actually qualifies
as an array but if this does look a
little bit too complicated for you then
you could also do this as well so you
could copy that and just make an array
over here call it food and set that
equal to this value and then actually
just place in the value of food over
here and you can use the food array just
like that
it'll work just fine don't forget the
semicolon over there and then we can set
as key and value and again you guys just
watch my for tutorial on the for each
loop to understand why I'm putting in
all of these things okay and we don't
actually need to print out this key like
I need it over here in my description
but I'm not going to print it out so I'm
just going to go ahead in over here and
say echo dollar value and then we'll
append on a break tag so that everything
that we print out here will appear on a
new line and put in a semicolon and now
that I've done this and when I go back
to my browser lets click refresh you can
see we finally have our question over
here so what are your favorite foods
burger steak salad or macaroni go ahead
and take your favorites so I'm just
going to take three of them for now
we'll click Submit and it says you
selected burger steak and macaroni let's
go back here and change this up some so
let's just select steak and salad submit
and then you selected steak and salad so
how cool is that
we now have a much better way of
handling checkboxes and we can also
handle if multiple checkboxes were
ticked okay so that's all I have for you
