here and welcome to my very first video
in my PrestaShop beginner series and in
this video I'm going to give you guys a
brief introduction into PrestaShop and
just explain how it works so first of
all for those of you guys who are
wondering what is PrestaShop and
PrestaShop is this pretty awesome
ecommerce CMS or ecommerce platform
which is actually designed to be a
working ecommerce store right out of the
box so the thing is as soon as you've
installed PrestaShop whether it be on
their cloud or whether it be downloaded
and hosted on your local server or
something as soon as you install
PrestaShop it's already developed as a
shop so everything's all working and all
you have to do is configure a payment
gateway number one so that your clients
can get their money to you and then you
also need to configure a product or some
of your products and your carrier and
shipping options so that you can get
your products to the client just like
that and it really is that simple that's
all you got to do and then you've got a
working shop and let's take a look at
some of the advantages or some of the
features of PrestaShop so if we take a
look at the front end theme over here
you can see that right now looks pretty
good and we've got a slider and we can
also change currencies so from dollar to
Rand or if you guys even have other
currencies that you want to add you can
go ahead and do that
clients have the ability to sign in and
log in obviously so that they can use
their details from the past etc and also
so you can have a client database so you
got all of that will be able to change
the logo and all of these things but
this this is just the default theme so
we even able to change the theme but one
thing I want to mention is the default
PrestaShop theme in PrestaShop 1.6 is
also made with bootstrap so the great
thing is you have a shop that comes
out-of-the-box responsive and it'll work
on your
computer screen but it'll also work on
your mobile phone or even on your
tablet's so customers can really shop at
your store no matter what device they're
using or where they are it doesn't
really matter so yeah let's go back to
full screen now and yeah that is some of
the front-end features as well as having
the ability to add in all of our social
links and have a newsletter signup
button and all of that good stuff
and if we take a look at the backend
there are a few other great things
because like I said at the beginning of
the video PrestaShop was designed to be
an online store right from the start so
if we take a look at the backend over
here we've got a dashboard to give us
information about our shop and who's
shopping and how much stuff we've sold
etc and anything you would expect a shop
to have press the shop has built in as
well so we're able to create a catalogue
of our products and add new products etc
obviously orders we can handle our
orders invoices product returns credit
slips everything can be handled within
PrestaShop you so you don't have to like
have some external system like a lot of
shops do because WordPress add-ons and
things like that don't really have an
and orders tab like this with all of
these options and PrestaShop does which
is really great we've also got a
database of our customers so who all has
shopped at or with our PrestaShop site
before we've got all the addresses
shopping carts and information on
shopping carts that are open at the
moment so all of that stuff that you'd
expect from a shop is actually built
into PrestaShop which is great okay
shipping like I said we can just set up
our shipping carriers and there we go
we can now send our stuff to our clients
okay localization that's something I
spoke about on the front end as well
where we can change currencies based on
where our clients are in the world
because if we're only based in South
Africa like I am then we might only want
to round but if we're selling stuff
overseas like in America or whatever
then you want dollars right so we can do
all of that and there's a few other
settings so that is great and the other
thing is not only is the front end of
PrestaShop responsive the back office is
responsive as well so if I take a look
at my back office over here I can go
ahead and make changes to the back
office on my tablet or I could even make
changes to the back office on my phone
or something and it's going to work just
like that so I don't even have to be in
the office to make changes to my shop
well in the physical office but I do
have to be in this back office okay yeah
okay so yeah those are some of the
really cool features about PrestaShop
and those are things that stood out for
me and I really enjoyed but you'll
probably find that if you use PrestaShop
you're going to be able to pick up a lot
more cool things that you do like there
might be some things you don't like but
yeah we'll have to take a look and see
well first we have to use PrestaShop
okay so yeah that is PrestaShop now
let's talk about how to actually use
PrestaShop and if you go over to
PrestaShop comm then you see that right
at the top of the page over here we've
got create your first free or your free
online store and you want to use the
cloud option or you want to download
press the shop and install it somewhere
else and if you're not really sure what
you want to do like you don't know if
the cloud option is better or the
downloaded version is better you can go
ahead and click on this link and it's
going to take you to this page which is
going to explain what you get on each
package so if as you scroll down you can
see that we've got the ability to manage
our clients that's SEO optimized mobile
friendly so all of that stuff both of
them have or both versions of PrestaShop
have but when we get to hosting you can
see that
if you take the cloud option press the
shops going to host your site for you
whereas if you had to download the
downloaded version you'd have to find a
host yourself and automatic installation
obviously if press the shops hosting the
site for you then they'll install it for
you otherwise and whenever you download
it and install it on your own host
you're going to have to install
PrestaShop yourself but here is the
thing if you download press the shop you
get access to your source code and you
get access to your database so if you
ever want to make some changes to press
the shop like creating your own theme or
something like that
then you need the downloaded version
because PrestaShop is not going to let
you have access to your source code or
access to your database if you are using
their cloud version and the reason for
that is for everyone that's going to be
using the cloud version they want to
automatically update you to the latest
PrestaShop every time there's a new
PrestaShop available and if you have
access to your source code and your
database and then they update like and
you've made changes and then they update
your version of PrestaShop it means that
your website could break so that's the
only reason why that's taken away from
you is just because they want to be able
to automatically update you and they
don't want your website to break when
that happens and that's actually all I
have for you guys in this video so don't

grow and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
