here and I have been looking over an
article recently and this is an old
article that I found like seven years
ago which is all about the programmers
Creed so I'm going to leave a link to
that article in the description below
but I'm mostly just going to throw a
screenshot up here and yeah go ahead
take a look through that article read it
and let me know what you guys think but
I just want to explain or walk over some
of these parts because I think that this
article does a really good job at
explaining what it means to be a
programmer and this article was written
15 years ago but it's amazing how
relevant it still is so part one I state
your name do solemnly swear that I will
read directions carefully and follow
them and I think that this is so
important like there are so many people
who either don't read their instructions
or don't follow instructions in a video
maybe decide to skip a step somewhere
along the line and the problem is when
you do stuff like that it means that
whatever you skip still mess up in the
beginning can affect things later on and
then nothing works right so you have to
make sure that when you're following
instructions in a video that you follow
all the instructions to the T especially
if you're newer programming because if
you don't then yeah it's going to have
consequences later down the line and
something will work and then you're
going to complain and be upset because
something's not working and a lot of the
time at that point people turn to
blaming others we like to do that right
like oh my code is not working but I did
everything perfectly it's your fault
it's the person who made the
documentation fault it's not my fault I
did it all right meanwhile you didn't
actually do everything right you skip
the step or you decided to do something
differently somewhere along the line so
that's the thing if you decide to not
follow instructions purposefully or by
accident maybe you don't follow
instructions by accident then you kind
of need to assume that later on when
something doesn't work it's because you
messed up it's because somewhere along
the line you
get this down and you need to go back
and read the instructions again and make
sure that you did everything properly
part two of the programmers Creed is I
state your name do solemnly swear that I
will read documentation and an attempt
to work out problems myself before
pestering someone else with questions
and I think that that is so so so
important but the other factor to it is
that it requires a lot of discipline
because it means that you have to decide
to read through stuff and you have to
decide to do research on your own and
sometimes for a lot of new people they
don't want to do that writings like it's
nice to have people just explain stuff
to us or have people do stuff for us all
the time but the thing is if you really
want to succeed it as a programmer and
now the Sun is disappearing behind the
clouds but yeah if you really want to
succeed as a programmer then you need to
be able to be one of those people who
can do the research who is willing to
read through things and as it states
here by somebody who wrote this thing 15
years ago there is nothing worse to an
experienced programmer than a whiny new
programmer pestering you with questions
that a new programmer could have easily
answered for five with five minutes of
reading
I might have to misquote at that end
path a so go ahead and just read the
article in the description and let me
know what you think and part three to
the programmers Creed is I state your
name do solemnly swear that I will help
other programmers once I become one and
I'm going to agree with them here and
say that this is also incredibly
important because I think without
YouTube and without certain things like
w3 schools and all the other websites
out there that provide free resources I
wouldn't be the programmer that I am
today and because of that I also need to
be thankful and give back to the
community and that's another reason why
I have a YouTube channel because I make
content that hopefully will help others
and it doesn't have to be a YouTube
channel you can give back to the
community in any way
things like blogs things like popping
into forums and answering questions in
forums all of these things help
contribute back to the community and it
doesn't have to be one-on-one sitting
down teaching somebody how to code
so hopefully you read the article and
kind of make your own opinion on this
but yeah if you think that this article
doesn't do a good job explaining what it
means to be a programmer then let me
know in the comments below also if you
think that something should be added or
changed or if you don't agree with
something along the line then yeah leave
a comment let me know let's start a
discussion and we'll talk about this and
I think I'll make a follow-up video in
future talking about why I agree with
this and maybe I'll address some of your
points as well but before I end off the
video I just want to send a huge shout
out to these guys so these guys are my
patrons that contribute five dollars or
more every single month which goes a
long way to helping me make more videos
for you guys more often and if you like
my videos and you want to help me make
more than consider becoming a patron
also if you can't afford to give away
any money I know a lot of people really
want to then yes just subscribe leave a
comment like and share this video
because that's also going to help my
channel grow and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
