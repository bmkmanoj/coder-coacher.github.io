welcome back to tutorial number 4 in my
HTML and CSS series and in this video
I'm just going to show you guys how to
bold and italicize text and I'm also
going to show you guys what the
horizontal rule is and if this time I'm
going to show you guys what comments are
and how to use them but if we take a
look at our HTML here you can see that
we starting off with a blank body I
cleared everything out of there and
that's just because we didn't need to
use any of the previous code but it's
also because I prepared three paragraphs
beforehand and I'm just going to paste
them in now so if you take a look at
that that's just three plain old
paragraphs just the P tag so you guys
should know how to make a paragraph if
you watch the previous tutorial and yeah
that's that's it so let me just take a
look at this in Firefox just to show you
guys so there you have just three plain
old paragraphs but as you can see in the
second paragraph we say this text will
be bold and it isn't bold so let's go
ahead and make that bold and to do that
obviously we have to use a tag but it's
not what you guys might be thinking you
can't just come in here and rather tag
that says bold because as you can see it
hasn't turned blue and that means it's
not going to work because in HTML
whoever wrote the HTML or made HTML
decided that you have to use the word
strong so there we go
you use a strong tag to bold your text
and let me just go ahead all the way to
the India for now and then forward slash
strong cool so let's save that and then
go back to Firefox and click refresh and
as you can see we get one bold paragraph
but as you can see in the second part of
my paragraph ESS and this text won't be
bolded and that's because you don't have
to have all of the text in the in the
tag you can
just choose the specific words that you
want to be bolded and surround them in
the bold tag and you get bolded text
just like that so let me go ahead and
refresh and there you go you have just
one half of the paragraph bolded so
that's pretty cool and pretty easy I
mean you guys should know how to do that
and so the next thing I want to do is
italicize this next paragraph and it's
going to be just as easy as that so we
just have to learn what the new tag is
and to italicize text in HTML they
decided that you should use a tag called
the emphasis tag but you actually just
say II M for emphasis and then wherever
you want your talax to end then you just
support slash e m and now you'll see
this text will be italics is now going
to be italicized so let me go ahead and
refresh that and look at that and while
I wasn't lying to you guys we have
italicized text so that was pretty easy
yeah now we can go on to the next part
of the tutorial how easy was that cheese
and the next thing I said I was going to
show you guys was how do you make a
horizontal rule and if you guys don't
know what a horizontal rule is then it's
just a straight line that goes all the
way across your page kind of like if you
were ever working in preschool or
primary school and they always told you
to rule off after your work and then
start your new work below that ruled off
line that is what a horizontal rule is
so to make a horizontal rule you just
open up your tag and then the keyword is
HR and it's a single tag so you don't
need to add in another tag anywhere else
which means you put the forward slash
after the keyword like that and when you
click Save and go back to Firefox you
see we get this nice little
over here and if we go ahead and copy
that to the next space that we have here
we now have divided up all of our
paragraphs so as you can see we've
divided all our part all of our
paragraphs up with these two lines so
that that's quite useful if you ever
writing a blog perhaps and you wanted to
separate all your blog entries with a
line and that's how you would do that
pretty easy so yeah we've actually got
tons of time left and we can go on to
comments so let me just do this here
quickly okay and if you guys don't know
what comments are then they're actually
like these little notes that you can
leave to yourself if you guys have ever
done any other programming languages
before then you'll see like your
comments never show up on your whatever
you're programming but they're just
there to help you or help anyone else
that might be looking at your code just
to see where or what what you made
certain things for okay so how do I
explain let me just make an example here
where I say this page was written by
Quinton what okay so you know if you
just make normal text like that and save
it it's gonna show up in the browser and
it says this page was written by Quinton
what but you actually didn't want that
that you wanted to comment that out you
didn't want it to show up in the browser
so to make a comment you go smaller than
and then exclamation mark
- - and as you can see everything over
here turned green and that means that
it's a comment so just to end our
comment off in the correct place we go -
- greater than sign and now you can see
all of this is come back to normal and
we just have green text over here
which is this page was written by
Quinton what and if you save that and
take a look at that new browser this
page was written by Quinton what does
not show up anymore so as you can see a
comment might just help you just explain
to other people that might be looking at
your code why you use it or why you use
that certain code that way or just leave
a note luck because now people know that
you are in fact the person that wrote
this webpage and as you can see the
comment doesn't show up in the browser
but everyone that might be reading your
source code can see that you you wrote
that page just also guys be careful
whenever leaving a comment if I
right-click in my browser and click
inspect element I can open this up and I
can still read your comment here so if
you guys have like any secret
information that you put in a comment
that you don't want anyone to see just
remember not to publish that online but
for this example where you have this
page was written by Quinton Watts if
you're a freelancer you might want to
include that in every single webpage
that you ever writes just so that you
can prove to people that you wrote it
which pretty cool or like bring business
into your self I guess mm-hmm anyways
that's all I have for you guys in this
tutorial so I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial and thanks for watching
