here and welcome to my frequently asked
questions playlist so yeah I get asked a
lot of questions very often sometimes
well most of the time it's the same
question over and over and over again
and instead of me like responding to it
over and over and over again I thought
I'd just make this playlist of
frequently asked questions so that some
of you guys can get your answer without
having to contact me and then wait for
me to reply so the reason I decided to
make this playlist is first of all for
convenience but there is a much bigger
reason behind it and that is the second
reason which is people are contacting me
asking me things and then I might give
them a response that they weren't
expecting like a No
and then generally they get quite angry
with me and so I don't know if I'm if
it's the way I'm saying no or if I just
they were expecting that I have to say
yes or if they're just trolling me and
so like yeah I'm just trying to combat
being trolled by people or combat having
angry messages in my inbox so I'm gonna
be answering these questions one video
at a time to try and keep the questions
as all questions and answers as short as
possible because I know that nobody's
gonna want to watch a 20 minute long
video with a whole bunch of questions
and then look for the one that they were
looking or wanting to hear the answer to
its rather just easier to have two
minute videos with the title that is the
question that they'd be asking and then
yeah that way you guys will be able to
find your question a lot easier so I'm
gonna link to a playlist over here you
can guys can check out the titles see
what questions you want to know the
answers to and watch those and if you or
don't want the answer to that question
then simply skip that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
