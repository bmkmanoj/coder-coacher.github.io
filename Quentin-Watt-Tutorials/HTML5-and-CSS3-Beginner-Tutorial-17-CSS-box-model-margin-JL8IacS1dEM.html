to tutorial number 17 and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about margins and like I said in
the previous tutorials a margin is the
space around the outside of our box so
if I just go ahead and copy this header
and paste it down here you'll be able to
see a little bit clearer what I'm
talking about so let's go ahead and run
this in Firefox and as you can see we
now have two headers they're exactly the
same with the padding and then the
border but in between our two headers
we've got this little bit of white space
over here this space is actually our
default margin which is about 15 pixels
or so because it's about the same size
as my cursor so by default we have this
clear spaced margin but we can obviously
change that margin to whatever we would
like it to be siliceous go back to our
CSS over here and using the margin
property we can change that margin so
let's just go put it at zero pixels for
now and then you'll see what happens so
zero pixels and we can click refresh and
now you can see there's absolutely no
space between our two headers but if we
go back here and we set this margin
equal to 30 pixels then we're going to
get 30 pixels of space all the way
around our box model so that's pretty
cool and that's what we use margins for
just to create a little bit of space
between our boxes and the one thing I
want you guys to notice is just that
margins are actually transparent so as
you can see this space over here is
white and all the space all the way
around our box is actually white because
the background of our website is white
but if our maybe set the background to
green then we'd still have a green
background in our margin and that's
because the margin is transparent it's
not like padding which actually kept the
same color so as you can see padding
kept the same color as our background of
our content so the padding is blue but
our margin is actually transparent and
as you can see the other thing I want
you guys to notice is just that the
padding didn't change when we changed
our margin and our border didn't change
but only the margin change so guys don't
get confused between padding and margins
margins are on the outside of our border
and padding is on the inside of our
border so that's pretty much all I have
for you guys in this tutorial and don't
forget to come back and watch the next
video I would appreciate it Lots if you
