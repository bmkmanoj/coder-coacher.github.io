here and in this video we're going to
take a look at the document ready event
handler which occurs as soon as the page
loads so this will allow us to run some
code as soon as the page has loaded or
as soon as the document object model is
ready and yeah to do that we're
obviously going to be using this script
which I included in the previous video
and make sure that your jQuery script
tag is above your actual script tag
where you're going to be writing your
jQuery because that actually matters if
they were swapped around you would
probably notice that your codes not
going to work so yeah we've got the
paragraph over here which I used in the
previous tutorial as well and that's
just got an ID of paragraph and will be
an ID of Perak and we'll be using this
in later on in the tutorial so let's get
started with actually listening for the
event of the document being ready and to
do that we're going to select our
documents so remember in jQuery whenever
we're selecting something we're going to
use the dollar and then we're going to
use parentheses and whatever we're
selecting is going to go inside of that
which in this case we're selecting the
document so I'm just going to type in
the word document and then we're
listening for it to be ready so document
dot ready and that's going to have some
parentheses as well and that means we're
waiting for when the document is ready
and now what I'm going to do is type the
word function and this basically is not
really like a normal function that we
usually type in other languages whenever
we type a function in other languages we
actually have to type the word function
give it a name supply some arguments in
the parentheses that kind of thing but
in jQuery this is kind of just like well
it's actually called an anonymous
function I think and what it does is
is just tells the browser okay Otto's
jQuery okay when this happens we need
some code to be run and it's probably
going to be more than one line so we
have to type this word function and that
is just going to basically make an
anonymous function so it doesn't have a
name in other words and whatever we want
to happen must go in between these two
curly braces so that one and that one
and that's pretty much what's going to
happen and we also have to end this off
with a semicolon I didn't do that in my
previous video so just make sure that
when you're creating little statements
like this in jQuery you actually end
them off with a semicolon and now we can
actually do something
so we're basically listening for when
the document is ready we need to do
something and whatever we want to do is
going to go in here so in this case I'm
going to take this paragraph and I'm
actually going to hide it as well yeah
what's the SS I'm going to hide this
paragraph so I'm just going to add in a
style attribute and I'm going to set
this equal to display:none so that means
if I try to run this in Firefox right
now this paragraph is not going to
appear so let's run that and as you can
see we've got a web page that's blank
even though this paragraph is actually
here it's not being displayed in the
browser okay and that's because of this
CSS rule that we added in here in line
and it's probably not best to add CSS in
line like this if you guys have watched
my HTML videos I do tell you that you
should be adding CSS using an external
stylesheet but just for the purpose of
this tutorial that's what we're doing
and now with jQuery I'm actually going
to make that paragraph fade in and get
displayed so first of all we have to
select that paragraph and we're going to
do that by selecting by ID
so I'm actually going to add in these
quotation marks here and type in a hash
symbol or pound key or whatever you want
to call that a shop symbol and I'm going
to type in the ID of the element that I
want to select which in this case is
para and I'm going to paste that in
there and what we want to do here is
fade this in so I'm going to say dot
fade in and the eye has to be a capital
so just make sure where I'm using caps
you are using caps and you should be
fine
and this fade in function is going to
take one argument so this is basically a
function that we're calling and the
function or the argument that it's going
to take is how fast we would like to
fade our paragraph in and we can do this
with an amount of seconds so let's say I
typed in 1000 and that would be 1000
milliseconds or 1 second and if we type
in some words like we can type in fast
then that'll make sure it fades in
really fast or we could type in the word
slow and that will go slowly so those
are 2 jQuery presets but if you don't
like those presets you can actually add
an amount of seconds like I told you
guys before where you can add
milliseconds which would be 1 second is
1000 milliseconds but let's start this
off with actually a slow fade in so I'm
going to click Save and if I go back to
this page over here and run this in
Firefox then you'll notice that as soon
as the page loads you actually have our
paragraph fading in so quite slowly
there and we could actually change this
up a little bit so if we wanted that to
be even slower I could probably put
something in like 4,000 milliseconds
which would be 4 seconds and if we go
back over to Firefox and click refresh
then you can see that it fades in a lot
more slowly so that is how we use the
documents ready
eventhandler and that's basically when
it gets cold is as soon as the page
loads we're going to run some functions
but it doesn't have to be the entire
page it just has to be as soon as the
Dom or the document object model is
ready then this will be called so the
rest of the page might not be finished
loading yet but as long as the document
object model is ready then this event
handler will run and that's all I have
for you guys in this video so don't

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
