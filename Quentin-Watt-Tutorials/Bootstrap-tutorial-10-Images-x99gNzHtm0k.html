here and welcome to tutorial number 10
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to work with images in
bootstrap because there are actually a
bunch of different things that we can do
with our images so one of the really
awesome things that bootstrap allows us
to do is actually make our images
responsive so you don't land up having a
really big image that's you know larger
than its parent or its parent container
so just to show you guys an example of
that let's take a look at what I've got
over here so right now you can see I've
got a container and inside my container
I've got a row and here's the important
part because inside of that row I have a
div that is set to take up only four
columns on a medium device and six on an
extra-small device which means our image
that we add should only take up a
quarter of this or a third of the screen
so like from here to somewhere around
here our image should end but let's go
ahead and add an image and see what
happens so I'm going to add an image tag
over here and I'm going to give this
image a source of something so source is
equal to and you can see that I've got
an image over here and obviously my path
to that image is going to be images Mac
jpg so let's go Mac dot jpg oops and I'm
going to go add my images folder in
front of that okay so now we've linked
to the image let's go ahead and save
this now and see exactly what happens
I'm going to hit refresh and you can see
that now with this really big image
which is actually taking up definitely
more than the column size so like I said
this column is set to take up all this
div is take set to take up four columns
and four columns should kind of end
somewhere around here where my mouse is
and obviously this image is way bigger
than that so that is because M
in bootstrap by default are not
responsive and if we want them to become
responsive we have to add a class so I'm
going to go ahead and add a class of IMG
- responsive and that is going to make
my image a responsive image which means
it will always fit 100% of its parent so
let's hit refresh and you can see that
now our image only takes up those four
columns that we assigned to this div so
it's not going to be bigger than that
and it's not going to be smaller than
that
it is going to be 100% the size of its
parent and obviously see if I change the
size of the parents so let's say I
decide I want this image to take up six
columns instead of four I could go ahead
and change that and my image will scale
to fit that size and of course as the
screen gets smaller because this is
responsive the image also gets smaller
so that is quite awesome that bootstrap
added that functionality and yeah I just
wanted to show you guys how to do that
but there is something else I can show
you guys and that is how to make image
shapes in bootstrap
so bootstrap actually allows us to
create different shapes and we actually
have three shapes three shapes to choose
from three shapes hmm that might have
sounded weird but yeah we've got three
shapes to choose from image rounded
image circle and image thumbnail and
I'll show you what each one of those
does so let's go ahead and add a class
to this image of image - rounded and
then I'm going to copy this class and
paste that three times so now we have
three rows and three of them with taking
up six columns each and I'm going to
change this one to image circle and I'm
going to change the last one to image -
thumbnail and now if I go ahead and hit
save
and we jump back over to the browser and
hit refresh you can see that our first
image now has rounded corners might be a
little bit hard to see on that little
YouTube player but it's there the image
now has rounded corners then image
circle would probably have worked better
if I used a square image because if this
image was square then this would be a
perfect circle but of course I've used a
longer rectangular shaped image so now
it kind of looks like an ellipses or
what's the webknight ellipses elliptical
circle something like that yeah and then
the last one over here is an image with
a like white border and then a thin dark
line around the outside as well so yeah
that is what image thumbnail does and
I'll leave it to you to kind of try each
class out and take a closer look at what
each one of these classes does but I
thought that these shapes are pretty
awesome especially the image circle I
use that quite a bit
and that is all I have for you guys in
