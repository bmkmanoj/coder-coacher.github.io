here and welcome to tutorial number four
and in this tutorial we're going to take
a look at FTP accounts so I'm going to
show you guys how to set up an FTP
account and then I'm also going to set
up an FTP client and upload and download
some files from the server in fact I
don't think I'll download any but I will
upload some so I've got a little bit of
an issue right here and it's an issue
that some of you guys might have as well
where FTP accounts are set to zero out
of zero so I got a really cheap hosting
package and I know some of you guys
might have this issue as well
where you don't have any ftp accounts
and that that's fine because these are
additional ftp accounts so you don't
need to have additional ftp accounts but
it is nice to have for certain
situations so there is a default one
that we can make use of and i'm going to
show you guys how to make use of that
one but let's take a look at this FTP
accounts page and see what's on there so
I just opened it up in a new tab which
is over here and the reason why is I
just didn't want to lose this page
anyway you'll see that when I open this
page I've got the option to add an
account even though over here it's set
to zero so I'm going to get an error if
I fill in this form but let's fill it in
anyway and you guys can see just how to
add an account so the first thing we
have to do is create a username which
would be my login username and I'm just
going to set that to Quinton password
I'm going to just use the password
generator so go ahead and copy that tick
the box make sure that you actually have
copied it and paste it in a safe place
use the password and that will create a
very strong password and then you'll see
below we have a directory and a quota so
directory basically just allows you to
set up a specific directory for the user
so this is why you might want to have an
additional ftp account is if someone
needs to access your server but you
don't want to give them full access to
everything then you can set up the
location just for where they can ftp
into so just give them one certain
directory put that directory path over
here like right now we would be ft
peeing into public HTML slash Quinton
and that's fine this file doesn't exist
but if it did exist then that's the one
place I would be allowed to go and quota
just lets you set a quota of bandwidth
so if you know that this person's only
supposed to upload one file you can set
them a certain amount of bandwidth and
that way they won't upload a whole bunch
of rubbish otherwise you can leave this
at our limited if you know they're going
to be uploading and downloading files
from your server quite often anyway once
you've done that click create FTP
account and it will create the account
but you can see I've got the error and
like I said that is because I have zero
additional FTP accounts so that is how
to set one up if you do have additional
accounts it would have created it and
that account would appear down here at
the bottom of the page well it would
actually appear on this one but you can
see we've got special FTP accounts so
out of these special FTP accounts this
one is the default one that I'm able to
use and yeah I can get the username and
the password for this by clicking on
configure FTP clients and you can see
I've got a username I've got a host and
I've got a port and one thing we're
missing here is a password but by
default if you're going to use this
special FTP account you're going to be
able to use the same password that you
use for cPanel so when your hosting
provider when your hosting provider set
up cPanel for you they should have sent
you an ftp password otherwise you can
use the same one as you used for cPanel
and
it should be fine so let me open up my
FTP client here and you can see that I'm
using a program called FileZilla which
is free you can download it it works for
Windows and Mac and what I want to do is
set up a new FTP accounts so I can quick
connect by just putting my host my
username password and port over here by
grabbing them all from then putting here
but if I know I'm going to connect to
this account very often I'll set up a
new server by clicking on that icon
click on new site create Josie Corp as a
site and then I'll add in my hostname
which is this thing over here and we
don't actually have to have FTP dot our
URL for most sites it'll actually just
work without the FTP but you can use the
FTP there if you want it to same thing
then port I can see is 21 so that is
default most so hosting providers will
use 21 as your FTP port unless they are
not following standards then logon type
we need to change this to normal so that
we can put in a username and a password
so I've got a user name over here and
I'm going to paste that in over here and
then I'm going to copy and paste the
same password that I use for cPanel I'm
going to put that over here and and then
I'm going to click on connect and you
can see we're resolving an address so
this is like the status of our
connection going on here right now it's
verifying certificate so a window popped
up that just asked me to hit OK because
the server certificate was unknown and
yeah now you can see we've got some
stuff that changed in these two blocks
well actually just this one so this is
our server I'm connected to the server
in this block and this block is my local
computer so
if I expand this you can see the files
on my computer and right now we're on
the Quinton the username Quinton and on
the desktop and you can see that there
is an index file another page and an
admin directory and these two are
actually hidden files on Mac so don't
worry about them they're hidden I can't
see them but FileZilla can actually see
them so it's picking them up here but if
I were to minimize these windows or
remove them away you can see I don't
have those files yet but I do have my
index file my another page file and my
admin file so let's or my admin folder
let's upload those files to my server so
let's pull FileZilla up here again and
I'm going to go to the public HTML
directory because that's where all the
files that we want people to see must go
and I'm going to upload another page by
just clicking on it and hitting upload
and it goes from this block to this
block and now it's on my server and I
can verify that if I go to the file
manager and I already have this open I'm
gonna get reload and there we go another
page that HTML has been uploaded to the
server and I can also visit that page by
going to Josie Capcom / another page dot
HTML and there we go hey you I am
another page so that is uploaded let's
go back to FileZilla and I want to
upload this admin folder and this is
something we're going to be taking a
look at in the next tutorial but this is
just a folder with another index file
inside of it and I'm going to go ahead
and upload that and all this folded has
is just another page so if I change the
URL here I can go to admin the admin
folder and there we go we're on the
admin page and if I come back here and
hit reload you can see it was
successfully uploaded so yeah that is
how to
load files to your server using FTP and
if you ever want to download them you
can do the same thing just highlight
them right-click and hit download and
they're going to be downloaded so yeah
that is all I have for you guys in this
