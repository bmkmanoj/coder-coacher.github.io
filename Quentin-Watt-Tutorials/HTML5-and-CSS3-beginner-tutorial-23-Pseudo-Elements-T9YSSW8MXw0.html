welcome to tutorial number 23 and in
this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys
how to work with pseudo elements in HTML
so in the previous tutorial we looked at
pseudo classes which are very similar
and in fact a lot of people might think
pseudo elements are exactly the same
thing because they kind of are except a
pseudo class is kind of a class that
doesn't exist whereas a pseudo element
is more of an element than it is just a
specific class right so let's create a
paragraph and I'm gonna put some lorem
ipsum in here so I'm going to type and
lorem and then I'm gonna hit tab and if
you're using sublime this should happen
it should add in a full paragraph of
lorem ipsum right if it doesn't work try
googling it maybe it is different on
Windows then Mac alright so here we have
a paragraph and what I want to do now is
style this so let's take a look at this
and the browser real quick and it is you
know quite a long paragraph I'm just
gonna zoom in to make that a little bit
more clear and let's style our paragraph
but I'm gonna style a pseudo element in
this paragraph so I'm going to select
the first letter so that is an element
if you think about it this letter it
exists it's there on the screen and I
can select it as a letter or trend but
treat it as an element therefore that's
why we say it is a pseudo element than
not a class right and I'm going to give
this a font size of 200% which will make
it twice as big as the other text in the
paragraph and then I'm also going to
change the color to blue or whatever
color you want to do let's hit refresh
and now you can see we've got this
really big L it's you know it's twice
the size of it
or the other text on the page and it's
also blue so we can treat this first
letter as if it were in element all
right we can also do the same thing with
the first line of this paragraph so
let's come back here and hit refresh and
now it selects the entire first line and
it applies the same styling so we've got
the font size and the the color changing
there nice thing about that is it will
automatically detect how long the line
is and just make that first line or
apply that styling to the first line
right so if i zoom out a little bit you
can see the line got longer and so all
of that text also changed to blue as
well if i zoom in the line gets a little
bit shorter and all of that text and
changes and the text that moved out the
new line you know loses that styling
alright so there we go we've done that
now let's take a look at the next
selector I want to show you guys which
is before and after so let's go for
before and I'll just remove that styling
but what the before element allows us to
do is add some text before our paragraph
so let me go ahead and just remove
everything except maybe this first
sentence so the paragraphs are lot
shorter to work with and now we have
this this paragraph here but I want to
add some text before or something before
right then I can use the paragraph
selector selected before elements and
then add in
some styling so I'm going to add in
content and I'm going to add maybe just
the word sum or something right and that
allows us to add content before our text
but this has been put in with CSS so
you'll notice that I can select normal
text like this but if I try to select
the something I can't select it it's
it's been put in there with CSS it's
almost treated as if it were an image or
something rather than text so this can
be used if you ever want to put a little
bit of content in before a prior
paragraph and you can do the same thing
for after so you can put the text in
after a paragraph and now we have
something at the end of the paragraph
but I think for the most part people
generally put in like a full stop and
then they usually use this to clear
whenever we do float and clear which
we'll probably do in a previous tutorial
or in a future tutorial in a previous
tutorial and it is also useful for
sometimes putting in icons so let me
just say before and I'll just use this
for now seeing as we're not linking to
any icons but you'll see I get to put
this little hash symbol in on a hash but
what is this thing called a dash before
the paragraph and if I have obviously a
few paragraphs then they all get that -
save come back here refresh so they all
get that little dash before them and
they almost look like a little bit of a
list and in future when I show you guys
how to add your own custom fonts and
things like that to your HTML documents
you can add in your own icon over here
and then
icon will appear before the text as well
I just want to send a shout out to my
