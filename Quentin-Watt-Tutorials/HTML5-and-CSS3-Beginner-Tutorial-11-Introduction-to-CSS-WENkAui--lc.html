to tutorial number 11
and in this tutorial we are finally
gonna start writing some CSS so just in
case you guys didn't watch my previous
videos or maybe you forgot and you just
found this video by accident or
something CSS stands for cascading style
sheets and it's pretty much the language
that we use to make our website look
pretty so we use CSS to change the color
of our text change the font and that
kind of thing
and there are actually a few different
ways that we can use to add CSS to our
web page and one of these ways is called
an internal style sheet which is what
I'm going to be showing you guys in this
tutorial so to add an internal style
sheet to your web page you need to come
up here to the head of your document and
inside your head you need to add in two
style tags so style and style and
obviously that one is to end it off and
in your first style tag you have to add
an attribute called type and you need to
set this equal to text slash CSS Nazi SS
SS CSS and inside here is where we'll be
putting all of our CSS code so I'm just
going to go ahead and save that and now
in order to start styling stuff on our
web page we need to actually select an
element that we want to style so in my
body of my web page here all I've
actually got is just this one paragraph
that says this is an example paragraph
and why not just go ahead and style that
paragraph so in order to select that
paragraph we're just going to type in P
and then we're going to open up and
close our two curly braces and inside
there we're going to select what what we
want to change about our paragraph so
what property do we want to change
and that is the color and I'm actually
gonna just change the color to red so
what you do now is add in a colon and
then you type in red and after you
finished making up whatever your style
needs to be then you have to add in a
semicolon so let's go ahead and save
that and then run this in Firefox and
there we go we actually get a nice red
paragraph if you take a look at that
okay so let me just go back here and
explain what I did real quick this is a
paragraph and what we did was we
selected it sorry excuse me I made a
mistake this is a selector and we use
the selector to select whatever we want
to change on our web page and in this
case it was the paragraphs are selected
the paragraph and then we opened up our
curly braces and closed them and inside
here we put we chose what property we
wanted to change for our paragraph and
in this case I just chose the color now
there are actually hundreds of different
properties I mean you can change the
font family font style font type font
size font weight all these different
types of properties that you can change
and you'll probably go find a list of
all the properties somewhere on Google
or whatever and after that what we did
was we set our color equal to a value so
this over here is the value and the
value that I chose to set makalah to was
just red and then what we did was we
ended off our statement with a semicolon
and the colon over here means equals I
don't know why they did that in CSS they
just made a colon equals equals you know
what I'm saying so yeah and you can
actually you don't have to just tap in
one of these things for every element
that you want to style you can actually
style multiple properties of one
elements inside one selector
so I'm actually just gonna space this
out a little bit neater and inside here
okay we've set the color to red and now
what we can do is maybe change the font
family so you type in font - family and
then colon four equals and then we can
set this equal to sans-serif and
semicolon and now when we go back to our
paragraph you should see the the font
family should change to send serif so
that's pretty cool and that's all I've
got for you guys in this tutorial I hope
you guys are excited about learning
about CSS and I will see you guys in the
next tutorial
