here and in this video we're still
talking about jQuery selectors and I'm
going to show you how to select multiple
elements at the same time so you'll
notice that I've got a form over here
and inside of this form I've got an
input with a type of button and I also
have a paragraph that says click me so
if we run this in Firefox we basically
have this form show up in our browser
and if I click on the button nothing
happens and if I click on the paragraph
nothing happens so we need to start
creating the jQuery that is actually
going to handle the button click and the
paragraph click but before we do that I
actually want to give each one of these
elements and ID so I'm going to give my
input my button an ID of button and I'm
also going to give my paragraph an ID of
Perak so now each one of these has an ID
sorry for the squeaker but now let's
take a look at how to work with these in
jQuery so you know that if I wanted to
select one of these elements on my page
I'd go ahead and not you know open up my
normal selection tags and I'd add in
these quotation marks and because I've
given them an ID
I can maybe select my button by its ID
of button using hash tag button like
that and then I can listen out for the
click like this so on click what do we
want to do well we want to do something
so we'll run a function and we'll break
down a line and end that off with a
semicolon so you already know how to
select an element by ID like this now
whatever I want to happen should go over
here so let's just alert something out
like something was clicked so I'm going
to click Save here or I'm actually gonna
hit ctrl s on my keyboard rather but if
we go back over to our browser and click
refresh now now whenever we click this
button we get our alert box popped up
that says something was clicked but if I
click on the paragraph nothing happens
yet but again the button still works so
now I want to show you how to actually
select both this button and that
paragraph with the same selector all
selecting at once and the way we do that
is by just adding in a comma and then
adding in the ID or the selector for
whichever element we want to select next
in this case we're going to select this
paragraph by ID so I'm going to say
hashtag para and when I click Save now
now if I click the button or if I click
the paragraph we're listening for both
of those both of those elements to be
clicked and then we'll alert out the
exact same message so this code will run
no matter which one of these two
elements has been clicked so if I go
back over to Firefox now and I click
refresh when I click the button the
alert box pops up and if I click OK I
can get rid of that if I click on the
paragraph the alert box pops up again so
that is how we use multiple selectors in
jQuery and that's all I have for you in
this video so it's a nice short one and
I will see you guys next time don't
