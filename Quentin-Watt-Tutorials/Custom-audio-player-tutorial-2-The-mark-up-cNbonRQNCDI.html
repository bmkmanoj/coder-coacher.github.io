here and this is tutorial number two in
my custom audio player series so in this
tutorial we're going to be taking a look
at all of the HTML content that we're
going to need to add to this page in
order to create our audio player so if
you guys forgot what our audio player
looks like then let me go over to
Firefox over here and this is pretty
much what we are going to be building so
we've got our play button we've got all
of this stuff I explained it all in the
previous video I shouldn't be trying to
explain it now but yeah this is what
we're going to need to do so the first
thing that you can see here over here is
that we've centered this audio file
we've centered the audio player so the
way I did that was by putting it all in
one big box that was going to handle the
centering for us so I'm going to do that
by creating a div tag and I'm going to
give this div tag an ID of wrapper and
by wrapper I'm not talking about $0.50
or jay-z or anything like that so yeah
lame joke I know but I hope you guys did
laughs now I'm going to be taking a look
at what we're going to need to put
inside of this actual wrapper because
this wrappers just going to Center
everything so we still need to put our
audio track in here so to do that I'm
going to open up an audio tag and I'm
going to close my audio tag off and if
you guys are not familiar with the audio
tag I do speak about it in my previous
tutorial series so go ahead and take a
look at that if you need a little bit
more detail but the only attribute that
I'm going to give this audio tag right
now is an ID and I'm going to give that
an ID of my track okay and what this is
going to do is just obviously identify
our track and we're going to use that
with JavaScript later on whenever we
want to
cause and play this track okay
then I'm going to give this a track a
source tag and the source tag is going
to be set equal to well it's going to
have an attribute sorry that is going to
be set equal to the source of the actual
audio track so here's where things get a
little bit tricky
I will admit there are quite a few guys
who don't really seem to understand this
concept but whenever we are working with
our track and it's in a different file
then we're going to have to specify the
full file path or at least a relative
file path okay so right now you can see
that in my directory structure over here
I have my index.html file which is what
we're working on right now so that is
the actual page then we have our main
dot CSS file and you know we're not
working on that just yet but that is
going to obviously be our CSS then we've
got our controls like j/s which is going
to be our JavaScript file but if I go
one folder back over here then you can
see that I've actually named this folder
tutorial code and that's really not very
important but that is basically where
the code for this tutorial is going to
go my code was my code that I was
testing and showing you guys earlier
which is what you see here in the
browser if I go back here we've got my
images file which is where all my images
are going to be coming from later and I
have an audio file or audio folder where
all my audio files are situated at the
moment okay and the file that we're
going to be using specifically is night
owl so how do I tell HTML to go back one
file or back one folder then down the
audio folder and select this track well
it is quite simple but like I said a lot
of guys seem to become
used about this so I'm going to say dot
dot slash and that means hey go back one
folder so we would be technically
sitting over here in this index file and
we're going to go back one folder so one
folder back okay well what do you want
me to do now what we want you to go to
this audio file so audio and what do you
want to do from there well the next
thing you're going to have to do is
select this track night-owl dot mp3 so
I'm just going to type that name in here
and that means my track should work but
I'm also going to give this a type just
in case the browser kind of doesn't
understand what type of file this is so
we're gonna have that a type of audio
slash mp3 and that should be fine okay
so now we've got our div tag we've got
our audio tag let's add the rest of the
content and if you guys know anything
about the audio tag you know that this
actually creates an audio file or loads
the audio file into the page but it
doesn't actually display anything so
what we want to display now is these
controls so we need to create them and
the way I did that was by using a
navigation tag so nav and ending nav and
then I'm going to give my nav tag a
child so div and I'm going to give this
div an ID of default bar so default bar
and that has to be Cabell okay and I'm
going to end this default bar off so
this default bar in case you guys are
confused is actually this bar up at the
top here so if I click refresh its it
well the default bar is this gray bar
okay
now let's go ahead and create an another
div inside
this so I'm going to say div and ending
div and I'm going to give this div
inside of here an ID of a progress bar
so progress bar and I'm assuming that a
Sevilla Capitol it does according to the
way I coded my stuff okay cool
and if you guys don't know what the
progress bar is then that is going to be
the blue part of this bar that actually
moves along as the video starts playing
or audio track starts playing okay so
we've got our default bar we've got our
progress bar and then the next thing we
need to do is add in the section for our
buttons so I'm going to create another
div tag here and I'm going to give this
an ID of buttons and this is where our
buttons are going to go so the play
button the mute button and we're
actually going to put the duration of
the track in there as well so we're
going to have to do here is open up a
button and we're going to close the
button off so button and I'm going to
give this a type of button which you
know technically you don't need this
attribute but I'm putting it in there
just in case and we're going to give
this an ID of whoopsie jump down a line
play button so play while I'm hitting
all the wrong keys today so play button
and then I'm going to duplicate that
well actually only needed to duplicate
it once the next one is going to be the
pause button so pause button and I'm
using capitals here so just make sure
you're using Cape capitals the same and
that shouldn't be pause as well it
should be mute okay so play
button and mute button get the head
right okay seeing as I got it wrong I
hope you guys will get it right okay so
then the next thing we're going to do is
add in a span tag and this is going to
have an ID of current time and that is
going to be that how much time has
passed in this video and I'm going to
set that or I'm going to give it an
inner HTML of 0 : 0 0 and we're going to
end that off and this just means that by
default if even if the JavaScript fails
to load and there's a problem we're
still going to be showing that we're at
0 seconds and then I'm going to go ahead
and add in a slash over here and to be
honest I'm probably just going to copy
this and paste that here ok and this is
going to show the full duration so I'm
going to change this ID to feel full
duration and we're going to leave the
inner HTML at 0 0 0 so just in case
maybe the file fails to load or
something then we're still showing that
we're just we're showing something but
it's 0 seconds so then we know that you
know the file is zero seconds that we
can't actually play anything and then
I'm going to hmm No ok yeah that's fine
all that content is done then the next
thing I'm going to do here is load in
our JavaScript file but we're going to
do that when we create our JavaScript
file so when we actually put content in
yet so right now we've taken care of all
of our content but if I go back here and
well if I try run this in Firefox you
will see that we've got a button that's
blank a button that's blank and we've
got our current times displaying a 0 0
and our full duration displaying at 0 0
so right now you know this this file
actually
like a complete flop but we are going to
finish this off in the next tutorial and
we're actually going to style it and
make it actually look like our audio
player so come back in the next video
and you guys will learn how to do that
