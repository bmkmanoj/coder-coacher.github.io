here and welcome to tutorial number four
in my builder website series and in this
tutorial we can finally take off this
research UI kits I forgot to do that at
the end of the last video but we've done
our research on UI kit so I'm gonna take
this one off and we're gonna take a look
at our neck next task over here which is
to do some research on current design
trends and I also want to talk to you
guys about some website terminology so
in order to do this let's take a look at
Apple's website and I think I'll start
explaining everything from Apple's
website and I'm going to show you guys a
bunch of other websites that follow a
very similar design trend and I know
some guys are going to notice that I've
got samsung's website open on the exact
next tab above yeah I'll let you guys
have the arguments in the the
description or in the comments down
below and yeah basically let's just talk
about this website so you'll notice that
a lot of websites follow a very similar
trend to what Apple has done here but
basically you have a navigation bar
going along the top of the screen and
then you have images that do all of the
work for you so you can see right now
we've got an entire image or one image
taking up the entire screen and we
literally have what is this one two
three four five six seven words on the
page which just iPhone eight a new
generation of iPhones so we're barely
even using any text here it's simply
just letting our image to all of the
work and yeah this is something that you
will notice across most websites they do
this and something that I want to talk
about right now is terminology so
basically when you land on a website
everything that you see before scrolling
down so basically everything from here
up that is called the section above the
fold
so this is something that we try to do
quite often now is to try and keep
everything above the fold peen and to
the point you just try promote your most
important product I think something that
happens quite a lot and definitely a big
mistake I see amongst a lot of customers
and clients that I have served is they
kind of don't know what is important to
their product and they're just trying to
give importance to everything and then
basically they take this whole section
that we call above the fold and they try
and get everything or fit everything
into this above the fold section so you
know like you have this block over here
which is about one product and you have
another block over there which is about
another product and there's just so much
stuff the whole above the fold section
gets so busy and you're trying to give
the viewers so much choice to actually
click on something that they might be
interested in you kind of forget that
your design can lead them into the
products that you want them to be
interested in so basically that's
exactly what Apple has done here is if
you take a look at this website
literally on the first page Apple wants
you to be interested in the iPhone 8
because that's the next product that's
coming out so that's the first product
you see and it's the only product you
see when you land on the page so they
pretty much know that you're gonna click
on this and go through to the iPhone
AIDS page right but if you scroll a
little bit further down that section you
can see that their next most and product
that they've tried to promote here is
the iPhone X or the iPhone 10 and the
reason why this is second and not first
is because the iPhone 8 basically came
out like two days ago and the iPhone 10
is probably only going to come out in a
couple months so yeah they exactly they
know what product is most important to
them and they're promoting them
promoting these products that way and
again if you scroll down you'll notice
there's a common trend amongst
everything here is it's literally just a
couple different words and then they let
an entire image take up the whole page
so it's just one image taking up the
entire page
and yeah it's a very very simple very
very clean design you'd know exactly
what the user is going to click on
obviously they're gonna click on this
thing because they're not going to click
anywhere else right so yeah it's a good
example of letting your website design
lead the user to where you want them to
go and you can see if you go over to
samsung's website it's pretty much the
exactly the same thing so we've got our
navigation bar along the top here and
again everything that you see above the
fold it's literally just five words do
bigger things Galaxy Note 8 and we have
a picture of the Galaxy Note 8 so we
know that the users can probably gonna
click this button and the interesting
thing is that this is Samsung's website
for the entire brand so this isn't
actually just a cellphone website if you
scroll down okay we've got things here
for the 360 camera the TVs there's a
fridge and yeah again all of them
following the same kind of concept where
you have one section that takes up
pretty much the entire screen just this
tiny bit of text here so we're not
really worrying too much about the words
and then yeah yeah we're not trying to
overload the user with some some content
we're just giving them enough that they
need to see and then we give them the
product which is what they really came
here to see right and then they can
click the button find out more to read a
little bit more about that product but
yeah it's a good example of letting your
design lead the customer to the product
that they want to take a look at and
again
Samsung obviously knows what's the most
important product to them because they
promote the phone as the first thing
that appears when you look at the
website above the fold right and it's
not only Samsung and Apple where you can
see this design trend if you take a look
at UI kit which is the front-end
framework we're using for this series
it's literally the same thing right this
whole section above the fold you've just
got UI kits brand or UI kits logo and
then this tiny little bit of text and
then a download button
so the user can go straight to actually
downloading UI kits and we're letting
imagery do all the work with this
background image here again the next
section below that it's literally just a
blue background with a little bit of
text but the entire section takes up the
whole page so this is something that I
want to implement into this design is
just basically sections that take up an
entire page or the entire screen at a
time and if you take a look at some of
Google's products so you can it doesn't
matter if it's google adsense google
adwords or any other google product for
that matter pretty much all of them
follow a similar trend as well so just a
little bit of text and then an image and
then again a little bit of text and an
image and a call to action so you know
exactly what the user is going to click
on it's going to be this little button
here if that's what they were interested
in you don't have to worry about
cramming everything above the fold or
everything into this section here and
hoping that the user just picks
something and yeah that's all I have to
say about the current design trend at
the moment is just about keeping things
simple
letting images do the work having one
clear concise call to action so you know
exactly what the user is gonna click on
it's going to be that thing and yeah
just having a nice big heading and a
little bit of word wording so you don't
really want to like overwhelm the user
with some text you just kind of want to
give them the thing that they're looking
for and then hope that they click on
that right or not even hope you know
that there that's what they're gonna
click on so that is all I have for you
