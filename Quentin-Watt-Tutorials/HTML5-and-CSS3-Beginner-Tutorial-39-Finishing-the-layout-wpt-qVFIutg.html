to tutorial number 39 and in this
tutorial we can carry on styling our
website over here so in the previous
tutorial we left off just finishing our
top nav and just in case you guys maybe
forgot since the last tutorial where we
where I'll just run this in Firefox and
as you can see our header is now like in
the correct place with our logo on the
left and our title just next to it and
then our links are all in the right
place but now we just need to go ahead
and get the rest of this stuff sorted so
back to our CSS file and what I want to
do now is of course just add in a
comment and I'm just gonna say end
navigation and we'll say start what is
this we can start styling this section
cool so now we can go ahead and grab our
section and it was actually called the
section so grab that there
oops okay this section and what I want
to do now is obviously we need to get
our main section displayed on this side
on the left and then we want our recent
news floated over and displayed on the
right so I kind of just gave you guys a
hint of what we need to do there and we
need to float these elements so let me
just go back to folder over there cool
and so we can go ahead and just float
left and we'll set a margin over here to
I'm actually gonna use kind of a bit of
a shortcut yeah so margin zero pixels 10
pixels 10 pixels zero pixels
and I know a lot of you guys probably
looking at and you're like what the heck
you never showed us this before okay
well what happens is when you do that
that is a shortcut in CSS and basically
what it does is it Styles the top right
bottom and then lifts okay so our top
has zero pixels our writers 10 pixels
margin and then I bought it the bottom
of our section will have a 10 pixel
margin again and then on the left will
have 0 pixels so 0 pixels 0 pixels 10
pixels 10 pixels cool
and after that we can go ahead and add
in some padding so I'm just gonna go
ahead and add in 10 pixels of padding
and then 2 pixels a border sorry a
border of 2 pixels solid green cool and
now what I have to do is I have to go
ahead and set my width but like I said a
couple tutorials ago actually up at the
top here we set out with to 960 because
it divides into three parts really well
so our section is going to take up two
columns of our website so that means the
total width and let me just go ahead and
I'll put the comment over here we want
the total width of our website or the
our section to be 640 pixels so 640
pixels and if you look at what it is now
okay we've got 10 pixels of padding on
each side so that's 10 pixels on the
left and then again another 10 pixels on
the right so that is 20 pixels over all
with 4 padding okay and in our margin
over here we've got
zero pixels on the top and with zero
pixels on the left but we have got ten
pixels on the right so again that is
another ten pixels that we have to worry
about so with so now we've got that's 30
pixels so 640 minus 30 gives us 610 and
then we've got a board over here that we
actually need to worry about again so
that is another two pixels on each side
which adds another four pixels to add to
the width okay so that means we actually
if you go ahead and you -6 take 640 and
you - that 10 and you - that 20 we had
610 and then you have to go ahead and -
that 4 that means our total width can
only be 606 pixels
okay so it's good to keep calculator
handy when you are calculating the width
of your site but like I said a lot of
people will just go ahead and use that
960 pixels for the width and then really
helps when you planning your website
later on how wide you gonna want your
website to be so now we have a total
width for our section of 640 pixels but
we only set the width to 606 and then
our border and our padding and our
margin kind of take up the rest of the
space and it all adds up so there we go
and now what we have to do is go ahead
and what around you hold on let me just
pause
okay cool well I don't want to do
anything there just yet
so we can now carry on with the rest of
our site and what I'm gonna do now is we
can end section styling and start what
is that side news so we can go ahead and
grab our side news side news and now we
can see that we've already used 640
pixels of our website width with our
section that means we've got another 320
left for the side news
so that total which can only be 320
pixels about my asterixis Astrix 320
pixels total so that's what it can only
add up to and what we needed now is just
floats it left and then we need to add
padding of 10 pixels and we need to add
a border to pixels solid Orange and then
I want to go ahead and set a width and
like I said we're gonna have to
calculate it again so 320 pixels our
total space that we have farside news -
10 pixels for the padding but it's 10
pixels on each side so that adds up -
okay it comes down to 300 so
because they have to - 20 pixels and
then again on our border we have to go
ahead and - those two pixels are all
four pixels actually because it's two
pixels on each side so - and other four
pixels and that lets us have a width a
total width of two hundred and
ninety-six pixels and that actually adds
up perfectly to 960 pixels which means
our website fits okay and that is a good
thing so now when I go ahead and I click
refresh you can see we now have our main
section over here with a green border
and our articles inside of our main
section and then on the side of here we
have the recent news and it just says
add me on Twitter so there we go
our website actually fits in the place
that we gave it all the space that we
gave it now as you can see our footer is
kind of displaying in like a really
funny place and what we need to do now
is we just need to get that to display
right at the bottom of the page and if
you watch my float tutorials then you'll
know that's actually really easy so
let's just go ahead and inside news and
what is that start footer and all we
need to do now is just grab our footer
bar ID which was page under school
footer and we just need to set that to
clear both and border to pixel solid
black and padding of 10 pixels and then
I'm just gonna go ahead and text align
this to the center so it doesn't look
stupid all by itself on the left go
ahead and click Save
come back here and
in click refresh and as you can see our
footer is now at the bottom of the
website below everything else with a
black border all the way around it and
the content is in the center so that's
pretty cool and that's pretty much the
layout of the website done and now all
we need to do is spend some time trying
to make it look pretty so thank you guys
