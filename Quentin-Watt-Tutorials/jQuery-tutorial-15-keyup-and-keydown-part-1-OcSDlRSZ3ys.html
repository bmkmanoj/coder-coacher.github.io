here and welcome to this video on jQuery
event handlers and in this video I'm
actually going to talk to you guys about
the key up and the key down event
handlers in jQuery so first of all let's
actually show you guys what we're going
to be making and if I jump over to my
browser over here real quick
you'll see I've got a user name field
and I've got a text field and when I
type stuff into this text field I
actually have a number up here next to
my text field and you'll see that it
actually starts counting down every time
I add a character so it's kind of like
the input box whenever you type a tweet
on your phone or on the internet on the
Twitter website basically while you're
typing you have a counter that counts
how many characters you have left cuz
obviously Twitter you only have 140
characters or something and yeah this
pretty much works in the same way so let
me go ahead and actually get rid of all
of this and you can see that it now
gives me the value of 20 again because
I'm only allowed to type in 20
characters here and if I go over that
you can see that I've got a negative
number and I've actually turned the
boarder of my input box red so I'm going
to show you guys how to do that and
hopefully you guys have already know
HTML because I want to get over the HTML
part quite quickly so I'm actually just
going to go ahead and paste all of that
in but I will explain what's going on
okay so the first thing we have is a
form and inside this form we've got a
label called user name or it has the
text of user name so that is this label
over here before our input box and
obviously that's just there to tell the
user that they have to type a username
in
to that textbox okay the input box is
there obviously for the user to type in
their text and I've given this username
or this input a ID of username so that
we can identify this input element in
jQuery and we're going to be working
with that quite a bit so that's why
that's there and then I also have a span
tag which appears next to our input
element so the span tag is over here and
this is actually what contains our
counter so we start off the span tag
with a blank value so there's nothing in
there right now and we actually use
jQuery to add a value into this element
so I'm going to show you guys how to do
all of that now so let's jump back over
to our scripting file and what I want to
do here is first of all select my input
type so that's over here my input
element and I'm going to select that by
ID so I'm just going to copy that ID and
we need to add in our hash tag over here
go ahead and add in our user name I
accidentally got rid of my bracket so
let's put let's put that back in here
and now I've selected my user name and
I'm actually going to bind an event to
that and the event we're going to use is
key down so whenever the user presses a
key down we want something to happen and
that something is going to be a function
so let's go ahead and open up our
function over here and just to test that
this code works I'm going to alert
something out it's always good to just
test your code as you go along so let's
just say you pressed a key and now
whenever the user is focused in on our
element our user name element and they
press a key we're going
to alert out you have pressed the key so
let's click Save
jump back over to Chrome I need to
refresh this now and you can set on my
username I've got my text field and
whenever I push a key
I actually alert out you have pushed the
key and if I do it again that happens
again okay awesome
so our jQuery is indeed working we are
detecting that the user has pressed the
key on their keyboard now let's take a
look at actually doing something with
the value that the user has actually
entered in to this input box okay so the
first thing we need to do is actually
grab that value and make it a variable
so I'm going to make a variable here
called user name value and we'll set
that equal to the value that is in our
user name input field so I need to
select this input field over here which
you know this is all going to be the
same but I'm going to append on the dot
Val function and that is going to grab
the value of our user name over here
okay so now we need to actually do
something with this variable and what
I'm going to do is actually print it out
but I'm going to print it out in the
span tag that we have over here so the
span tag we want our value to be printed
out in between there so how do we do
that well first of all we need to select
that span tag by its ID so I'm going to
go ahead and open up my select over here
and we'll select that span by its ID
which happens to be user name feedback
I'm going to go ahead and paste that in
there and we need to use the HTML
attribute or the HTML function because
this is jQuery to change the inner HTML
of this element and we could just type
in something
but that isn't going to be dynamic it's
not going to change every time the user
type something and so what we really
want to do is grab this variable oops I
copied instead of I cut I paste it
instead of copied that's what I'm in to
say so let's go ahead and copy this now
and actually paste this variable in here
and now we're actually printing out this
variable in our span tag whenever the
user presses a key down so let's go back
over to Firefox I'm going to click
refresh in fact actually just want to go
to this page again a whole new page okay
and now watch what happens when I type
something in to this text box I push the
letter K s okay so nothing happened
until I push my second letter so this is
kind of like one letter behind let me go
ahead and say I oh now we've got yes
let's go ahead and say P yeah so we're
definitely basically a one letter behind
over here then we are over here and why
is that happening
well it's actually got to do with the
event that we're using because we're
using key down so what actually happens
is every time I press a key so let me go
ahead and press the key L we're grabbing
the value that's in this text box and
then we're actually and then the key is
actually going down and actually typing
the letter basically so the computer
what I'm trying to say here is the
computer only prints this letter I once
it's already printed the value of here
so let me go ahead and type in G L you
see what I'm saying
so it's printing this value and then
it's only adding the letter in
afterwards and the way we can fix this
is by using the key up function or the
key up event handler
so let's go ahead and click Save and if
I come back here and click refresh and
I'll type something in now let's go
ahead and say let's you can see we've
actually got every single letter so
let's go one two three it's actually
typing everything as I type it it's
printing it out so a key up basically
will print this value after we've
already added a letter to our input box
so that's where key up it comes in handy
over key down because you're actually
able to grab the letter that was pressed
once the key has been released okay so
now that we've actually printed that out
we need to take a look at actually
making a counter and also then
displaying the red border if the user
goes over that counter limit and all of
that good stuff but I'm actually going
to be doing that in the next video
because this video is getting kind of
long so I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
