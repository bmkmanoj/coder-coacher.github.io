here and welcome back to tutorial number
12 and in this tutorial I am going to
show you guys how to use an external
style sheet on your web page okay so the
first thing we're going to talk about is
just what are the advantages of using an
external style sheet okay so to do that
I'm just going to speak about what we
did in the previous tutorial quickly and
in the previous tutorial we learned
about inline CSS which is where we used
styling inside of the tag itself so we
had to go ahead and put in a style
attribute and then put in some style
rules over here as well okay but I
showed you guys that this wouldn't
really be the best way to use the SS on
your web page because this will only
change one element and that is the
element that the style tag is inside of
okay so it would be much better to use
an internal style sheet but again an
internal style sheet is not really the
best way to use CSS because let's say I
had one or two or three or 100 websites
okay what web pages on my website okay I
would then have to go ahead and copy
these styling rules over all 100 of
those web pages until all of them can
look the same or follow the same theme
which is really what you want on your
website okay that all the pages look
very similar okay now of course copying
all of that code would get a bit tedious
and it means if we ever have to change
something we have to go back and change
it on all 100 web pages okay so it is
much better to use an external style
sheet which is what I'm going to show
you guys how to do in this video and to
start off I'm just going to go ahead and
get rid of all of that styling so that
our web page basically looks blank again
it should look like this
if I click refresh yes okay so let's go
ahead and make an external stylesheet
and then learn how to style that way so
I'm going to go ahead and file new and
file save as and I'm just going to save
this new file as main dot CSS now be
sure to save it in the same directory as
your index.html file okay if you save it
anywhere else then you need to make sure
that you've watched my video on
directory structures and you understand
how to link to a file that's in a
different folder okay
so for now we've just got this blank
main CSS file but let's go ahead and
actually add in some styling to this
okay so I told you guys before that if
we want to select all of the paragraphs
on a web page we can just use the
selector P and then we put in our two
curly braces okay now as you can see the
one of the other advantages of using an
external stylesheet is that notepad plus
plus really helps us out with this kind
of thing and it's already letting us
know that paragraph or the P that we
selected is an element okay so we're
selecting by an element name and that is
why P turned the same color blue as our
elements on our web page okay so let's
go ahead and now add in a rule so we'll
just go ahead and say color red and as
you can see again notepad plus plus is
helping us out even further because
anything that is a valid CSS property is
going to turn this gray color and then
anything that's a value that'll stay
black as normal
okay so right now we've changed all of
the colors of our paragraphs to red and
let's also change our heading one okay
so we'll change the background
and color of that to be let's just say
yellow again okay but we're not done yet
because although we have our styling
rules here we have no way of telling
HTML okay this webpage needs to look for
its styling in this folder or in this
file okay so to do that we actually use
a link in the head of our webpage so we
go ahead and say a link and then we say
rel which stands for relationship and
over here we just put in stylesheet and
then we put in the href okay which is
basically the location of where to look
for this CSS file and because they're in
the same directory I can just go ahead
and say main dot CSS and then I'll go
ahead and close that off with a slash
okay so now when we go back and click
refresh you can see we have indeed got
our styling appearing on the web page so
that is quite awesome indeed okay
so just remember guys whenever you want
to use an external style sheet
don't forget to link to it in the head
of your webpage and then also just keep
sure I will make sure that you keep to
the proper CSS rules which we are going
to learn about in the future okay but
just to stress this again whenever you
are using a CSS or whenever you are
trying to change some CSS you're going
to use a selector to tell HTML what
element you want to change okay so P for
paragraphs h1 for h1 tags etc and then
the second part inside of these curly
braces that is the property so what do
you want to change about the tag and
then also what the value is that
you want to change this property to okay
