here and in this tutorial which is
tutorial number 34 we are finally going
to start creating a basic website
template or website layout that we are
going to use or that you guys will be
able to use to create all your websites
from now on okay so I've got some code
from the previous tutorial over here and
these are basically just the new tags
which I did speak about in the previous
tutorial so if you guys didn't watch
that just go back and watch that and all
of this is going to make sense but we've
got our header tag navigation tag
section tag and let's actually space
this out a little bit better and
underneath that we've got the aside tag
and right at the bottom the new footer
tag okay so these are all tags that
we're going to be able to use to divide
our website up into like just manageable
or logical sections okay now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
navigation tag out over here
and I'm going to place it inside my
header because it's a good idea like to
include your navigation in your header
and that way you can just have your
header on every single page and it'll be
the same because your navigations
probably also going to have to be the
same across all pages so I like to have
my navigation inside of my header some
people actually do that some people like
to have the navigation inside of the
side tag and then place the navigation
on the side but I'm like I favor having
my navigation in the head and actually
going across the top of the webpage kind
of like Google or Facebook or something
so let's talk about what we actually
need to put in our head at now because
we already know we're going to have to
put our nav navigation in here but other
than that we're also going to have to
place our logo so I'm going to create an
image tag over here and I'm going to
give this a source of
logo dot ping but I haven't actually
created a logo yet I don't have one so
this isn't going to show up until I
actually create the image but for now
let's just give this an alt attribute of
logo area and that means that for now as
a placeholder we'll have these words
logo area appearing where our logo is
supposed to go at least you know until I
create an actual logo okay in the
navigation we're going to have to place
a whole bunch of links to other pages
but we don't have any other pages yet so
the links aren't going to be complete
and the way I like to do this is create
an unordered list because it just makes
things a little bit more manageable and
there we go we have an unordered list so
inside the unordered list we're going to
have a bunch of list items okay and in
these list items we're actually going to
have our links so a and ending a ok and
let's just give this an H ref tag of
nothing okay now because we haven't
created these webpages yet we don't want
these links to actually go anywhere
because they'll go to a page that
doesn't exist so we'll leave the H ref
blank and that means the link will still
show up so we can still style the web
page and get the link looking all pretty
but it doesn't have to work until we
actually you know I have actually
created the other pages so the first
page we can link to is home which is
pretty much going to be the page that we
on already because your index page is
your home page then let's copy this and
paste it down here a few times so the
next page that we can link to or you
know have a fake link to is the about
page because pretty much every website
has an about page other than that lets
do a tutorials page just because I make
tutorials so
you know that's all I'm thinking about
right now and at the last link we can
place in a contact page okay so these
pages don't exist right now so we're
leaving the HRF blank but the links will
still show up so if I run this in
Firefox let's go over here run in
Firefox we have the logo area which
we're going to put our logo in there
soon enough as soon as I make one I
haven't made one yet but we have our
navigation showing up here as well but
it's got these bullet points so don't
worry about that we are going to style
that all this these bullet points away
later on with the styling but for now
you know only our navigation at least
shows up so that's what we wanted to
look out for so that is pretty much our
header done we can add some stuff later
maybe but you know for now I think we've
got our you know basic content in there
so for our section I think I'm going to
leave this for the next tutorial so
let's just make a comment over here and
comment so actually so like weird in
HTML to remember that smaller than
greater than sign of the exclamation
mark and stuff but okay next tutorial so
I'm gonna get back to this but in the
next video okay so yeah like I said
we'll do this in the next tutorial I
kind of lost my place because I had to
go to all my dog to stop barking okay
then in the aside section like I said
this would just be sort of some side
news or just content that isn't that
important but I think we'll get to this
in the next video as well because this
video is getting kind of long so I'm
just going to copy that and paste that
here and we'll definitely work on those
in the next video but for the footer
this you know sometimes websites don't
really have anything that they want to
put in their footer so like if your
website is going to be a little bit
empty but you still need a foot
this is pretty much where your copyright
will go okay so if you guys want a
little you know symbol I think it's alt
ctrl C okay now can't get that to appear
but if I type in the word and copy so
and percent and a copy just like this I
will get a little copyright symbol that
shows up and then I can just put in your
copyright oops
copyright the programmers Creed calm and
actually let's make that all one word
and maybe get rid of the so copyright
program is creat dot-com and if I save
that now go over to Firefox and click
refresh you can see I've got my
copyright showing up at the bottom and
this is the little copyright symbol I
was talking about and the way you make
that in HTML is by writing and copy with
a little semicolon okay so that's all
for this video but come back in the next
video where we will start putting some
more information in our section and our
aside section and until then I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
