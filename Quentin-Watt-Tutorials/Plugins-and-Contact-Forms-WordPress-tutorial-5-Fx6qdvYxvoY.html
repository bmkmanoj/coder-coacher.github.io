here and in this video I'm gonna show
you how to install a plugin on WordPress
and the plugin that I'm gonna be using
is a contact form plug-in and yeah it's
just gonna be there to show you guys how
to set up a contact form because I know
that's probably the first thing you're
gonna want to do on a website anyway and
so it is probably one of the more useful
plugins to be showing you so the first
thing you need to do is log into
WordPress
I'm already logged in and if I go over
to the backend over here you can see I'm
on the plugins page so this is where we
install a plug-in and there are two ways
we can go about doing this we can click
add new and actually search for a
plug-in in the plug-in directory and
that's the way I'm gonna install my
plug-in but you can also upload a
plug-in so if you hit the upload button
you can browse to a file
you know select something and hit open
and install now and it will install the
plug-in but yeah this is an image so
that's not gonna work although if you
are ever looking for a plug-in you can
just go over to WordPress's
plug-in directory we'll leave a link in
the description and the plug-in that I'm
going to be using is contact form 7 so
yeah if you just got over the plugins
search for something if you know what
plug-in you're wanting to use and you'll
get to a page that looks something like
this and you can hit download download
that zip file and then you can go back
over to WordPress and well that popped
up a little bit later anyway you can
download this zip file and then go ahead
and upload it over here although I don't
want to do it this way I'm going to use
WordPress's
actual directory so let's go back and
hit add new again and I'm gonna use this
little search directory so it's got a
contact form 7 obviously this is a lot
easier or a lot easier way to look for a
plug-in although yeah sometimes you'll
come across plugins that are not
available here and
you have to actually download them
somewhere which is just why I showed you
the whole upload thing but let's go over
the contact form seven seeing as that is
available within WordPress is directory
and yeah when I hit install it's going
to download the package that takes a few
minutes and once that's done it extracts
all the files and all you have to do
then is hit activate and that'll
activate the plug-in if you're not ready
to activate it you could just you know
click somewhere in the menu but if you
hit activate it's going to bring you
back to the plugins page and you'll see
that now I've got this little blue
plug-in over here that means it is
active if it's red it means that the
plug-in is active and needs to have an
update and if it looks kind of like
these two plugins it just means that the
plug-in is an active at the moment so
yeah I've got this contact form 7
plug-in installed and activated and
you'll notice that something was added
to the side menu over here and if you
look at the menu that you'll see that
we've got this contact form menu item
added to our menu and that was added by
this plugin so let's hit contact and
that's going to take me through to a
settings page for this plugin so the
great thing about this is or the great
thing about most WordPress plugins is
they're really easy to use because most
of them come with a cool thing called a
wordpress shortcode which is these
square brackets so whenever you see some
text in square brackets like this it's
generally going to be a shortcode for a
plug-in and whatever's inside will
depend on the plug-in you're using so
because this is contact form 7 plug-in
it's got some contact form 7 information
in here so what I'm gonna do is just
copy all while I'm gonna copy that
shortcode and I'm gonna paste that on a
page somewhere where I want to use it
and
in our case I think I'll add it onto the
contact page and I'll add it down here
somewhere at the bottom of the contact
page so let me edit the contact page and
I'm just gonna paste it down here at the
bottom of the page most people will tell
you whenever you paste a shortcode onto
a page in WordPress you should use the
text editor I don't know why they always
do that I think maybe this relates to
some kind of old version of WordPress
where shortcuts would only work if they
were pasted in this way but I find
pasting it in in the visual editor does
exactly the same thing so I'm not quite
sure why people tell you that but yeah
if your plugin or your shortcode doesn't
work maybe you should just pop into the
text view and make sure that the plug-in
or that the shortcode hasn't been
replaced with some funny characters okay
so I'm gonna hit update and let's go
back over to the front-end and just hit
refresh and now you can see that we've
got this contact form appearing on our
page and it was as simple as just
pasting in this shortcode so what the
shortcode did was generate some HTML and
display it on the page but how does it
know that we want a name field an email
a subject and all that kind of stuff
well let's go back to the plug-in and
just take a look at some of the settings
so I'm gonna go to the plug-in page and
if I hit edit on our current form
because this is the form that we're
using this was a default form that was
set up on contact form 7 I'm just gonna
hit edit and you'll see that over here
we're using more short codes again so
we've got these little square brackets
and besides that we've got some HTML in
here so we've got a paragraph that says
your name and some text that says
required a break tag and then these
short codes and if I come back over to
the front-end and I inspect elements and
be using Firebug for this you can see
I've got a paragraph your name with the
text required break tag and then we've
got the span tag with an input element
so that that's more or less what we're
seeing here write a paragraph this text
and then that break tag and then the
span tag that we were looking at mm-hmm
I'm not sure how to bring that back up
again there we go that's span tag that
we were looking at again is a shortcode
right so that shortcode oh well this
HTML was generated by this shortcode and
so yeah these are fields that we can set
up in a contact form seven so let's say
I wanted to set up my own field I could
simply just type in a shortcode like
this but the cool thing is they've got
this shortcode generator so if I hit
text this will allow me to add a new
text field to my form of course there
are other options like radio buttons
checkboxes and so on but let's just use
a text field and I'm gonna give my text
field a name so I'm looking at the form
over here and I see we're asking the
user for their name their email a
subject and a message why not ask for
their surname as well so let's just name
this something and I'm gonna stick with
the naming convention that they followed
here so they named the field for the
users name your name so I'm just gonna
add your name or your surname as the
field I'm using if you tick required
that will then make this field required
so the user wouldn't be able to submit
the form without filling in this field
there are a few other options here like
adding a default value and using
placeholders or adding classes and ID's
but basically whatever options you fill
in over here are going to affect what
appears at the bottom and this is your
shortcode so when I say use a
placeholder you can see we're adding
placeholder over here
and when I take that away then again the
shortcode changes so from here I can
copy the shortcode and I can paste it in
manually or I can just hit insert tag
and that's gonna paste the shortcode
where my cursor was lost so what I think
I'm gonna do is just move this because
if we're gonna ask for the surname we
might as well ask for that right after
asking for their name right and then we
might want to just copy some of this
HTML just to keep the layout of the form
working and change your name to your
surname and then just end off that
paragraph that I have forgot to end off
but yeah basically I'm just trying to
keep this form the way it was set up by
default you don't have to follow these
instructions exactly you can create your
own HTML and add classes wherever you
want but this is just what works and
looking at it it does look and you know
it doesn't look terrible let me put it
that way so I think I think just
following that layout look is fine and
and then I'm gonna go over to the mail
settings and this is where you get to
choose what happens when somebody hits
the send button because when somebody
hits the send button the form is gonna
send an email to whatever address is
placed in here so since I set WordPress
up with this email address that's the
email address that appears although I
could pull in a secondary email address
by adding a comma and then adding not
exist at Quinten watch.com and that
would mean that this email would then go
to two addresses although I'm gonna just
remove that if you ever want to send it
to multiple people you can also add a CC
address in the additional header
although yeah I'm going to just leave
that for now you'll see that we're using
short codes again on this page except
now the short codes are a little bit
shorter
make sense just because over here we're
using a short code of text and then a
name value whereas over here we're only
using the name within the short code but
what this does oh yeah what the short
code does is grab the value that the
user has filled in to the form so in
other words when we're saying from your
name we're saying that whenever the user
falls in something like Jared over here
well that's not right okay there's a
user folding Jared over here then Jared
would appear as the from name in the
email then we have our message body now
this is something that I used I like to
change up a little bit I don't quite
like the format that this comes in but
let's just say we make this a little bit
more user friendly and I say you
received an email from and sometimes
well I don't actually use the word email
you should say you received a form
submission with the following details
and then I usually try grab all the
person's details so I know okay they
there we're asking them for a name so
they need a full in their name somewhere
so I'm just gonna say a name and then to
grab whatever they use a fold in here
again it's just these square brackets
with the name and then we also have the
surname field so I like to actually just
pop between these two views so we also
need to grab the surname the email
address subject and message so I'm gonna
just try fly through this quickly so
surname was that and then we need
email subject and message so I got one
too many but basically email subject
message I need to change all of these as
well
by the way make sure that all of these
values match up what's over here
otherwise your forms not going to work
and then I'm gonna hit save and now I
can come back over the front-end hit
refresh and I could test my form out by
filling in some of these details so
named Jared what email address Jared at
email comm whatever subject hello there
and whatever message they wanted to type
in and hit Send and I'm gonna get this
success message to say your email was
sent successfully
but disclaimer we're setting this up on
our local host I'm using map and my map
has not been set up to send emails to
anyone I mean I don't really have
outgoing mail set up here so it's not
gonna be able to send an email to me so
what I usually do is I set forms up the
way I want them to work and just before
I or when I move the site over to a live
server I then fill in all of the forms
and test them and make sure one or more
make 100% sure that they're working so
yeah I would probably wait to test this
form again once your website has been
moved off of your localhost and on to a
proper server that has the ability to
send emails and that is what I have for
you in this videos if you like that
video there are a bunch of things that
you can do to help first of all don't
