to tutorial number 25 and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
about styling links on your web page
so the first thing you need to know is
that links actually have four different
states so you don't actually just go
ahead and you know just select your
normal a tag and then go ahead and write
whatever you want your link to be over
here and that's what it will look like
okay links have four different states
and we use pseudo classes to style every
single state so the first state is just
the normal what a link looks like by
default then the second state is the
visited state so if we say a visited
okay that would be after we've visited
our after we visited that web page what
the link is going to look like and then
a hover which is pretty much while our
mouse is sitting over the over the link
how do you want the link to look like
and then we've also got a active which
is what the link looks like when you're
actually clicking down on the link so
let's go ahead and you know just save
this I'm not gonna style anything in
here yet so that all the defaults appear
and then we can just go ahead and look
at what the defaults look like so if we
go back to index dot HTML let's just go
ahead and make a link to my youtube
channel so my channel and the href for
that would be HTTP the little italy you
to okay dot youtube.com slash user slash
Quinton Watts
okay so if we save this and run this in
Firefox you can see by default a visitor
a link that has not been visited is blue
and
it's underlined by default but when we
go and we hover over it you can see it
actually doesn't change just the mouse
pointer turns into an arrow I mean a
hand from an arrow to a hand and while
you're clicking down on it you can see
that the link now changes to be red and
as soon as we let go we go to my YouTube
channel you know that's pretty cool
anyways and we go back to the my website
now you can see we've visited this link
and the link is now purple so those are
the four different states by default
what they look like and we can actually
go ahead and change this so go back to
your CSS and as you can see by default
the link was blue when it was not
visited so we can change this maybe to
be color orange and tix decoration we'll
take the underline away so
text-decoration:none okay then we'll set
our visited link which was purple by
default we can change that to be green
and well we will just leave it as green
and it won't be underlined because it'll
inherit the text decoration from the
normal link then when we're hovering
over our link what color do we want it
so we can go ahead and change that color
to red and as you remember when we were
hovering over our link it didn't
actually change the first time round and
we'll set the text decoration to
underline so that'll bring that
underlined link back and then we can go
ahead and change the winter was active
remember when you clicked on it when I
was active it changed red so now what we
can do is maybe just change the color to
black and we'll also have the
text-decoration:underline there
okay awesome so if we go ahead and save
this and then go back to our our Firefox
page over here and we refresh okay by
default and others unvisited link was
blue and now it should be orange okay
but I have visited that link so let me
just go ahead and clear my recent
history clear hmmm okay yeah and now
when we refresh as you can see by
default it's not underlined anymore and
it's orange instead of blue and as soon
as we hover over it it now becomes red
and it's underlined which is actually
what it looked like when it was active
before we started styling it so I
probably shouldn't have made them so
similar and now when I click down on the
link as you can see it changes to black
which is what we set it to be in the CSS
and as soon as I let go and we visited
my YouTube channel and we go back the
text is now green so those are the four
different states that you can use to
style your link and that's pretty much
all I have for you guys in this tutorial
