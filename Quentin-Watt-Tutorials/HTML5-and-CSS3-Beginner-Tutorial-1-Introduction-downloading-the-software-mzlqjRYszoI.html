Quinton and welcome to my HTML and CSS
tutorial now if you guys just stumbled
across this video and you don't know
what HTML and CSS is then it's actually
the language that websites are written
in and for these tutorials I'm going to
assume that anyone watching has never
had any experience with HTML and CSS
before that way anyone watching will be
able to join in and follow along so now
I've already told you that HTML and CSS
are the languages that websites are
written in but let's break it down a
little more HTML stands for hypertext
markup language and it is all of the
contents of our website all the
paragraphs all the headers and all the
images etc while CSS stands for
cascading style sheets we and we use
this to style the website so basically
choosing what color we want our
background or what color we want our
text borders etc so we can take a look
at a practical example real quick if we
just open up our browser and in this
case I'm using Firefox and we can go to
any web page we want and just
right-click somewhere and then click
inspect element and as you see this
little bar appears at the bottom of the
screen which I can then scroll up and
you know we see all of this code that
doesn't really make much sense to us at
the moment and if you can read it you're
welcome to try and read it and then I'm
going to click this little style button
in the bottom corner here and this
window is going to appear which again is
just a bunch of words in some brackets
and you can try read this too but it
might not make any sense to you either
but right now this is actually HTML all
the stuff here on the left and all of
the stuff here on the right is actually
CSS and like I said you can try read it
now if you want but it's probably not
going to make much sense to you but if
you come back at the end of the
tutorials and you go try read through
this again it's actually going to make
sense and you're actually going to be
able to understand what you're reading
so there we go that's where we're going
with the next few tutorials
now to follow along with the rest of my
tutorials you are going to need to
download some software and the first
thing you're going to need to download
is a good text editor and it's probably
best if you use the same one as me and
the one that I use is notepad plus plus
because it's one of the best and it's
free and to download notepad plus plus
just go over to the notepad plus plus
website I'll leave the link in the
description and then just make sure you
go to the download page and once you get
to the download page you'll just see
here notepad plus plus installer ok this
is the one that most of you guys are
going to want to download so just go
ahead and click on that and then you can
just go ahead and save the file now I'm
not going to save it because I already
have it downloaded on my computer and
I'd only download it again but for you
guys just go ahead and download and
install it and once you run it you
should get a program that looks like
this and the next thing you're going to
need is a good browser now I recommend
you switch to firefox but if you really
don't want to use firefox then chrome
should work just fine too
so go ahead and follow the links below
and download the software and then you
can meet up with me in the next tutorial
where we will actually start writing
some code but for now thanks for
watching don't forget to subscribe feel
free to leave a comment don't hesitate
to like and share my videos and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
