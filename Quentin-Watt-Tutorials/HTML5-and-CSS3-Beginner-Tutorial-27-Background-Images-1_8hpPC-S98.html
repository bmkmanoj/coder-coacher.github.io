number 27 and in this tutorial I just
want to show you guys how to make a
background image on your web page so in
this tutorial we are starting off with a
blank body and that is perfectly fine
because we don't actually need any
content inside of our body so we can go
straight over to our CSS file over here
and what we're going to do now is just
select the body tag and that will make
sure that our image tiles all the way
across the entire background of our
website and now what we can do is use
the property called background - image
or background - image to set the image
to the background so now what you have
to do is type in the word URL and then
inside brackets put two quotation marks
and inside those quotation marks you
have to put the file location of the
image you want to use okay so my image
is called profile underscore pick dot
jpg and then we have put a semicolon
over okay
but this alone isn't actually going to
work because my image is in a folder
called images so if you take a look this
is my website structure over here and
that's the index page that we working
with at the moment but this is our CSS
sheet over here and block as you guys
saw a via we just stopped in the name of
my picture that I want to use which is
profile pic but if we save this now and
run this in Firefox whoops
okay run this one in Firefox okay we're
going to get a blank web page as you can
see and that's because our CSS folder
couldn't actually find the image and
that's because we didn't give it the
right location okay so profile pic yes
is the name of my picture but
what happened was my CSS she looked for
profile pic in the same folder that my
CSS sheet is in and there is no picture
over here called profile pic so I just
gave up looking and it didn't add the
image to the background so in order to
tell my CSS folder to go one folder up
and then into the images folder and then
to find my picture we have to type in
dot dot forward slash and then images
and then forward slash and then the name
of my profile pic ok and now when we
save this and we click refresh we get a
website with my face all over it which
is pretty much the best website you've
ever seen am i right
ok now I'm just kidding but yeah now
what we can do is instead of having my
image my face repeats across the entire
website let's just go ahead and say
background - repeat is equal to
no-repeat and that'll stop the image
from repeating both ways so it's not
going to repeat across and it's not
going to repeat down let's go ahead and
refresh and as you can see I just have
one image of myself okay and let's say I
actually wanted my image to repeat only
across the website then what I can do is
I can say background repeat' is equal to
repeat X ok and when we refresh this we
have my web my picture repeating all the
way across my website and if I had to
make my website longer the picture we
just carry on going so that's pretty
cool and now what we can do is make my
picture instead of a across go down so
we just set background repeat' is equal
to repeat Y and that makes my
picture repeats down okay so that's
pretty cool now what we can also do is
we can use background images and
background colors to work together so
let me just go ahead and minimize this
so instead of using profile pic I'm
going to use the pic called smiley jpg
and we'll just we'll take the repeat
away so that my image repeats all the
way across the website and then I'll
type in a property called background
color which already showed you guys
before background - color and already
told you guys that you can use a
hexadecimal color like two seven two
seven two seven I have no idea what
color that's going to come out by but
anyways let's go ahead and refresh this
hmm okay so what happened there was my
image didn't actually show up and that's
because it's not a jpg
it's a ping so let me just go ahead and
change that to PNG and we go ahead and
save this and then we can refresh this
in Firefox and already did it and we get
the image repeating down and across our
web page and our the color of our web
page is still in the background so you
can have your background color and your
background image and if we started
typing in contents over here that would
also appear above the image so you
actually have three layers of content on
your website or three layers that you
can work around with every element on
your web page so that's pretty cool and
