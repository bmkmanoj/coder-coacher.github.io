and let's address a frequently asked
question which is how can I contact you
and this gets asked in a lot of weird
ways but just answer the question
immediately look in the video
description of this video and every
single other video I've ever made you
will find for links to four social media
snapchat Instagram Facebook and Twitter
now these are four of the biggest social
medias in the world I do check my social
media myself it's not like I'm paying
anybody to do it so you will be
contacting me now if you don't have an
account on one of these apps you can
always send me an email I just don't
make my email address super public so
you have to go over to the my YouTube
channel click on a belt and scroll down
you will be able to view an email
address over there and you can contact
me on that email address the reason why
I want that super public is because I'm
like I'm going to start getting a lot of
spam from robots and not real people and
that's not cool right so there's that
way you can get hold of me and that's
pretty much the only way right those
four social medias and an email a lot of
people tend to contact me on Facebook so
you're completely off of YouTube now
you're on Facebook messaging and
actually talking to me and they ask me
where they can contact me and I'm like
you're talking to me right now I know
you're aware of this it's kind of a
weird conversation to have like you're
already talking to me where else do you
want to contact me and a lot of people
at that point tend to try and move me to
another app like WeChat or something
else and there's a reason why I only
support for social medias and I only
have links to four social medias it's
because if I had links to more social
medias it has to spend more time off my
day checking social media I mean think
about it these are for apps already if
it takes me 10 minutes a day if you
check all four apps that's awesome more
than half an hour a day checking social
media if it takes you know if I have 10
apps and that's going to take me a
hundred minutes a day so that's going to
take me almost two hours checking social
media I really don't want to have to
deal with all of that I just want four
social medias and I do
like that's where you can contact me if
you don't have an account they send me
an email if you're not going to send me
an email and you want to use something
else like I'm not going to go anywhere
else so yeah now if you haven't seen
