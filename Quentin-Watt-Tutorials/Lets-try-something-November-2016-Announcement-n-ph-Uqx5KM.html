here and welcome to this video it is the
first of november this is not actually a
tutorial it's a little bit more of an
announcement so there's something that i
mentioned a few videos a few days ago in
my previous video which was that i'm
planning on doing my html5 and css3
tutorial series again i'm not sure how
some of you guys are going to feel about
that I know regular followers are
probably gonna think like okay this is
like the third time he's had this year
he's on his channel and that is true but
every time I put out the series again
there is an opportunity to make it
better and looking at the last series it
was not HD it doesn't have good audio
and I feel like I can fix that now
because i've got a microphone and I've
got you know better screen recording
software and I've got a better computer
so that it can be HD now and I want to
make it better because to be honest that
content brings the most new people to my
channel that's where everybody's coming
from and right now it's not HD and it's
not the not good quality the audio is is
pretty not nice trying to avoid using
swear words so the audio is not good
right and I just want that to be better
and I feel like I can make it better I
also feel like I can make some of the
content better judging from some of the
comments in previous tutorials there are
places where people get confused where
you know maybe I could have explained
something better and I think I could
have so in this series I am gonna make
it better and i am doing things
differently to how i did the first time
hopefully it's clear to people and
people understand better so yeah I think
it can be better and it bugs me that it
isn't so I'm going to try and fix that
and then the other thing is i have
actually recorded 10 of these videos
already so they're ready to be released
their uploaded to youtube but i'm going
to release them one
day which brings me to my next point I'm
going to try and release one video a day
for the month of november and we'll see
how things go because hopefully i can
record one video a day monday to friday
and at least that way you know if I ever
fall behind in the week I've got the
weekend to try and catch up but I want
to try release one video a day Monday to
Friday and this is going to be a lot of
hard work for me it there is going to be
a lot of real life stuff getting in the
way you know if I if I get busy on a
weekend and I have to go to a wedding or
some kind of an event then I obviously
don't get a video done so I'm going to
try and and just try to put all these
real-life excuses away you know i'll try
go do these these events but still get a
video done anyway you know i only need a
certain amount of time to record and
then i can edit at night so i'm gonna
i'm gonna try just put all these excuses
aside and just do it just do one video a
day and we'll see how things go from
there hopefully that turns out to be
rewarding you know obviously I don't
want to put in all of this time and
effort into my youtube channel if if it
doesn't help me you know what I'm saying
so let's just see what what what how
that works for the month of November and
maybe we can try it for most of December
but December is kind of like a holiday
period especially in South Africa not
too many people work in a December so it
means that like we usually go spend time
with family and that's kind of what I'd
be doing so I probably wouldn't be able
to record videos when I'm with my family
because I wouldn't be at home so we'll
see how this ember goes but for the
month of November I'm going to try to do
one video a day and then the other thing
is once the html5 and css3 tutorial
series is done I'm going to try and do a
website from start to finish using all
the technologies that I've taught on my
channel so far so we'll use but a PHP
will use some JavaScript will
use some HTML and CSS of course because
how else do you build a website and then
we'll use a little bit of jQuery and
probably a CSS framework like UI kit I
did mention that in a live stream a few
weeks ago that's gone private but i'll
try and use all of those technologies
and we'll build one website from start
to finish from PSD to the finished
product in the browser and i know that
that is a series a lot of people have
been asking for so it will be done
probably sometime around december maybe
beginning of january and that's all i
have for you guys in this video i'll see
you guys next time i just want to send a
shout-out to my sponsors at dev mountain
they run a coding boot camp with courses
on iOS development ux design and web
development and they can teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks which i think is a
rather impressive timeline so go ahead
and check out their website the link is
in the video description and if you do
contact them make sure to tell them that
I thank you hey thanks for staying until
the end of the video that really means a
lot to me now why you're still here
there are a few things that you can do
to help first of all if you haven't
already subscribe and watch another one
of my videos and if you want to help me
make more content more often or if you
feel that my content is just worth
paying a little bit of money towards you
