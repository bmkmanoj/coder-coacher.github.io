here and welcome to tutorial number 40
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at more elements that go
within a forum and there's definitely a
few more elements that I want to show
you guys these are not input elements
they're actually just other elements
that go in a form so they don't have a
tag called input right but they do have
other tags and yeah if we take a look at
this right now you can see that I've
cleared out the code in my form and yeah
we have just a blank submit or we have a
blank website with a submit button so
let's go ahead and add in a few elements
within this form now the first one I
want to show you guys is something
called a field set so go ahead and just
type in field set and if you save this
and run that in the browser you just
kind of get like a very big blank box
and basically what happens is or
basically what this field set is for is
to place other elements inside of it and
you can also place a legend within that
field set so just to give this a little
bit more spacing let me add a break tag
and then let's add a legend here so
legend is another useful tag that always
goes within field set because the legend
and the field set kind of go
hand-in-hand
this creates a caption for the fields it
so let's type in something like personal
data save this jump back of the browser
refresh and now you can see that our
legend appears in the top of our field
set so this is nice for if you have a
bunch of different sections within your
form so one can be personal data and you
can have another section for you know
like work data or family data or
something like that and yeah basically
just divide the form up into a bunch of
different sections that is what field
sets are for all right but let's just
work with one for now and
now because we have this field tent
let's go ahead and put in a few other
elements so obviously we can work with
our input of type text and ask the user
for the name now we already know what
this is going to look like so I'm not
going to bother refreshing just yet but
maybe let's also add in a label okay
because you guys need to know how to use
labels or where your labels are useful
which kind of we've already worked with
but let's refresh that and so we have a
place for user to enter in their name
all right we also might ask them for the
email address and so on and all these
other input elements that we have
already looked at but I want to try and
hit all the tags that we haven't looked
at yet so one of those is a select box
so let's just add in a couple break tags
over here break and a break I'm just
doing this for spacing reasons so that
it doesn't all appear on one line and
now let's go ahead and type in select
and if you type in select just like this
and leave a blank you kind of don't end
up with anything but what a select box
does is give us a little drop-down list
that we can then select items from so
right now a blank select kind of just
gives you this blank box which is very
useless so let's go ahead and give it a
few options
so you basically place all these option
tags within the select box and then that
gives you options then you can actually
select from that box so let's say we're
asking the user for their career so
let's just grab a label here so we know
what this is for so basically what is
your professional or something like that
and then they can fill in a software
engineer or give another option here
social media manager and let's give it a
third option as well something else that
they could select that is a job brand
manager something that okay cool
so let's come back over the browser
refresh and now you can see that we have
this drop-down list with a bunch of
professions that the user can choose so
that's how you create a select box in
HTML right there also our or there's one
other element that I definitely want to
show you guys which is a text area so
let's add in a couple break tags over
here again break and break and then add
in a text area right so a text area
allows the user to fill in a lot of
information basically it's not the small
input types but you actually get like a
place where you can find paragraphs and
paragraphs and paragraphs of info so I
just want to show you guys a few other
attributes that you can put in here
because right now you'll see that when
you load the page this box this text
area kind of is very small you do have
any option to resize it but it is quite
small so let's let's add some coals so
let's say 50 now calls stands for
columns and that just determines how
wide your text area is going to be so
remember early on it was kind of like
quite small but now at 50 it's it's much
much bigger and you can make that like
80 or something and make it even bigger
all right then you can also add rows so
because we've got the Coles attribute we
can also add rows and I'm just going to
sit ten rows over here and watch what
happens when I hit refresh we now have a
much bigger space or yeah it's a lot
higher or taller than it used to be
right
then you could go ahead and add in some
of your own sex here but I would prefer
to use a placeholder so it's got
placeholder and let's say tell us about
yourself all right save this jump back
out of the browser and refresh and now
you have a placeholder within the text
area and you can type whatever and when
you start typing this tell us about
yourself placeholder disappears right so
those are some of the other elements
that go within a form and that's how you
use them feel free to go ahead and
create a whole bunch of forms now with
the names professions whatever drop down
this text areas and I'll see you guys in
the next video I just want to send a
shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain
