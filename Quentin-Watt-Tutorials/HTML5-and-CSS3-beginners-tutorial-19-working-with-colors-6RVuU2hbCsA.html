here and welcome to tutorial number 19
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to work with colors in HTML
and CSS okay so before we get started I
just want to explain that I do have a
div tag in my body and inside that div
tag I have a paragraph tag that just is
working with colors and if I go over to
my CSS file then I've already styled my
div elements to have a height of 250
pixels and a width of 250 pixels now the
only reason I did that was so that we'd
actually have a big block that's going
to show color whenever I change
background colors of my div okay so now
let's actually talk about the colors and
you guys have probably noticed that
every time I've changed the background
color or the color of my text in the
previous tutorials I always had to use a
preset color like red or blue or green
or yellow or something okay but the web
is actually so much more colorful than
those simple HTML presets so let's say I
wanted to change the background color
before I'd go ahead and type in
background color and use a preset color
like blue but now I don't get to choose
what shade of blue is going to appear
it's just going to be the default blue
which is like this really dark link
color so if I go ahead and click refresh
I've got this really dark blue but like
I said the web is so much colorful then
so much more colorful than these presets
so instead of working with an HTML
preset like this there are two other
options that we can use and the first
option or the first way to change colors
is the hexadecimal color value so I'm
going to speak to you guys about that or
if you don't want to use hexadecimal
colors you can use something called an
RGB color Val
and I'm going to show you guys how to do
that as well okay so let's just take a
look at hexadecimal colors first and
basically what a hexadecimal color is
it's basically like six characters but
they can either be numbers like numbers
1 to 9 or letters from A to F and if you
guys wanted to go ahead and get a
hexadecimal color you could go over to
Google so you could go ahead and just
search for like hexadecimal colors and
you could go ahead and there probably be
a color chart here so color picker and
you could go ahead and just pick one of
these colors and you get a color that
looks like this but what I would prefer
to do is I go over to any image editing
program so right now I'm using a program
called GIMP but sometimes they use
Photoshop as well actually most of the
time I use Photoshop but GIMP is free so
any of you guys that are watching if you
don't have the money for Photoshop go
ahead and download and install GIMP and
if you ever want to get an HTML color go
ahead and click click click not kick on
the color palette over there and
whenever you move your color around here
you can see that under HTML notation
we've got this number that's going to
change and basically whatever this
number is that is the code for the color
that you are seeing in the actual
current color palette or color block
okay so I'm going to go ahead and
actually just copy this color 0 0 B a FF
and that is going to be this really
light color blue that I use in pretty
much all of my HTML thumbnails and if I
go over to CSS instead of using this
preset color blue I can go ahead and use
my actual hexadecimal color value but
you can't go ahead and actually just
paste in your color value whenever
working with a hexadecimal color in HTML
or in CSS you actually have to put in a
hash tag just to tell HTML that whatever
comes after this is going to be a
hexadecimal color
so basically hash tag color and you're
sorted so now if I go back to Firefox
and click refresh instead of having that
like really dark horrible blue I've got
this nice easy on the eyes light blue so
that's much better and like I said we
don't only have to use hexadecimal
colors so we could go ahead and use
something called an RGB color value and
I'm going to show you guys how to do
that now so let's go back to notepad
plus plus and instead of using a
background color of hashtag whatever
let's go ahead and take that out and
we'll type in the letters R G B which
stands for red green and blue and then
you're going to open up your parentheses
and then you're going to have to put in
three different values so the first
value is how much red you want in the
actual color then how much green do once
in the color and then how much blue do
you want in the actual color but if you
go ahead and leave this at zero zero
zero then that means you're actually
going to get black so let's go back here
and click refresh and as you can see
zero zero zero on an RGB chart is black
and if you go ahead and change this to 2
5 5 to 5 to 5 then that will be white
and you can't have a number higher than
to 5 5 to 5 is the
highest number you can use on an RGB
color value so just in case you guys are
wondering and now you can see that it's
actually disappeared completely because
we made the background white but if you
guys want to actually get like a blue or
a green color in between all of that you
can go ahead and use GIMP or Photoshop
or something again and whenever you
change colors over here you can see
you've got our G B that's your red green
and blue color values and that's pretty
much where you'd be able to basically
get your values that you're going to
need so right now to get this let's
actually change it to like a green color
if we wanted this a really bright green
then we'd need a red value of 12 a green
value of 255 and a blue value of zero so
if I go back to notepad plus plus and I
go ahead and say 12 to 5 0 I should get
that really bright green so let's go
back here and click refresh and as you
can see we've got that really right
green showing up okay so that's actually
all I have for you guys in this video
