here and welcome to tutorial number 6
and in this video I am going to talk to
you guys about column inception just
kidding I'm going to be talking to you
guys about nesting the responsive grid
inside of the grid so in other words
we're going to put columns inside of
columns which is why I call it column
inception okay so let's get started by
first of all taking a look at some of
the code that I've already thrown in
here so I just went ahead and made a
container and a row and a div that takes
up 12 columns and it has a background
color of success and there's a little
bit of content there so this is
basically what we were working with in
the browser
div that is green that has some content
okay now let's take a look at what
happens when we nest a column inside of
this column so what I'm going to do is
create another div and I'm going to give
this one a class of Col lg6 and then I'm
also going to give it a background color
of BG primary and that's going to be
like a dark blue color and I'm going to
create a paragraph here and just say
this is an inner div now if I don't have
the background color we're probably not
going to be able to see how big this
column is so that's the only reason why
I'm putting the background color in and
also if I don't have contents inside of
the div it's probably not going to show
up in the browser window so that's why I
had to put a paragraph in here
so if you guys don't have the background
color or you don't have some content
it's probably not going to show up on
your screen very well okay now let me
come back here and hit refresh and did I
forget to save I think I might have I
guess I'm just going to hit ahead and
hit save and come back and hit refresh
and now you can see that we have our 12
column div and then we also have a six
column div and the result over here was
pretty much expected right you guys knew
that okay twelve columns means that this
div is going to take up the full width
of a container whereas six columns means
that this div is going to take up half
of the container so what would happen
then if I changed this parent column to
be the same size as the child column in
other words we want this one to be half
of the grid and we want this one to be
kind of the same size as its parent if
we wanted to take up the full width of
its parent so 6 + 6 because this is a
mistake that la viga is going to are
going to make right now that I've gone
ahead and done that and I come back and
hit refresh you can see that not only
did my parent div shrink to six columns
but so did the child div so whenever you
nest one column inside of another column
what you're actually saying over here
with these breakpoints is that the child
column must take up six columns of its
parent so this child div is taking up
six columns of its parents in other
words you can think of it like this
whenever you start nesting the dirt the
bootstrap grid then you're basically
creating a mini grid inside of the
column that you're actually nesting it
in so we've got a grid that starts here
and ends here that was twelve columns
but because we nested this column inside
of this div we've also got a grid that
starts here and ends here
so this div is taking up six columns of
its parents and if we wanted it to take
up its full width of its parent then I
could go ahead and change that to Col LG
twelve
and when I hit save that's going to make
it the same size or the full width of
its parent so now let me open up Firefox
again and come back here and hit refresh
and you can see that now we have the
blue div taking up as much space as it
can of its parent now the problem is we
do have this little margin over here and
that's what happens whenever you nest
columns inside of columns by default we
have that padding all that that margin
and if you want to get rid of that it is
actually quite easy we could just tap
this all in and I can create another div
over here and I'll give that a class of
row and then I will end that row off
down here okay so now we've got our
column nested inside a row nested inside
our other columns so now if I go ahead
and hit save and we come back to firefox
and i refresh this you can see we get
rid of that spacing now that is kind of
weird because it means that we won't be
able to tell that this inner div is
actually nested inside of that outer div
it kind of just looks like there are two
separate rows but if you guys ever
wanted to get rid of the padding then
that's how you can do it quite easily
now let me show you guys what happens if
I actually scale this down because right
now we have a large column at 6 and then
we have that nested column inside of it
is also got a breakpoint of the large
screen so if we scale this down to a
smaller screen this is a medium layout
you can see that now everything has
actually started stacking which is what
I told you guys would happen in the last
tutorial so if I wanted these to still
display inside of each other
a certain width so in other words I
still wanted this nested column to
display at half of its parents on a
medium screen I'd have to go ahead and
add a breakpoint for that okay so I'm
going to say Cole MD 6 and that would
mean okay it's going to take up six
columns of its parent on a medium device
but we still have to add the class up
here because whatever class the parent
has the child has to have a same class
otherwise what happens is you'll end up
messing around with the breakpoints and
it's fine right now because this is a
row but I did this before and I got a
little bit of an error so let me go
ahead and move the row and now you can
see that the parent div actually because
it is floated and it's stacking the
child if is not actually inside of the
parent div so there's a solution to that
which was to actually have the cut the
second nested column inside of a row or
what you can do is just give the parents
a class so call em d6 and now that
they've got the same breakpoints if I go
ahead and hit save and come back here
and hit refresh you can see that they'll
work the same at the same breakpoint
even if I change that to be 12 columns
at a medium breakpoint so come back and
hit refresh and it works just fine okay
so if you guys ever have any problems
with nested divs breaking outside of
their parent for some reason then you
guys know how to fix that now and that
is all I have for you guys in this video
