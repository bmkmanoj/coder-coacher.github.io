to tutorial number 21 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to speak to you
guys about the float and pier properties
in CSS
now the float property actually has a
couple of different uses but for this
example I'm just going to make like a
simple floating image and then I'm going
to get the text to wrap around the image
so the first thing we're going to need
to do is grab an image so if you take a
look at my folder structure here for my
website I've got my index page and then
I've got my CSS folder with my CSS sheet
inside and then inside you have also got
an images folder with a picture of me so
this is the picture that I'm going to be
using for this tutorial and what we can
do now is obviously just go to the body
of our website and the first thing I'm
going to do is add in an image of myself
okay image and we'll put that source
equal to images that's the folder that
my pictures in and then my picture is
called profile pic dot jpg and now what
we can do is you can also give this
image a class of profile pic profile on
the skull pick and if we go back to this
fold over here let me just show you my
picture is actually only 200 pixels wide
by 200 pixels in height so what I'm
going to do now is actually just give up
my image some attributes of width and
height
so go width is equal to 200 and the
height is equal to 200 and now the last
thing I'm going to do is actually just
add in an alt attribute and we're going
to set those equal to profile pic now
the alt attribute is just a bunch of
text that will show up on the webpage if
we cannot find my image and then
obviously the height and width I already
told you just sets a height and a width
for my image and you guys kind of know
what the rest of this stuff does so let
me go ahead and just save that and what
I'm going to do now is also let's add
two paragraphs to our website real quick
so paragraph 1 and we can just type
something in here like how now brown cow
and we'll copy pasted that a few times
just so that we've got a longer
paragraph I wonder if that is enough
okay and we'll stop there and we can
make a second paragraph and this
paragraph we can also say something
random like oh my cheese whoops oh my
cheese and exclamation mark and what we
can do here is obviously oh no wrong
keyboard shortcut ctrl C and we'll just
copy/paste that a few times and there we
go I think we've got too long enough
paragraphs so what we can do now is just
check this image I will check what this
website looks like in our browser so
let's just go launch that in Firefox and
as you can see we've got an image and
then a paragraph that appears underneath
the image and another paragraph below
that but now what we can do is actually
just go to our CSS sheet over here and
remember this class that we gave to our
picture class off profile pic we can go
ahead and grab that class and will use
it over here so . and then the class
name and all you really did you do over
here is type in the float property
and we'll set this equal to float:left
for now and then I'll explain to you
what that does so go ahead and click
refresh and as you can see we now have a
profile picture of myself with the
paragraphs wrapping around my image but
obviously there's not much space over
here so it's kind of hard to read so if
you wanted to what you could do is then
go ahead and give a margin around the
image so let's just go ahead and make a
margin of about 10 pixels for now then
save that and refresh and now as you can
see we've got a bit of space in between
our image and our paragraphs so that's
pretty cool and that's pretty much what
the float:left property does and I
actually just want to go back here real
quick and show you something so seeing
as there was a float:left you guys are
probably wondering if I could float the
image right and the answer to that is
yes you can and what happens when you do
that is obviously the image instead of
being on the left is going to be on the
right so let's go ahead and click
refresh and as you can see we now have
an image that is floated to the right so
that's what floating an image to the
left or the right dies but as you can
see with the bottom paragraph like if
you've got two paragraphs your your top
paragraph and your bottom paragraph both
wrap around the image so what I'm going
to do now is actually just go back here
quickly and just set this back to float
left just because I prefer it on the
left and we're going to need to make my
paragraphs just a little bit longer
so I'll copy this and make about twice
the size it is now and I'll do the same
thing for this so ctrl-c ctrl-v
and now it's basically double the size
so let's go back here fresh and that's
just about perfect
okay now what I was saying was the
bottom paragraph always seems to be
wrapping around the image just like the
top paragraph does but what if we wanted
our bottom paragraph to appear below our
image you know like maybe you didn't
actually want it to wrap around our
image over here so what we have to do
now is use the clear property to force
this paragraph to appear below our
floated image so what you can do now is
we're going to have to go back to
notepad plus plus go ahead and give our
second paragraph a class of below let's
just make that class below class equals
wheel ooh or anything you really want to
name it but I can't think of a better
name at the moment so below it will be
and we'll go ahead and just go ahead and
select that class and now what we're
going to do is use the clear property to
clear the floated image so our floated
image at the moment is floated left so
what we can do now is clear the left
side I'm going to go ahead and save this
and refresh our image now or our
paragraph now appears below the floated
image so that's pretty much what clear
does and it works in pretty much the
exact same way as the float property
does so if you had the image floated
right then you would have to clear the
right and if you didn't clear the right
then it would just wrap around so let's
go back there as you can see our text
though wraps around the image until we
go ahead and clear the right so let's go
ahead and do that
BAM
okay so now it's cleared and what I
actually like to do is instead of
clearing the same as the image you know
like what if I actually had two images
and one was floated left and the other
one was floated right and I just wanted
to make sure that my content appear
below everything what you can do to just
make sure that this paragraph
appears below the image no matter if
it's clear floated on the left or on the
right what you then do is you just go
ahead and say clear both and then it
doesn't really matter which side the
image is floated to your paragraph is
always going to be on the bottom so
