here and welcome to tutorial number 20
and in this tutorial we are going to be
taking a look at finishing of this
slider so yeah if I take a look at the
slider here and then I take a look at
the slider in my design I think there
are quite a few differences so first of
all the text needs to change this button
is definitely a lot bigger in my design
than it is over here and then I think
also if I scroll down a little bit I've
made a little bit of a problem here in
the footer of my website and I need to
fix that as well so that's not quite got
to do with the slider but I think that
was just something I missed out during
the photo tutorial and I'd like to kind
of take care of that now so yeah the
first thing you need to do is open
everything up in your text editor and
I've already got a bunch of these files
open here so I'm going to be working in
the index file and I'm also going to be
working in the footer on inked PHP file
and I'm probably also going to be
working in custom CSS so let's open that
up now as well so one thing I want to
change in the footer is do you see where
it says div class UK with medium one of
two right that splits our footer into
two parts so the left side and then the
right side but basically I can just set
a bigger break point for this so if I
type the word medium in between the 1
and the width basically that just means
that the break point for this should be
on medium screen so anything smaller
than a medium screen will display as
full width whereas everything larger
than a medium screen will display as 1
off to right and if that doesn't make
any sense to you at all let me just go
ahead and save this and if we jump back
over to the browser and refresh you can
see that now these two are actually
taking up the full width on a small
screen on our mobile screen but anything
bigger than a mobile screen or a medium
screen
anything bit that that is a medium
screen or bigger it splits it splits up
and it takes up half for this one and
then half of the screen for this one
alright so yeah that kind of fixed my
footer problem but not quite because I
think there were a few other things that
I needed to fix here so let's inspect
again and yeah with my mobile inspector
on you can see that this is still left
aligned or right aligned and this is
still left aligned so we can add in
another class here which is just UK text
Center
- small now the - small just means on a
small screen will Center the text so
this is a really useful really handy
class that is available to us in UI kit
and if I save that now and jump back
over to the browser and refresh boom on
a small screen it is centered so that is
if we look at my footer design here
looking much much better I think just
when I made this footer I made it really
big so I gave quite a lot of spacing in
here and I could fix this with some
custom CSS but I'm actually not quite
sure my footer needs to be this big
either so I'm sort of happy to stick
with that and maybe just give it a
little bit more line height that's
something I could do so let's just
inspect this and maybe what I could do
is is in my footage just just give that
an extra class so let's go back to my
code and for my footer we already have a
class here
TM footer that's great I'm gonna use
that class in my CSS and I'm just gonna
give this a line height of I suppose
it's 16 pixels right now so let's let's
try 25 pixels as a line height and see
if that makes anything better
that's a refresh hmm I don't think that
changed anything but it also might be
cached so let's hard refresh yeah
yeah the photo got a little bit bigger I
suppose we could we could bump this up
some let's make it like 50 pixels or
something just for ah there we go that
looks and that looks very close to my
design actually yeah okay well I think
I'm gonna I'm gonna be happy with that
and leave that as is
but now let's move on to our slider and
yeah one thing I want to do here is just
make these or this button really big so
I think one way to do that is let's jump
back over to and yeah in our slideshow
code right now let's find these buttons
so there's one here and there's one here
and instead of using the UK button large
class I suppose we can add in our own
class here of TM button very large or
something and I guess we could also just
keep this class and modify upon that I'm
not quite sure what what all that class
is adding right now but yeah now if
we've got this class here let's let's
just change TM button very large TT a
button huge
I think that'll take up a little bit
less space because it's quite a long
class all right so let's copy that move
that over to our CSS and I'm gonna paste
that in here and let's go ahead and
start styling this so I think one thing
we can do here is just give it a little
bit more padding so I think right now
it's got no pixels or no padding on the
top and the bottom so let's just give it
10 pixels and then 15 pixels for the
left and the right will also give it a
line hides of something like 36 pixels
and a font size of 36 pixels and the
reason why I'm choosing 36 pixels for
the font size by the way if the if the
line height or the font size is gonna be
36 we should probably make this
let's make it 44 right just to be a
little bit bigger than the actual space
of our text now the reason why I'm
choosing 36 for the text is because I
believe that this heading over here is
size 36 so let's refresh and boom our
button text is about the same size as
our text in the slider right now and
yeah everything's looking pretty good
there it does seem to be like some
opacity on my button and I'm not sure
why I'm gonna have to try and see if I
can fix that because yeah if you if you
zoom in a lot
let's try make that a hundred and fifty
you can kind of see through this button
so I think I'm gonna need you to try and
fix that
okay so I've gone ahead and found the
problem here but basically if you
inspect element on the slideshow
it's the opacity is not on the button
it's also not on the heading one or the
div above that it's on the entire
overlay panel right so looking at this
overlay panel there is a class and it
must be in our custom CSS file I don't
know if I change this by accident or if
this is just how it came on UI kids
customizer but the overlay has a slight
transparency of 0.7 but if we change
that to one I can see through or I can I
can't see through the button anymore
which is good that's exactly what I want
and the background of our overlay also
gets a little bit darker which I'm fine
with
I think it is actually a little bit
darker in my design anyway if I scroll
all the way back up yeah no it isn't I
don't think I put an overlay there right
but yeah this darkness will come in
handy if I use a very light colored
image in the background so if I use an
image that might have a little bit of
white or something this this dark
background usually counts as
that so that this white text that's on
our slider is gonna be visible so I'm
absolutely okay with having a dark
background here in fact I would have
wanted it I'm not sure why I didn't put
it in the design maybe that was just
time constraints but yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and just leave this as it is so I
could I could go ahead and make this
change in UI kits customizer but that's
probably gonna take some time so instead
of doing that I'm just gonna do it the
short way and I'm gonna copy this
exactly as it is from Google Chrome and
just paste that in my custom CSS file
over here and that's gonna overwrite the
stuff on the slideshow that I didn't
like so if I save this now and we look
at this in the browser again I should
now no longer have transparency on my
slideshow so that's pretty awesome right
and yeah I think the next thing I wanted
to do and the last thing I wanted to do
was just change the text on my slideshow
so let's pick some cheesy text that we
can put in our heading ones here and I
think in my design we had your next
adventure awaits so that's something
cool let's put that in here your next
adventure away it's book now and then
for the next one we can also do
something cheesy like have an awesome
there's a holiday in Namibia or
something not that anybody would want to
go to holiday and it is it but the this
picture over here looks looks a lot like
a desert ride in Namibia and Namibia is
a neighboring country of mine so I've
always wanted to go and I never have
gone so probably be pretty cool oh by
the way observant people might have
noticed that I I switched the images
around
so maybe that's something I can do here
is just switch those back have that as
image 1 and that is image - okay awesome
okay so that's looking a little bit
better here we still have text appearing
underneath the arrows okay so something
we could do to to fix this it'll be a
quick fix is to go over to this heading
one and let's add some break tags in
here so I think if I had a break tag
here and there's a holiday in Namibia
hmm let's try another break tag there
but let's give these break tags a class
of UK visible small and we can just copy
that and paste that onto that break tag
another reason why I am putting this
class on here is because that'll make
sure that the break tag only shows up
and breaks the line on a small screen so
on a mobile phone screen which means on
a desktop it shouldn't break it all
right so let's refresh okay so that's
looking good and let's go to slide two
all right so that's still kind of hidden
behind the navigation but because it's
only visible on a small screen it will
still display all in one line on a big
screen like this which is totally cool
so maybe I can just add in one more
break tag after holiday and I suppose
this is something that you know you
might want to check across a variety of
screen sizes just to make sure that it
displays well on all screen sizes but I
think desktops looking good and mobile
is looking fine as
I mean I'm totally okay with that I
don't know if I'm happy with this text
here but I think I'll try and think of a
solution and then we'll try and
implement that in a future video but for
now I think I'm gonna end this video of
here because this this slideshow is
looking much much better and my foot is
looking much much better so yeah before
