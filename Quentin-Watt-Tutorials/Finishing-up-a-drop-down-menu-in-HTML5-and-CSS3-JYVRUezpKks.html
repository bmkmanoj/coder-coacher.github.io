of the series and I know if you guys
watched the last video you probably
thought we'd be done with the drop-down
menu and why we still here but there
were some things that I thought maybe we
could just improve a little bit I know
it's not the best drop-down menu in the
world critics will argue but maybe we
can just do something to make it a
little bit better you know so um right
now the text in the sub list is as big
as the main list which you know we can
change we can get away get rid of that
double border maybe and maybe just
change the color of the link that we're
hovering over just so that the user
knows exactly what they're hovering over
even though they could probably see just
with the mouse but you know just to make
the website a little bit more
interactive so what we'll do now is
we'll go over to our top nav ul ul Li a
which is top nav ul ul Li a those these
ones that one that one and that one and
just change them ah
click so what we'll do now is font
because we wanted to change the size of
the font and we'll make it bold 14
pixels and capital S sans-serif there we
go okay and then the next thing we can
do ah sound serif okay and next thing we
can do is obviously change the text of
that thing so top nav ala hover
okay li a:hover and then open up our
brackets there okay and what we want is
maybe just for the color of the text
let's change to red and one other thing
that we can do is Li just a hover this
I've made a background image that we've
already used and if we run this in
chrome again because I quit chrome
instead of minimizing we've already got
a background gradient where it goes from
dark to light now
maybe when we're hovering over this we
can swap the gradient around and now all
that we need to do then is just swap the
rotate the image around 180 degrees and
then save it as another name which I've
already done so we can go here
background and then image and then URL
and what was it called now under school
have a dot PNG okay so now I have two
got done I've done let's just go ahead
and take a look in chrome this time I
didn't quit it okay so now we've got the
text that changes color and the
background image that flips around every
time you hover over one of these top
ones and then when you go into the list
okay you can see the background image is
followed which will have to delete now
and then the text changes color just
that you got you know exactly which one
you're hovering over okay so to get rid
of the background image from the sub
list if we don't want that their top
underscore nav Allah
let's go ul ul L R and then hover and
we'll just copy this
that's the any part we need really
control-c control-v and we'll write
there none so no background image and
that should be done so we go back here
refresh and there we go so there is your
drop-down menu
fully functional and styled I know it's
not the best drop-down menu in the world
area we said we might take those borders
out but that's not too difficult either
just go down to top nav ul ul Li and go
border woops border-top:none and now go
back screw refresh okay so now I think
we're done and there we go that is your
drop down menu thanks for watching my
series please comment on my videos

be adding some more in future
