again and in this video I just wanted to
answer a question that I get asked quite
often because a lot of people ask the
question in a number of different ways
they asked Quinton how do I get a job
all they ask is this enough to know to
get a job or they ask what do I need to
learn to get a job right so it's it's
those three questions and like this is
something that whenever somebody asked
that question I'm like well it depends
what do you want to do right because
obviously it does depend not every job
is the same therefore not every jobs
requirements are gonna be the same and
not every job role is the same like you
might be contacting me and you want to
be a front-end developer right then you
need to know different stuff to somebody
who wants to be a back-end developer and
it's the same thing for full-stack
developers it's the same thing for
database administrators so there are a
whole bunch of like different job play
what's the word positions that you could
be like career paths that you could take
right and what you need to learn or what
you need to know it depends on the
career path that you want to follow
right so what I'm trying to say here is
there is no like one answer fits all
this is what you need to go out and do
to get a job but what I can tell you is
the four points or the four steps that I
took to getting a job and finding out
what I needed to know to make myself
employable and I am gonna assume that
most of you guys who asked this question
and who are looking for the answer to
this question are people who are not in
a university or a college or a boot camp
or something because when you go to a
boot camp they kind of just tell you
what to learn so you already know versus
if you're trying to learn yourself and
you don't know what to learn right so I
am also self-taught and therefore this
is the these are the four steps that I
took step number one is to decide what
you want to be now a lot of the time
when people ask me this question and I'm
like well it depends on what you want to
do they usually reply back and go hey I
just want to job any job it doesn't
matter
and that's a really bad mentality to
have right because without a goal you
can't score if you're sitting there
going out on a job any job it doesn't
matter to me what you're doing is you're
just shooting bullets in the dark and
hoping you hit a target whereas if
you've decided what it is you want to do
you know where that target is you know
what you're chasing and you know way
what you want to shoot at right so
there's a lot better chance of you
actually hitting that target there's a
lot better chance of you getting that
job when you know what job you want and
I mean I can go into another analogy
here you don't go out and buy a TV or a
computer or a computer game or something
without knowing what it is you want
right you usually kind of already know
what you want before you walk into the
store and it's the same thing with the
job you should try and figure out what
it is you want to do before just going
for interviews right so decide what you
want to do step one step two right is to
look for jobs in that role I'm not
saying apply to the jobs I'm just saying
look for jobs in that role so if you've
decided I want to be a WordPress
developer or if you've decided I want to
be a front-end developer look for jobs
in that role and so if you go ahead and
look for jobs in the role whatever all
you want to be whether it be a front-end
developer or WordPress developer
something like that right just look for
those jobs and then you'll be able to
see what people are looking for in you
as a developer right and I would say
don't look at one job description look
at like a hundred because then you can
get a really good idea of what guys are
looking for and you're gonna notice
obviously the same stuff for every
front-end developer or WordPress
developer job people are gonna want you
to know WordPress people are gonna want
you to know
Joomla HTML and five html5 and css3 like
those are the kind of the basic things
that you're gonna need to know you're
gonna need to know responsive design or
responsive development you just that's
the way the Internet has gone so you're
gonna need to know those things like
definitely right but then comes the part
where like some guys are gonna want you
to know jQuery but other guys are gonna
be fussy and they're gonna say like I
don't want you to use jQuery we use
nodejs
company and other companies are gonna
say we don't use nodejs we use angular
right or we use gulp so there's gonna be
these like finicky things where
different companies are gonna want you
know different stuff depending on what
it is they use at the company and the
light is kind of fading or the Sun is
going down but once you've done step 2
and you've gone and searched for the
jobs and you found what it is people are
looking for in your area and what people
are looking for in your career path
right then I'd say step three is to go
ahead and learn those things but don't
only learn those things build a
portfolio right because very often when
you look for a job and when you go into
these job interviews guys or the
employer is not really going to care
about whether you say you can do the
work but if you can show them work that
you have already done if you can show
them work that like you can say okay
here are three website I built three
websites I've built or you know here's a
project that I worked on for quite a
long time if you can show them something
that you have worked on that is gonna be
a lot more valuable than you're just
saying that you could do the work and
it's also gonna be a lot more valuable
than a degree believe it or not as I've
spoken to a bunch of employers here in
my city at least and a lot of them will
say it actually doesn't really matter
whether you have a degree or not because
most of the universities are not
up-to-date with the technology that we
use currently like because we're always
changing like we're always moving faster
with technology than the universities
are moving with curriculums so often
they don't really care if someone has a
degree or not but if you have a
portfolio of work that you can show that
you were able to do work with recent
technology and recent stuff that they've
been using like nodejs or angularjs or
something like that then you are gonna
get the job trust me you stand on a lot
higher chance of getting the job than
somebody who doesn't have a portfolio
and then I'd say step number four is to
go out there and own that interview so
be confident when you go out there and
get interviewed know your stuff right so
they're gonna ask you questions and
they're
interview you need to make sure that you
know the stuff that they're asking and
if you don't know something that they're
asking then be honest right I find a lot
of people they don't people don't really
want to admit when they don't know
something you know it's kind of
embarrassing you go for the interview
and they say you need it to know PHP but
you didn't actually know PHP and now
they ask you a question about PHP and
you like you don't want to say I don't
know so you try and make up like an
answer and like at that point they're
just gonna they're just gonna see that
you don't you clearly don't know and
they're probably gonna be a little bit
annoyed at you for wasting their time
whereas if you say look I don't actually
know PHP but I'm willing to learn it if
that's something that you you do every
day or work with every day
in this field I'd say PHP is quite a big
one you should learn that but let's just
say it was a small thing like they use
git right and you don't know get then
yeah just be like listen I don't know
get but I'll learn it over the weekend
or I'll learn it over a week if you put
me in a position where I get to use git
every day I will learn it so yeah just
be honest and let people know when you
don't know something if it is something
small don't pretend like you do know
what it is and like give bad answers or
wrong answers and then also yeah another
point for owning an interview which is
part of of that is when you don't know
something demonstrate that you're
willing to learn and also just
demonstrate that you're willing to learn
in general so you know if if they ask
you questions about how you learn and if
you're willing to learn yeah like most
companies out there are not gonna want
somebody who comes into the company and
just remain stagnant like you shouldn't
just be this guy of like okay I've got a
job I'm happy now you should want to
learn things and you should want to grow
in the business so demonstrate that
you're willing to learn and yeah those
are that's that's my advice for earning
the interview just be confident admit
when you don't know something and show
them that you're willing to learn and so
that's all I have for you guys in this
video but before we end off I just want
