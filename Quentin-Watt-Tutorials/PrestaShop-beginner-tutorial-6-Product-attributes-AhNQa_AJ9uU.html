here and welcome to tutorial number six
in this PrestaShop series and I have no
idea what I'm going to do when I run out
of fingers to counter tutorials on but
yeah in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at product customization so
if you guys watch the previous video I
there were a few things where I said ok
I'm gonna handle that in the next video
I'm gonna handle that in the next video
and yeah now it's the next video
and I'm gonna handle that so let's take
a look at our products of ESO I'm logged
into PrestaShop let's go to catalog and
I'll take a look at my product quickly
so I set up this green hoodie as a
product in the previous video and there
are a couple of things we can do to
customize this product now and actually
add like different sizes or different
colors or different patterns whatever it
is to our product so to do that let's go
over to product attributes in the menu
over here and you can see that right now
we have a few products or probably
attributes set up already so we've got
size shoe size color and depending on
our product we can choose which one of
these which one of these attributes we
want to use so if we take a look at size
you can see at the moment there's a
small medium large and one size and we
can always go ahead and hit add new
value which is above my head over there
and we can add a new value to this
product like extra large or extra extra
large or whatever the case may be but
I'm going to leave this one alone and
let's go ahead and add in our own
product attribute so again up in the top
corner above my head there is an add new
attribute button click on that and
that's going to take us through to the
page where we get to add some attributes
so I'm going to add a patents attribute
and when we give this name patents that
is what displays in the back end but
then public name is whatever
name displays in the front end for our
viewers so let's just leave it at
patterns as well but it could be
different in the front end to the back
end if you wanted to URL I'm going to
leave that blank major title I'm going
to leave that blank indexable we can
also say no just so that this attribute
doesn't show up or something but I'm
going to I'm going to leave it IDs
attribute type let's change it from
drop-down list and make that a color or
texture because if this is a pattern we
need to have a texture right so let's
hit save and that is our attribute set
up and ready now what we need to do is
actually give this attribute some values
so I mean you saw what values we had
here let's go over to patterns and
actually add a couple values I'm going
to hit add I'm going to go in here and
then hit add and for our attribute group
that's going to be we're adding this to
the patterns value let's say circles
because you'll see why when I show you
the image URL I'm going to leave a blank
meta title I will leave a blank we could
always fold this in a later stage color
I'm not going to change because we're
not using colors we're using textures so
I'm going to add a file over here and
this is a pattern with some circles on
it not the best example because the
hoodie is not going to look like this
but just so you guys get to see like
that I can add an image and it'll show
up let's use that one and I'm going to
hit save and add another value then for
this one we'll give it a value of
zigzags I guess that's what the pattern
looked like to me URL leave blank made a
title leave blank color leave blank and
add an image that one will be the zig
zags so let's open that and I'm just
going to hit save so we've got our two
textures set up
if I go into patterns you can see that
we've got the name for each one of these
and we've got an image for each one of
these so now the image will show up and
then the user can choose like oh they
wanted with this pattern or oh they
wondered with that pattern whatever and
it'll show up so let's go back to lists
now and actually let's go to our product
and take a look at how to add an
attribute to a product so let's go to
products and I'm going to scroll down to
the bottom over here we've got green
hoodie as a product so yeah if we go
over to combinations that is where we
add our attributes and I could like hit
new combination and go through this in
like a really weird way but I'm just
going to go to the combinations
generator this is a lot easier in my
opinion so let's go ahead and hit OK and
now that gives us a list of all our
attributes and all I have to do is
highlight the attributes that apply to
this product so let's say I wanted to
use my patterns that I just set up I can
highlight those and I also want to use
the size so I'll hit command on my
keyboard and just highlight all of these
as well hit add and it adds all of these
attributes to our product and right now
you can see we can like change the text
so if I'm choosing it with one pattern
adds more text or whatever to the
product we can go ahead and add that in
here excluding or including or whatever
but I'm just going to hit generate
combinations right at the bottom because
we can always edit this stuff just now
so let's hit generate sorry I realized
just now is a South African term just
now you guys probably didn't even know
what I meant there but that means later
at another time so yeah yeah we've got
all my attributes showing up on
combinations and I can edit each one of
these individually so
let's say pattern zigzag and a size of
small sum for some reason changes the
price of my product then I can go over
to that edit button come over to impact
on price and I can say you know what if
they choose a hoodie that has size small
and has zigzags the price is going to be
increased to a new price so we can say
including or excluding that what it's
going to be but I've set text to zero
anyway so yeah it's going to calculate
it for me whatever I add in here to be
the same thing because I said text to
zero so let's go ahead and hit save and
stay at the bottom over here and now
when I take a look at my product
combinations you can see that if they
order a hoodie that has a zigzag pattern
and is in the small size the impacts on
the price is 300 ran increase which
means the price will be double the price
basically if they choose that one option
and if we go to the front end over here
and I actually click on my product to
view it you can see that now I've got my
combination set up here so we've got
size and we've got patterns displaying
and the user can pick zigzags and you
can see immediately the price goes to
600 Rand because it's zig zags with the
size of small but if I change that back
to medium then the price changes as well
so that's how to work with attributes
and you can always go ahead and go back
to the back office and change your
change your pricing structure so
depending on what the price needs to be
or whatever set that up and that's all
I'm going to show you guys for
attributes but let's take a look at
features so I'm going to click on that
link and you can see that we've got
height width depth etc and we can always
add a new feature here like actually I
wouldn't even know what we can add but
yeah if you want to add one it's going
to work the same way as an attribute
just go ahead and add it and then you
can give it some values and once you've
set that all up you can go back to your
product and I'm going to go back to
green hoodie here we can go over to
features on my product and you saw
height was one of the features that we
had available we can go ahead and use
our predefined values so I guess that
was something that you know it was just
the customized value we could put in
whatever we wanted otherwise if it was
some like Styles whatever it's a
drop-down list so we get to choose what
style and we want like casual whatever
okay so back to product features you'll
see that Styles is got all those options
set up as a drop-down list okay so we've
got that set up now let's take a look at
manufacturers real quick so you can set
up your own manufacturer whereas this is
just the information it'll display in
the front end when you add a
manufacturer to a product and right now
we have this default fashion
manufacturer and we've also got a
favorite brand that I added that didn't
have a logo and we can always go ahead
and add in a new manufacturer and then a
new address as well so we've got
manufacturers from about addresses so
basically you share this information
with the client and then that way if
something goes wrong with the product
they can take it to the manufacturer and
like they'll have all the details for
the manufacturer over here so let's say
add a new manufacturer I'm just going to
say
quinton short description and don't talk
to me long description
I am the menu factory rear logo I don't
really have a logo let's just put the
picture of me over here
I made a title etc we can we put all of
that in but I'm just going to leave all
of that as it is enable I'm going to say
yes so people can use this product or
people can add this manufacturer to a
product let's get rid of that bar well
this little task bar does one of this
piano let's go add a manufacturer
address go to Quinton and we can just
add a all my details of yes a Quinton
wat address whoo okay I'll put that
address in three seven four Rivonia
Boulevard let's put that one in putting
in fake details now by the way um st.
Martin South Africa is the country
anyways
cool let's just hit save with all those
details in like it is and there we go we
have Quinton as a manufacturer with some
details if I go back over to my product
I can go to my green hoodie over here
and and manufacturers somewhere where
was it it was under associations we
associated with the manufacturer okay
I'm not just going to put my name there
so let's save and stay if I come back to
the front end and I hit refresh then it
might show okay I think it does show
thee I don't think it shows the
manufacturer details so that's fine okay
so just a little correction on
the manufacturer basically some of the
information you use is slightly false
when you add a manufacturer to a product
it doesn't actually show the
manufacturer on the product so like when
you're looking at a product like this on
the product page it doesn't show the
manufacturer or let's go back to my
product make more sense that way so on
my hoodie it doesn't show the
manufacturer here on this product but if
you create a link to a manufacturer so
I've got I've created link to the
manufacturer Quinten then once you've
done that it'll display the
manufacturers information and their
details and then all the products that
you have listed from that manufacturer
will display underneath so that's just
how that that shows up I do believe it
is possible to show the manufacturer on
the product page over here but you have
to edit the template and that is kind of
out of scope for this video so yeah I'm
not going to show you guys that but
that's all I have for you in this video
so don't forget to subscribe please feel
free to leave a comment like and share
this video it's really going to help my
channel grow and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
