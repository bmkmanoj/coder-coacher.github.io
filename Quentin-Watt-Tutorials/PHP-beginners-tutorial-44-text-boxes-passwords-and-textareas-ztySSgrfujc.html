here and this is tutorial number 44 and
in this tutorial I am going to start
covering how to retrieve data from form
elements okay so in this tutorial we are
going to cover text fields password
fields and text areas okay and then in
the next couple of tutorials we'll look
at select lists and radio buttons etc
okay but for now I just want to explain
to you guys that I do have this code
from the previous tutorial where I was
showing you guys the difference between
the get method and the post method okay
and as it turns out when I showed you
guys the difference between get and post
we actually already learned how to grab
data from the text field input okay so
as you guys can remember from this this
tutorial from this program I could type
in my name so let's go ahead and type in
Quinton and type in what and we were
able to display my name back out to
myself in the browser okay so that's
basically how to work with the text
field is the code that we used in the
previous tutorial so I'm not going to go
and change this too much but let's let's
just use this name input again except
we'll change it to username and I'll
give the name of the input element a
name of username and then we'll leave
the type as text but for surname let's
go ahead and change this so instead of
saying surname we'll change this to
password and we need to change the type
to password and we'll change the name to
password okay now the difference between
a text
and a password type is now whenever we
run this in Firefox so let's go back
here and click refresh
if you ever type something in this
password field
it gets rendered out as bullet points
instead of as normal characters like a
text box does okay and there was still
one more thing I wanted to do so let's
go ahead and throw in a break tag just
after our password here and we'll throw
in a break tag after our username as
well break and I'm going to place in a
text area element and we'll just end
that off text area and I'm going to give
this a name of data I guess just
something that the user can fill in and
we should actually be good to go just
like that so let's maybe just throw in
another break tag after this to make
sure that this button over here is
displayed on a new line okay
so now when I go ahead and click refresh
I've got a username field a password
field and a text area that I can type
some data into okay so let's go ahead
and actually program some code that will
actually expect all of the starter and
then be able to display it back out to
the user and I'm going to do that in my
handler file because as you guys can see
whenever we click Submit on this form
the data will all be sent through to
handler dot PHP okay so let's go ahead
and maybe just delete all this code and
lead this PHP tag yeah or just the code
in the PHP tag okay and let's create
some new variables so I'm going to
create a variable called username and
we'll set that equal to dollar
underscore and what are we using here
we're actually using the get method so
let's change this to post because
whenever you're working with sensitive
data like a password or if you're
working with a lot of data which might
be typed into a text area it's always
best to use the post method okay so
let's go back in and just change this to
dollar underscore post and then we'll
grab the username from I will post a
dancer then we'll go ahead and get our
password so that was pot we'll name that
password and we'll get that from dollar
underscore post password okay and
basically this will then grab the
password from our posted data and if you
guys aren't sure where I'm getting this
these values from whatever is typed in
here
okay I'm grabbing it from the actual
name of our input element so whatever
you named your input element over here
or your form field over here that is
what the data is going to be sent
through as in this array so this dollar
underscore post is actually an array of
all the data that was filled in in this
form and then we can go ahead and grab
it by name so I've grabbed my user name
I grabbed my password now let's go ahead
and get the text area so I'm going to
call this variable data and we'll set
that to dollar underscore post data okay
and that should get the content that was
included in our text area so now let's
go ahead and actually write some code
that will output all of this and we'll
just say maybe echo
welcome and then we'll append on the
variable username and let's actually
include a space in here and then we're
going to have to append on a space over
here and we'll say your your password is
and then we'll just display the password
so password just if I can get that
spelled correctly and then let's go
ahead and actually include a break tag
over here and then append on some more
data and the last thing I actually want
to append on is your this data variable
over here so let's just say your data is
: and we'll actually keep a break tag in
here and then append on the variable
data okay and that's actually just how
easy it is to grab values from a text
field or a text area or a password it's
just as easy as just grabbing that from
the actual array and then we can go
ahead and echo them out just like this
once we've made our variables okay so
now let's go over to Firefox and I'm
going to click refresh over here and
we'll fill in a name of Quinton we can
just go password is hello or something
and this is my daughter I hope I have a
lot okay and this is now going to be
stored in our data variable so let's go
ahead and click Submit and I'm just
going to ignore that okay so it says
welcome Quinton your password is hello
and your data is this is my daughter I
hope I have a lot so whatever I typed in
here we were able to display out over
here so that's pretty cool and that's
how to grab data from text areas
password fields or text fields and I
hope this tutorial really came in handy
for you guys and that's actually all I
