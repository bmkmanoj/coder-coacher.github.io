to tutorial number 35 and in this
tutorial I just want to go over the
layout of your website a little bit and
I want to explain some new tags that
were made for html5 and they just have
the ability to be a lot more descriptive
than normal dove tags so if you take a
look at all websites and let me just go
ahead and open up my YouTube page real
quick okay so I'm just going to go open
my YouTube page and there we go that is
my youtube channel right there and if
you just take a look at pretty much all
web sites all over but you can include
my youtube channel there are pretty much
five different parts to your web page
okay so the first part that we have is
the header which is right at the top and
that usually has like your logo maybe
your search bar and things like that and
then the next part that we have is your
navigation and that is usually
underneath the header but on YouTube
we've kind of got luck we have to click
on our name over here and then we get
the navigation and we can go through to
our different pages okay so right now
I'm already on my channel so it doesn't
really matter and then as you can see
I've actually got 297 subscribers and
pretty much almost 20,000 views which is
quite exciting and then on the side we
have sidebars so we've got a this is
pretty much all the people I'm
subscribed to and all that kind of stuff
and then we've also got a sidebar here
and in the middle we've got our main
section and if we scroll all the way
down to the bottom we have our footer so
those are actually our five parts to our
website the header the nav the okay so
let me just go the header the nav the
sidebar the main section and
the footer because some websites only
have one sidebar they don't have to like
YouTube so that's just basically the
five different tags and we can go over
to our note pad over yeah we can
actually start writing a little website
using those new tags so let me go ahead
and the first thing we can do is just
add in a header so as you can see these
are actual real tags that we can use
because they're turning blue
so there we go so hitter and inside our
header usually there is your logo so
that would be an image with your logo
logo dot PNG and I actually don't have a
logo so I'm not going to have any image
showing up alt equals logo image and we
might as well just put a heading at two
because our image isn't going to show up
so go H to H two and impart it just
right welcome to my website
yeah we'll leave the typos okay so and
then after your header you would usually
have your nav so let's go ahead and
create your nav
so that's short for navigation how did I
spell this wrong nav okay well y'all
sorry is supposed to be nav thinking
navigation type nav okay so there we go
nav and okay so that is on nav which we
would have our navigation in and usually
your navigation is always in the form of
an unordered list so we can go ahead and
ending ul and we'll have to put some
list items in here and your nav usually
has links to all the other
pages on your website so you can go
ahead and add in some links href equals
and for now if i just put in hash if we
click on our link it's not going to take
us anyway so the first page is usually
always your home page and pretty much
every website has a bout page and then a
contact page cool so that is our nav
pretty much done and inside off down F
we can have our main section so that
will be in our section tags but I'm
actually not going to go over main
section just yet because there's
actually a lot of stuff that can
actually be put into our main section so
I'm going to save that for the next
tutorial so we can just go ahead and
make a comment over here next tutorial
and then we can have our sidebar so that
would be like pretty much the bar on the
side of our section and the element for
that is called a side so a side and a
side
cool and in your sidebar a lot of
websites would use this just for like
news or like recent events so you could
probably just go ahead and add in a
header and say recent news and probably
put a paragraph in yet with some news so
mmm you know what actually can't think
of any news at the moment so might as
well just say add me on Twitter at
quinton watch cool so you guys can go
ahead and add me on Twitter and after
that we'll have our footer so you know
alpha is basically the last part of the
website all the way down over here and
that usually contains links to all sorts
of things but in some websites you'll
see when they don't have as many pages
as YouTube does they just have a
copyright in their footer so let's just
go ahead and add in our footer and
ending footer and inside the footer we
usually have like a copyright so to make
the copyright symbol you go and copy and
that makes the copyright symbol and you
can just say well copyright Quentin what
dot-com I guess okay so we can go ahead
and save this and we can actually go
ahead and run this in Firefox now so run
in Firefox and there we go we actually
have like a little mini web page so you
can see my logo doesn't show up because
I don't have one yet and then there's
the title to my web page which is all
actually inside our header as you saw in
that code so that's our header and
underneath that we had our navigation
which was links to other pages on our
website which actually fake because they
not on our website and then we had our
sidebar and as you can see our sidebar
is now not on the side it's actually
underneath everything and then we've got
our foot lost at the bottom over there
okay so these new elements don't
actually change anything
on the layout of our website just yet we
actually still have to use style rules
to change the layout those these new
elements are actually just there to be
more descriptive than a native tag so
old websites before html5 used to have
to use a div tag for every single one of
these sections and it kind of got a
little bit confusing because you were
sitting there like okay well this is a
div and this is a div and this is a bill
but what they will do
so now you've at least got more
descriptive tags that you can use for
your website so that's pretty much all I
have for you guys in this tutorial and
will pretty much move on with this code
in the next tutorial and I'll explain
what to do in this section and then
we'll start styling the website a little
bit later so that's pretty much what you
guys have got to get excited for and
thank you very much for watching and I
will see you guys next next time don't
