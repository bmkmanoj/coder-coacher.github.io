here and welcome to tutorial number 41
and in this tutorial we are going to
talk about two built-in language
constructs in PHP called include and
require now these two language
constructs are actually very useful and
they'll save you from typing out a heck
of a lot of code if you use them
correctly okay so basically what they
allow you to do is include code written
in another file onto the file that
you're working with at the moment or the
file that you want that code to be on as
well okay so let's say for instance I
was making a header for my web page okay
then basically I could go ahead and code
my header in another file which are
called header dot PHP and then I could
include it exactly where I want it in my
HTML code on my actual home page and
then I could go ahead and include that
same header on every single one of my
web pages so I wouldn't have to type the
code out or copy and paste the code
across all our web pages like I would
have had to have done if I was just
using normal HTML okay and this will
work for PHP code as well so if for
instance you had one PHP file that you
wanted all of your core functions to be
in you could go ahead and include all
those functions onto the page that would
use those functions and then obviously
be able to use those functions across
your index page and every other web page
as long as you included your functions
file so just to show you guys what I
mean
let's create a header in this header dot
PHP page and as you guys will notice
this is basically my file structure at
the moment I've got my main page or my
home page index dot PHP and then
my header.php file which is empty so
we'll create a head over here so we'll
just put in two heading tags or header
tags and then we'll put a heading one
and ending heading one and we'll just
say this is the page header okay so now
we've got our header we can go back to
our index page and as you can see this
is all just a basic HTML if you guys
don't understand what's going on with
this code then you need to watch my HTML
series because I explained all of that
okay but for now let's go ahead and at
the top of my body where I want my
header to be I'm going to go ahead and
put in PHP tags and then I'm going to
type the word include and then my file
that I want to include which is header
dot PHP obviously make sure to surround
the file with quotation marks otherwise
you're probably not going it's probably
not going to work it's going to get an
error okay so there we go now we have
our header on the page let's go ahead
and just create some contents so I'm
going to make a paragraph here and I'm
going to set this equal to or let's set
this equal to but I'm just going to give
some content here just saying this is
the rest of the page okay so now we have
an index page that should contain our
header which was coded in this file and
then it should also contain a paragraph
so now when we go over to Firefox and
click refresh there we go we've got our
header and then we've got the rest of
the page now the reason why this is
obviously handy is because I could go
ahead and then
save this as another file so let's go
about dot php' so this could be my about
page on my website and let me just open
up about PHP and basically over here I
could just go ahead and change the
content so we can just say about page
and we'll just copy and paste that a few
times to get it clear that this is the
about page okay and now if I go over to
my about dot PHP then I've got the same
header here but then I've got my
different content for the about page
okay so the reason why using an include
file here was useful was obviously
because we got the same header without
having to actually copy paste that code
from the index file - over to my about
page or my about file and the really
nice thing about that is obviously if I
wanted to change this header then let's
say I wanted to add navigation or
something then I could go ahead and do
that over here and only do it once and
it would be updated across all of my
different pages so let's say I take out
this is the page header and I just
changed it to page header okay now if I
were using normal HTML I would have had
to have changed that over here on my
index file and then again over here on
my about page but instead we've made our
separate header page that we've just
included so I've changed it once over
here and now it should be updated on
both pages if I go ahead and click
refresh we're now on about dot PHP and
we've got page header so that has been
updated and if I go over to index dot
PHP then we've got this is the rest of
the page and we've got the same header
so that has been updated as well
now I've just gone ahead and used like a
silly little example where I was
including HTML on to the page but if you
guys had PHP code that you wanted to
include you could do that as well it
would work just fine and then like I
said you could have all your functions
or your core functions that you were
going to use across all of your pages in
one PHP file and just include them and
be able to use them on this page just
because they were included or the file
that they were written in was included
okay now let's go ahead and talk about
what the difference between include and
require is and the answer is not much
actually because if I were to change
include to require over here and I could
do the same thing for the bar page
although we're probably not going to use
it so let's go ahead and just say
require then it still does the same
thing that include does it is going to
include this page or include this file
on to my web page so if I go ahead and
click refresh here I'm on index dot PHP
nothing's changed because even though I
didn't include the file I still required
it so PHP slow it went and fetched all
the contents on this page or in this
file and included it onto the page so
the only difference actually between
include and require is when something
goes wrong so let's say PHP couldn't
find this file I'll go ahead and just
make a spelling mistake on purpose so
we've got Hader PHP now PHP shouldn't be
able to find a file called edit of PHP
because I don't have that in my
directory if I go back and click refresh
now I'm got two I've got two errors over
here okay so that just means that PHP
couldn't find the file that it required
okay but if I go ahead and say include
and the file and I go ahead and save us
now and
refresh you can see I've got my two
errors because something went wrong with
the include but I still have the rest of
the page printed out okay so the
difference between include and require
is that if require goes wrong if the
page or if PHP cannot find the file that
it required then your page just gets
killed nothing after that will be X
executed or prints it out or rendered in
the browser okay but if you're using
include then the rest of the code
on that page will still get executed or
printed out now of course we've actually
just got error reporting turned on
because we're testing this on our local
computer and we want to be able to see
any errors but if you were hosting this
on like a shared hosting company or
something error reporting would actually
be turned off so the user would never
actually see these errors okay so if you
were acquiring a file and PHP couldn't
find the file then the user would
probably just get a blank page and
they'd have to try and click refresh or
something and then hopefully everything
would go right okay but that's all I
have for you guys in this video so don't

it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
