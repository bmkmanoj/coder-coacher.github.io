here and welcome to this tutorial series
on cPanel so a question I get asked all
the time is how do I get my website live
on to the Internet where everyone can
see it and the simple answer is to buy
some shared hosting and then use cPanel
to upload all your files and get your
website live I know you guys probably
have two questions first of all what is
cPanel and secondly what is shared
hosting so cPanel is a control panel
yeah I know the name kind of gives it
away doesn't it
but cPanel is a control panel that is
used on most Linux hosting packages so
if you purchase Linux hosting you are
more than likely going to land up with
cPanel as your control panel and what
cPanel allows us to do is easily create
and manage email addresses create and
manage files created manage databases
and there's a whole bunch of other stuff
as well which we will be taking a look
at in this tutorial series okay so that
is cPanel but what is shared hosting
well shared hosting is when a hosting
provider sets up one server and they put
a whole bunch of people's websites on
that service so there is not just you
there's a whole bunch of people you're
all sharing that server and what that
means is that you don't have to pay for
the full server you only pay for the
part of the server that you're using and
most of these hosting providers
generally offer like some really good
packages so you get to choose how many
email addresses you want how many
databases you want how much storage
space you need and then you only pay for
the part that you're using and what that
means is that shared hosting can be
really cheap so let's jump onto my
computer and I'm going to show you guys
what to look for when buying a share
hosting package and also how to check
that cPanel will be available all right
so we're on my computer right now and
I've got a bunch of different tabs open
over here that you can see
but first I just want to mention like a
little disclaimer that none of these
companies have paid me to say anything
about them or to mention their names
here so yeah I just wanted to get that
out there and the suggestion I actually
have for you guys is to actually just
Google companies that are local and in
your area because that's what I did
whenever I was looking for hosting back
in the day when I was looking for a good
hosting company when I started actually
needing hosting what I did was I just
went to Google and I typed in web
hosting South Africa and you can see
there's a bunch of ads over here right
now and then one of the top-ranking
sites is web Africa which is a hosting
company but they're based in another
city - what I am based in and also they
never used to be this high Lee ranked
the company that I chose long ago was a
free host and you can see that I've
actually visited their link before so
I'm just going to go ahead and click on
this and these guys are the web hosts
that I use not that they're paying me to
say that but yeah it is really
convenient because they are next door to
me so they're in the same city as I am
they're next door to me if I have any
issues I just get out of my desk walk
across the road and I say hey I've got
some issues on my website can you please
fix them and like that's how easy it is
for me to get hold of them so it is
really convenient and usually I don't
have any issues they're really good at
what they do but anyway let's go over to
hosting and I'm going to go to line X
hosting and we're going to take a look
at some of the hosting packages and the
reason why I'm telling you guys to look
for someone local is because if you're
going to be managing a website or
running a website within your country
sometimes if you get a server outside of
your country it can run really slowly it
can affect loading time so I host with
the South African website because I was
hoping South African people would visit
my site or I've got other websites that
South African people need a visit so
yeah
it really helps just having a local
company hosting your site anyway
I'm gonna scroll down now and you can
see that once I get partway down the
page I've actually got the packages and
pricing options over here so you can see
that there's a bunch of different
package options we've got from bronze to
platinum Pro and if you take a look at
each one of these packages you can see
that we've got a cost so 19 ran for
silver home that's just over $1 if I do
the currency conversion based on what
today's currency is set up free and
actually I don't even know why they're
bragging about this because if you're
gonna get web hosting or especially
shared hosting from a company set up
should be free I don't know why they
would charge you for it anyway web
traffic that's nice we've got unlimited
web traffic and I would say if you guys
are looking for a hosting company and
they're not giving you unlimited web
traffic I would go look somewhere else
because if if they give you a certain
amount of bandwidth you might never
reach that bandwidth I know but if you
ever do they're gonna shut your side
down until you like pay for more
bandwidth and that could be really
annoying especially if you weren't
expecting your website to do well in a
certain month anyway so yeah web traffic
look for something that has unlimited
web traffic storage space right now this
one is just under a gig so I'd probably
want to bump this package up a little
bit and get a little bit more space
although 750 Meg's is really not bad for
a website I don't see many websites go
over that amount but yeah there is
something else that we need which is
really important that is a MySQL
database so you can see I've kind of
skipped over email addresses I mean you
guys all know what that those are but
MySQL database is something that we need
if you guys don't know about MySQL
databases we need that for WordPress and
if you're building a system that
requires like logging in and
information and stuff like that you're
really going to need a SQL database and
with this package we've got one and that
is fine that's enough for if you're
running a wordpress site or a Joomla
site but sometimes you might want to
have an extra database so then you can
go ahead and look for a package with
more databases although one I think is
what majority of people will ever use so
yeah this is probably the minimum
package I would choose is just a gold
home package for a wordpress or a Joomla
site or any custom PHP site that I was
cutting myself this is the lowest
package I would go for
and you can see PHP version 5.3 plus so
they're not telling me exactly it's just
that it's higher than 5.3 and yeah I
would definitely opt for a package that
has a good or a very late very new
version of PHP because yeah you don't
want to be hosting with someone who's
got old PHP and then you try do
something with WordPress and it doesn't
work because a lot of sites and a lot of
plug-ins for WordPress or Joomla these
days need PHP 5.3 or higher so just make
sure that you've got that and you can
see I've got an option to check for more
features and over here is where I get to
see cPanel so I know that these guys are
using cPanel that's great
and this that is like the whole point of
this tutorial is I need someone with
cPanel because that's what I'm going to
be showing you guys so yeah we've got
access to cPanel and if I scroll further
down we've got access the version of
cPanel is cPanel 11 which is a very
recent version of cPanel and that's
awesome so I'm just going to close this
I mean you guys can check out the other
stats if you want to but I don't want to
run through all of them and yeah that's
just the minimum package I would choose
here if we go over to another hosting
provider this is Hostgator
you need to go over to web hosting or
their wordpress hosting page and just
take a look at some of the stats that
they they've got or some of the
specifications they offer and you can
see on what they call a hatchling plan
you get a single domain which is
actually what you get here as well you
just get one domain and then unmetered
bandwidth so you're getting unlimited
web traffic which is awesome and like I
said I wouldn't go for anyone that is
not offering unlimited bandwidth and so
yeah just make sure that you do that and
I'm just going to scroll further down
the page to show you guys with his start
listing technical specs you've got some
information about web hosting features
and some stuff that's free on their site
and so on but what I really wanted you
to look at is that cPanel is available
on Hostgator so if you're going to host
with them you do have access to cPanel
and they'll also talk about unlimited
MySQL databases which is awesome and
like I said it's nice to have more than
one database but we're more than likely
only gonna need the one anyway so don't
get known let this get you too excited
like oh my gosh you can have unlimited
databases yeah because you're probably
not going to use them all anyway anyway
Wow
I said that twice let's move on to the
next provider that I want to show you
guys and that is GoDaddy which is like a
pretty big international hosting
provider all of you guys should probably
know them and if you go over to hosting
and you click on web hosting you'll land
up on this page that I'm showing you
guys now and you can see that they've
got an economy package deluxe and so on
so you can take a look at the prices and
there's a few little specs here like oh
you got one website 100 gigs of storage
which is crazy compared to what I'm
getting offered on other hosting
providers like my local provider but
anyway unlimited bandwidth like I said
you don't really want to go with anyone
that isn't offering you this so you'll
find that a lot of guys
offering unlimited bandwidth and yeah
I'm just going to skip some of those
stats and scroll further down the page
because what I really want to show you
is that they are also using cPanel for
Linux so you can see we've got access to
cPanel and a whole bunch of other stuff
but a cPanel is the important thing here
because I'm gonna be showing you guys
cPanel so yeah if you scroll even
further down you can see a bunch of
stats for their plans so you get a free
domain you get to host the website disk
space all the stuff that was actually
further up the page but something that
you might want to just check out for is
my SQL databases or my sequel databases
that's actually how this word is
pronounced I know I'm probably going to
get a lot of flack in the comments for
saying MySQL but anyway yeah we've got
access to 10 10 databases but they have
a max size of one gig not that you would
ever reach that on a simple Joomla or a
WordPress site anyway so yeah that's
just how to check out for like certain
stats and make sure that your host is
using cPanel if it doesn't say on the
website that they're using cPanel you
might want to phone them or just look
somewhere else because most of the good
guys will say that they are using cPanel
oh they'll let you know that they're
using cPanel so once you've purchased
hosting like for a free host what did I
do I go to Gold home sign up now for you
guys on these other packages you'd click
the sign up now button and you're going
to have to fill in a form like choose
your pricing plan put in your details
and they'll ask you for a domain so
you'll have to register a domain which
would be like ww-whatever your website
is calm and then you'd have to pay once
you've done all of that they'll probably
send you an email and give you some of
your hosting details with a free host I
actually have access to this back-end
panel called a client zone
and I can view all my hosting packages
and login to cPanel from there so if I
click on that button it's kind of let me
login to cPanel which I already have
open over here and so this is what
cPanel looks like but we're actually
going to be taking a look at this in the
next tutorial so I'll explain what all
of this stuff is and what this is and
what that means but yeah for now just
make sure that you've purchased hosting
and that once you've got hosting you get
through to cPanel which looks something
like this otherwise it might look
something like this old theme because
you can switch themes here so let's give
this a few seconds to load ok so this is
pretty much the old version of cPanel
sometimes this little bar at the top
here is blue and it says cPanel and not
a free host but web hosting providers
can change this so that's why it says a
free host and sometimes this background
is either gray or blue but yeah for this
one it's red just because these guys
logo is red so yeah it should look
something like this but it might not
look exactly the same that's all I
wanted to say so I'm going to switch
back to paper lantern because this is
the new theme and it is the theme that
I'm gonna use for my tutorials because
it because it's the new one and more
than likely anyone who's looking for
hosting from now on will be given the
this version of cPanel with this theme
displaying so that is all I have for you
