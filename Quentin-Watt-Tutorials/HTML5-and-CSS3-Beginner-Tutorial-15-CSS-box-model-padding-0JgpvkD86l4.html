to tutorial number 15 and in this
tutorial I'm just going to explain to
you guys what the CSS box model is and
I'm just going to start off by saying
that it's actually quite easy to learn
guys and you're going to be using it in
every single webpage you write from now
on so that's just one more reason to
stay and watch this video until it's
finished and what I want you guys to do
now is just go over to the body of your
web page and you can add in Ellie any
elements you want I'm just going to use
a header so let's just go ahead and h2
and inside my header I'm just going to
type something random like I love my
subscribers just like that in fact I
love you guys so much I'm going to put
an exclamation mark there okay cool so
now we can go ahead and run this in
Firefox and you're saying to me okay
well this is no different to anything
I've shown you guys in the past it's
just a plain old boring header on the
top of our web page
why are you showing me this well what if
I told you that every single element on
our web page is actually displayed as a
box you guys can't see that box yet but
it is actually here it's just all white
or it's all transparent so you can't see
it but what if I went back to our CSS
and I change the background quickly so
let's just change the background of our
header to be blue
background - color and we'll use this
blue from the previous tutorial which is
0:08
a FF and now we're going to go ahead and
refresh this in Firefox and now you can
kind of see we've got this long blue
rectangle with our header in it so you
can sort of see this box taking place
now right now it's just the background
that you can see but yeah you can
actually see it now if I say that this
box was made up of four parts okay the
first part is the content which is this
text right here then the next part is
the padding which is how much space
there is between where my text ends and
with the blue of our background ends as
well so the space between maybe the
bottom of our text and the blue of our
background but as you can see there's
not actually much space in fact I think
it's zero pixels so right now padding is
set at zero and then the next part after
that is the border which is basically
just the line that goes all the way
around our box and the final part is the
margin which is how much space do we
want between this box and the next box
or the side of our websites as you can
see here this little space between where
my window starts and where my header
starts or with the blue of my head of
starts that is a margin so that's the
four parts of the CSS box model and in
this tutorial I'm actually just going to
talk about padding a little bit so what
you can do now is just go over to your
CSS let's open that okay and like I told
you guys the padding is the space
between our text and the end of our blue
box our blue background so let's just go
ahead and add in a little bit more
padding and then you go
we'll probably understand as soon as you
see it so let's go padding and we'll set
that equal to 20 pixels and when you
save this and go back to firefox watch
what happens the space between our text
and the end of the blue background is
going to get bigger
watch am check it that okay so that's
what padding is like on 20 pixels and
what happens now is we've got 20 pixels
of padding on the top so 20 pixels from
here to here then 20 pixels on the left
so 20 pixels from here to here and 20
pixels on the bottom same thing and we
actually have 20 pixels on the right but
it starts here and it goes 20 pixels in
and our website if our header was so
long that it took over 2 lines you'd get
exactly the same amount of space from
here to here as from here to here so
that's pretty cool and that's how
padding works but you can also have a
different amount of padding on each side
so you can go back here and you can
choose keywords so you can have padding
top as 20 pixels then I'm actually just
going to go ahead and copy this then you
can also have padding bottom and you can
set that equal to lack 60 pixels or
something random well and then you can
have padding left which you can set it
like 50 pixels and what you can't even
really see the padding right at the
moment but you can also set padding
rights to something like 200 pixels when
I'm going to see it so let's go ahead
and save that and refresh and as you can
see now that we've got 60 pixels of
padding on the bottom 50 on the left 200
on the right so that would be from here
to about here somewhere and then what is
that 10 pixels on the top 20 pixels on
top still so that's how padding works
and that's how you can use it to change
the different amount of space that you
want in between
your CSS box model so if we go back and
we just have padding at the top then you
just have the space on the top of our
page check it out check so no space on
the left no space on the bottom okay
there's space on the right but they
actually isn't because there's no space
there I head is just not long enough to
fit all the way across the page and then
we've got 20 pixels of space on the top
so that's all I've got for you guys in
this tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it
and in the next tutorial I'm going to
talk about borders which will be the
line that goes all the way around our
padding so thanks for watching guys and
