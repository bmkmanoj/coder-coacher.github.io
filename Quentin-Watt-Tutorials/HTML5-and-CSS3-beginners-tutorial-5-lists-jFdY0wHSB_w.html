here and welcome to tutorial number five
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at making lists in HTML so
as you can see I've cleared out
everything in the body and I've changed
the title of my website a little bit
just so that it says what we're doing in
this tutorial okay but other than that
this is the basic templates that we set
up in tutorial two so you can go ahead
and just do the exact same thing to
follow along now there are actually two
different possible types of Lists that
we can make in HTML and the first type
of Lists that I want to show you guys is
called an unordered list in other words
the lists all have a bullet point next
to them so they don't have to appear in
any particular order okay so they're not
ordered in any way it's just bullet
points and to do that you're going to go
ahead and put in the tags ul which
stands for unordered list okay and then
we're going to end off our an ordered
list and in between here is where all of
our list items have to go or all of the
points that we want in our list have to
go okay and I kind of already gave you a
hint as to what we call those okay
because each item in a list is called a
list item so we go ahead and we start
that off with the tag li4 list item and
we end it off with an ending li okay so
I'm actually just going to copy this and
now we can think of things that we have
to put in our list so let's say this was
a list for Santa Claus and we wanted to
tell him things that we want for
Christmas that he should probably bring
for us because let's face it Santa's
real you know so the first thing that I
would like from Santa is more books
to make tutorials for you guys okay and
then the next thing that I think I'd
like is a new keyboard because this one
has a really small shift key on the left
side and usually the shift key on the
left sides big but I didn't actually see
that when I bought it and I couldn't
send it back so I have to deal with it
now a small shift key okay then the
third thing I think I want from Santa is
battlefield for the game because I like
the game so God put that in there and
the next one I guess can be a game as
well so I'll go ahead and say Assassin's
Creed Black Flag because I do not have
that yet and it's the only one I don't
have already bought all the others okay
so if we go ahead and we save this now
and then we run this in Firefox you can
see we've got a list on our page and
each item has a bullet point next to it
so they're not ordered in any way we
could change these around and if it
still makes sense because they just got
bullet bulleted items okay and the next
kind of list that I wanted to show you
guys was is called an ordered list and
these would be lists that have to be in
order
so let's say I was going to make a list
of steps that you guys have to take to
become good programmers or write good
websites okay then I have to go ahead
and start off my list with the tag Oh L
and this stands for ordered list and
then we're going to end it off with the
ending Oh L and in here we're still
going to use the same list item tags so
the type of list that gets displayed
depends on
the outer tag that Oh L or the UL tag
but the list item tags are common in
both lists okay so let's say the first
step to becoming a good programmer is to
go to the programmers Creed YouTube
channel okay and the second step would
be to subscribe subscribe okay and the
third point we could probably say watch
all the videos because otherwise you're
not going to learn anything if you don't
watch them and the last line would be
practice because you guys have to
practice these things yourself to get
good at them so practice practice
practice
okay so now when we go ahead and we save
this and come back to Firefox again and
click refresh you can see we've got the
two lists on our page and you remember
this was the unordered list and this is
our ordered list so it's actually
numbered 1 2 3 4 so our steps or the
items in this list have to be in an
order that makes sense obviously
otherwise people are going to read this
and go like what the heck how can I do
point number 2 if I haven't even done
point number 1 Who am I supposed to
subscribe to so that's pretty much all I
have for you guys in this video thanks
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and feel free to leave a comment like or
share the video it's really going to
help my channel grow so thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
