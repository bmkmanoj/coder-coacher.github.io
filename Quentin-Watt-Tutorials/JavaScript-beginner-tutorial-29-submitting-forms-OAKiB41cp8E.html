here and welcome back to tutorial number
29 and in this video I just want to
speak to you guys about submitting a
form okay so in the previous tutorial I
did say that we were going to start some
form validation but I decided before we
move on to that you guys should probably
just understand fully what submitting
form means and how we're going to use
that in JavaScript okay so let's just
start off by putting a form onto our web
page
so starting form and ending form okay
and there are two attributes that are
actually compulsory to have on our form
we need to have them every time and the
first one is the action which is
basically where do I want to send the
information I get from this form where
do I want to send it to okay and this is
going to be like another page on our
website
okay preferably something that's written
with some server-side code okay so in
other words it can't be a dot HTML file
okay like it can't be another page that
HTML because okay let's say another page
was another page on our website if it
was a dot HTML file it wouldn't be able
to do anything with the values that we
sent to it okay so we'd actually you
know it would be pointless but if it was
something like a dot PHP file then we'd
be able to actually read the data that
we sent to it and actually do stuff with
the data save it in a database or
something like that whatever okay so
that's what the action does okay then
we've got another attribute called the
method
and the method is basically all the data
that we get in the form how do we want
to send that data to this page okay
so one way is by using the get method
okay and what the get method does is it
sends the data up as part of the URL and
then the post method sends it as a
separate page but I'll explain this in a
few seconds let's just add some
information in our in our form so let's
just put in some input types here or
input elements okay so let's make a
login page where we can fill in our
information and then click like a button
that says login and see if we can login
okay so let's just start off with the
obviously a username and then we're also
going to need a password and then we're
going to need a button over here this is
like submit or login okay so we'll put
in an input of type text for the
username so they can type in their name
and we'll give this a name of username
okay and I'm going to end that off just
like that and then I'm going to copy
this paste it down here okay and for the
password I'm going to give it a type of
password and I'm going to give it a name
of password as well and down at the
bottom over here I'm going to put in
another input element but this one is
going to be type submit' and then the
value we can set to submit or actually
let's set it to login okay so the value
is just basically whatever appears on
our button again so
so now when I go ahead and I run this in
Firefox okay you can see that I've got
this form over here and right now it's
asking for a username which we could go
ahead and type in my name didn't spell
it right okay and then the password like
I'll just go ahead and say false 1 2 3
or something ok and now when I click
this button okay what will happen is we
going to send the that information that
I fold in so this information over here
to another page PHP which actually
doesn't exist I haven't made it yet so
we're going to get a bit of an error
showing up on our web page and we're
going to send it using this method
called the get method ok so let's go
ahead and click login and just like I
told you the page doesn't exist so
Firefox is giving me a file not found
error but that's okay okay
so let's just look at the URL over here
and like I told you the get method sends
the dots that we fold in up in the URL
so right now if we look in our URL we've
got this file which is basically way on
my computer this file or that is located
or where this computer is looking for
this file ok then the page that we're
supposed to be on is called another page
dot PHP which doesn't exist so that's
why we get this error but at the end
here we've got this question mark and
then we've got the username which is set
to Quinton and password which is set to
boss w123 so I I added in a W by
accident by hey ok so that's basically
how we send information using the get
method it gets added on
the URL so by the way if this webpage
was on a live server then we wouldn't
get all of this information up here we
just get ww-whatever my website name is
so like programmers creed or something
programmers Creed comm slash another
page dot PHP
whatever this information is here okay
so that would be like that's my domain
this is the web page were on
basically and these after the question
mark over here these are all the oh
that's all the information that I tried
to send to the server using the get
method okay so that's one way of
submitting data then I told you that
instead of using the get method we can
also use the post method so let's go
ahead and save this and actually just
want to close that and we'll run this in
Firefox again okay so now we're using
the post method so when I go and I fill
in the exact same information so pulse
one two three and we click login now
when we look at the end of our URL we
don't have that question mark with the
rest of the values anymore okay and that
is because whenever you send information
using post it sends the information to
the server separately to the wit when
we're just trying to go to the page so
it doesn't go in as part of the URL in
fact we can't even see the information
when we use post so post is the more
secure method if you're ever trying to
deal with passwords and banking or
something like that but if it's
something simple like a search engine
then you'll find even if you go to
Google when you start typing your
information in here on the web page
Google so
let's just say cause then when you click
search you can see that it's actually
added in queue which is your question
sits to cause okay so if it's just
something like a search engine then you
can go ahead and use the get method but
if it's four passwords and things like
that
then you use the post method so quite
simple and that's actually everything
I've got to say about how forms work or
submitting forms so thanks for watching
guys and don't forget to check out the
next tutorial where we'll be working
with some form validation and until next
time thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe please leave a comment and
like the video and I'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
