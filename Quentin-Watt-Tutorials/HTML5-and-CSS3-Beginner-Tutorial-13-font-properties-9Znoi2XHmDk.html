back to tutorial number 13 so in the
last tutorial I showed you guys how to
use an external style sheets to style
your web page so if you guys don't know
why I'm typing all of this code in a new
document with no HTML
underneath then you need to go back and
watch the previous tutorial and then
you'll understand why I'm doing this and
if you've already seen the previous
tutorial then you're good to go
so I'm just gonna carry on from where I
left off in the previous tutorial and
the code is exactly the same where we've
just got one paragraph in our body and
then we've styled that paragraph with
the color property and we've changed the
color to red and we've used the font
family property to change the font on
the webpage to San serif so I can
actually go ahead and just run this in
Firefox just to show you guys what it
used to look like in the previous
tutorial and now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna show you guys how to change
the size of this paragraph with CSS so
we can go back to our CSS document here
and now just change the font size you
just type in font - size and use your
colon as an equal sign and then what you
do is you set this equal to a value in
pixels so you go 48 px for pixels and
that makes your font size 48 pixels
which is extremely big you're probably
never gonna make a paragraph that big on
a web page but just so that you guys
noticed the difference small normal
default paragraph huge big-ass paragraph
so that's how to change the font size in
CSS and you can also change if you want
the font to be bold or normal and by
default it's normal
but if you want to use CSS to make your
font bold then you use font - wait
and I'm actually spelling that wrong
there we go font weight and there's a
few different values that you can
actually set this at to have it like
somewhere between normal and bold but
you're never gonna go to a website or
find a document weight some guy said
ease boldness of his paragraph to be
half bold you're always gonna have
normal and then bold so you can just set
this to bold and you most of the time
gonna get the look that you're going for
so let's go ahead and refresh Firefox
and there we go now we have a really big
bold paragraph and one more thing that I
want to show you guys is also how to
italicize your text using CSS and you
can do this by setting the font style
property so font - style and my default
obviously your text is normal as you've
seen and if you want it to be italic
then you just change font style to
italic and put a semicolon on it and
save that and when you go to firefox and
refresh you'll get a slightly italicized
paragraph so there we go that's how to
change a few different font properties
in your CSS and most of you guys are
probably wondering well if you can use
CSS to change your text to italics or to
bold then why did I show you guys the
HTML strong tag and emphasis tag because
you guys remember that we did the strong
and we also did the emphasis tag like
that and that's just because we hadn't
learned CSS yet and that's also because
the strong and the emphasis
are probably gonna be depreciated from
CSS or HTML in the future one day
because we can just use CSS to style our
text and one last thing I want to show
you guys also is using CSS if you're
really lazy you can actually set the
font family the font size and the font
weight all using one property and that
is the font property so if you just type
in font normal like that
you can set this equal to if you want
your text to be bold set it to bold then
you change the size which would be let's
make it a little bit smaller this time
will be like twenty six pixels and then
you can set the the font family which
would be sans-serif and it has to be in
this order you can't match the order
around and put like twenty six pixels of
the front and then bold in the middle
it's not gonna work so let's go ahead
and just refresh this and as you can see
we now have a size 26 paragraph that is
bold and the font family is tall
sans-serif and if you guys don't want
your text bold then you could always
just leave the bold out and just set it
to 26 pixels
sans-serif and you'll still have our
normal 26 pixel sensor of paragraph so
that's pretty cool that's how to use ya
CSS just to change the look of your text
on your web page so that was just
actually just a quick handy tutorial I
hope you guys found this helpful and in
the next couple of tutorials I'm
probably gonna show you guys how to use
the CSS box model so get excited for
that and I will see you guys in the next
tutorial I would appreciate a lot if you
guys really hit that subscribe button
and also don't be afraid to comment like
or share my videos it's really gonna
help my channel grow
so thanks very
much and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
