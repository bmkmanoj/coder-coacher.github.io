to tutorial number 30 and in this
tutorial you can see that I'm using the
exact same code as the previous
tutorials but I know some of you guys
are probably sitting here like what the
heck is rowspan or what the heck is
colspan
so let me just go ahead and explain call
a span let me just run this in Firefox
it'll probably be easier for you guys
colspan is when you have a cell so
that's one of these things that goes
over multiple columns so let's say the
word album went over this column and
this column so there wasn't a border
here and there wasn't the word track
here that would be call span and Rose
ban is basically the same thing except
with rows so we could have the word or
the cell walking away in this column and
in this row and in this row so yeah if
it doesn't make sense now then don't
worry he it'll make a lot more sense
after the practical example that I'm
going to show you guys so let's just go
ahead and say that I wanted to add in a
black links to social websites on my
table so I could go ahead and add in a
header at the top to blue header and we
could just call the social for the
social websites and then in my second
and my third row for each band I can add
in the social websites so table data and
ink table data I just copy that okay and
we can say that they are on Twitter and
we can go ahead and we could actually
make a tags around here but there's no
points we can just leave it as like a
fake link for now it doesn't really
matter and okay so we've got Twitter
and then we can have Facebook and I'm
actually just gonna copy this again
really lazy work okay
paste so now we have Twitter and we've
got Facebook for each one of our bands
and we've got a header at the top that
says social so let's go ahead and save
this go back to Firefox and if we click
refresh you can see that we now have a
cell called social but it only takes up
one column and our social links are
actually taking up two columns you've
got Twitter and we've got Facebook but
the social is only taking up one column
so we can use colspan to fix this so we
can go back to our notepad and in our
table header for social we can go ahead
and add the attribute called colspan
and we can set this equal to two okay so
by default colspan is always 1 you never
actually have to set it to 1 so we can
set it to 2 and when we click refresh
you can see that our column now spans or
our table header now spans over to
columns so it doesn't just take the
Twitter column but it covers the
Facebook column too so that's pretty
much what colspan does and rowspan is
pretty much exactly the same thing
except down with rows so we can go ahead
and make an example of that real quick
in the third row I'm just gonna go and
take out my to social columns there and
I'm gonna save this and just to show you
guys what it's going to look like
without those two cells there you can
see we now have a row that's only got
three columns and then the 4th column or
the 4th and the 5th column are missing
so we can go back to our notepad and
over here you can see we've got our
twitter and we've got our Facebook
columns over here
so we can just go ahead and add in the
attributes of rowspan and we can set
this equal to two and five here too
rowspan who's bad equal to two so save
that go back to firefox now and if we
click refresh you can see we now have
these two columns spanning over all
these two cells spanning over multiple
rows so you can see they go over two
rows now sometimes when you look at of
another person's code you might see that
they're actually using row span of 99
oops
99 okay and the reason for that is
because it doesn't really make much of a
visual difference here okay it's just to
make sure that the row that's or the
cell that is spanning multiple rows goes
all the way down to the end of the table
so even if you had like 20 euros your
cell would still span over all 20 year
old rows so that's pretty much what row
span and colspan do and I hope this
tutorial was helpful so thank you very
much and I will see you guys next time I
would appreciate it a lot if you guys
