here and this is tutorial number 55 and
in this tutorial we are going to take a
look at how to validate an email address
using the filter VAR function okay now
there is another way to do this using
something called a regular expression
but regular expressions look really
confusing I'm not even gonna lie to you
guys go ahead and Google regular
expressions in PHP or something and
you're going to see it doesn't even look
like computer code it just looks like
mumbo-jumbo like a whole bunch of back
slashes and funny symbols so this filter
var function is a lot more kind to use
and it works pretty much just as well so
that is what we're going to use in this
video so let's go ahead and actually
take a look at what we have in our form
over here which as usual is just a
submit button and as input we've just
got a text box with the name of email
where the user can enter the email
address and we're using the get method
so if you take a look at that in the
browser there we go that's what it looks
like
okay now let's actually use some PHP to
handle the starter and just check if
this email address that the user enters
in here is indeed valid and there we go
my voice squeaks okay I could feel it
coming okay so let's check if it is
indeed valid and to do that we are first
going to have to check if the value has
been set so if this email value has been
set if is set dollar underscore get and
we'll have to set that as dole
underscore get email okay then we also
want to check that it is not empty so
I'm going to just say
and not empty open up our parenthesis
here and just grab the same thing done'
underscore get email okay then let's go
ahead and do something so as long as
this variable has been set and ie the
page has been submitted and as long as
this variable or this email is not empty
let's go ahead and validate this email
address so validate email okay if
however the email address is not been
set or is empty then let's just go ahead
and say else and we'll echo please enter
an email okay so now let's go ahead and
actually assume that the user has felt
something in what do we want to do well
we want to perform another check okay
and that check is we want to see if this
email is indeed valid okay so we want to
use this fault of our function like I
said to check if the email is valid so
I'm going to say if filter underscore
var and I'm going to open my parentheses
here because this is a function so
that's the function name and parentheses
put in a comma because this is going to
take two arguments so the first argument
is going to be what email address or
what a bit of string do you want to
actually validate and in this case we
want to validate whatever is in this
input box okay so how do we get that
value well we're using this dollar
underscore get email and that's going to
grab the value straight for us okay then
the next thing we want to do is tell
this function
what we would like it to do because this
fault of our function can actually do
quite a few different things but in this
case we want to validate an email so I'm
going to hit my caps lock button here
and type in filter underscore validate
underscore email and that basically just
tells this function okay validate the
email address that you find in that
value okay
oops take caps lock off okay now let's
go ahead and actually put out some
output so just display some output if
the email is valid so if the email is
valid then this line of code is going to
run over here so let's just echo out the
email is valid otherwise let's go ahead
and say else and this line of code will
run if the email is invalid so we'll
just go ahead and echo invalid email try
again okay go ahead and click Save and
if we go over to Firefox here just click
refresh mmm
I made a mistake and it's always the
semicolon on the last line that I typed
it's kind of funny
let's click refresh must have left on
another semicolon I didn't save that
that's the MA problem added and save
okay cool so please enter an email
address let's go ahead and enter
something in here so let's enter 1 2 3 4
5 6 and of course that isn't an email
address so let's click Submit and
invalid email try again
okay so our function was able to tell
that if one two three four five six
doesn't look like an email now let's go
ahead and type something that does look
like an email so let me just type this
whole thing out again Quinten at
programmers Creed comm I click Submit
and it says this email is valid and I
just want to point out that that email
address doesn't actually exist I haven't
made it yet I probably will one day you
know when I'm not feeling lazy and I
decided to set up an email but yeah that
email is still valid even though it
doesn't actually exist for the reason
being is because our validate email
function only checks if there is an @
symbol and a dot symbol and some text in
between so something here something here
and something here okay obviously this
text can be pretty much anything as long
as there is an @ symbol and a dot and of
course no spaces because an email
shouldn't have spaces okay so you might
find that if I go ahead and click Submit
huh we're still getting this email is
valid and even if I typed something at
something dot something let's go ahead
and run through all of this so something
at something dot something so I don't
even have comm or whatever click Submit
that is still valid as well okay so this
is just checking that the email address
looks like an actual email if you want
to know if the email address is actually
a working email where you can get hold
of the person then you're going to have
to do something that pretty much every
website does nowadays anyways and that
is send a test email to that email
address and tell the user ok we've sent
you a link go ahead and click on that
link to verify that you indeed own that
email address
okay and of course that is like the
popular thing that everyone does so
that's why I'm telling you guys that but
anyways that's pretty much all I have
for you guys in this video so don't
forget to subscribe please feel free to
leave a comment like or share this video
it's really going to help my channel
grow and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
