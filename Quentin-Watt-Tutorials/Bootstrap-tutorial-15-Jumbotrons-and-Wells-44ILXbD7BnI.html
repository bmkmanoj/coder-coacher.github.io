here and welcome to tutorial number 15
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to use the jumbotron
component in bootstrap so a lot of you
guys would have already seen the
jumbotron component by now
especially especially if you watch my
first video in the series then in that
demo that I showed you guys I actually
had this really big jumbo Jean Jumbotron
at the top of my screen and basically
what it does is like takes whatever
content is inside of the Jumbotron and
just makes it really really big and as
you can see it's also got a background
color over here so yeah like if you want
something really really big and you want
something to stand out on your page like
a big heading or something then that's
where you would use a Jumbotron so I'm
going to show you guys how to make one
now by just jumping back over to my text
editor and I'm going to start off by
creating a div and I'm gonna give that
div a class and the class is going to be
jumbo tron okay
and that is our Jumbotron all set up
it's just one div with a class of
Jumbotron but we can then add in
whatever content we want over here so
I'm going to add in a paragraph and if I
just add some content to this paragraph
like hello there this is a jumbo tron
did it get your attention okay I'm gonna
go ahead and hit save jump back over to
my browser and hit refresh and you can
see that now I've got this really big
Jumbotron over here and this paragraph
is absolutely massive compared to like
normal paragraph text which we could
always compare the two by just adding a
normal paragraph out
side of our Jumbotron over here okay so
you can see everything it's really
really big and it doesn't matter what
element you add in here whether it's a
heading heading 1 heading 2 heading 6 or
anything else it's going to be a lot
bigger so that is what a Jumbotron is
used for and since we're got quite a bit
of time left over I'm also gonna show
you guys something called a well so that
might be confusing for some of you like
you might actually see a well and think
it's a a Jumbotron with small text but
it isn't so let me get rid of this
paragraph and I'll create a div with a
class of well so let's go class is equal
to well just like that and that makes a
well and that is not a well that you
drink water out of but rather just a
like part of the browser that looks
almost as if it's indented so let's just
add in some text over here paragraph and
I'll just say this is a well save this
jump back over to our browser and hit
refresh and you can see that now I've
got a well which looks somewhat similar
to our Jumbotron except this well has
much smaller text so that is the
difference between a Jumbotron and a
well and that is how you use one of
these bootstrap components just like
that so that's all I have for you guys

really gonna help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
