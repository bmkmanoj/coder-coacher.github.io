here and welcome to tutorial number 30
and in this video I am finally going to
start speaking to you guys about some
basic form validation okay so if you
take a look at our code here real quick
then this is basically the same code
from the previous tutorial where we just
have this form on our web page that has
three inputs so one for you to put in
your name one to put in a password and
then the last one is the submit button
okay so if we run this in Firefox then
this is pretty much what it looks like
just a place where you put in your name
password and you can click login but
right now if you click login it takes
you to this page that doesn't exist so
like I told you guys before whenever
we're working with forms we kind of need
to have some sort of clever scripting on
our web page so we need some sort of a
server-side a file like a PHP file but
just for the purposes of this tutorial
you guys don't know any server-side
programming yet I'm assuming because I
didn't teach you any so what we'll do is
instead I'm just going to put this
action equal to submission dot HTML okay
and that is another file which I've made
and prepared up here and this is all
pretty basic but it's basically just a
web page that says thank you for
submitting your data so now when we go
back to this page and I click refresh
when I click login I'm going to get this
little page of here that says thank you
for submitting your data so even though
this entire web page is kind of a lie
because we don't actually do anything
with the data submitted it's just there
we don't have to look at a webpage that
doesn't exist or something like we don't
have to look at that error message okay
so sadly I have to tell you guys that we
aren't actually going to be logging a
user in to our website in this tutorial
because like I said we need some
server-side scripting for that but what
we are going to do is we're going to use
JavaScript just to make sure that the
user has actually filled in information
before they get led through to the next
page so as you can see right now are
filled in nothing here and our folding
nothing for password so surely I should
not be allowed to go on but when I click
login it still says thank you for
submitting your daughter I've still gone
through to the next web page so that's
what we're going to be doing in this
tutorial we're just going to be looking
at how to check that the user has
actually fold in some information and
then we'll move on later on in some in
some of the next videos to just check
that the information that they fold in
has met certain requirements okay so the
way we actually stop the user from going
through to the next page is we have to
use a return statement
and also an event ok so let's go back
here to our code and in the top of my
form I'm going to add another attribute
called on submit and this is actually an
event okay so this happens whenever the
user clicks on this button oh yeah so
whenever the user clicks on this button
because it's a submit button then this
for this event gets called on submits
okay and what we want to do here is
we're going to want to use a return
statement so we're going to type in the
word return and then we're going to I
have a function that is going to check
whether the user has fold in some
information so I'm just going to call my
function check info and you can call
this anything you want as long as you're
going to use the word return just before
your function that's fine okay so
basically what's going to happen now is
when the user clicks on this button over
here then this function is going to run
check info I haven't made it yet but
we're going to make it now and if this
function returns true then the user will
be allowed to go through to the next
page but if this function returns false
then the user is going to stay on this
page and they're going to get we will
put out an error message just to tell
them that they need to fill in the data
correctly okay so let's go ahead and
start making this function so I'm just
going to go ahead and grab that copy so
a function check info and now what we
want to do is we're just going to check
the most basic thing okay we want to
check that the user has actually fold in
some information inside of these two
input elements okay so to do that we
obviously going to have to make that
value of the input element variable so
I'm going to go ahead and give these two
input elements of an ID okay and the
first one I'm going to give an ID of
username because it's the one for
username and the second one is the input
for password so I'm going to give it an
ID of Paul
swerd okay so now we've got our two IDs
we can go ahead and make a variable and
I'm going to call the variable username
so I'm reusing this thing this word a
lot but I'm basically just calling the
username username wherever we're working
with it okay so I'm going to call it
username and I'm going to then set that
equal to document dot get element by ID
small D and the ID that I want to get is
username okay so I'm going to set it to
this element but I don't want to use the
entire element I only want the value so
I'm going to append on the dot value
property here and that means that
username the variable is only going to
be equal to whatever is inside of our
input elements okay and we'll do the
exact same thing for password so let's
go ahead and copy that and paste this
and the ID that we're looking for here
is password and we'll call this variable
password as well okay so now we've got
the two variables that we need to work
with let's go ahead and try and check if
they are empty so we're going to use an
if statement so we're going to go ahead
and say if username equals equals and an
empty string okay because what happens
here is if there's nothing typed into
this input element its then it is then
an empty string okay because there's
nothing typed in here and this is a text
input okay so when it's empty or when
password is
empty so you guys know how to use The
Awl symbol I already spoke to you guys
about that or password equals equals
nothing then go ahead and do something
else if there's something fold in do
something else again so this code over
here that we're typing now will only run
if they've left these two input elements
empty okay so what we're going to do is
we're going to alert Auto message so we
need to tell the user that they have to
fill in all the information please fill
in all fields okay and we also want to
return false okay because we want them
to stay on this webpage we don't want to
let them go through to the next page and
have their data submitted if they didn't
even fill in any any information they
didn't even fill in any data okay but if
they have fold in information then this
else statement will run okay so what we
can do in this else statement is just
return true because now they fold in
information so we're going to let them
through to our web our next part of our
web page okay so when we go back to
Firefox now and click refresh
when I click login over here and I leave
these two input elements blank I'm not
going to be allowed to go through to my
next web page or the next page okay so I
get this error message err please fill
in all fields so we have to actually
fill in some information before we are
allowed to submit the data okay so I
mean it kind of makes sense you don't
want to let your user submit data if
there's no data to submit so let's go
ahead and just type in Quinton for my
name and password we'll just type in
pause
one two three or something like that
because I'm an idiot go ahead and click
login and now because I actually fold in
some information this if statement
didn't evaluate to true which means this
else statement of a year ran and that
just says return true so that just means
okay JavaScript let the user continue
let the user submit the data and that's
why we landed up on this page that says
thank you for submitting your data okay
so that's actually all I have for you
guys in this video but don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to leave a
comment and like the video and we'll be
back in the next tutorial where I will
continue to talk about form validation
so thanks guys and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
