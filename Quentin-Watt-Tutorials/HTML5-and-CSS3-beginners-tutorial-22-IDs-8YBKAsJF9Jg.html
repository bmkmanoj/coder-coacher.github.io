here and welcome to tutorial number 22
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to style elements on your
web page using an ID okay now if you
guys watch the previous tutorial then
you know that in that tutorial I spoke
to you guys about classes and if you
guys didn't watch that tutorial then I'm
going to make a few references to that
video now but basically the difference
between a class and a ID is that they
work pretty much the same but an ID has
to be unique to each element so in other
words let's say you wanted a lot of
elements on your page to look the same
so you had like 50 elements or 10
elements on your web page that you
wanted to all look the same then you
need to go ahead and use a class to
style those elements but if you only
have one element that you want to style
then it's okay to use an ID reason for
that is because IDs have to be unique to
each element
it'll partly work if you try use two
elements with the same ID with CSS but
if you ever try and use two elements
with the same ID and then once you add
javascript to the page later and select
that element by ID you're going to
confuse the heck out of JavaScript
basically so just don't use two elements
with the same ID as soon as you need two
elements that have to have the same ID
you should probably be styling using a
class just putting that out there and I
know I actually rambled on for quite a
long time but now let's go ahead and
actually put some elements on our page
that we can style so I'm going to go
ahead and actually create three
different paragraphs over here so I'm
just going to place my cursor right
before those paragraph tags and push
ctrl D and that will duplicate the
paragraphs
okay so our first paragraph can just say
I am blue and straight out of the
previous tutorial we are going to turn
this paragraph blue the second paragraph
I guess can say the same thing we did in
the previous tutorial which it was just
like oh boy I wish I were blue or red
actually because we want to turn this
one a different color to that one so boy
I wish I were red and then the last one
can say if it's yellow let it Mellow and
that's actually kind of disgusting but
yeah I've heard people say that before
it's kind of catchy okay so basically
what I want to do in this tutorial is
obviously turn this paragraph blue this
paragraph red and that paragraph yellow
now to do that I'm going to use an ID so
I don't know why I keep going to my CSS
sheet I don't want to go there yet I'm
going to use an ID so I'm going to go
ahead and add that in as an attribute in
my first paragraph so I'm going to give
this an ID of blue and the second one
will give an ID of red and the third
paragraph we can give an ID of yellow
okay and now all we have to do is go
over to CSS and select these paragraphs
by their actual ID and the reason that
we'll the way you do that is you
basically have to tell CSS okay listen
up
a one two style using an ID and the way
you do that is obviously by just using
this hashtag I don't know why I said
obviously because it's not obvious I'm
showing you guys this for reason okay
so basically go ahead and use this
hashtag and then
go ahead and type in your ID name
so my first ID is blue so I'm going to
go ahead and put in blue over here and
now I can style my first paragraph and I
think what I'm going to do is just
change the color to blue and then we'll
go ahead and style the red ID so hashtag
red and that'll change the red ID so
we'll go ahead and say color easy on the
caps lock over there color red and then
the last one can be or we got to select
the idea of yellow and we'll go ahead
and change this color to yellow but I'm
going to give it a background color of
black just so that we can actually see
it because yesterday or in the previous
tutorial you guys couldn't actually see
the yellow text so let's go ahead now
and run this in Firefox and as you can
see I've now been able to use these IDs
over here to actually style all the
paragraphs so we've got our first
paragraph being blue the second one
being red and the last one being yellow
with a black background okay so that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this video and I hope you guys go ahead
and start styling all your websites very
nicely using the ID and class attributes
just remember though if you're going to
style more than one elements to look the
same go ahead and use a class but if
there's only one element then go ahead
and you can use an ID and that'll work
just fine so thanks for watching don't

going to help my channel grow and I will
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
