to tutorial number 45 and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to
create a password entry field and I'm
going to show you how that differs from
just a normal text entry field and if
this time at the end of the tutorial
we'll probably go through letting the
user submit a file so for now let's just
go over to our forum over here and as
you can see I'm basically starting out
with the normal template that I always
start out with except I've already got
my forum in the body so now we can go
ahead and let's create a username or a
text field and a password entry field
next to each other by actually just
creating a username and a password entry
field like if a user was logging into a
website so we can go ahead and start off
our labels and we're gonna need one
label for the username which is going to
be a text entry field so input type
equals text and you guys should already
have seen my video on how to put a text
field on your web page and now we just
need to give this an ID user name and
we'll party just give it a name of user
name and then in our label section over
here we'll go ahead and give this an ID
of user power no sorry excuse me we just
have to give this an attribute of full
user name cool so there we go we now
have our label and our user name and you
guys should pretty much already know
what that looks like so I'm not gonna
refresh just yet but all I need to do
now because I'm really lazy is I'm just
going to go ahead
copy this and paste it and wherever we
see username I'm just going to change
that to password so uh-huh password boss
were not fast rod and mother just do
this heist okay so that was just
changing the ID the name and password
but what we actually have to do is under
our input type we need to change this
from text to password and other than
that they're pretty much exactly the
same so actually when you change that as
well horse word word yeah
and just to make this look a little bit
better I might as well include a break
tag over there and now we can run this
in Firefox and as you can see we now
have a username and a password entry
field of here and the username was just
a normal text box and you guys know what
that looks like if I go ahead and I type
whatever I want over here it comes up
exactly as expected
just with the plain old text but a
password is just a little bit different
because whatever you type in here comes
up as bullet points as you can see so
the user that's just bulleted up so that
no one can see what you typed in there
and obviously that's for security
reasons so now you guys know how to
create a username entry field and a
password entry field on your website and
these two elements are actually pretty
much so similar that they even have the
same attributes so if you remember when
I spoke to you guys about the max length
max Ling and I will set that equal to
five and then the size we can sit to
five as well now you should have already
seen me talking about the max length and
the size in a previous tutorial when I
spoke about text input type equals text
and those same attributes work in
password so if we go ahead and we
refresh this you can see my password
entry field got a bit smaller and I can
also only type in five characters and no
more as you can see it's not typing so
that's pretty much the difference
between a username and a password and
the only difference is that the thing is
bulleted out all the content is bulleted
out so let's just go ahead and minimize
that and below this we can just add in
another break tag and like I said if
there was enough time we'll go over how
to submit a file so let's go ahead and
do that and this is actually really easy
so let's go ahead and all it is is just
an input element with the type equal to
file and that's it go ahead and save
this come back here click refresh and as
you can see we've now got this new
element that's showing up here and this
is just how to live this is just how the
user can submit a file so as soon as
they click on this browse button or even
if they click in this field a little
window pops up and then they can just
choose a file that they would like to
upload onto the web server and that's
pretty much it there's not much else you
can really do with the file
element you can if you want to just
change the size and that's pretty much
it
so size equal to five and it just gets
smaller
that's it so that's pretty much all I
have for you guys in this tutorial and I
would really like to see you guys in the
next tutorial and obviously don't forget
