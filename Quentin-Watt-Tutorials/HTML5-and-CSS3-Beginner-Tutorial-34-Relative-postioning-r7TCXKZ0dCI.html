back to tutorial number 34 and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
about styling elements on your web page
so as you can see I'm actually starting
off with all the exact same code as our
previous tutorial but what I want to do
now is I actually want to change a few
things and one of the things I want to
change is I just want to delete a few of
these paragraphs because we don't need
so many okay so I'm just gonna go ahead
and click Save and in our main section I
want to delete the styling code for or
the positioning code for the absolute
positioning of the previous tutorial so
I'm just gonna go ahead and I delete
that and then save this and we can run
this in Firefox and whoops wrong one
okay let's go ahead run this in Firefox
and the reason I want to do this as I
just want you guys to be able to see the
difference between what it looks like
now and what it looks like later so
you've just got something to compare it
to so as you can see we've started off
with a head at the top of the page our
main section in the middle and then our
footer at the bottom over here so that's
basically what our page looks like now
and what we can do is just go to our CSS
and we can use relative positioning to
change a little bit of the positioning
on the web page let's just go ahead and
position the our main section we'll go
ahead and position that relative and
what we can do is go up is position from
the top can be 400 pixels and position
from the left can be 100 pixels let's go
ahead and save that and we can go back
to Firefox and click refresh and as you
can see this is very different to what
happened in our previous tutorials
whenever we positioned an element okay
so as you can see our footer didn't
actually shoot up to fill up this empty
space that has been left by our article
okay and the reason for that is because
the browser store actually drew our
article in this space or I don't wanna
say drew it actually rendered our
article in this space our main section
and then only after rendering our main
section in this space it decided to move
our article 400 pixels down and 100
pixels to the left okay so that's why
there is this big open space in the
middle and if that's different to
absolute positioning because absolute
positioning the the footer actually shot
up and then took a took up the space
that was left behind and then the next
thing I want to tell you guys about is
that our article isn't actually position
800 pixels from the top left corner of
our browser or our window it's actually
positioned 800 pixels down from its
original position
so that is 800 pixels down and then a
hundred pixels left to its original
position and I can demonstrate this a
little bit better by going over to our
CSS and instead of using such big
measurements over here we can just go
ahead and say position at 10 pixels left
and yeah we can go ahead and say 5
pixels down okay so go back to Firefox
and then click refresh and as you can
see we're now actually just 5 pixels
down from where our main section would
have originally been and 10 pixels
across from when our main section would
have originally been okay so that's what
relative positioning actually does on
your web page and we can compare this to
absolute positioning if I just go over
to my style sheets and will position our
footer absolutely okay so let's go ahead
and
I can partly just copy this ctrl-c
ctrl-v
and we can go ahead and position this
absolute okay awesome save that and I'm
just gonna leave the measurements
exactly the same and we can go back and
refresh this and as you can see my
footer is now five pixels from the top
and I am right it is five pixels yes
okay awesome so it's five pixels from
the top and 10 pixels from the left of
the top corner of our browser and that
is what absolute positioning does
compared to relative positioning which
is now five pixels from its original
position in the document flow and five
pixels down and ten pixels to the left
of its original position in the document
flow so that's pretty much what absolute
positioning and relative positioning
does and what's the difference between
both of them so thank you guys for
