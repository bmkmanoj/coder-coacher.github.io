know something last weekend so not not
this previous weekend at the weekend
before that my internet line actually
blew up so there was a huge thunderstorm
I got hit by lightning and take a look
at this so that is my adsl filter and
that was my ruta that's also blown up as
well so yeah pretty much everything
right now is broken and I don't have
internet access at home if I absolutely
have to use the internet I pull out my
cell phone and I connect to the internet
using my cell phone using mobile
daughter it is a lot more expensive
doing things that way so I try to do
that as little as possible now I know a
lot of you guys going to be asking well
I mean how do you upload these videos
well I used the internet at work so i
use i actually always use the internet
I've worked to upload videos because
that's faster so i usually record at
home then go upload whenever i might
work but i am trying to organize a
faster line at home so i'm trying to get
fiber but fire but again really
expensive stuff and i'm trying to get
ahold of it but i I've actually already
been waiting three months for fiber from
one company and then we're taking too
long so I decided to go to another
company now and I have absolutely no hot
no idea how long this is going to take I
have been told one week and then I'll
get fiber but I don't know i'll probably
have to wait 2-3 weeks so for now i'm
recording videos offline and then going
to publish them when i'm at work online
again right so that is the situation and
hopefully
can get that sorted soon and then i can
stop making videos that require internet
access so things like me teaching you
guys how to do a design of a new website
or something like that and yeah
hopefully i can get that fixed soon and
i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
