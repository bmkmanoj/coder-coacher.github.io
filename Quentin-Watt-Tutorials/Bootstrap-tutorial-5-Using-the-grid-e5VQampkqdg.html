here and welcome to tutorial number five
and in this video we are finally going
to be coding some bootstrap so I know a
lot of you guys have probably been
shouting at your screen for the first
four tutorials like when the hell are
you going to start coding Quinton well
this is the video so get ready and in
this video we're actually going to start
by creating a container for our
bootstrap grid and then we're going to
start creating the grid inside of that
container so like I said bootstrap is
made out of rows and columns and we'll
be making those rows and columns in this
video so let's start off by creating a
div and I'm going to give this div a
class of container and this could also
have a class of container fluid but I'll
explain the difference a little bit
later on in the tutorial for now let's
just go ahead and use container and
inside of our container I'm going to add
a row so this is going to be div with a
class of row and by the way this doesn't
have to be a div okay so let's say I
wanted to have a header or a footer or
any other html5 tag on my site I could
do that by just adding or changing this
tag to a header tag but it doesn't have
to be the container spectacled e it
could be one of the rows but yeah you
can decide I'll lay I'll leave you up to
that right okay so now I have a row
let's go ahead and start adding some
columns and I'm going to add a column by
creating another div and I'm going to
give this a class of Col for column but
it's a little bit trickier than that
right because remember when I spoke to
you about
breakpoints we actually use our columns
when we're whenever we create these
different break points so for instance
if I want to create a break point for a
large screen then I will say call - LG -
however many columns I want this div to
take up on a large screen right so I'm
going to go ahead and add a one over
here and this means that we're creating
a column that on a large screen displays
at one column width okay and yeah so now
I'm going to go ahead and add a number
one over here and I also want to give
this a secondary class by just leaving a
space and adding BG - warning and that
is going to add a background color so
bootstrap has these background colors
that we can add with this class so BG
for background and then warning for the
actual color code and bootstrap has
these five different color codes by
default which are warning danger info
success and primary and these are okay
warning is like a yellow danger is like
a red success is a green and info is a
light blue and then by default primary
is like this darkish blue so you'll get
to see all the colors now in just a
second as soon as we continue or finish
with making these columns so I'm going
to say copy this first column and I'm
going to paste that three times so now I
have four columns 1 2 3 4 and I'm going
to give give each one of these a
different background so let's go we've
got warning info danger and success okay
and the reason why I'm doing this is
just so you guys can see the color
difference between each column so you
know where one column starts
and ends and then where the next column
starts and ends okay so this is just to
give you guys a visual representation of
each column and now I'm going to copy
those four columns and paste those twice
so now I have 12 columns if I count
correctly 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 20 - what's
where did that come from 11 and 12 okay
command S that's going to save
everything and now we can go over to the
browser and view this all and did I give
that a container of fluid
no I didn't I just I don't know if I
saved that then hmm maybe I spelled
container wrong yeah okay I must have
made a little bit of a type of somewhere
along the line container is spelled
wrong okay and this is exactly what
happens when you use contain a fluid it
makes the div take up the full browser
width but container also seems to where
container it gives you these spaces on
the side it's just that I made a typo
because I'm an idiot but yeah let's move
on from there and as you can see I now
have 12 columns starting from 1 and
ending at 12 and we've got our different
colors over here so you can see exactly
what the width of a column is on a
computer screen ok and what I wanted to
show you guys now was that if you change
this to container fluid then the
container actually gets bigger and takes
up the full width of the browser but you
kind of already saw that because I made
my typo so yeah let's go ahead and just
save that back as it was okay and that
should take us back to our default
container and now I want to show you
guys what happens if you add more
columns
to our container because right now or
more columns taro because right now we
have 12 columns and bootstrap has 12
columns so what happens if I add a 13th
or a 14th column is the other columns
going to expand out of the container
because that would be weird
let's go ahead and test that out right
so let me copy column 12 and paste that
and we'll change that to column 13 I'm
going to go ahead and save this now and
if I hit refresh you can see that column
13 is appearing below column 1 so what
has happened here is because we used
more columns than bootstrap has
available it kind of just broke the
column down to a new line and started
over there so in other words it starts
stacking the columns if you start using
more columns than you have space for
okay and that is the default bootstrap
behavior so if you're trying to use too
many columns of your contents trying to
fit over too many columns then it kind
of just breaks down and takes up a new
line or it stacks is a better word okay
so that's what I wanted to show you
about that let's get rid of that column
now and I'm going to hit save and I want
to show you guys the responsiveness of
this setup right now so I'm going to go
ahead and hit shift or alt come on M
ideas shift ctrl M on a Windows PC and
that jumps into responsive design view
and immediately you'll see that
something is looking pretty weird right
now because over here we had all of our
columns next to each other but over here
all of our columns are stacking and
displaying one below the other and that
has happening all the way up to a
thousand two hundred pixels okay and the
reason for that is
at a thousand two hundred pixels that is
our large breakpoints so anything bigger
than a thousand two hundred pixels is
considered a large screen a thousand two
hundred pixels in width right then if I
scale this down to anything below a
thousand two hundred pixels that is
considered a medium width screen so we'd
need a medium with breakpoints over here
or we'd need something smaller than a
medium width breakpoint so what I'm
going to do is hit alt command F and I'm
going to change my large breakpoint to a
small breakpoints and we're going to
have the small breakpoints appear at
four columns and in fact I want to I
want to change them I'm just going to
have a large breakpoint and I'm going to
have an extra small breakpoint so let's
go ahead and replace all and hit save
now okay and basically when I click
refresh now nothing should happen on a
large screen so we still have this rule
applying this breakpoint file or screen
applying which is if it's a large screen
we wanted to take up one column and now
I'm going to go ahead and hit jump into
responsive design view okay and let's
start off at a phone screen so this is
pretty much what our website would look
like on a phone where we now have each
column is or each one of these divs is
taking up four columns and that is an
extra small device that is our phone so
12 divided by 4 is 3 so that's why we
actually have three different columns
appearing ok and then the rest of them
are stacked underneath underneath at
three columns each so yeah that is our
extra small view but now let me scroll
our scale up to a small view which is
this is like an iPad with
by the way at seven six eight okay so
anything below that is a I pad width and
as you can see we're still using the
extra small rule which I applied over
here so this extra small break point is
applying even to the small screen and
again if I scale that up a bit more this
is a medium sized screen and we still
have our extra small breakpoint rule
applying even though this is a medium
sized screen so you're probably
wondering well what the heck if we have
a medium sized screen why is it using
the extra small rule and the same thing
for the small screen if we have a small
screen why is it using the extra small
breakpoint rule and the reason for that
is because bootstrap works from the
smallest screen up okay so in other
words if we're if we set a breakpoint
for an extra small screen which is what
I did now and then we leave out
breakpoints for the small and the medium
and even if we did that for the large
then a bootstrap would use the smallest
breakpoint first right so in order to
change that we'd obviously have to add
more breakpoints so I could go ahead and
add a breakpoint for a medium-sized
screen and have that add like two
columns or something and then our medium
screen would display with our medium
breakpoint rule but since I left those
out that's why we had the extra small
rule applying to everything until we got
to the large screen because like I said
bootstrap uses the smallest breakpoint
rule first and that is because it
bootstrap follows this mobile first
design rule right so your design for a
phone first because everyone you
as phones most people use phones and
then let your website scale up to a
computer and still look good you've got
the option of doing that with all of our
breakpoints okay and that's actually
pretty much what I wanted to show you
guys in this video but in the next video
I'm going to show you guys how to create
a few layouts using the bootstrap grid
and that is what you'll have to come
back and watch the next video for so
until then don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
and share this video it's really going
to help my channel grow and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
