here and as you guys can probably tell
this video is going to be a little bit
different to what you're used to seeing
on my channel ok because you're looking
at my face and not my computer screen ok
but there is a reason for that ok
because I said ok a lot because I have a
guest on the channel today his name is
Travis and he's all the way from San
Francisco California from another
youtube channel called dev tips so he
actually commented on one of my videos
and he said hey man do you want to do a
collaboration and I said of course and I
actually said I emailed you all ready
let's go ok so wow we got together we
kind of thought away like okay well how
are we going to do this interview
because he can't actually you know come
here to my house I'm all the way in
South Africa so instead what we decided
to do was do a little skype chat and I
interviewed him and he interviewed me so
it's it's worth mentioning that if you
guys want to learn a little bit more
about me then you want to click through
on the annotation at the end of the
video and you'll go through to a video
on Travis's channel where he will
interview me and right now we'll go into
my interview with Travis so pay close
attention because my t-shirts about to
change color and this little bit of
stubble is going to disappear hey Travis
how are you doing today really good
thanks ok so Travis can you tell us more
about yourself who you are and what do
you do oh man that's the big stuff um ok
so I'm a I'm a designer and developer I
live in California in America and I work
in work in California with startups I
currently work with a company that does
a like big data analytics for YouTube
and that's kind of how i got like the
whole youtube
but you know I spent time with YouTube
other YouTube creators and learned about
the community and kind of just thought
you know hey there's a space for me
right here this is really cool and I
said I have something to say so it kind
of worked out that's how I got it kind
of got with the YouTube so how did you
actually get into web design in the
first place oh geez um well it's a it's
a progression like anything so when I
was a kid I was in a rock and roll band
and we needed like flyers and then we
needed t-shirts and then we needed a
website you know and we needed like
album covers and everything like that
and then the other bands needed stuff
and I was just like like this I would
always draw and like I wrote a lot and I
would take photos a lot when I was a kid
so it just kind of came to me naturally
that this is like this this idea that i
want to be a creator that i want to be a
producer and when that when a need arose
when all the bands that I that we would
like tour with and play music with like
needed you know graphical assets or
whatever it just kind of yeah naturally
came into line and so later on down the
road I how did that come back but I
joined an agency ace to live in Las
Vegas so it joined a an advertising
agency there right after a lot of you
know freelance work and all that the
usual story of you have to grind a lot
you know um but I yeah I joined an
advertising agency it from Las Vegas and
then from there uh I became the creative
director and I led a team of designers
and that was a lot of fun and then I
moved out to California and I worked
with an agency out here that does a web
sites and creative for a bunch of like
rock stars so like like a American rock
stars I don't know if you're if you know
it like Bon Jovi and Janet Jackson the
killers and like a whole bunch of like
really like like top top-of-the-line
acts so that was a really
cool to like need all those kind of
people and that's exciting yeah yeah it
was a really great job um and then from
there I joined another startup so I've
been doing agency work now agency work
means that you work for clients you work
on their projects so joining the startup
culture and here in Silicon Valley was a
little bit different because you're not
working for somebody else you're you're
in effect working for the user or you
know you're building something that
you're going to directly communicate
with the users and help them to enrich
their lives in I mean hopefully enrich
their lives in some way but it's
interesting because you instead of doing
client work or agency work where you
move from one project to the next in a
matter of month or have several projects
going on at once um you know working out
of at a start-up or an in-house kind of
design position you can sit with the
project for a very long time years you
know you sit with it you think about
every like little nuance you know how
does the user do X and after that they
have to do why and what's that going to
be like so so it's very user focused and
like it has to be rightful the user it's
not something like where you go to a
company and you're like okay do you like
this or do you not like this kind of
thing yeah yeah so when you're going to
use his reactions energy is you can't
speak to that that's exactly right yeah
when you're working at an agency the
client is the band or the company that
you're working for right you're like
does the CEO like this shade of blue
right and he has to decide if he likes
the shade of blue but when you're
working for the user directly it doesn't
even matter with the shade of blue is
nobody cares all they care about is do
they know where to click do they do they
understand what's happening and that's a
big difference yeah so I really really
enjoy it now so the come
that I worked with got acquired by
groupon and then after that I joined
this company now and we work with with
YouTube and youtubers and create a place
where they can understand their audience
and grow their audience and stuff like
that so hanging out with all these
youtubers yeah hanging out with all
these youtubers I got the bug and
started kind of like doing my own thing
and and you know and I've always loved
teach and talking's to hear my own voice
you know one of those kind of people so
I know it sounds really fun so what do
you actually find what are you most
passionate about in like what you do now
what's what's the most fun Ottomans um
so I spend a lot of time with dev tips I
didn't really understand going into it
how much time this would kind of take so
before dev tips my big project was my
it's kind of a blog right I would like
have specifically direct art-directed
articles let's like every every article
on my blog had a different design
independent of each other and in its
that it spent a lot of time there's a
really great creative output for me a
really good way to express myself and
learn a lot I learned a lot by doing
things and trying new things so I look
at dev tips is like an extension of that
like it's a new kind of a medium it's a
new platform for me I'm trying new
things learning new things all the time
like like hosting these interviews with
you is something I've never done before
so it's really exciting to me to like
meet Pete I mean you're about half a
world away so that's so cool that we can
just cut connect this way it's it's
really awesome yeah YouTube is for me
like the next kind of creative project
that I've been doing and its really cool
it's really it's it's been one of the
most interactive things that I've done
in terms of actual engagement from the
people that view my work usually people
see it and they comment like this is
cool or this is nice or hey that's an
interesting thought but
this YouTube channel it's like I'm
getting to know the people that I'm
communicating with and like it's kind of
blowing my mind that people are actually
interested in what I have to say it's
pretty cool i really like it yeah it's
quite exciting for me too yeah okay so
what did you actually do before web
designer did you just get straight into
that off the school um well I did print
design for a long time okay yeah that's
where I started I started in in print
design at the at the agency in Las Vegas
I I did print design and worked myself
up to being a creative director in
charge of or not in charge of but you
know leading a team of designers there
who primarily did print as well and I I
also did weba taught myself I didn't go
to school I taught myself and the reason
I I always was keen on the web was
because it is a really open publishing
platform right so if you're a print
designer took the way to make your work
become real is to pay somebody a lot of
money to print it printing is very
expensive and in order to get something
really cool it cost like the the cooler
it is the more it costs right yeah and
I'm very poor / stingy so um the only
way to get my things printed was to do
them for clients you know and they would
print their thing and I would keep one
or two of them just kind of be like this
token or you know like at like an
artifact that I understand so yes yeah
so the web is like it's just so much
freedom yeah that's right yeah the web
is like this really open I mean all you
need to do is have like a web server
somewhere and these days you don't even
need to have that you can just use
github pages or something free you know
and and you can you can make really
awesome things that hundreds and
thousands and you know and even more
than that people can see it and enjoy
use it and it can and they can respond
to it right so like if you don't make a
magazine ad yeah if somebody is gonna
flip through it on a coffee table in a
dentist office and then I'm never gonna
hear about it but web site you can click
a button and it's in millions of
people's hands kind of thing that's
right and they can they can use it they
can respond to it and they can we can
talk about it afterward and that is like
really cool that just gives me going I
can't even okay so here's kind of a big
question okay but your channels are
fairly new to youtube it's actually just
a few months old um but can you tell us
what was the inspiration behind starting
the channel um the inspiration behind
okay so there's a there's a youtube
convention here in its in California but
it's in LA and I went to it because I am
a part of the YouTube ecosphere in that
in in the way that I work at this
company that makes tools for youtubers
so we went to the conference to meet you
tubers and talk to them talk to people
who use our tools talk to people who
don't and try to get them to use our
tools and um I was just really just
blown away by the passion that everybody
like everybody was so excited about
everything right and everybody was like
really cool and that's what really like
I was just walking around the show floor
and i was thinking like i kinda want to
be in the mix like I want to be in the
middle of this so um actually at the
conference I on my phone I registered
the dev tips name on YouTube ok right
there yeah so that was like that's where
it started and yeah and then not two
months later you put a video no yeah
like I had to go and I had to like build
in my garage I do like like a build the
back of this ground like I you know just
sheetrock and everything I'd paint it
and get the lights and the gift
like study microphones and like figure
out exactly how I wanted to present
myself in the branding right like like
the motion before and after and stuff
like that I had had some help from a
really good friend of mine John Haggard
and he he helped me um the he liked to
he like talked me through how to do the
motion work which I had never done
before if that was a really a big
learning experience too so when I say
that like my youtube channel has been a
big like a learning experience both in
terms of like just effort and time like
I'm so impressed with everybody else now
like now that I'm making these things
I'm like watch every else's videos and
I'm like whoa like you know yeah it's
just so it's so involved but it's you
know okay so that's actually leads into
my next question as well which is I'm
looking back what impact do you feel
that your channel has had on your life
so far and I'm not just talking in terms
of subscribers but what have you learned
from actually starting a YouTube channel
well I think in terms of the content
that i teach being HTML and CSS and we
haven't even gotten there yet but i'm
planning on teaching javascript um i've
i've learned well I've had a deeper
appreciation for the material certainly
because I mean even though I use these
things every day trying to explain them
as like a whole nother level and I got
that to you yeah it's not easy to
express something that is just really
natural to you so um I mean I I spend a
lot of time writing the scripts and
thinking about is there anything
interesting i can bring to this kind of
conversation i've done like really weird
things like when i was explaining
display types i was writing like using
my face as a whiteboard and that was
weird and like I just sometimes I try to
draw it out or use like different types
of animations to help people understand
the things and through through all using
these different like tools
it really really brings about how
important and kind of just awesome what
we get to do is every day so and then
also I've learned a lot about how how
much work goes into these YouTube videos
yeah I'm so appreciative now if like I
see other people's work and I'm like wow
this is really great and before I would
be like that was cool yeah but but now I
get it like I like I understand what
goes into it and I'm like wow you know
first of all thank you for making this
like it's so much effort and second of
all like good job cuz it's not easy yeah
okay I was just coming back to the part
where you said you appreciate the
material a lot more yeah I remember I I
can't remember which channel ones but I
remember watching some guys speak about
that and they call that the curse of
knowledge like the more you know then
the harder it is to explain something to
somebody else because you're leaving out
the simple things yes like you're
expecting them to just know the simple
stuff yes and you actually have to go
back to your source material or like a
book or something and see how that is
showing really people that already new
to this stuff like okay you need to do
this first and that person that is the
things that like you take for granted it
was it seemed really simple but for them
they never knew how to do it right it's
it's definitely a skill to be simple
yeah and and that's it's not easy and it
takes practice and stuff and that's why
like I mean I can't it's really hard for
me to sit down and just talk I I write
scripts I do I write them all out and um
you know I take more than one take so I
explained something like that wasn't
good and so I'll do it again um like
like more than like I mean four or five
takes in a road to get something like
like that clear because i often you see
ya doing okay cool I wasn't sure because
um here seems like really I don't know
yours
really natural like when I first one I
was like oh cool this guy knows what
he's doing oh I'll write a script out
and have it on the screen that I'm
surprised by that you sound so natural
Wow uh yeah no I try I read through my
script of like okay I think I've got an
all in memory and i go and i'll actually
i'll go for about half a video and then
i'll forget something so that I gotta
like um and I hit the pause button I'm
like what am i doing now yeah so the
script is not only just what to say but
it's also kind of a lesson plan like
what's your strategy in teaching that
material um so yeah can you to not tell
us what are your plans for the future of
your channel oh man I have so many ideas
bouncing around I have a huge list of
things I want to do um things like I
want to do more of things like this
talking to other creators and developers
recently I went to a meetup in San
Francisco and I made that video talking
I asked them about inspiration what
inspires them and what is it you know
what does it take to be an inspired
person like how do you assimilate
information and be able to combine it
and create something new so that was
really fun um I do that like whenever I
go to there's like whenever I go to a
place where there's going to be a lot of
creative people I usually just bring my
camera and try to see if I can get some
gems you know out of those people um and
then I also you know continue with the
tutorials we finished a CSS basic series
and I feel really like like free you
know like like we're done with the
basics now let's go into like the be
interesting and not that the basics
aren't interesting they're very
interesting but I feel like now I can do
things that people don't understand like
those like I've had a lot of questions
about positioning so I made to
positioning videos and people were like
finally now I get it if you know um so I
want to do more I like also answering
user questions
when they leave comments I'm I try to
address them as you know as
appropriately and as quickly as possible
and g is other things I don't know yeah
just there's a there's a lot of plants
like I have a list of like like topics
like next week I'm going to be doing
floats for example okay and in not only
is it the material that I'm trying to
teach but I want to approach it in like
entertaining ways I mean you can get
this information anywhere and you can
look up floats and you can read about it
and you can understand it in two minutes
but like how can I make a video that
helps somebody not be bored of it you
know that's one of my concerns yeah
that's something that bugs me a little
bit as a long I stayed in one of my
videos once and a people comment below
they all the time it's like you're not
boring yeah yeah you are like violence
yeah as the youtuber you I'm always so
self-conscious like these people are
gonna hate this or they're gonna turn it
off after two you know seconds yeah now
I kind of I kind of RIT's a netbook is
now get a comp end all the time yeah I
wasn't fishing for compliments right
right um okay so is there anything else
