here and welcome back to tutorial number
34 and in this video we are going to
take a look at how to split and merge
arrays using the array slice and the
array merge functions okay so of course
to start things off we need an array
which I've gone ahead and used the array
from the previous tutorial but I just
want to make this array a little bit
longer so that we actually have some
elements to work with over here so I'm
going to add in another fruit we'll just
add in banana and then I think the last
one can just be blueberries or something
ok cool so now we've got an array that's
just a little bit longer so we've got a
little bit more to work with here now
let me show you guys how to use the
array slice function ok so obviously the
name is array slice array underscore
slice and this array actually takes
three different arguments okay the first
one is the array that you would like to
cut so in this case we are going to be
using the fruit array so we might as
well just go ahead and throw that array
in there the next argument is where you
would like to start cutting from so in
other words if you wanted to start
cutting from the first element then
you'd go ahead and put a 1 in here but
let's go ahead and start cutting from
apples so we'll start cutting from the
second element and I'm actually lying
because this is 0 1 2 ok well whatever
will we'll see where we get to with 2
ok and the next element or the next
argument sorry that we are going to have
to supply is how long would you like to
cut fall so in other words if you wanted
to cut from apples to strawberries that
is 3
elements so you would obviously put a
three in here again if you wanted to
just cut one element out like apples
then you just have to put a one but
let's go ahead and start cutting at
element two or position two and then cut
for three elements and see where we end
up okay
and I'm actually going to store this in
a new array okay because once you've
used this function you actually get an
array back so this new array variable is
actually going to be holding a new array
that we would have made with this
function so now let's just go ahead and
display all of this out obviously to do
that it's an array so we have to leap
through the array so we'll go ahead and
say for each new array as value and then
obviously break down here and just echo
out the value followed by a break tags
that everything appears on a new line
don't forget the quotes okay
cool so now that we've done this we
should actually cut a an array out of
this array and then obviously display
everything that is in our new array so
let's see what we get in the browser
strawberries banana blueberries okay so
we actually started cutting from
strawberries and we went along for three
different elements so if we wanted to
start from apples then we'd start at the
first element obviously so let's go back
here and click refresh Apple
strawberries banana okay so that's how
to actually split an array into us like
a sub array now let's take a look at how
to merge two arrays so obviously two
do that we need to have two arrays so
I'm just going to go ahead and get rid
of all of that and we'll make a new
array called food and obviously this is
going to be an array and we'll just put
in four elements here so one two three
four and the first one can be a burgers
the second one can be pizza and that can
be fries so basically all unhealthy food
and pies okay cool so now we've got two
arrays let's take a look at how to merge
them so I'm going to make a new variable
here called merged arrays and obviously
this is going to be an array which is
going to be equal to the sum of both of
these arrays so it's going to be those
two arrays that are merged okay and
we're going to use a function called
array merge so array and the score merge
and this function actually takes in two
arguments as well so the first argument
is obviously the first array that you
want to merge and then the second
argument is the second array that you'd
like to merge okay so now this variable
here merged arrays is actually equal to
this array and that array okay so if we
go ahead and display this out
we should get oranges apples
strawberries banana blueberries burgers
pizza fries and pies all echoed out onto
the screen so let's go ahead and see if
we've done everything correctly
so for each merged array
as value and then we'll just echo out
the value and depend on a break tag as
well break okay cool so let's go ahead
and save this now go back to Firefox
click refresh and as you can see we have
now echoed out oranges apples
strawberries all the way down to pies so
we did indeed join these two arrays into
one array called merged arrays cool so I
hope that comes in handy and that's
actually all I have for you guys in this
video but as always don't forget to

going to help my channel grow and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
