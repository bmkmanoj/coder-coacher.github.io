here and welcome to this video on coding
versus programming and in this video I
just want to talk about what's the
difference between the two and I also
actually started off making this video
wanting to tell you guys the danger of
following too many tutorials because I
feel like I'm going to explain that in
this video but I feel like there is a
little bit of a danger in following too
many tutorials because there are just
two very important parts to being a
programmer that if you follow two main
tutorials you don't actually get to
exercise those two skills and yeah
basically you'll end up being a little
bit empty or lacking a little bit as a
programmer because there's two skills
very important skills that you obviously
don't train if you follow too many
tutorials but I'm not saying stop
watching tutorials and don't don't ever
watch toriel's again I'm just saying
that sometimes you might need to figure
things out on your own instead of
looking for a tutorial on how to do
something so yeah now that I've got that
out of the way let's take a look at my
slideshow over here and by the way super
awesome slideshow skills am i right yeah
okay so I decided to keep things pretty
simple for this video so the slides are
pretty bland but yeah you can see that
this is what I think programming is and
I think programming consists of four
major points so you could break this
down a little bit more and I'm sure
you'll find some sub points that
actually belong to these four points but
yeah I think programming consists of
four major points the first major point
is to identify what a problem is or
identify the problem and this can be an
incredibly difficult part of programming
I think a lot of people might struggle
with finding a problem but the thing is
if you can't find what the problem is if
you if you don't know what it is you
want to code basically you can't you
can't finish
rest of the program because you don't
know what the program needs to do if you
can't identify the problem so you need
to be able to identify the problem then
you need to be able to find a solution
so I think that these first two steps
are actually the most difficult part of
programming identifying the problem and
then finding the solution and in my mind
finding a solution is done not behind
the computer I know a lot of people
might sit behind a computer and find a
solution to a problem but I think you
should always find your solution on
paper write down a list of instructions
on paper or at least make a mental note
of a list of things that you want to do
and then go ahead and code it so yeah
these are definitely the most -
difficult points if you get these two
points sorted coding is actually really
easy and you'll notice that coding will
team coding is over here as a sub point
underneath programming so whereas
programming is this like major process
of writing a program from start to
finish including testing I think coding
is just one small part of it coding is
just taking the instructions that you
have written down or the solution that
you have already thought about and then
writing it down or writing it as code
into the computer and then the last
point is to test your code and see if
that works so those are my four points
to programming and actually there are
two more points that I'm gonna add a
little while later but yeah let's take a
look at the first point which is
identifying the problem and I want to
talk to you guys about this a little bit
more because it does help if you think
about this problem that you need a solve
as a math problem this is why often
you'll hear people say that if you want
to become a programmer or developer you
need to be good at math and I say it's
not necessarily because we do a lot of
math in programming it depends on what
kind of programming you're going to do
you might use math you might not but I'd
say the four
process is the same like the problem
when you when you think about math and
you think about solving for x in an
equation and you want to now go about
finding X or solving X that thought
process of finding X is the same sort of
process you have to go about when you
create a programming you want to find
the solution at the end of the day you
want to write an algorithm which is
actually in the next point so yeah you
just you need to think of this as a math
problem and you need to think
mathematically at some point like I know
even if you didn't do math you could
probably still be a program it just
really helps right okay so then the next
thing is to find something I thought oh
well yeah I don't know maybe you should
have been through several points on
their own but identifying a problem
basically involved finding something
that could work
better and then building a solution to
that so I think a really cool example of
finding something that could have worked
better and then building a solution to
that is if you think about snapchat the
app snapchat before snapchat I would
have to take a photo with my cell phone
and then I'd have to open up a third
party app on my cell phone or I'd have
to open an app on my computer like
Photoshop and draw on the actual image
and then go ahead and post it to a
social media like Facebook or Twitter or
so on and what snapchat then did was
they kind of identified that hey we can
just let somebody take a photo in our
app and then in our app they can draw on
a picture they can superimpose emojis or
something like that over the picture and
then they can post it to our social
network which is snapchat and or
download the image so yeah like I think
I think that was a really great idea and
it was such a great idea that whatsapp
and Facebook and Instagram pretty much
all stole the idea and now they
work in exactly the same way so yeah
snapchat saw a gap in the market they
saw a problem that needed fixing or they
found something that was already working
and they just realize that they could
make it work better and that is an
important part of identifying a problem
that is one example all right another
example is to convert something that
previously always works on paper into a
computer program so that is that is a
problem that needs solving right if
people are still using pens of pen and
paper in this day and age for something
that could be done on a computer then
yeah why not
convert a pro convert that paperwork
into a program and my boss has recently
done something like that you might think
about oh no like everything that could
have been done on paper can now be done
on a computer but actually the nautical
industry is that what you call it the
boating industry it's got to do with
boats and ships and stuff these guys
especially with yachts have always
managed yachts and renting yachts or
something pretty much all on paper and
then recently they contacted my boss and
he's like millionaires in the
Mediterranean Sea contacted my boss and
asked him to build an app and find a
solution and then some guys in Tokyo got
involved and yeah like now my boss has
currently or he has made an app it is
available to certain people but that
that basically takes something that
people have been doing for hundreds and
hundreds of hundreds of years on paper
and they finally converted it into a
cell phone app which is quite crazy
right so yeah identifying a solution at
anything the problem can actually be
quite similar to in business finding a
gap in the market and then finding out
what it is you want to
program or whatever right okay so then
finding the solution so finding the
solution the first step I've put you
involves thinking through each step
logically now if you think about it
Steve Jobs actually has a quote which is
everybody in this country should learn
how to program
because it teaches you how to think so
yeah basically finding a solution to a
problem just involves thinking logically
and that leads me to the next point here
which is that you have to remember that
the computer doesn't know what you're
trying to do so if you skip over a step
you're going to get an error if you're
not if you're too vague in your
instructions you're probably going to
get an error so you want to break down
your instructions to steps that are as
simple as possible and that is called
creating an algorithm right so here's an
algorithm that we use every day which is
opening the door pretty much everybody
opens the door at some point in a day I
suppose and let's just imagine that you
then found somebody from a sci-fi home
because you know in sci-fi films like
Star Wars the doors kind of just like
whish open by themselves and nobody ever
actually has to open the door well I
don't know about saw Star Wars I think
that people do open those but yeah think
about sci-fi films with the doors are
kind of open by themselves like if you
had to take somebody out of that
universe and put them in our planet in
the real world today and tell them to
open a door that will walk through the
door they might not know to open it so
they're going to sit there struggling
and you know trying to walk through this
door and it's not opening so they might
walk into the door first bump themselves
and get frustrated but then you need to
kind of explain to them listen to open a
door you need to put your hand on the
door handle then you need to turn the
handle then you need to push the door if
the door is a push toys at the pool door
then you've got to push it pull it right
so
yeah like that that causes if statements
in programming as well as what those
just a pretty cool examples happening
and then once you've pushed or pull the
door and it's open you can walk through
the doorway and that is the end of your
program and actually if you wanted to
write more to that like closing the door
on stuff you'd have to have more
instructions but this is just something
that is it's I mean opening the door is
something that's super super simple and
if you were to talk to somebody else you
might actually tell them hey open that
door but if you were to tell a computer
you know this thing over here open the
door
the computers print you're not going to
understand you unless you give it very
very very basic instructions like this
and so that's the process or that's the
thought process you have to go through
is breaking things down into as simple
instructions as possible all right so
let's let's look at this last slide here
which is testing it so testing it
basically is where this this becomes a
flow chart so you need to run your code
and then you need a figure out does it
work right so if it doesn't work if it
doesn't work that's a no and then you
need to go back to the beginning again
identify the problem why doesn't my code
work well it's because I missed out a
semicolon or something like that what's
the solution at the semicolon in so code
it add that semicolon in test it does it
work hopefully now it does yes it works
can it be better and the crazy thing
about this is the answer to this can it
be better question is always always yes
so you might not think you might get to
a point with your program where you
think okay it there's no way it can be
improved it's not it doesn't need to be
made better and you will release it to
the public for them to use but you
always have reviews and things like the
App Store and then people will tell you
whether your program can be better or
not so pretty much your program can
always be better and that just means
going back to the beginning again
identify the problem what can I make or
add into this program to make it better
find the solution go about pseudo coding
that solution and then actually coding
it and testing it and yeah this becomes
a never-ending process and that's why
your apps can have version 1 the in
version 2 then version 3 because you can
always make it better right so yeah that
is basically my whole process or my
whole thought process on what the
difference between coding and
programming really is and I just want to
look at the first slide again so these
first few points I think are incredibly
incredibly important and I think if you
follow too many tutorials generally the
person who made the tutorials has
already identified the problem for you
and they've already found the solution
for you
so you generally just go straight into
coding it whoever's making this tutorial
might explain how they identify the
problem and they might explain what they
did to find a solution but generally
that's not what gets covered in a
tutorial generally the tutorials only
cover coding and then testing and if you
follow through many tutorials I think
yeah you really get focused on the the
coding side of things and you don't
exercise these two very important parts
of the programming process and that can
you know lead to problems later on in
the future when you have to code
something yourself and you can't because
you don't know how to find a solution or
you don't know how to identify a problem
so yeah I'd say there are times when you
can follow tutorials and learn learn
from a tutorial when you can but there
are also times where you need to go
about figuring something out for
yourself even if it's difficult even if
it's challenging and frustrating you
need to go ahead and look for find
solutions for yourself because you're
exercising these two skills you're
exercising the ability to identify a
problem and
the solution and those are your most
important skills as a programmer I think
coding I mean if you can find a solution
anybody can code that solution you could
even give a monkey the correct keyboard
and the correct instructions and you can
have a monkey code a program at the end
of the day as long as he doesn't have to
go about identifying the solution or
identifying the problem and finding the
solution because those are the harder
parts and that's just really what I
wanted to drive home in this video so
yeah thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys next time I just want to send a
shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain

development and they'll teach you
everything you need to know to get a job
within this field and they'll do it
within 12 weeks so check out their
website the link is in the description
below and if you do contact them make
