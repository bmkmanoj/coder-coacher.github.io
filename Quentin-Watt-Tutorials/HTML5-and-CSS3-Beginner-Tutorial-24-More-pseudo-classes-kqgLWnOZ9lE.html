to tutorial number 24 and in this
tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
a little bit more about some pseudo
classes so in the last tutorial I left
off having styled the first letter of
every single one of our paragraphs and
now what we can do in this tutorial is
just style the first child and the last
child so as you can see I'm starting off
with the same HTML that we had in the
previous tutorial but now what I want to
do is just indent all of this and then
wrap it inside of a div and the reason
why I'm doing this is just because I
need some child elements on my website
and if you guys don't know what child
elements are then basically if you can
see all of these four paragraphs and how
they are nice and neatly nested inside
of this stuff okay that means that all
of these paragraphs over here are
children of this stuff okay it also
means that this stuff is their parents
and it also means that this body is the
grandparents of these pair at these
paragraphs and this body is the parent
of this stuff so that's just how parents
and children work in HTML and when I say
I wanna style the first child then I'm
talking about this child over here okay
so the first child of my death would be
this paragraph over here and the last
child of my dev would be this paragraph
over here so that's just pretty much
what we're gonna do in this tutorial so
if you go over to your CSS and then we
go ahead and we select our div now
actually when I selected by ID so
because this div is the parent we can
just give it an ID of dad and when we go
back here we can okay I'll save that and
when we go back here we can select our
div by ID so dad and then we also need
to select the paragraphs so just like
that
so that's actually called a child
selector and if you haven't watched my
video on child selectors you should
probably go back and watch that and then
you'd understand why I did that and now
what we're going to do is use the colon
symbol just to say that we're using a
pseudo class and then what we do is we
select the pseudo class we want to use
which is first child and now what we can
do is pretty much just change the color
to green you know just something obvious
that you guys can see and if we save
this and then run this in Firefox okay
oops I ran it in the CSS sheet again
okay we go back to our index dot HTML
and then we run this in Firefox and as
you can see we now have three plain old
boring black paragraphs and then we have
one green paragraph and that was the
first child okay so that's pretty much
just how to select the first child and
if we go back to our CSS and instead of
selecting our first child we select the
last child then we pretty much get the
exact same thing except the word once is
now green instead of the word you so
that's just how to use the first child
and the last child selectors and now
what we can do
before we end off this video is I just
want to talk to you guys about the
before and after pseudo classes so you
can go back to your CSS and actually
just real clear all of this out actually
you know we weren't we'll just go ahead
and take this away so like I said we
want to use the before and the after
pseudo class so let's go ahead and be
for and we can make one for off there as
well so we'll just go ahead and after
and now what we can do is we'll still
leave these colors the same but then I'm
actually going to use the content
property to add some content to our
before and after
because as you can see on our on our
website here we don't have any content
before our paragraph and we don't have
any content after our paragraph but we
know again we're gonna change that so
anything inside of our two quotation
marks here is gonna appear on our
website so we can probably just go ahead
and write carpe diem and you know what
the models will just copy that and put
it down here as well just seeing as our
website already says you only live once
you might as well seize the day so we
can go back to our Firefox browser and
when we refresh this watch what happens
I haven't actually changed any of my
HTML you can see that so I'm not like
pausing the video and secretly tricking
you guys watch what happens when we
refresh the page you'll end up having
the word carpe diem before your
paragraph and you'll end up having the
word carpe diem off your paragraph so
that's just how the before and off the
pseudo classes work and that's pretty
much all I have for you guys in this
tutorial so I will see you guys next
time
