here and welcome to this video on
running commands via the command line so
if you guys are on Mac we are gonna be
using a Mac for this or I am gonna be
using a Mac for this tutorial but if you
guys are on Windows then don't worry
I've got you guys sorted as well so
check the video description below and
there is going to be a link to some of
the commands that we're gonna be running
for Windows but before I jump into this
video I just want to flash dev mountains
logo and I am gonna be talking to you
guys about them a little bit more
towards the end of the video but for now
let's look at this little black box on
my screen and I know that some of you
are probably looking at this and
wondering like what the heck this thing
looks so 90s why do we even need to work
with these little black box thingies
anymore and some like it could actually
be daunting to you you might be thinking
looking at this something like what the
heck is this thing even and so yeah this
is actually a very very valuable skill
to have as a developer especially in
2018 2017 because a lot of technologies
are coming out or becoming popular that
require or have a certain amount of
command line yeah basically a certain
amount of work that needs to be done in
the command line and so yeah things like
like github if you've heard of github
things like github
make use of the command line quite a lot
there is a GUI aspect to it which is
this little program that I'm using here
on my computer but we don't actually use
this this little program we just install
this so that we can run commands from
the command line
okay then things like react J yes or no
js' all of these kinds of things also
have a similar kind of aspect or a
similar kind of amount of work behind
them that involve using the command line
over actually using a graphical user
interface so instead of actually you
know right-clicking somewhere and
creating a new folder we'd like to be
able to do that
from the command line so that's what I'm
gonna be showing you guys how to do in
this video now let's cover actually
opening up terminal so I'm just going to
close this and if you guys are on a Mac
just hit command + space and search for
terminal and hit enter and there we go
you go up terminal and if you guys are
on Windows you're gonna be searching for
something called command prompt so a
slightly different name but it does
exactly the same thing and yeah now the
next thing I want to show you guys is
where to get some of the commands so
check in the video description of this
video and I'm gonna leave a link or I'm
going to leave two links so one - a Mac
terminal cheat sheet and if you guys are
on Windows I'm leaving this this Windows
cheat sheet here and yeah basically
these are all the commands that we're
gonna be working with so if you guys are
on Windows you're probably gonna be
working with these commands which are
slightly different and if you're on Mac
or even if you're on Linux a lot of the
commands that you're going to be running
here are pretty much the same or well
yeah if you're on Mac these are the
commands you're gonna be running and if
you're on Linux it's gonna be pretty
much the same thing
so now let's jump back over to my
command prompt here and I think the best
way to handle this is for me to show you
guys a visual representation of what
we're doing as well as actually showing
you the command line so I'm gonna open
up finder and I'm gonna go to my root
directory or my home directory which is
the little icon with the home and
probably your user name so whatever you
whatever user you're logged into on your
computer that should probably appear
here and find them and that is your home
directory now the reason why I'm
stressing this so much is because when
you open up terminal it's also going to
take you to your home directory so
Quinton's MacBook Pro and the user
Quinten that is my home directory that
is open in terminal right now and that
is this thing here so to prove it to you
I'm gonna run a command LS and if you
take a look at our cheat sheets if we
just scroll down to core commands LS
this is a short listing so this is going
to be a listing of all of the files
within my or all of the files and
folders within my directory so if I hit
LS and or if I type LS and hit enter you
can see that I've got applications
downloads Dropbox movies and yeah we've
got applications Dropbox downloads
movies all of those folders are here as
well I think the one difference that
some of you sharp-eyed people might
notice is that desktop is here and not
actually here and I think Apple just
kind of removes that that folder for me
because or it just that's actually a
hidden folder that you know I can unhide
using a command that I'll show you guys
maybe in a future video but yeah this is
essentially what what the command line
version looks like and this is the GUI
version but what I'd like to do now is
show you guys a few more commands so
yeah LS will list everything in the
directory we can also use another
command called CD and what CD does is
change the directory so that'll change
us to a certain directory now if we run
CD as it is with nothing next to it that
should pretty much take us back to the
home directory another way to go to the
home directory is type CD and then add
in this little tilde sign so if you run
that it also will take you back to the
home directory so that's a really really
important factor to notice or to note
take note of because you might change
directories on your computer quite a lot
and then not know how to get back to the
home directory and the fastest way is to
just type CD with a little tilde or just
CD as it is alright so now let's CD into
a directory and I think the best thing
for me to do is CD onto my desktop so
let's type CD desktop and now believe it
or not I can I can close this window
because now I'm on my desktop so my
desktop is kind of behind the terminal
here
and yeah whatever I start doing in my
terminal stuff should start appearing on
the desktop for me so if I type in
another command here which is MK dir and
let's just switch back to my notes so
I'm looking at the call commands and I'm
also looking and file management because
that's what we can use or directory
management as well because that's what
we can use the terminal for now and
these are some really helpful and really
useful commands so I'm gonna make a
directory and that's going to create a
new directory for us right so M key
mkdir stands for make directory and
let's create a new file or folder over
here called hamburger right and you can
see that I've run that command and now I
have a folder on my desktop called
hamburger right something I can do here
is CD into that directory so I can go
into hamburger and now you can see that
we've got hamburger in the command line
here so that means that I am in my
hamburger directory and from here I can
create a file so the command to create a
file on Mac is touch and then whatever
your files name is so let's touch and
then let's create a file here called
patty dot HTML right and I can do this a
couple times I can say touch tomorrow
dot PHP or something and such lettuce
CSS and that's going to create all of
these files right so if I open up this
directory now here we have lettuce CSS
patty HTML and tomato dot PHP so we've
got all the files set up here in the
directory and yeah we did all of that
using the command line and now we can
actually start removing some of these
files as well so if we look at the
the option to remove files we've got
well there there are a few different
options options that we can opt for here
so there is our M and then our M - I or
RM - R so there's a bunch of different
ones that we can use here but let's just
go with the standard RM and let's remove
Pattie dot HTML and hit enter and that
just removed patty from my directory
here so patty is now gone if you guys
want you can try some of the other
commands so RM - I basically allows you
to remove a file but you have to confirm
whether you would like that file removed
or not so let's RM - I let us start CSS
and hit enter and you can see here it's
asking are you sure you'd like to remove
lettest at CSS and you can type the word
yes or no and if you type yes BAM that
file is now gone so yeah there's a lot
of stuff that you can play around with
with this something else I want to show
you guys is how to see the backup folder
so if you type CD and then two dots
that's going to take you back just one
directory so remember CD and a tilde
will take you all the way back to the
home directory
but CD and then two dots is just gonna
take you back one folder so I've gone
out of my hammer that hamburger
directory and I'm now on my desktop and
so if I hit LS I should have my
hamburger folder showing up so that's
that's that folder back there and yeah I
can then type RM - R and if I look at my
cheat sheet here RM - oo will remove a
directory and all of its contents so
right now the hamburger directory exists
and it actually has a file in it called
tomato dot PHP so we can actually remove
everything by just typing RM - our
hamburger right and hamburger should now
be gone and you can see everything's
kind of
disappeared here as well now I kind of
do you want - I probably should have
done this before before running RM - R
but let's let's open up the terminal
here again and say mkdir test right so
if I create a test directory on my
desktop and then I type in my terminal I
type RM - test so if I just try remove
test and hit enter you can see that oops
that's because I've put this little
weird yeah I shouldn't have done that I
shouldn't have typed that thing so let's
just go RM test so the name of my folder
and hit enter you can see that it says
test is a directory so test is actually
a folder not a file and you can't use RM
on a on a folder you can only use it on
a file so that's why you have to say RM
- our test and that will get rid of the
the folder that you're trying to delete
so whatever folder name you put here
that's going to remove that folder
something else you can also do like
after you've run a lot of commands in
your command line the command line can
get a little bit messy like it is now so
sometimes it's just easier to type clear
that's gonna kind of remove everything
from the terminal although not really
because I can still scroll up so all it
does is just push everything out of view
and yeah let's let sucky let's actually
go back to my home directory so neat
little trick here something I've just
done is I've pushed up on the arrow key
or the up arrow key on my keyboard and
that goes back to some of my last
commands that I've run so yeah if you
guys want to you know keep a history of
commands that you've run you can always
just hit up and down and you can rerun a
command so if if maybe you wrote a
command that had an error like RM - test
you can then just go back there and
modify it which is nice when command
start getting really long but yeah now
that we've created directories remove
directories and all of that
fun stuff let's move on to something a
little bit more complicated so what I'd
like to do is create a new file on my
desktop so I'm already on my desktop
right now you can see that over there
and let's type touch test dot PHP right
and now I've got my PHP file on my
computer here and if I type open test
dot PHP that's probably going to open
the file in my favorite text editor so
there we go I've got sublime text open
here I've got test dot PHP in here and I
can type something in like this is just
test hit save and close this now right
and I know that this file has some text
in it but something else I can also do
is open this file we don't actually do
this very often but something you can do
is open this file in the command line so
let's type in some of the commands yes
you can you can choose between nano or
Pico and I think there's a few others
but let's type nano test PHP and that's
going to open up the PHP file in my
command line and you can see we've got
the test or the text here this is just a
test so let's remove all of this this
text and let's change it to something
else right and yeah this next part can
be a little bit tricky because yeah if
you want to actually close the file you
have to hold down ctrl + X on a Mac and
that's going to ask you if you want to
save your changes and you can put in Y
for yes and that's going to save the
file right and I think the next part
here is I mean I can hit ctrl and cancel
or yeah if I just hit enter it's going
to save the file okay so yeah we don't
often use or open up files in
the command prompt but yeah it's just
nice to know that you can actually do
that so now if I take this exact same
file and I open this in sublime you can
see that the say or the change that I
made in the terminal or yeah in my
command line has actually been saved to
the file as well right so that's pretty
awesome and yeah I think I've covered
most of the basics of using the command
line so I hope you guys now now know how
to navigate around your computer I think
maybe something I can do just before I
end off this video is to go over to my
command line here CD back to my home
directory and if I hit LS I'm back in
the place where I started with my
applications my downloads etc so yeah
just to show you guys how that works and
yeah I hope I've pretty much covered all
of the basics if you guys are looking to
kind of recap over some of these things
check the video descriptions links
because I'm gonna link to this website
and I'm also going to link to this
website and you guys can play around
with these commands by yourself
hopefully you don't break break anything
and before I end of this video I want to
talk to you guys about dev Mountain so
dev Mountain is a coding boot camp
that'll teach you everything you need to
know to become a iOS developer a UX
designer or a web developer so if you if
you're in that position right now where
you want to make that career change and
you want to go from whatever you're
doing right now whether it be working at
McDonald's working at a regular office
job or you know you've just finished
school and you have absolutely no idea
what you want to do with their life with
your life go ahead and check out their
website you can watch some of their
videos or just scroll down the page and
read a little bit more about their what
makes their Mountain unique so their
career focused and they'll give you free
housing that's a pretty cool plus so
whatever you've paid to be or to be
attending their course you'll also have
housing involved
so you won't have to worry about where
you're staying because yeah depending on
where you are you might have to just
move cities for the time that you're at
the bootcamp so they have they have
locations in Provo Salt Lake City Dallas
and Phoenix so you can go ahead and
check all of those locations out figure
out which one's best for you
and they've got courses that run for
about 13 weeks so yeah just check out
their programs and figure out if it's
worth it for you or not the link is in
