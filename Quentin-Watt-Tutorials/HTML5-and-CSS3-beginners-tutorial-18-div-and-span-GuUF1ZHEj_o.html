here and welcome to tutorial number 18
and in this tutorial I am going to talk
to you guys about two HTML elements that
are made to be used specifically with
CSS okay and these tags are the div and
span tags now unlike any other HTML
elements that you may have worked with
before these two tags don't actually
change the content in any way at all so
if I were to make use of a div element
real quick I go ahead and open up my div
tag over here and I'll go close it down
here and you'll see any content that I
put inside the stove tag won't actually
change unless I use CSS to change this
tag for me okay so let's go ahead and
just put in a heading two and ending
heading two and in the heading we can go
ahead and say apples are good and then
I'll go to the new line and make a
paragraph and then this paragraph will
just say an apple a day keeps the doctor
away if you didn't see that coming
then well okay cool so now we've got
just a normal header and a normal
paragraph and if I go ahead and run this
in Firefox you can see that it displays
as a normal heading two and a normal
paragraph so having these two tags
inside of a div tag didn't change the
way that they display at all okay and
again if I go ahead and I give you the
same example with a span tag you'll see
that the span tag isn't going to change
a word at all either so I'm going to go
ahead and just surround this word apple
with span tags and if I go back
and refresh again we don't have any
change whatsoever to the word Apple okay
so like I said these tags by themselves
do absolutely nothing but with CSS we
can go ahead and actually change those
tags to make our website look pretty or
just change the display of something on
our website so let's go ahead and style
our div tag and we can go ahead and give
that a border of one pixel solid and red
and I want to give this a background
color as well so background color of
yellow and I'm going to give this a
width of 250 pixels just so that we can
see the actual block a little bit better
and then I'm going to go ahead and give
this style my span tag now sorry and
I'll set that equal to a color of maybe
green so the text will be green and then
I'll go ahead and use text decoration
which is a property if you want to
underline your text you can go ahead and
use text decoration so underline and
that should make our word appear
underlined okay now before we go back to
Firefox and click refresh I just want to
mention to you guys or explain to you
guys why I wrote my tags out like that's
like why div is like a block and then
the span tag I left as an inline thing
so I went ahead and I just wrote span
and ending span in the same line and the
reason for that is because a div tag is
actually a block element so I like to
write my tags the same way that they
would display in the browser and a block
a div tag is a block level element so
that
means that if I were to make another div
tag on my page then we'd basically have
two blocks and these blocks would
obviously contain whatever content is
inside of the block okay so basically a
div is a big block that we can put on
our page whereas a span tag is actually
an inline element so that means that
this tag isn't going to break down to a
new line it's not going to display as a
block or anything like that it's just
going to change the content inside of
the two tags or in between the tags but
it's not going to actually do anything
else whereas if I were to put the div
tag maybe around the word day then they
would be in its own block so we'd
actually land up having an apple earth
then we'd start our new block which
means that this word day would be on a
new line and then we'd go the block
would end of the day and then we create
we'd have another line and new line that
says keeps the doctor away so go ahead
and just experiment with it yourself if
you guys don't know what I'm saying but
basically a div tag is a block level
element so it's going to break to a new
line whereas a span tag is an inline
element so it's not going to break to a
new line okay so let's go back here now
and click refresh and we'll get our
styling up here okay
all appearing okay so now we've got our
block over here and as you can see we've
got a border of one pixel red and we've
got a background color that's yellow so
that that's our div tag done also the
width is 250 which is actually quite
convenient because it fits the content
very nicely and then we've gone ahead
and weave in our span tag just turn all
the text green and underline any text in
our span tag
so that's basically how you use your div
and span tags like you'll use your div
to make a big block on the page and a
span tag just to change some words in a
sentence
okay and that's actually all I wanted to
