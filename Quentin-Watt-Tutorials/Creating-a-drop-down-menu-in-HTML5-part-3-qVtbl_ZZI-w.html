tutorial of the drop-down menu series
and in this tutorial
basically we're picking up where we left
off in the second tutorial if I just
launched this in chrome yeah you'll see
we've got our drop-down menu and when we
go over tutorials it drops down cool so
that's exactly where we left off and
it's fully functional but like us I said
before it doesn't look that good so
we're just going to look at styling that
to make it look a little bit better okay
so what we're going to do now so go over
to our CSS and we'll add in a background
gradient which I've actually I'm
actually going to use an image
background image I made it in GIMP and
then yeah I can show you guys how to
make that if anyone struggling but it's
rather easy and I'm using the wrong
brackets there URL nav underscore hover
new not hover normal dot PNG okay so
that's the background image adding a
border of one pixel solid RGB and then
we'll put that about 200 150 0 now
that's going to come up as some sort of
orange I'm not exactly sure what up and
taste it okay what else what else okay
and we'll just change the font to be
bold 16 pixels sans-serif
- okay and we'll put in a height and a
width and a margin height 40 pixels with
thousand pixels whew that's not a
thousand thousand pixels and margin of
zero pixels and photo okay now what this
does is it'll Center our navigation in
the middle of the page
okay so we'll have a height of 1,000 I
mean a width of 1,000 pixels very
self-explanatory height of 40 pixel
self-explanatory margin zero so we'll
have a margin of nothing on the top and
nothing on the bottom and and then the
the distance from the left will be the
same as the distance from the right so
it'll actually be in the center that's
what Auto over there means okay so you
save that and we can go take a look at
it actually
so launch in Chrome
that's what it looks like at the moment
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to go down to our styling and
something I should have done the last
tutorial was style the links just to get
rid of the top nav Li a okay just to get
rid of the text decoration so text caps
lock off text-decoration:none just so
that it's not underlined or anything
anymore and display:block
come on man
okay display:block height
white okay and I've map it maybe just
add in a border there photo one pixel
solid RGB and then we'll make that about
two thirty one hundred zero something
like that
ah go ahead and run that in Chrome
quickly oh I didn't say if did ah nope
so you've run in Chrome okay
and yeah I didn't add in padding cool so
go back to our link here I mean yeah
just add in some padding padding ten
pixels
well I don't know what I'm thinking
solid there 10 pixels and 25 pixels okay
so that gives it a padding of 10 pixels
on the top and on the bottom and 25
pixels on the left and 25 pixels on the
right so now we can go ahead and look at
that and it should fill that orange bar
kind of pretty much not so much only
kind of okay and now we do that border
we'll change it so that it's only on the
right okay
and now top nav you ll as you can see
when we look in chrome our drop-down
list is there but we can't see it
because the text is what so we need to
change the text over the background of
that you ll an ordered list to be a
different color so we go top nav ull ull
okay which let me just clean to other
view top nav ull ull which is top nav
ull ull which is that one okay we'll
give that a background color background
RGB and what's of 200 150 0 something
like that and then top nav top on the
school now ul whoa yeah
ul ul Li a and we'll just put in now
let's put it around the UL be a border
of one pixel solid RGB again and what's
at 2:30 100 zero
and then just copy this quickly go C
control V and off the LR will put an A
for the link and border right and take
away the border so border right equals
none there we go let's take a look at
what that looks like now
okay still nothing what went wrong with
the background color says border no
there's the background background claw
RGB let's see
what
okay take away width we don't need that
that's why it's not working
take away with completely and there we
go yeah that is quite a disgusting color
and then over here in URL oh whatever
with 100% top nav ul ul Li save okay
maybe just fix that color quickly which
one is it that one 250 should bring it
up some more orange there we go cool ah
and then maybe just change that see now
I'm just tweaking it a little bit 99%
instead of 100% the width and then
pretty much sorted and there we go
that's your drop-down menu in just HTML
and CSS thank you guys for watching
please like and subscribe my videos and
maybe I'll make them all see you guys
