here and welcome to tutorial number 27
and in this tutorial I want to speak to
you guys about forms in JavaScript okay
so if you guys don't know what forms are
I do explained in my previous series
I've got a couple videos on forms and
all the elements that we can put inside
of a form okay so if you guys don't know
what that is then go back and watch that
series and you'll be good to go
but if you do know what forms are then
this is what we're going to be making in
this tutorial okay so we've got this
program here and it asks for your name
and when you type it in so if I type in
my name Quinton and I click done then it
writes welcome Quinton on to the screen
okay and let's say I typed in my
brother's name Jared then it would write
welcome Jared so whatever you type in
here is what gets printed out here okay
so let's take a look at how to do that
now the first thing we need to do is
obviously put in all of those elements
that you see here so I'm going to move
over this quite quickly but we're going
to start off with a paragraph and I'm
actually going to leave it empty but I'm
going to give it an ID of welcome so
this is the paragraph that eventually
shows your name okay whoops yeah okay so
this is this is the paragraph over here
but as you can see when we start the
program it's not that it's empty so
that's what we're going to do now that
that's just our empty paragraph after
that I have a form a form form form form
okay and the form and inside here I've
got two input elements and I also have
just like some plain text which is what
is you
or name okay and yeah whatever something
like that okay after that we have our
input element so input type is equal to
text and then I also give an ID and I
set that equal to name
okay so this is the ID we'll be using
when we refer to this element and I also
want to add in a break tag and after
that I'm going to put it in another
input element input type of button and
the value was equal to done okay so I
hope I didn't move too fast for you guys
but if we save this now and run it in
Firefox you can see that we've basically
got the exact same program here so well
it looks the same right now this is the
one that works and this is the one that
we just made now which if you type stuff
in here now and you click done nothing
happens okay so this is the one that's
not working but we've got all of the
stuff done so long now we need to do is
work on the JavaScript okay so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
function and I'm going to call that
function right name okay and that's
exactly what this function is going to
do it's going to write whatever we put
in this element onto this paragraph okay
so what I need to now what I need to do
now is make this paragraph a variable so
that we can work with it and then I also
want to make this input element into a
variable so we can work with that as
well
okay so I'm going to make a variable and
I'm
recorded welcome para and I'm going to
set that equal to this paragraph so the
way I do that is I use my documents Wow
document dot get element by ID method
and we obviously need to grab it by this
ID here so let's go ahead and just copy
that and paste it there and that's
basically how those two are linked now
we need to go ahead and get this next
input element here so I'm just going to
call it a name and we'll just copy that
because I'm lazy and we need to grab
that name over there so we'll copy that
and paste it there okay
so now we're getting we over here this
line okay we're getting this element by
its ID and then on this line over here
we're grabbing this element by this ID
okay so now we've actually got these two
elements stored inside a variable and we
can work with those variables okay so
what I want to do now is I'm going to
set the inner HTML of this paragraph to
the value of whatever is written in here
okay so you guys know that a paragraph
tag because it's got an opening tag and
a closing tag then we can work with
something called inner HTML now inner
HTML is basically whatever is written
inside of the paragraph so this stuff
here over there that is the inner HTML
of the paragraph okay so to work with
the inner HTML of that paragraph we're
going to say welcome para okay because
that is
how wiii i identify this paragraph now
and then we're going to say dot in a
HTML and we can set that equal to
something so we're going to set it equal
to the word welcome okay
plus we'll concatenate whatever is
written inside here so whatever the
value of this input element is okay now
we know that we can refer to this input
element as this variable here name so
let's go ahead and type in that variable
name but we have to access the property
value so name dot value and the value is
whatever is written in here so you guys
know that already
okay so now we've got this function all
pretty and ready to go but we need to
call it somewhere so on my button
whenever I click okay so we'll go on
click and that is an event okay
unclick what do we want to happen well
let's call this paragraph or this
function sorry over here so paste that
in and put a semicolon cool save this
now and now when I go back to Firefox
and click refresh whenever I click on
this button it should write what ever
I've put inside here so let's type in
something like just my name again I
guess
Quinten click done and it says welcome
quinton but there's in the space so
that's a quick fix we just go ahead and
put in a space inside here now when we
save this go back here click refresh now
whenever I type this up and I click done
it says
I'll come quinton and I guess whatever
other name I want to put in here to it
would type that out as well
so welcome sure so that's pretty cool
and that's actually all I have for this
tutorial so let me know if I move too
fast guys because I don't know when I
look at this I've already shown you most
of this stuff so I figure you should
kind of know it by now but hey I don't
know maybe some of you guys don't so
just let me know if I move too fast and
if I didn't then thanks for watching and
