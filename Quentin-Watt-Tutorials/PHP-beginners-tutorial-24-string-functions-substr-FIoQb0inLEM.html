here and welcome back to tutorial number
24 and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at the substring function
okay now what the substring function
does is cut one piece of a string out of
another string okay so in other words
you could search for some words in a
really long sentence and only cut out
the words that you want or you could
take a string and cut it up letter by
letter and then print out each letter
one at a time and those are things that
I'm going to show you how to do in this
video okay so let's see the substring
function in action but in order to do
that I just want to create a variable
first called pizza and then we're going
to set this equal to the string that
we're going to work with so the string
that I have so conveniently chosen is
it's like you want to be thin and
healthy but there is pizza and make sure
you make a few typos otherwise it won't
work okay so I just need to escape that
single quotation there okay and now we
can take a look at this substring
function okay and basically the name for
this function is sub STR which you guys
can guess stands for substring okay and
this substring function actually takes
three different arguments the first
argument is the string that we want to
cut some words out of in this case we
already have a string over here it's
called pizza so let's go ahead and just
throw our variable pizza in over here
okay
then the second argument that we need is
where do we want to start cutting from
okay so I'm going to go ahead and put in
the value of five over here and this
means we're going to start cutting from
five characters or from our fifth
character in this string which if you
count one two skip this escape character
because that's escaping this so this is
actually part of our string so it's one
two three four five okay so that means
we're going to start cutting just before
the L for like okay and after that the
last argument that we need is basically
how many characters do we want to cut
for so I'm going to go ahead and put in
the value of four over here and that
means we're going to start from the
fifth position and cut out four
characters so when I save this and go
back to Firefox I should get I didn't
save this did I know I did okay noob
mistake I didn't put echo in front of
this mm-hmm a little bit newb okay so
we'll go ahead and save that now come
back click refresh and there we go so I
have the word like print it out in the
browser which by the way you guys should
really go ahead and click that like
button you know it's really gonna help
my channel okay but that's not all we
can do with our substring function
because we can actually combine this
with some of the previous functions
we've learned about in the previous
tutorials and that's what I'm going to
go ahead and do now so I'm going to
create a variable called find and we'll
set this equal to some word that we want
to find in the sentence so let's say we
want to find the word
healthy okay and then I'm going to
create another two variables over here
okay and the first one we're going to
call start so this will be where we want
to start cutting from and obviously
we're going to start cutting from
wherever we can find the word healthy
and we know how to do that because we've
learned about the string position
function okay so we want to look for we
want to look in our string pizza and we
want to find the word healthy which is
thought in our variable find okay so now
we have our starting position
let's get an ending position so end
would be STR Len so it would be the
length of our word that's in the
variable find so STR Lin find and now
all we got to do is change our start to
our start variable and how long we
should cut for to our end variable okay
now when we save this we should find the
word healthy in the sentence and then
print it out on the screen so let's
click refresh and there we go that's
awesome
now the reason why I spaced this out
like I did is because we haven't learned
how to get user from the data data from
the user user from the data confusing
okay we haven't learned how to get data
from the user and that's what we're
going to learn later on but this would
be part of that this would be basically
getting user getting data from the user
and nearly set it again and this would
be us just processing everything and
that's actually processing as well but
without put okay okay so now we've
looked or we've searched forward in our
string and then we've printed it out or
cut it out and then printed it out okay
now let's take a look at how to print
one letter of our string on a line okay
and to do that I'm actually going to
borrow some code from tutorial number 22
so if you guys don't have this code
watch tutorial number 22
I do explain all of that so let's just
go ahead and just paste it over here
okay and basically what this code did
was I created a variable called name and
I stored my name in that and then I got
the length of this variable so my name
is seven characters long and that's what
this variable holds so basically after
that we made a loop and we loop starting
from zero and going up until the length
of my name which is seven so from zero
to seven we were looping and we're just
incrementing by one each time so all I
have to do now is change this echo to
substring because we're going to use the
substring function here and obviously
the string that I need to cut from is
the string name or the variable name and
then I'm going to cut from so the
starting position that I'm going to cut
from is our variable I which we are
using in the loop and then how long do I
want to cut for well like I said I just
want to print one character on each line
so I'm just going to cut for one
character so I don't have to have a
variable for that I'll just put in the
number one and now when I save this and
click refresh I now have my name printed
out in the browser
one letter per line so how cool is that
and that's actually all I have for you
guys in this video so I hope you guys
enjoyed this please don't forget to

going to help my channel grow and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
