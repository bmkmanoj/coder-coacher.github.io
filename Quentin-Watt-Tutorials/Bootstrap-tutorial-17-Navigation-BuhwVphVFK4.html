here and welcome to tutorial number 17
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to create a navigation in
bootstrap so bootstrap actually has a
really simple nav component that we're
able to make use of and it actually
comes with two different styles of
navigation so if you take a look at my
browser over here we've got the first
style which is called a pulled
navigation and I guess it's called a
pulled navigation because each one of
these menu items when you hover over it
gets a background color and it kind of
looks like a bunch of pills okay then
the second one is obviously a tab
navigation and you can see that each one
of these items kind of looks like a tab
so the home item looks like it's a tab
that's closed at the moment whereas our
profile item is our active item and that
one looks kind of like an active tab or
an open tab right so that is what I'm
going to show you guys how to do in this
tutorial and we're also able to add
dropdowns and a few other cool classes
to all of this so I'm going to show you
guys how all of that works and I just
want to mention before we get tucked
into all of the code that I am using
code from the previous tutorial so we
have always been using this head and
this body and I am using a container a
row and a column that is taking up the
full 12 column so it's taking up the
full width of our container okay and
from here I'm going to add an unordered
list to start creating this menu so that
is kind of like the standard thing is we
always create our menus inside of
unordered list so I'm going to open up
and unordered list over here so which is
going to start with ul and I'm going to
hit enter and because I'm using sublime
it autocompletes all of that for me then
I'm going to add a class so let's type
in class and I'm gonna set that equal to
nav so we have a class of nav
but I'm also going to add a secondary
class which is Nev - tabs and this is
going to create a tabbed navigation
which is this bottom navigation that you
can see over here
so from here we need to add in a bunch
of list items because that's what we put
in an unordered list right so let's go
ahead and open up an li tag and I'm
gonna hit enter and it's gonna close it
off for me then I'm going to add an A or
an anchor link in between these
unordered lists all these list items
okay so I'm going to hit enter over here
and that's going to autocomplete my link
as well so from here I'm just gonna make
the a trip of my link to be hash and I'm
going to add some text so let's create
the first link or make the first link be
a link to the home page and there's a
helicopter flying over I don't know if
you guys can hear it but it's kind of
distracting me so an unordered list we
have a list item and from here I'm gonna
just duplicate this a list item a couple
times by hitting command shift D on my
Mac and that's going to duplicate the
item but I guess that's only if you're
using sublime and if you're using a Mac
because if you're using Windows it's
probably going to be like ctrl shift D
or something else you might have to
google it okay so we have our homepage
now let's create a link or make the next
link a profile link and a messages link
and yeah I think we can just leave it at
these three for now but what I want to
do is go over to this first list item
and I'm going to add a class over here
of active and what this actor Floss does
is it just makes this the active list
item so in other words it's going to
pull through the styling to either make
if we're using a tab navigation to make
that list item our active tab so I've
done this using the home page
which means our home should be the
active list item otherwise if you're
using a pulled navigation it's going to
have that background color so let's hit
refresh and here you can see that now
we've got our tab navigation and our
home link is the active link so that's
the one with this class over here
right and I can also change this so like
I said instead of using the nav - tabs
we can use nav pulls so nav - pulls as a
class and come back here and hit refresh
and you can see that now we're using the
pulled navigation so now it looks like
everything is a pull instead of a bunch
of tabs right so that's quite simple and
there's a few other classes that we can
add to our menu item so the first class
that I want to show you guys is gonna be
called nav - justified and if you go
ahead and type that in as a class on
your unordered list then what its gonna
do is justify all of these links so it's
gonna make them take up as much space as
possible without going over to lines so
if I hit refresh you can see that here
we've got our home link and you can see
it's now really big than our profile
link and our messages link and they are
taking up the full width of the
container right so yeah that's that's
what nav justified does and the next
class I want to show you guys is Nev -
stacked and I might have to change the
size of my column over here as well so
let me just hit save and I'll show you
what a nav stacked does let's hit
refresh and you can see that now we've
got our home link taking of the full
width of the container our profile link
underneath that messages link underneath
that right so yeah that's because we're
using nav stack so it stacks the
navigations on top of each other and
ideally what you do here is maybe make
this column take up three columns and
then you'd make another column below
this with some content so
if I hit refresh you can see that now we
have our navigation taking up only three
columns and then if we added another
column below this in the code it would
appear over here so we'd have our
content next to our navigation right so
you could do that if you wanted to do
that as well but let's change this
column back to take up the full width
and I'm gonna remove this nav stack
class and I want to show you guys how to
add a drop-down menu or a drop-down nav
to or yeah dropdown-link to this
navigation so let's go ahead and copy
this list item and I'm gonna change the
text over here to be drop-down and what
we need to do is inside of this link so
make sure you're doing it inside of this
a tag we need to add another span tag
and I'm going to end that span tag off
and we need to give this class or this
span tag a class of carrot and what that
does is it makes a little carrot or that
little triangle thing right and from
here we need to start adding our sub nav
or our drop-down nav so I'm gonna hit
enter make sure that your closing list
item is below your opening list item
over there and in between these two list
items but outside of this link we need
to create an unordered list so I'm gonna
say ul and I'm gonna hit enter that's
gonna close it off for me and we need to
give this ul or this unordered list a
class so I'm going to give that a class
of drop-down - menu just like that okay
and I need to just take a look at my
notes quickly so we have a unordered
list with a class of drop-down menu then
we also need to go over to this link
above here and we need to give this a
class as well so let's give it a class
and we'll set that equal to drop down
- toggle and then we also need to give
this another attribute which is data
- toggle so if you watch the last
tutorial then you notice that we're kind
of just bringing all of the code from
the last tutorial and combining it into
this tutorial to make this drop down
which is an our data toggle needs to be
set to drop down and that should be fine
now we just need to give this drop-down
list some list items so maybe what we do
is we just copy that and we say item 1
and then just copy that a couple times
so 2 3 and we'll say item 2 and item 3
save that come back here hit refresh
and now when I click on my drop-down
list I should have item 1 item 2 an item
3 so yeah that's how you add a drop-down
link to your navigation you just need to
make sure that you have this unordered
list within a list item and make sure
you add all those classes incorrectly
and well in correctly not incorrectly
because that would obviously mean that
you know you know what I'm saying that
could be confusing but yeah that is all
I have for you guys in this tutorial and
I will see you guys next time
