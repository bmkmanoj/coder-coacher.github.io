here
and welcome to tutorial number 11 and in
this tutorial I am gonna show you guys
how to change and edit customers or set
up a new customer in PrestaShop so by
default obviously customers can sign in
in the front end and create their own
accounts but if you ever want to set up
a new customer yourself then you can
login to press the shop and go over to
the customers tab just click on that and
the first menu item underneath that is
gonna be customers again so go ahead and
click on that and in this page you're
able to see all the customers that have
already signed up and are already using
your store so we have this John Doe by
default and then I've also created an
account before which was me okay and I
can always add a new customer over here
by hitting the plus button at the top or
that big one and the green bar over
there as well so click on that button
and that's gonna take you to a page
where you get to add a customer and the
first thing we have to fill in is a
social title so I'm gonna just check
mister over there and if you guys ever
want to set up a new title because by
default we have mister and missus and
then I've added sir you just need to go
over to the titles page over here and
it's going to ask you to fill in a title
name and whether the title is female
male or like both or yeah it could apply
to both then you can just set that up
there and when you hit save and come
back to this page you'll have multiple
titles or all the titles that you
actually added
okay so we've got mister we've got mrs.
and sir but I've ticked mr. so let's go
and fill in my customers name as Jared
that's my brother and he's surname is
what's just like mine and his email
address will be
Jared at Jews it's calm that email
address does not exist by the way I just
created it right now or just made it up
right now
password we can give him a password like
1 2 3 4 5 6 birthday
I believe his birthday is the 25th of
October 1993 boom ok so that's pretty
much all set up enabled you'll leave it
as yes because enabled means he can use
the store if you leave this at no then
it means he won't be able to log in and
actually shop from the online store ok
newsletter we'll leave that no opt-in
we'll leave it no and group access I'm
gonna change this to just be customer
group access and his default customer
group is gonna be customer so that just
means when he buys from the shop or
purchases anything from the shop he's
gonna purchase as a customer and
customer gets zero percent discount but
we can always create a new customer
group which can get like 15% discount or
whatever it is you guys want to set up
and yeah that customer group can be set
up under the scripts tab I will be
talking about that later and then
that'll appear over here and that means
whatever your user you're setting up
with that customer access or customer
group will get the discount so let's hit
save and wait for that to load ok so
that is how to setup a new customer and
if you ever want to go back and edit one
of the customers you can just go back
here click on that edit button and it's
actually going to take you to the exact
same forum again so you can see we set
up my brother's account Jared but now
we're in my account Quinton
and it looks pretty much identical
except for the birthday and my personal
details like my email address and my
name so if I ever wanted to change this
let's say I'm not a mister but I'm
actually a sir because I was knighted or
something
go ahead and save that and yeah your
title should change or my title should
change so now I'm now sir Quentin what
okay
then we can go over to addresses and if
this is if you ever want to set up a new
address for an existing clients like or
an existing customer so by default
whenever you purchase something and like
I've purchased something before then I
fold in my address which was 31 crane
road wherever now I can go ahead and
edit that address or I can add a new
address for myself on this page but I'll
leave that up to you guys to discover
okay groups this is where I said we can
create a new customer group that
actually gets a discount level so you
can see this discount column over here
and if I ever want to just add a new
group let's say I want to add a reseller
group so guys that are buying for me to
sell to someone else again I can give
them a 15% discount or whatever it is
you guys come to terms with then name
I'll just set my name to reseller
because that's the name of the discount
group or the customer group okay
tax included or excluded obviously
you'll know whether that applies to you
or not and show prices leave it yes so
it just means when they're using the
store they'll see the price okay
so let's hit save and that customer
group should now have been set up so
there it is and if I ever want to go
back over to my customers and just
change one of them to be in that group I
can go and go ahead and do that so let's
just edit Quinten again and we'll give
him reseller access and default customer
group we'll also just said that too
reseller okay so it just means I get to
give myself discount yay me
okay so that was customer groups and
we've edited the customer counts and
everything but let's just take a look at
this shopping carts tab as well and this
is just where you get to see all the
different shopping carts that you've had
in your stores history so successful
shopping carts will look something like
these bottom five which is set up here
as examples by PrestaShop and then you
can see that we've also got these
abandoned carts which were actually my
fault during some previous tutorials and
I added products to a clock that I then
abandoned and that's why they display
like that over there so that's how you
get to see if you've had abandoned carts
or not okay
customer service we can run through that
quickly and this is just whether or not
you have or a customer has filled in the
customer service form so if we come back
to the front end of the store over here
and scroll all the way down to contact
us there is a form that customers are
able to fill in and if they fill us in
cat they can choose to go to customer
service or webmaster and obviously we're
on the customer service page so if they
choose that option then this is going to
come through to us here in the backend
and you can see I've already filled one
in so they'll fill in their details and
so on and all of that will come through
to this page where I can then read any
message that they sent me so in this
case I say myself a message that said
hello there it's Quinton and I just
wanted to let you know that your service
is excellent but obviously this is the
real world and you're probably gonna
hear from customers that are upset more
often than customers that are not upset
okay
so yeah you can go ahead and respond to
them and just work out whatever problems
they had or say thanks in this
speakers I gave myself a compliment okay
and yeah that's all I have for you guys
in this video so I will see you guys

it's really gonna help my channel grow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
