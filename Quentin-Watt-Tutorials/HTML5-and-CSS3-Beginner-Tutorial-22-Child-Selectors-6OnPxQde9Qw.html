number 22 and in this tutorial I'm just
going to show you guys how to use child
selectors to style add elements on your
web page so what we can do now is we've
got a blank web page at the moment so we
have to give our web page some content
so let's just go ahead and add in a div
just like that
and inside this div let's let here then
put in three paragraphs so our first
paragraph can be like oh let's go ahead
and actually make our first paragraph
first and I might as well just copy the
salon and our first paragraph you can
probably just in have some content of
belly we'll just give them all some
names and Barbie and the next one can be
Baloo that is some alliteration I have
going on there okay and now to do is
just outside here we can just call these
ones Tom and Richard and what is this
Harry okay cool so now we've got six
paragraphs on our web page we've got
three inside of a div and we've just got
three normal ones but let's go ahead and
focus on these three inside the dev
really quick and the reason why I put
them inside a div is because we're using
child selectors so we need to have some
child elements and if you take a look at
these three paragraphs you'll see that
they're all nice and neatly nested
inside this div over here so we can go
ahead and give this to a class and we
can call this class mum because these
three paragraphs are all children of
this stuff which I have now called
mom okay so those are the paragraphs
that we're going to want to style now
so let's go ahead and save this and go
to our CSS over here and you guys know
that if you went ahead and you just
selected the P element like that we're
going to land up styling all six
elements or six paragraph elements on
our webpage so instead of just going
ahead and selecting only that P we can
go ahead and select dos and then we can
go ahead and leave a space and then
select our paragraph and what this is
going to do is it's going to select all
paragraphs that are children of a dove
tag so that's what we've got here we've
got three paragraphs that are children
of this stove tag so let's go ahead and
style those paragraphs really quick and
what we can do is you know just
something simple change the color to red
and now we can go ahead and save this
and if you run this in Firefox you'll
then whoops okay I'm in my CSS sheet go
back to my HTML run in Firefox you
should get three paragraphs that are red
and three that are black and that's
because our children elements have now
been styled with our child selector over
here but I guess this Perley isn't
really the best way to go ahead and use
a child selector on your webpage because
if you go back to your HTML over here
and you decided okay well actually
really wanted these paragraphs over here
to be inside a div tag and maybe you
call the stuff tag dad and you're handed
off your dog tag over there and let's
just go ahead and Indian these that
looks nice nice and neat and tidy and
then we go ahead and refresh in Firefox
now watch what happens when i refresh
you'll see that these paragraphs are
probably going to turn or they going to
turn red and you might have done this by
accident
and you maybe you actually wanted these
paragraphs to be read and these ones
thought to be black what you can then do
is just use classes and child selector
so instead of selecting all paragraphs
that are children of a dove tag you
could select all paragraphs that are
children of the class mom so in order to
do that you obviously just put full stop
to get your class and we'll get the
class mom and all children of all
paragraphs that are children of mom
that's what we wanted to style and when
you go back to Firefox and click refresh
you'll see that we now still have only
these three paragraphs read and those
three are still black so that's pretty
much all I have for you guys in this
tutorial and I hope you guys enjoyed the
