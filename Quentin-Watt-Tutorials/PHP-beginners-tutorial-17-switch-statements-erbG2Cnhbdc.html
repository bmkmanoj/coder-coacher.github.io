here and welcome to you tutorial number
17 and in this tutorial we are going to
start talking about the switch statement
so you guys have already learned that we
could use a whole bunch of if statements
and else if statements to check for
alternative conditions so you know like
I could go ahead and say if something
else if something else else if and I
could carry on going to check for a
whole bunch of statements and then just
have a else right at the end to handle
everything else that doesn't match any
of those conditions okay
but there is actually another way to do
things because having a whole bunch of
if else if else if statements would get
quite long and probably look quite
untidy
so we have this thing called the switch
statement and the switch statement works
very similar to an if statement or
if-else statements except the syntax is
a little bit different so let's go ahead
and take a look at that syntax real
quick okay so to use a switch statement
you'll type in the word switch and then
you'll put in some parentheses okay now
in here is basically where we will put a
test value or a variable or something
like that so we'll pass a variable into
here and then after that we put in our
two curly braces and I'll break down two
lines and here is where we check for our
conditions okay but we do it a little
bit differently to an if statement
because over here we go ahead and we
call them cases so we go case and then
we test for a value so right now I'm
actually gonna we gonna substitute these
black text things over here with some
actual values later but just for now for
demonstration purposes
just you can just write value they or
something just so you guys get used to
this syntax okay
so we'll check for in the case of this
value will do something so go ahead and
do this okay and then there's an
optional statement that we can put in
here which is called the break statement
and I'll explain that in a little while
but for now we're probably going to want
to use these break statements so just go
ahead and include that in your notes if
you are indeed taking notes down and
then we'll obviously do this a few times
so the case value and we'll check for as
many values as we need to so let's just
go ahead and put three in here for now
okay so this is basically like the
syntax of what our case statement might
look like or switch statements or it
might look like okay but if you you know
still struggling to understand let's go
ahead and actually make an example of
this so let's say I had a variable
called apples why not
and I set this equal to ten okay now I
could use this variable in my test value
here so this is the basically what we
want to check so we'll put that variable
in here and now for our cases this is
basically going to be the values that we
want to check for so let's say I want to
check if apples is equal to one then I
can go in the case of apples is one okay
then we'll do this so let's echo
something out on the screen let's just
say echo and apple a day keeps the
doctor away and make sure you spell
everything wrong otherwise it won't work
okay and then for our next case we can
check if maybe a apples is equal to 5
and if apples is 5 then we can just go
ahead and echo something out like 5
apples that's nice and of course again
make sure there's some type of x' and
then for our last case let's check if
apples is set to 10 which it indeed is
so over here we can echo 10 apples
that's a bit much don't you think
ok so now we can go ahead and save this
and actually try run this in Firefox
ok so I've just got to make sure that
xampp is running and then I'm gonna have
to go over to this tutorial so localhost
tutorials tutorial this one is 17 okay
and I made an error somewhere 912 yes I
did not put in a semicolon gotta watch
out for those things cool click refresh
and as you can see I've got 10 apples is
a bit much don't you think
so we successfully check that if apples
was set to 10 we'd print this out and if
I go ahead and I change that to 1 now
apples is set to 1 so in the case that
apples is 1 we echo out an apple the day
keeps the doctor away so let's go ahead
and see if we do indeed print that out
and as you can see that was correct
that's printed out and if we change that
to 5 go ahead and save this click
refresh 5 apples that's nice
ok so now we know how to check for a
value that we have actually set apples
to okay
our case but what happens if let's say
we set apples to something like 8 well
we don't actually have any cases over
here that check for 8 they offer like 1
5 10 so what do you guys think is going
to happen right now
well let's save it and go ahead and see
click refresh and nothing happens ok so
now we basically need a statement to
handle everything else that we haven't
checked ok so that's where we get the
default statement so to use the default
statement we just go ahead and type the
word
default and then we echo out something
so let's just echo out this is the
default now this default statement will
only run or only be printed out if none
of the previous cases matched our
variable ok so right now none of them do
you match the variable so let's go ahead
and save that and click refresh and as
you can see this is the default and it
doesn't matter what we set apples to now
as long as apples isn't 1 5 or 10 we are
going to get this printed out so the
default statement basically handles
everything else that we didn't check for
okay then the next thing I should
explain to you guys just before we end
off is this break statement ok now what
this break statement does is basically
break out of the switch statements okay
because let's say we found let's say
apples was one okay now we've checked
for the case of apples being one and
we've printed this line of code out if
we didn't have break yeah so if break
wasn't yet the computer would then go on
and check
four case five and well we already know
that apples is one because we found it
over here so why is the computer even
checking for case five and then it'll go
on and check for case ten and check the
next case in the next case in the next
case and it's going to waste computing
time checking for these cases so you
would rather just prefer to have if I
can get that back you would rather just
prefer to have this break statement here
so that way the computer goes okay case
apples is one I'm gonna print this out
and then I'm gonna break that means that
I'm gonna ignore the rest of this stuff
and we'll just continue on with whatever
code is down there okay so that's what
that break statement does and the reason
why we don't have a break statement in
our default is because the default
statement is always going to be the last
statement in the switch statement okay
so there's no point in breaking out of a
default statement if there's already or
a default case if this is already the
last case because by the time the
computer gets here it's the end so why
break out if it's gonna break up by
itself you know what I'm saying
so that's all I have for you guys in
this tutorial don't forget to subscribe
