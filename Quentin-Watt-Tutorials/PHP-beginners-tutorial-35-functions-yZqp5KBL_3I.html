here and welcome to tutorial number 35
and in this tutorial we are finally
going to start learning how to create
our own functions in PHP so over the
past few tutorials you guys have already
seen and hopefully you've already used
some of the built-in functions in PHP
which I showed you guys and now it's
time to finally start learning how to
create our own functions okay so why our
function is useful and what do functions
allow us to do well a function allows us
to reuse code whenever we like so that
means we don't have to repeat the same
block of code like we don't have to copy
paste code and put it all over the place
we can just write it all once in a
function and call that function whenever
we need it okay this means that our code
will be shorter and ultimately it will
keep our code looking a lot more tidy so
let's take a look at the syntax for
creating a function in PHP and it's
actually quite simple okay all you have
to do is type in the keyword function
which tells PHP okay listen up we are
about to make a function over here this
is going to be a function that we want
to make as the programmer okay then
you'll put in the function name so you
can name this function anything you like
just for display purposes that I'm just
going to type function underscore name
and then we're gonna put in two
parentheses and like I told you guys in
the past whenever you're working with
the function the part or the little bit
that goes in between these two
parentheses is called an argument and
sometimes there are a few so sometimes
it's arguments not
mint and then we're gonna put in these
two curly braces and basically inside of
these curly braces this is where our
statements will go so basically the code
that you would like your function to
execute when it gets called will be over
here in the statements then we also have
a return value which we'll learn about
later on and not all functions need to
use them but sometimes they are useful
to have so we can use a return value
just keep that in mind okay so now we've
taken taking a look at the syntax for
how to use a function let's actually use
one let's actually make a function that
does something so I'm gonna make a very
simple function and I'm just gonna call
it display and the function that I'm
gonna use or make is not gonna use any
arguments so we'll just leave our
parentheses blank for now and as a
statement all I'm gonna do is make this
function echo something out so it's just
gonna display something in the browser
okay so let's just make it echo out I
was displayed by a function and of
course I'm not even going to use a
return value because we're just trying
to create a really simple function so
now when I go ahead and save this and go
back to Firefox and click refresh
nothing's happening so why is this well
this is because whenever we write code
inside a function the code in our
function is not automatically executed
when our browser runs or when the
browser loads so that makes a function
difference to code that is just outside
of a function which is stuff that we
have been working with in the past okay
so
a function will only execute when you
actually call the function and that is
obviously very useful because we can
have this function here and then call it
maybe 10 times
below this declaration so let's go ahead
and learn how to declare a function so
I'm just going to go ahead and say
display and that's basically all we need
to do is just write in the function name
which I'm getting from here obviously
and then just put in empty parentheses
because we do need those even though we
aren't using any arguments and now when
we save this and run this we should get
I was displayed by a function printed
out so congratulations you've just
created your first function in PHP and
obviously we will be making some more
useful functions in the next couple of
videos but for now that's all I'm going
to show you guys so thanks for watching
don't forget to subscribe please feel
free to leave a comment like or share
the video it's really gonna help my
channel grow and I will see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
