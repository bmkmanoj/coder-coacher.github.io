here and this is tutorial number 11 and
in this tutorial we are going to be
taking a look at some buttons so
something you guys may be aware of in
HTML is that we normally have three
different ways to create buttons but in
bootstrap we actually have four
different ways to create buttons so
we've got an a tag which let me go ahead
and start coding this out for you but we
can use an a tag to create a button so
we're gonna create a link that looks
like a button basically and I'm going to
give this a class of BTN and BTN -
defaults and I might as well copy this
now because I'm going to be using it a
couple times and I'm gonna give this an
H ref of just hash so I'll but now link
is not going to take us anywhere and I'm
going to close this link tag and just
close it over here as well and we will
type the word link so if I save this and
I jump over to our browser you can see
that I've got a link that actually looks
like a button because we've given it
this class and this is for when you want
to create a button that will link a user
to a different page where they can fill
in some information or something that's
where this is kind of useful then we've
also got a bunch of different other ways
which you guys should be aware of by now
and that is to create a button tag and
end off the button tag and give it the
exact same class of button or BTN and
BTN default and I'm going to just give
this some text of button and of course
that makes a button and because we're
using the exact same class over here the
buttons actually look exactly the same
so that's just the
default styling for a button in
bootstrap we can go ahead and show you
the next two ways to create buttons
which is with an input and both of these
next methods are going to be inputs so
the first input is going to be a type of
button and the second input is going to
be a type of submit so if I go ahead and
copy this and save that or paste that
and say submit then we've got a one
input with the type of button and one
input with the type of submit and I
might as well give each of these a value
as well so this is going to be input
button and this one is going to be a
submit whose value of submit okay and in
fact I think input buttons way too long
let's just make that input so go ahead
and save this now and I'll go back over
to the browser and hit refresh and you
can see we've got a link button we've
got a button that's made of the button
tag we've got our input button and we've
got a submit button which is also an
input so these two are more to be used
in forms this one is more to be used
like just to click on and run some Java
scripts to calculate something or
whatever you want to do if you want to
run a script you'll use one of these
buttons and yeah that's pretty much it's
pretty much what the uses for all of
those are but I want to show you a bunch
of other cool stuff that we can do with
this because we can apply bootstraps
contextual classes to these buttons and
by contextual classes I'm talking about
that primary danger success those
classes so let's go ahead and actually
just copy this row and I'm going to
paste this and the I'm actually getting
rid of the link and I'm going to get rid
of these other two so we're just going
to be you
the button tags um button default you've
kind of seen by now but I will leave it
over here anyways but I'm gonna I'm
going to paste this other line I think I
should do it about seven times so what's
that one two three four five six seven
cool a hand
I'll leave the first one default the
second one I'm going to say BTN primary
as the class and of course you guys can
pretty much guess what this is going to
do but I'm going to continue adding all
of the classes yes so success danger
warning info and the last line I'm going
to add is going to be BTN link so I'm
going to go ahead and hit save
and if I jump back over to the browser
and hit refresh you can see that now
I've got my default button then I've got
my primary button success button danger
button warning button info button and a
button that actually looks like a link
so this is kind of weird like we've got
a link over here that looks like a
button and then we've got a button over
here that looks like a link but
bootstrap just kind of gave us this
functionality so that if you ever want a
button to look like a link you can go
ahead and do that or if you ever want a
link to look like a button you can go
ahead and do that as well so it's up to
you to decide where you want to use them
but I'm just going to let you know that
the option of using them like that is
there okay so we've got our buttons now
let's take a look at button sizes
because something else we can do in
bootstrap is actually make our buttons
bigger or smaller using certain classes
and I'm actually feeling kind of lazy I
don't really want to make a new row but
yeah let's just go ahead and do it
anyways and I'm going to maybe just get
rid of all of the stuff and use just the
default button
and that's going to be the default size
then we also need one for Beatty and
lodge so if I add the class BTN - LG
that stands for button lodge and that's
going to make this button even bigger
than the default and then I can also go
ahead and add another class over here
which is going to be BTN - MSM just like
that and that's going to make this
button small so it's going to be smaller
than the default and we've got one lost
button size to work with which is BTN -
X s and that's button extra small which
obviously is the smallest version of our
buttons so if I come back here and hit
refresh you can see that now I've got a
kind of normal button a really big
button a smaller button and you can see
how that is actually smaller than that
and then we've got an extra small button
which is obviously the smallest button
here
okay so we've also got the option of
making different size buttons for
different sized screens although for SEO
purposes and stuff I actually know that
the bigger the button the better well
not really but in a way so the default
button I think is kind of works fine
across all platforms there's no need to
change the size but if you really want
to change the size of the button the
option is available okay and that's all
I have to talk to you guys about buttons
so yeah I will see you guys next time
