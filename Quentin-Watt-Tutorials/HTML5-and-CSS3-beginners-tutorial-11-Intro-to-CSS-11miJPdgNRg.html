here and welcome back to tutorial number
11 and in this tutorial we are finally
going to start learning some CSS so just
in case you forgot CSS is the language
we use to make our websites look pretty
so in other words we'll use CSS to
change the color or the background color
of our text or our elements and we'll
probably use CSS to add in some
background images or borders and all
those kinds of things so let's just
first take a look at how to use some
really basic CSS and over the next few
tutorials we're probably going to learn
all the cool stuff as well okay now
there are three different ways to use
style sheets on your web page okay and
the first method is called inline
styling now this is when you take a
style attribute and you put it within
the HTML tag on your web page okay so
right now I have got three tags in my
body I've got a header and two
paragraphs so my website currently looks
like this okay but let's see if we can
get these paragraphs to turn blue
okay now the way we do that with inline
styling is we go ahead we put in a style
attribute and then we have to set that
equal to a specific CSS rule okay so
that rule basically me basically needs a
property so the property that we are
going to be working with is the color so
basically the property is what do you
want to change about this element okay
and there are tons and tons of
properties that we will learn about but
for now you can you guys can know that
color is one of them okay and then you
need to put in colon and a value of what
you want to change that color to or that
property to
okay so in this case we want to change
the color to blue now when we go ahead
and save this and go back to firefox and
click refresh you can see that our first
paragraph that says i'm blue is now blue
so that's pretty cool okay and if we go
back here we can use inline styling
again to go ahead and change that
paragraph as well okay so let's go ahead
and click refresh and now this one is
blue as well okay but that can obviously
get a little bit messy because that
means that every time we want to change
a paragraph to blue we have to use the
style tag and then that CSS rule and can
you imagine how messy it would be if
every single one of our tags had to use
this style attribute it's kind of a
waste of space really okay so there is a
much much better way of using CSS if you
want to change multiple elements okay
and that is by using something called an
internal stylesheet okay so to use an
internal stylesheet you have to go ahead
and put in one of these style tags in
the head of your document and then
you're going to have to go ahead and end
it off as well and you should probably
just give this an attribute of text
slash CSS okay
now this used to be necessary in older
HTML but in html5 it's not actually
necessary but it's probably still good
to have as an attribute okay so now what
we need to do is we need to use CSS a
little bit differently okay we're still
going to have to use the property and
the value which I spoke to you guys
about before but we also have to you
use something new this time called a
selector okay and a selector is
basically how we tell HTML what we're
trying to style okay so let's say I
wanted to style all of the paragraphs on
my web page then I can select all of the
paragraphs by their element name okay
and a paragraph element name like you
guys can see here is just a P so if I go
ahead and put in a P over here and then
I put in two curly braces just to say
that this is where my styling for the
paragraphs is going to start and this is
where it's going to end okay now I can
go ahead and change one of the
properties of my paragraph which is
color and I can set that equal to blue
and then I just need to end that off
with a semicolon
every CSS rule has to be ended off with
a CH a semicolon okay so let's go ahead
and save that now and now when we click
refresh you can see that our paragraphs
are still blue so let's actually go
ahead and just change this out so it
looks a little bit different well
actually put the word red there and now
I want to click refresh our paragraphs
are indeed red okay and we can actually
use this for lots and lots of different
elements on our webpage so we can go
ahead and say okay well let's change all
the heading ones on our page and all we
need to do is set those equal to
something so let's go ahead and change
the background color so this is also a
property in CSS and we'll change the
background color of all our headers to
yellow and now when we go ahead and save
this and click refresh now the
background of our header so as you can
see I had actually takes up the whole
page but the background of our header is
indeed yellow
so that's quite awesome and that's
pretty much all I have for you guys in
this video so what we have learned so
far is how to use inline styling and
we've also learned how to use something
called an internal style sheet okay but
in the next video I'm going to show you
guys something called an external style
sheet which will help you if you want a
style more than one web page at a time
then you just include that external
style sheet with one line of code and
you can style like all the way all the
web pages on your website with one style
sheet so I'm going to show you guys how
to do that
in the next tutorial but don't forget to
subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share the video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
