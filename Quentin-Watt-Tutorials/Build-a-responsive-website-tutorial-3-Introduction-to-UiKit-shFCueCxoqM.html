here and welcome to this tutorial on how
to build a website from start to finish
and in this video we're actually going
to be taking a look at some of the tasks
I set up in the previous video so one of
the tasks that we have set up here under
the planning phase is to do some
research on UI kits because UI kit is a
technology that I want to use for this
tutorial and it's a pretty awesome
front-end framework so if you guys don't
know what a front-end framework is then
basically the best example I can give
you guys is bootstrap bootstrap is a
front-end framework and UI kit is very
very similar although I think bootstrap
if you had to compare bootstrap and UI
kit UI kit is kind of like bootstrap on
steroids there is a lot of really
awesome functionality that is in UI kits
that just isn't really available in
bootstrap or isn't even available in
some other front-end frameworks that I
know of like google has materialized CSS
which is also a pretty good front-end
framework but I don't think it has
anywhere near the same functionality
that UI kit does so let's go over to UI
kits website which is get UI kits calm
and if you guys go to this website
you're gonna see this little beta symbol
next to the logo and that's because UI
kit has UI kit version 3 right now so
right down here at the bottom you see it
says version 3 and unfortunately this is
still in beta which means it's not
finished yet and because it's not
finished yet there's a lot of
functionality that's in UI kit 3 or
that's supposed to be in UI kit 3 that
isn't actually available to us just yet
so unfortunately UI kit 3 is not what
we're gonna be using for this tutorial
series just because well yeah it's not
finished yet but what I would like to do
is use UI kit 2 so go ahead and click on
that link in the bottom of the website
over here and this is very very very
important right click on this link
because if you don't if you don't use UI
kit 2 and you instead decide to use UI
kit 3 there's a lot of stuff that's not
going to be available your tutorials are
probably not gonna work and you're gonna
leave some comments below my vid
you're saying that your tutorials are
not working so yeah just make sure that
you use UIKit - in fact I'm going to
leave the link to UIKit - in the video
description below so that you guys go
directly to uikit - but yeah from UIKit
- you can see that you've got the option
to download it and it's got some other
information about the features and
what's available but I'll let you guys
read that when you have time but for now
let's go over to the get started tab and
this is obviously gonna explain to you
guys how to download UI kit and
implement it on your site it works very
much the same way as bootstrap actually
so you can just click the download
button download the code and if you
scroll slightly further down the page
you can see an example of how it's
supposed to be implemented so pretty
much exactly the same as bootstrap you
link to the CSS and then you also make
sure that you've included jQuery and
then you can also link to UIKit and
that's going to allow you to make use of
all these really cool slideshows and
things that UI kit has available - to us
right you can also use a CDN so
basically here are some links to UI kit
in a CDN unfortunately you can't just
copy and post paste these links because
they have X's where the version number
should be I feel like somebody should be
updating that instead of leaving X's
there but you know oh well right now
something else that you will find
interesting about UI kit is they have
their own video tutorials available so
if you guys are ever struggling to
follow along with one of my videos you
can watch some of their videos and see
basically how to actually get UI kit
working as well but yeah once you've
gone through with their videos you can
come back to my videos and learn how to
actually build a project with this so
let's go over to the core tab here and
yeah the core tab obviously is gonna
tell us or the core menu item it's gonna
tell us what we can actually do with UI
kits so yeah in the core it's basically
just speaking about breakpoints because
of course uikit is responsive i mean it
wouldn't be a front-end framework or a
modern front-end framework if it wasn't
and yeah there's some other information
here if you want to go ahead and read
through all of that but I just want to
important to point out some of the
important bits so one of the important
bits is definitely the grid so if you
have used bootstrap in the past then
you'll know that you can make columns
using bootstrap so Col md6 would allow
you to have two columns that take up
half a screen itch if you did call em d3
you could have four columns that took up
three
columns each basically but four columns
next to each other on a page right so
uikit has a similar kind of
functionality except the classes have
slightly different names and they work
kind of like a fraction does so you've
got UK with one of one which will take
up the whole screen or UK with one of
two which takes up half the screen so
one of two half the screen right UK with
one of three and so on and so forth and
so here are some examples of that being
laid out so one of three each one of
these takes up one third one of two each
one of these takes up 1/2 and then you
can also just like now put together some
of the fractions so 3 of 10 and 7 of 10
kind of makes a small side bar and then
a main section and yeah pretty useful
stuff very easy to use and I recommend
checking it out when you can but yeah
just read up about this if you have some
time I'm not gonna focus too much on
this right now because I want to
highlight some of the really important
things about UI kit so if we take a look
at the block section and the panel
section these are some CSS
functionalities that we have available
to us in UI kits so we've got this
primary block over here and then we've
got a secondary block and so on very
nice for being able to create layouts
and we're definitely gonna be using this
functionality in my tutorial series so
remember the class UK block because I'm
probably going to be using that quite a
bit right but if we scroll a little bit
further down
Paige there's obviously some navigation
setups with me which make navigation a
little bit easier as well and we all be
taking a look at this and I will
definitely explain this in more detail
later on in the tutorial series but yeah
basically we have some nav bar options
here and then if we scroll all the way
down to the bottom to some of the
JavaScript options you can see that
we've got something called a scroll spy
or a scroll speed and yeah this
basically watches for as your page
Scrolls and then make some animations so
if you look at the bottom of the screen
over here as I scroll you can see some
of these things start sliding up and
sliding to the right or fading in and
yeah these are really cool animations to
have in fact if we scroll a little bit
further down you can have a whole bunch
of them fade in over time so with a
slight delay and yeah we're probably
gonna try makeup find a way to use this
in my tutorial series so that's cool and
one of the other things that I want to
show you guys that's really cool and
something that we're definitely going to
be using is under the components tab
there are things like slideshows and
parallax effects so the slideshow is
quite interesting because if we scroll
past this first slideshow down to the
next one this one is actually functional
and yeah it's very easy to implement
very easy to use it's just kind of
throwing in this code onto our page now
here's the big difference right is UIKit
2 currently has a working slideshow
whereas if you went over to UIKit 3 and
you click the getting started page and
you looked for a slideshow over here
let's go over to components you'll
probably find there isn't even a setting
for slideshow so yeah oh wait there we
go let's see here it is but I don't
think they actually have a working one
set up just yet so yeah this literally
wasn't even here a couple weeks ago so
this is obviously a new updates to their
beta
version and yeah they used to have the
slide nav which was available and the
slide show wasn't actually working for
quite some time but I see they have
updated this but like I said it's
currently in beta so some of the stuff
that wasn't even working about a month
ago is now working going back to UI kit
2 there are a few other features that
are here that are in quite interesting
so there is a sticky nav item or a
sticky diff so basically like you can
have it once you scroll up to a menu or
a div that it becomes sticky and it
sticks to the top of the browser as you
can see and then you can have others
that stick a certain distance from the
top or one that only starts sticking off
the you've scrolled 100 pixels past it
so right now it's not sticking but as
soon as you scroll there we go it's
stuck so yeah a whole bunch of really
cool settings available in UI kit and
we're gonna try and make use of a lot of
these in our in the tutorial series and
