here and welcome to tutorial number nine
and in this tutorial I wanted to show
you guys how do you make custom error
pages using cPanel so error pages are
probably hit more often than you might
think and one of the errors that is very
common is a 404 error so let me show you
guys just what that is so I'm going to
go over to my domain which is the domain
above for the series Josie cocom and if
I try to visit a page that doesn't exist
like let's go to forward slash not exist
dot HTML this is a file that is not on
my server and to prove that I mean
here's my file manager we've got another
page we've got index we don't have a
page called not exist so I'm going to
hit enter and you can see that I've got
a not found error additionally a 404 so
that is the code for this error file not
found was encountered so yeah this is
not a very friendly 404 page I mean
we're telling the user hey the file you
try to find doesn't exist but you know
who cares we're not linking back to our
home page so it's not friendly and you
know the page doesn't look very pretty
there's no styling applied to this so
you might want to style the page a
little bit and I thought a good example
of a 404 page would be get tabs 404 page
and it's kind of funny so take a look
and laugh but 404 this is not the page
you were looking for so if you're a star
Wars fan you'll totally get the joke and
yeah this is quite funny so this is a
good example of what a 404 page should
be like because you're letting them know
that this is a 404 but you're including
a search so that they can search the
rest of your site you're also including
a link back to the home page and there's
links to support and so on
now the search is kind of
an advanced feature it's not something
that we can take care of in cPanel but
we can certainly take care of links back
to the home page and adding an image not
really a moving parallax image but an
image so yeah let's jump back over the
cPanel and I'm gonna scroll all the way
down to the Advanced tab and I've got a
link to go to the arrow pages so let's
click on that and here is where I get to
edit error pages so first step one is
that I pick a domain and I'm just going
to use the main domain because we don't
have an error page for that this is also
a subdomain that I created earlier on in
the series if you guys don't have a
second option showing up then that's why
so yeah now step two is to create custom
error pages and here are the common
error pages these are the ones that are
hit all the time and 404 is one over
here that you can see and then there's a
whole bunch of other errors if you click
on that tab so you might want to take
care of all of these but if you're too
lazy to take care of all of them you
should definitely take care of the
common error pages that are hits very
often so to do that we need to just
click on this link so I'm going to click
on the 404 link and you can see that
over here I have an editor but even
above that you can see that this is
going to generate a file called 404s
HTML so because this is going to be an S
HTML file I could go over to my notepad
and copy whatever code that I had for
some of my other pages and I can use any
CSS files that were here you know right
now I'd have any CSS in here but any CSS
files that were here would be allowed to
be used to add styling and so yeah I
would just copy that and paste it in at
the top of the page and yeah you can see
I've got a little bit of a funny error
over there
text editors confusing me because it
thinks that we're quoting something
anyway yeah you might want to just
include these CSS files and style the
page and make it look appropriate
additionally you could delete the
content that's in yet and start adding a
tag so the referring URL or the
requested URL the URL that you were
looking for could not be found
be found and then we could look at
redirecting and so on but I would
actually just add a link to the home
page
so let's space this out I'm going to say
visit wow I cannot type visit our home
page and I want to make that a link so
let's end the a tag off and start the a
tag with href is equal to and I'm just
going to set this equal to my home page
which is Josie Corp com might as well
put in the whole HTTP slash slash wWOZ
cocom and then if they click this link
it should go back to my home page so
let's hit save and now that I've saved
that you can see it created a file
called 404 dot s HTML and if I go back
to my file manager and I hit reload you
can see that we've got this new file
here called 404s HTML and if I come back
here and hit enter you can see that now
I've got a page showing up and it's
given me an error not exist that HTML
could not be found visit our home page
now this is not again a very good page
but that just shows you how to edit the
page and you can go through my HTML
tutorials and learn how to style and
format things correctly and you can make
it look a lot better and then I would
suggest you go ahead and do that with
all of the commonly found arrow page
like the server 500 error and the 403
and so on one last thing I wanted to
mention as well is if you wanted to
create a search kind of like this one
then that might depend on the system
you're using because if you're using a
system like WordPress then they've got a
templating system that has its own way
of making 404 pages especially depending
on the framework you're using so yeah
then you could maybe include a search
and so on but if you're using just
custom or static HTML then you adding a
search and things like a login are you
way out of scope of the cPanel series
but if you were using another system
that could handle that then you could go
ahead and add things like that in there
and yeah that is all I have for you guys
