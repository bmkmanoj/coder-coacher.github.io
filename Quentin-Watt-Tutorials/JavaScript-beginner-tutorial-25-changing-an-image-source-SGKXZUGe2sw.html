here and welcome to tutorial number 25
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to change images on your
website so if you can remember from our
previous tutorial I showed you guys how
to use the document dot get element by
ID method which is a pretty useful
method because they named it exactly
what it does
so no confusion there and what it does
is it searches our website for an
element with an ID and then we can use
that element and change certain
properties of it so we're going to be
doing pretty much the same thing in this
tutorial except we're going to change
the image source so the first thing we
have to do is we actually need to have
two images so that we can like swap one
with the other
okay so fortunately for me I went ahead
and I prepared this so this is the file
we working in at the moment and inside
the same folder I've got this Facebook
logo and this Twitter logo okay and what
we're going to do now is we just need to
add one of these on to our web page so
I'm going to go down here to my body and
I'm going to add in an image tag and the
source of that we can start off as
Facebook dot PNG and then we need to
give it a few other attributes so you
guys might know that you have to have an
alt attribute with an image and we can
just set that equal to something like
social logo now this alt attribute
actually only shows up if the image
fails to load so if the compute computer
couldn't find the image then that's
that's what shows just these words
social logo okay then what I'm going to
do is give my image and ID because we
can't use our get elements by ID
if there is no ID so let's go ahead and
give an idea of social and then I'll
quickly go ahead and give my image one
last attribute and that is going to be
unclick okay so this is going to be a
function that I'm going to call so I'm
going to call this function change and
this will be whenever I click the image
I want this code to run so I'm going to
call this function call change which I
haven't made yet by the way okay and
that's what we're actually going to do
now so what we need to do is we first
need to declare this function so I'm
going to go ahead and say function
change and then we'll put in our code
block over there
and over here this is where we're going
to put all the code to change this image
so as you guys know the first thing we
need to do is I'm going to make a new
variable and I'm going to call it image
and I'm going to set this equal to
document dot get element by ID okay and
then I'm going to grab this image which
has the ID of social so go ahead and
copy and paste that and now we are free
to work with this image as the image
variable okay so what I can do now is I
can to select my image or I can refer to
my image as the image variable and then
I'm going to change the source attribute
so you guys know all the source property
and you guys know that to change in a
property I have to append that on with a
full stop so image dot source is how I'm
going to change the source of this image
and then I will set that equal to
Twitter dot T which
is the name of my Twitter logo so now if
I run this in Firefox you can see that
when I click on this image it changes to
the Twitter logo
okay so let's refresh it again we
started off with the Facebook logo and
when I clicked on it it turned in to the
Twitter logo okay so what we did was we
dynamically change the source attribute
or the source property of our image but
I think we can go ahead and do a lot
more than that because if you take a
look at this now once it's turned into
the Twitter image and I click on it
nothing happens so I can't change it
back to the Facebook logo unless I
actually refresh my page so let's go
ahead and make it that when I click this
Facebook image it changes to the Twitter
image and then when I click this Twitter
image it will change back to Facebook
and when I click on that it'll change
back to Twitter and so on and so on
so what I need to do that is I'm gonna
have to create some kind of an if
statement but let me show you guys
something first okay and what I want to
do now is I just want to alert something
else I'm going to let out our image
source okay because even though when we
put in our image source on the image
over here I'm kind of taking a shortcut
and because my pictures are in the same
folder as my HTML file then I can just
refer to my image as a the image name
and then dot whatever the file name is
but that's kind of a shortcut and this
isn't how the computer sees this image
the computer doesn't see it as Facebook
pin okay it actually sees it as this
really long file path so if you go back
to Firefox now and click refresh when I
click this image okay I've got an alert
box
and what it did was it alerted out the
source or the image source that the
computer sees so we just typed in this
last part yet Facebook ping if you take
a look at that but the computer sees the
entire file path so it sees see : uses
administrator that all that stuff until
it finally gets to the folder and with
my Facebook logo inside okay so I can't
use that as a condition but what I can
use as a condition is my own variable to
track the images so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm going to make a variable and
I'm going to call it image tracker okay
and I will set that equal to F for now
because we start off with our image as
the Facebook logo so we'll start off
with our variable as F for Facebook okay
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an if statement with this
variable as the condition so if image
tracker is equal to F then obviously
that means the Facebook logo is showing
and we need to show the Twitter logo so
then I can go ahead and say image source
and I can set that equal to Twitter dot
PNG okay so that's what would happen if
the Facebook logo is showing but if the
Facebook logo isn't showing the only
other option is that the Twitter logo
must be showing so in that case I need
to set my image source to Facebook okay
Facebook dot PNG okay and now that means
that our Facebook logo will show but
here's the thing and I'm actually
leaving out something very important we
need to update our image tracker so that
it will tell us which image is showing
okay
so once we've changed our image to
Twitter dot PNG we need to update our
image tracker and make sure that that
tells us that the Twitter image is
showing so now we'll set it to T for
Twitter and over here we just need to
update this back again to Facebook so
image tracker equals F okay so now what
happens is every time I click on the
image then JavaScript is going to run
this function so I'll click on this
image and then it's going to run this
function change and what change is going
to do is it's going to grab our variable
or our image over here and then it's
going to check if image track is equal
to F that means the Facebook logo is
showing so I'm going to show the Twitter
logo instead and I'm going to keep track
of which logo I'm showing by just
changing the image tracker to T and if
tracker is not equal to F so if it's not
equal to F the only other letter it can
be equal to is T so if it's not equal to
F I'm going to show the Facebook logo
because that means Twitter must have
been showing before so now I'm going to
change it to the Facebook logo and then
I'm going to set the image tracker to F
because now it's Facebook showing so
image tracker must be if okay so when we
go ahead and we refresh this in Firefox
you can see we've got the Facebook logo
at first but when I click on it it
changes to Twitter and when I click on
it again it changes back to Facebook and
when I click on it again back to Twitter
and I can carry on going forever okay so
