in here and welcome to tutorial number
17 and in this tutorial we are moving on
from building our website header
finally so let's go ahead and just move
that over to the testing on quality
control column and definitely we'll take
a look at this towards the end of the
build maybe just get one of our friends
or another one of our colleagues to test
the header but for now there are some
actual changes that I did between the
previous tutorial and this one so one
thing I did do was I added in my
services page and my Contact Us page so
if you jump through the menu now all of
the pages are there and they're working
the code for them right now is exactly
the same as the home page and the about
page so all I did was just copy all of
this over and change the page IDs and
then also I've got all of those page ID
set up in our menu exactly like I showed
you in the previous video but for now
let's move on to actually building our
website footer because that is our next
task so taking a look at a son over here
building our website footer is the next
thing I have going for us and the first
thing I want to do before I actually get
all into this bold is just take a look
at this in Photoshop and take a look at
my design fortunately I designed a
really really simple footer so on the
home page I just kind of want social
media links to the right oh yeah to the
left and copyright information to the
right and then hmm where did my father
go there it is ahaha
must have just worked his way off the
page somehow let's see there we go
that's why hmm just put that back in
position again right and so for my
mobile design essentially what I want to
do here is have my social media links on
the top and then my copyright
information on the bottom so that now I
know morally
what I'm looking for here let's let's
start coding this so I'm gonna jump over
to my text editor and the great thing
about this is we already have included
our footer across all of the pages so
we've got this include file setup all I
need to do now is open that for a file
and you can see I've already left the
comment here to say footer will go here
so we're gonna make sure that our footer
is above the JavaScript links here and
yeah
all I need to do now is start building
in my footer so let's let's let's not
use a div here let's let's use a footer
tag right and anything that I add into
this footer so let's just do a test
should actually start displaying across
all of our pages so if I'm on the home
page here we have the test about page so
anything that I add to this file is now
going to be on all of these pages which
is awesome so we only have to build the
foot at once and yeah instead of using
tests let's actually use some code that
makes a little bit of sense so what I'd
like to do here is use the exact same
code that I have on my home page right
now and we're gonna paste that in for
the footer so we're using the UK block
and UK block secondary classes so if you
guys are unsure of what they do or what
that does jump back over to your browser
go over to get UIKit just come or yeah
and then just take a look at the block
section here so a default block is gray
or sometimes grey the primary block is
whatever primary color you've chosen and
then you've got a secondary block which
is whatever secondary block you've
chosen something else that is gonna come
in handy is this UK contrast class so
I'm going to just copy that class and
paste that in here and what this is
gonna do the way that I've set up my my
file is it's going to turn all of the
text white
which is actually what we wanted for our
Photoshop design as well we wanted
everything to be white so let's jump
back over to my code over here and save
that with the UK contrast class as white
the next thing I want to do is create
another div in here and the reason why
I'm doing that is because if we look at
our design our footer is within a
container so that's exactly what I'd
like to do here is just create a class
with the class UK container and then UK
- container
- Center so that it senses my container
if this isn't here of course your
content is going to appear all the way
to the left instead of in the center and
then I'd like to make use of something
that is on get UI kits website if you go
over to the grid component essentially
what we'd like to do here is we'd like
to split our footer up into two parts so
we want one part that is left-aligned
that's half the screen and we want
another part that is right aligned
that's the other half of the screen and
that is of course going to make our
footer so that's the one half and that's
the other half right it's the way we do
this is if you take a look at UI kits
example code you use a UK grid div just
surrounding everything and then you can
use whatever classes you'd like or
whatever one of these classes you'd like
in the middle over there so UK with one
of two is going to give you half a
screen and half a screen if you do three
and ten and seven and ten you've
obviously got 30% and 70% or blocks that
take up 30% and 70% so I'm just going to
copy all of this and we can paste that
in here right and I know I'm doing a lot
of copy pasting but it's just
fortunately the documentation is that
good and also everything I've planned it
seems to line up with documentation
quite well and now what I'd like to do
here is obviously put in the follow us
text so for our social media and then
obviously we're gonna put our links in
there and then for the next part we're
also going to put in a copyright info so
I'm gonna type and copy semicolon and if
you guys are unsure of what this does
this creates a copyright symbol this is
actually HTML notation for a copyright
symbol and thanks Java I don't really
want to do an update right now I'm in
the middle of a tutorial please don't
bug me and yeah now we can create our
copyright so let's just put in the
copyright information here which I
believe in Photoshop I put copyright
link travel 2017 so let's just type that
in here link travel 2017 and then for
the follow us info I think it's actually
just gonna be better if we not trying to
have this div or these divs all on one
line let's just set up our code right so
for the follow us link what I'd like to
do here is obviously create a link
that's going to link to social media so
we'll set that equal to hash for now and
we'll in that link off and then I want
to create an icon so we're going to be
using the eye tags and we'll give this a
class of UK - icon - let's see Twitter I
think was first and then we can just
copy this and paste that down a couple
times and one can be Facebook and the
other one can be YouTube - play right
and I think Facebook Facebook - square
might give me a square Facebook icon
although that's actually not what I used
in my design so let's let's stick to the
stuff I have in my design
and let's save this now and jump back
over to my browser and refresh and
hopefully right now you should have a
footer that kind of looks like mine but
to be honest it is kind of distracting
that we've got this stuff on the
homepage that basically makes our foot
look a little bit bigger than it's
supposed to so let's go over to our
index file and instead of using UK block
secondary here let's just change this to
UK block primary we are also going to
replace this text later on but for now
just so that we can see the difference
between our footer and header let's come
back here and refresh and there we go
this is our actually a footer that's our
page content the blue section and there
is our header so something else I need
to do here is make sure that all of this
text aligns to the right because that's
what I have set up in my design is that
this text should align to the right so
let's jump back over to my text editor
here and the footer file and if I go
over to this div I can just add in the
class UK text - right and this is a
class that I mean if you're wondering
where I got it from it's somewhere on on
UI kits website I think it might be
under utility now let's say let's see
yeah UK - Tech text Center and UK text
right these these classes are just here
for alignment so if you guys are ever
wanting to learn how to align stuff or
you know you want to check out some
stuff on their website
yeah it's go ahead and do that right but
I kind of know their website really well
right now so yeah UK text right in this
file if I save it should align this text
to the right so let's come back here and
and tada we now have our foot a pretty
much set up correctly I think the only
difference between the footer that we
have now and basically what we've got
going on in our design here is okay the
font weight is different but the font
weight is also different for our menus
so I think the fonts are something I'm
going to sort out a little bit later but
for now
to fix to fix the spacing basically
we've got too much padding see here
we've got a very little amount of
padding and on our website over here
we've got a lot of padding so I just
like to bring that padding down so I'm
going to open up my custom CSS file here
and let's create a class called TM
footer and then I'm going to just
decrease my padding here so let's give
the Pat this padding padding top of 20
let's do 20 pixels and padding bottom of
20 pixels and now all I need to do is
take this class
copy that make sure I save this file
before I leave and put that class on our
footer tag so essentially on this footer
tag over here TM forum and in fact just
to keep things tidy maybe we can put it
as the first class now the reason why
I've called this TM footer is because
we're gonna differentiate between our
code and UI kits code and I think if you
use TM this in my head stands for theme
footer so this is my custom theme for a
whole custom theme for the code I'm just
making sure that I've saved this and
this and let's jump back over to the
browser now and refresh
and it looks like our padding is not
getting any less for some reason so
let's inspect elements and figure out
why so there's the TM for the class it's
here we've got some code UIKit UK block
hmm UK padding right it looks like my
code hasn't actually pulled through here
at all
that's interesting
let's try add a little bit more CSS
weights to this so TM footer UK UK block
so any item that has both of these
classes let's let's reduce the padding
and let's see what happens are still not
let's just make sure that my custom CSS
file is loading here so that we've got
the CSS file fig over to sources CSS
custom CSS okay
so Google Chrome has cached this CSS
file and my changes haven't showed up so
I'm just gonna push shift command and
are and hopefully that has now loaded
the new code so we've cleared the cache
and now yeah our footer is looking much
much better it does look like this two
little padding now so maybe we should
change this to 25 and 25 and save this
now and let's refresh okay and that
that's looking much much better right so
now our footer has been set up correctly
