here and welcome to tutorial number four
in this PrestaShop series and in this
video I am going to show you guys how to
change certain administration settings
in PrestaShop so if you want to create
new employees or add new employees
change employee permissions or
permissions for people using PrestaShop
or even just change a few settings on
PrestaShop then yeah admin the
administration tab in PrestaShop allows
us to change all of these settings so if
you are logged in to PrestaShop go over
to administration and i'm going to show
you guys from preferences down I'm just
going to run through a bunch of this
stuff right so in preferences this is
just some preferences preferences for
our shop and you can see the first one
is automatically check for module
updates and of course I would always
leave that on because you don't want to
have out-of-date modules right you want
to know when the modules need updates
and then update them so I wouldn't turn
that off because just now like one of
your payment modules gets out of date
and then doesn't like one except money
or something anymore and then you can't
get paid serious issues right so I
wouldn't I wouldn't really fiddle with
any of these things but one of the
settings that I would change and this is
the probably the only setting I will
change here is the maximum size for a
downloadable product now the reason why
I say I would change that is if you are
selling downloadable goods let's say
it's a ebook or a downloadable video
series or something then 2 Meg's is not
much at all so you might want to just up
that a little bit depending on what
you're selling and what do you think
your upload size needs to be or download
downloadable size needs to be sorry but
other than that I wouldn't change
anything else so that is Preferences
done let's go over to quick access and
quick access
is for people who think they're going to
save 20 seconds by clicking on this link
instead of just logging in to press the
shop and doing it the proper way I guess
by just like going over to the menu and
choosing something so yeah basically
what you're able to do here is create a
link so if I hit add new you can give
the link a name and then you need to
grab a URL and paste it in here so your
URL is obviously this thing and you can
see by default if I go back to quick
access we have a quick link to create a
new product we also have a quick link to
create a new category but there are not
full URLs so they're probably not going
to work right now you might have to edit
these but yeah this is just useful for
if you have employees that maybe don't
know how to add a new product or they
don't know where the section is because
they haven't watched these videos then
you just send them this link and they're
going to be met with that add new
product page and all they have to do is
like upload the picture and fill in the
product information hit save and your
products in write so that's what quick
access is there for then we've got
employees and this is where things get
interesting because here is where we can
add more people to our store and manage
a few little permission issues and stuff
like that because obviously if you have
someone working on your shop dock they
could mess something up so you'll give
them a lower permission than you so you
can see right now I am the only user for
my shop my name is Quinton and I have a
profile of super admin and that means
that I have access or full access to
everything in my shop right so I get to
change administration settings which as
you know people with a lower access
level than me wouldn't be able to get
into administration at all then I can go
ahead and click on this little add-in
we tab over here and this is where I
would fill in new employees information
and passwords and stuff but I can also
give them a permission profile as well
so I could give a new person super admin
access but like I said if they have
super admin access they have access to
everything and you might know what
that's to happen so you might want to
give them like salesman access or
largest what's that logistician access
and or translate access one of those and
basically that just allows you to limit
the permissions a little bit so they
won't be able to like mess your store up
completely they just have access to I
think like a salesman will only have
access to products and certain things
like that and if you guys ever want to
see what permissions these profiles have
you can go over to permissions which is
also in this this menu over here and
permissions like like I said super admin
you cannot change any of their
permissions they have full access to
everything but then you've also got
logistician and salesman and translator
and you can see as I click on each one
of these sections we're changing all of
these little tick boxes over here so
salesman has access to products and
categories so they can view and add and
delete and edit products etc and they
can also view and add and edit and
delete orders and so on but if we go
over to translator a translator who only
has access to products and categories
and that's just to like translate
certain products into different
languages and that's all I need to do we
don't want them to do anything else
so yeah this is where you would be able
to see what permissions each one of
these profiles has but you can also add
new permissions so let's say I want my
salesman to have access to suppliers I
want
them to view the suppliers add and
delete suppliers but I don't want them
to be able to edit suppliers then I can
go ahead and just manage these these
settings or their permissions just like
that by taking the box and it's going to
save it and if I uncheck the box it's
going to save it again cool
so that is permissions and let's say for
some reason that having these four
accesses is not enough for you and you
want to make your own custom access
level then you can do that by going over
to profiles and if you just hit add new
you can create your own new permission
profile so like maybe and you don't have
a super admin but you have a like admin
account where people have more access
than a Salesman but less access than a
super admin you can go ahead and do
something like that but I'm just going
to go ahead and cancel and we can go
over to the next menu item over here
which is menus and to be honest I don't
think you guys are going to change
anything here but you will notice that
menus is you can see this menu over here
is actually this menu over here so
you're able to change your back-end menu
impress the shop and customize it to how
you would like it to be but like I said
I wouldn't really change anything here
because you might change the menu and
then you mess everyone else around
because now like customers is in a new
place it just doesn't make sense right
so I would leave it as is but if you
want to change it it's up to you
and then merchants expertise this is
kind of just where you get to see as a
PrestaShop user what you have
accomplished so SEO like that's a bad by
the way all the great art badges or
things that you haven't done and then
the green or colored badges or stuff you
have done or is stuff you have done so
yeah this is just like to make you feel
good about yourself and good about using
PrestaShop
like oh yeah I set up SEO friendly URLs
I'm awesome at PrestaShop so yeah
basically that's what it's there for
right and that is all I have for you in
this video so don't forget to subscribe

help my channel grow and I will see you
