here and welcome to tutorial number 14
and in this tutorial we are gonna take a
look at SEO in PrestaShop so I'm gonna
show you guys how to change some SEO
URLs and we're also going to take a look
at meta descriptions and keywords and
stuff like that so what you need to do
is log in to PrestaShop and go over to
the Preferences tab and then underneath
that you should have an SEO and URLs
menu option go ahead and click on that
and that is going to take you through to
a page with a list of all our pages
actually so these are all pages that are
on our site and I'm just gonna pick one
like manufacturer and I'm gonna hit edit
and here is where we can edit a few
settings for this specific page so
you'll see at the top we have a switcher
or a drop-down list and this just allows
us to switch between the different pages
that we have so if you want to quickly
switch between pages instead of going
back to the SEO and URLs page again you
can do that then we've got page title so
that is manufacturers we could change
that if we wanted to do something a
little bit more relevant although
manufacturers is pretty relevant because
it's a list of our manufacturers right
then we have a meta description so if
you guys want to go ahead and improve
your major description you can go ahead
and edit it over here then we have a
section for meta keywords so this can
help if you want to just target specific
keywords for this page I would go ahead
and add a list of all the manufacturers
names in here maybe or something like
that it really would be something that's
different for each one of you guys so
I'm not gonna fill anything in for now
and then we also have the option to
change the rewritten URL so this is the
URL that kind of shows up over here
after the domain name and you can edit
that for the manufacturers page over
here or
for anyone of the other pages if you
just swap through all of those and then
you can go ahead and hit save and it's
gonna save all your settings and you
know all of that is gonna be changed and
then we can go back to this page which I
was waiting for it to load that was kind
of awkward it took a little while so
yeah once you've edited all of those
page settings you can also scroll a
little bit further down and there is an
option for friendly URLs so you can go
ahead and leave that up yes because
obviously this is about SEO and if we
turn that to no it's gonna be an SEO DSE
ode so yeah SEO deoptimization turd URL
and as you can see if you hover over
this it enables you to allow accented
characters in the URLs this is something
that I guess you gotta be careful for
because there's special characters and
stuff that I don't think they'll break
the website but yeah just watch out and
then below that we also have a redirect
rule so this is if you've created pages
and then deleting them and then
recreating them you might want to leave
this on during the development phase to
302 redirects temporarily moved but once
the site goes live then you need to
change this to a 301 permanently moved
redirect it's just going to make sure
that robots like Google and stuff will
know that the site's or that specific
page has been deleted and been moved to
another location permanently basically
okay so now that we've taken care of
that domain names I think this is
something that's only going to be on the
cloud version of PrestaShop so if you
want to change a domain name or add a
new domain name you can go ahead and do
that here
it does say you will be redirected to
your PrestaShop account which is where
you signed up for a cloud version of
PrestaShop
if you are using a downloaded version
you won't need to worry about this
because your domain should already be
set with your host okay and then we have
the schema of URLs so this is kind of
how do you want your URLs to be
rewritten and by default this is
actually set up really well so if we go
over to this product this is just a
printed some address but if you look at
the URL we've got the category that the
dress is in which is some addresses and
then we've got the Product ID and then
we've got our product name itself so
that's all in the URL it's very friendly
for robots one thing that I did kind of
wonder was if I could remove this ID
because there are ecommerce platforms
out there that I have used in the past
where the ID is not part of the URL so I
wanted to remove that but if you do try
to remove this and save you're gonna get
an error so you can't actually have a
URL that doesn't have an eye the Product
ID in it so that's just one limitation
that PrestaShop has I don't know if
that's a good or a bad thing but yeah I
thought I thought I'd mention it and
yeah so if you want to change how any of
these URLs are rewritten you can go
ahead and do it here and then right at
the bottom we have a robots.txt file
that we can generate so if you just
click on the button over here in the
corner then that is going to allow
PrestaShop to rewrite the robots.txt
file as best as PrestaShop can and you
can see here it does say that it will
erase the old robots.txt file so if you
like manual eft peed into your files
change the SEO or change the robots.txt
file then you might want to download it
and re-upload it with your own manual
changes then okay so yeah those are
those settings all complete and talked
about now let's take a look at how to
SEO
individual products so for that you want
to go over to catalog and then go over
to our products I don't know how I
missed that the first time but yeah go
over to the products page and let's just
take a look at the printed summer dress
seeing as that's the page I have open at
the moment and I'm gonna hit edit and
this will be the same for every product
of course then go over to the SEO tab on
the side over here and then you'll see
we have the option of adding a meta
title and made the description and then
we've got our friendly URL which is
printed some address so let me just
change this to something else like
Quinton's oh wait i don't know if that's
gonna work with a comma Quinton's
printed summer dress and then let's add
a mate a title here of just Quinton's
title and description cool go ahead and
save and stay or safe now I'm just gonna
hit save and yeah once I've changed this
I just gotta wait for it to load and I
can go to the front end probably just
refresh this page when you're finished
loading one day cool let's just hit
refresh here - sorry my internet is
horrendous but yeah okay cool
so now this has loaded and you can see
that the URL has changed to Quinton's
printed some address with the product ID
before that and if I just go ahead and
inspect the element somewhere in the
head of our document I should have
there's my and a description so I just
need to look for the title and that's
over there as well so those are there
they're not visible to clients but they
are therefore search engines like Google
or Bing or whatever it is that's in inks
in your site just to help them know what
information is on this site and also let
them find out if the information on here
is relevant to the title that you've
given it so yeah that's all I have for
this tutorial and thanks for watching
