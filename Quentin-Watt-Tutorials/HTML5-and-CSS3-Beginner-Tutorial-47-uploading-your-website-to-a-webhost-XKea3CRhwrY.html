tutorial number 47 and this is the final
tutorial in the series so if you are
watching this video then congratulations
you made it you are now at the
intermediate stage in HTML so you
finally know how to do pretty much
everything there is to do in HTML and
CSS and what we can do now is you're
ready to start moving on to some sort of
client-side scripting like JavaScript
and we'll do some server-side scripting
tutorials like PHP later on so you know
thank you guys for for sticking through
with all the tutorials and now in this
tutorial we can finally put our website
live on the internet and the first thing
you obviously want to do to get started
with that is you're going to have to
purchase purchase some shared hosting so
you just need to go ahead and Google a
shared hosting company in your area so
for me I already actually have my shared
hosting company and the company that I
use is called a free host but go ahead
and just Google a web hosting in and
wherever you guys are if you're in
America go ahead and you know look for
someone there I think if you're in the
States you can use someone like
Hostgator or GoDaddy or something like
that those are all pretty good webs web
hosts but for me I want to pay I want to
work with guys here in South Africa you
know so that at least I can talk to them
on the phone one on one without paying
lots of charges and that kind of thing
so the company that I work with is a
free host and just because they're
actually like one of the best in sa so
that's why I work with them and what you
want to do is once you go onto your web
hosts sites you're just going to want to
look for their hosting packages so
every host as entry-level hosting over
here that's cheap hosting that's exactly
what we need for now because we're just
beginners or you're just beginning so go
ahead and look under shared hosting so
down here they've got this is the
cheapest package nine random month and
you get unlimited traffic and
everything's set up for free you get
quite a bit of storage a few email
accounts and you don't even have to
worry about SQL databases because you
guys don't know how to use those yet I
didn't show you so we can go ahead and
you see you can use PHP so yeah
basically this isn't the greatest
package in the world but you know if
you're just starting out and you just
want like a little website or place to
show all your friends your website and
stuff like that you just want to put it
live go ahead and buy a cheap package
like that that's fine so we can go ahead
and click sign up over there and now
what they're going to do is they're
going to ask us for quite a few details
so right now they're just telling me how
much it's going to cost
we can move over to the next step and
then they'll ask you to like if you're a
new client you probably have to sign up
and give them your details if you're an
existing client like I'm an existing
client so I can actually just quickly
log in so I'm just going to log in and
I'll be right back okay so I'm now
logged in and then obviously the next
step is domain details so I just have to
tell them what domain I want to buy and
they'll check if it's available for me
so I've actually already bought this
this domain I bought it the other day so
tech five.com and now it's checking to
see if the domain is taken or not and
it's actually going to come back taken
because like I said I already bought
this domain so there we go it's taken so
you'd have to look for one that's not
taken and it actually said check 5.0 za
is open so there we go
congratulations that's open and then we
could proceed to the final step which is
the payment
tails but I'm not going to click that
button because then you guys will see my
banking details and you already don't
need to do that so let's just go ahead
and leave that alone but like I said
I've actually already bought tech
five.com SOCOM so if you go over to WWII
oh wait I think I Borg no calm cool okay
so I bought dot-org
and here we have every hosts little
splash page with it which they've
designed which just is it's been
registered on behalf of a client blah
blah blah okay so all you can do now is
if you actually sign up for all the
stuff they probably emailed you some
login details so I've got my stuff set
up in chrome over here okay so I took a
look at my details and I logged into my
client zone which is something you guys
would obviously have to do and just so
you know your client zone would
obviously look different this is just
the one that every host made so that's
why it looks like this just because they
made it so yours might look different
but at some point you're going to have
to just log into something called a
cPanel now the your your web host or
your hosting company or shared hosting
company probably already sent you the
username and password for your cPanel in
your email so you might not have even
had access to a fancy what do you call
this client so in that every host offers
you might not have access to that you
might just get a username password that
logs you straight into something called
a cPanel and the cPanel is going to be
the same pretty much whatever web host
you're using if they use cPanel it's
going to look like this so you'll be
able to follow along quite well and what
we can do now is just it says welcome
new user blah blah blah I'm just going
to say
thanks I'm fine and now we have we've
got access to our cPanel and we can
actually upload a file onto our web page
so let's go ahead and I've already coded
a website over here and this website
just says oh yeah I'm live on the
Internet baby
so let's upload that file and what I'm
going to do I'm just going to go to my
file manager and you want to go to your
public FTP routes that's pretty much
where if someone goes to your website
that's the page they're going to want to
see so go to your public HTML and as you
can see there's already a index page
there at the moment and that index page
is what we saw in Firefox just now which
is this page here which is Tech 5 has
been registered on behalf of a client so
let's go ahead and delete that so go
ahead and just delete it yes I'm sure
when I delete it and now it's gone so
when I go back to Firefox and I actually
refresh this you can see we've now lost
that page it's gone and we're now at the
index off so we in our way in our file
and we can go into the CGI bin which if
you take a look at there's a folder
called CGI bin so we know that this is
in fact our file that we have to upload
our website into and I'm just going to
go ahead and just click this upload
button and I'll choose a file ok cool
let me look here tutorial no wrong
folder go to where was that file desktop
tutorial code and tutorial 47 cool
index.html cool so now our page
our little file has been uploaded if you
can see in the bottom corner and we go
just put that in there cool so that's up
and we can actually just go back here
and if we refresh we should see our page
over here now hmm okay under public dot
HTML okay so that we've got our
index.html text file and because we're
got this page open in Firefox wwt 500
we'll go ahead and refresh this now we
get our page it says oh yeah I am live
on the Internet baby so there we go guys
congratulations
if you've written installed your first
website and you've uploaded it now then
congratulations
