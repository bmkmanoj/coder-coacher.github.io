here and i just wanted to talk to you
guys about a few things that are
happening on my channel right now so you
guys will have noticed there have been a
few changes with the content and there
are going to be a few other changes
happening as well it's not like terribly
big changes but one thing that you guys
will have noticed already is that i'm
starting to do a lot more kind of sit
down videos where i'm sitting here on
the couch and talking to you and this is
because i'm trying to be a little bit
more interactive and a little bit more
conversational with you guys so i'm
looking to grow or build a more like
interactive audience where this becomes
more of a two-way conversation where I
get to sit and talk to you guys and I'll
look at the comments and you know
respond to those so it becomes more of a
two-way conversation but i don't i'm
only looking for a certain type of
interactivity right like I'm looking for
this to become more of a conversation
where as making the tutorials that was
very one way it was kind of just like me
telling you what to do and then people
would either say thanks and like that
was the conversation over or they let me
that know that they had a problem but
the problems that I see that people
leave on most of my videos is not
actually related to the torial tutorials
it's usually like something else and you
know I don't want to become free online
support like that is my biggest fear
right now is I don't want people to see
me as free online support and just like
hey let me dump my problem here and
Quinton will fix it so that's the kind
of thing I'm trying to shy away from but
I do want to be interactive in a in a
sense that I do want to talk to you guys
just I don't want people kind of using
me to fix their problems so that was the
first change right the second change is
that I want to be now I want to do most
of my videos over again so I've already
got the HTML series up twice it is the
best performing content on my channel
and sadly it is very low quality right
and that's because I didn't have high
quality equipment back then when I was
making those videos so now that I do
have a proper microphone and a camera
and all that kind of stuff I actually
want to redo oops my hair is always
messed up these days but I actually want
to redo those videos so I want to just
make them higher quality right because
right now they're really crappy quality
and the third difference that you guys
are going to start seeing in some of my
videos is that I've got a sponsor right
now and I've had to place some links in
some of my videos and on the about page
of my channel and you're also going to
see shout outs and some of my videos to
this new sponsor that I have and I did a
lot of thinking about this like I did
actually have a couple calls with them
and we exchanged a few emails I didn't
just jump into the first sponsor that
I've I was offered there are a bunch of
other guys who have spoken to me in the
past and I'm usually always turned them
down so this was the first time I
actually received like a reasonable kind
of sponsorship where you know these guys
are just they just want to get people to
their website right they just want you
guys to go and check out what you need
to do to get a job in web development
and I think it is very relative to a lot
of people now because I have a very
international audience and they're this
sponsor of mine is based in the u.s. I
think yeah it it's more convenient for
us people than it is for anybody else
but the sponsor is dev mountain so
you're going to see me shouting out or
setting
if you shout outs to them in the next
couple of videos and that's just because
well you know they're gonna help me make
my channel grow right like the the the
sponsorship just helps oh it puts me one
step closer to making videos full time
because that's something I wanted to do
for some time it's like I actually need
to choose between having a full-time job
or having YouTube full time because I
can't actually do both it's a little bit
of a struggle you usually don't have
time or you can't go out on weekends and
so having a sponsorship is a very big
step forward to actually doing YouTube
full time which means I can you know
maybe start studying again which is
something that I also want to do if
you've been following along with my vlog
channel you all know that so overly you
guys can be a little bit supportive
about that I do know that a lot of other
YouTube channels when they do pick up
sponsorships or when I do pick up like
some kind of paid ad placement the
viewers usually get kind of upset not
like a how you sell out um not like I'm
afraid that that happens here but you
know to anybody who does do that I think
it's kind of selfish in a way because
like this is a company that's choosing
to help me and the money that I get from
a sponsorship like that goes towards
helping the channel and it goes a big
way towards helping the channel in the
fact that it will motivate me to make
more videos which you know everybody
wants it's also going to help me with
the money that i need to buy equipment
and things like this and actually pay
for this the cost of making videos
because making videos is not free let me
tell you that making bad videos was
cheap or cheaper but making high quality
videos has become a little bit more
expensive and therefore I you know I
need to cover my costs in that way so
for anybody who does get old like oh you
set up like i like i said it is it is
very selfish in a sense because
means that you are I mean as the person
that's going on you sell out like you
aren't actually helping me as much as a
sponsorship would so to complain about
that kind of stuff would not be cool and
so I just want to end of this video by
sending a thank-you to some of my
positive followers some helpful
followers and I think this needs to
become a thing like I should send a
thank you to some of the positive and
helpful people every few videos or you
know once every month or something so
the first person i want to thank is
anger risky now Unga he hasn't actually
been around for too long I think he's
been I've been here for about six months
or so following me but he is a video
maker from the Philippines and he
regularly watches my content he
regularly leaves comments so you know
laughs this video has gone live you know
check the comments out he's probably
there but one of the great things about
this is he's also a video create or a
content creator so he also makes
tutorials and if you are from the
Philippines Philippines you will
probably be able to understand him a lot
more than I can because he does some
English videos but he's also got videos
in another language he's native language
from the Philippines not sure what that
language is called I should probably
find out though filipino under the
stress of the camera that seemed way too
easy yeah yeah I just you know want to
send a thank you Tim because he has been
a helpful follower of the past six
months then I also want to send a thank
you to the mall Krishna or Qureshi so
this is a follower of mine who has been
around for two years I mean can you
believe that probably one of the longest
followers that's still around today and
if I leave a make a facebook post or put
put something on Facebook she's one of
the first people to like or comment and
so it's really helpful engaging and
encouraging to see her having been here
for two years or not gotten bored of me
because I am NOT making new content so
small you know thank you and then vinay
kumar 7a has been around also not too
long but he regularly engages in some of
my content so if i put up a new facebook
post or he'll put up a new video he's
one of the first people to leave a
comment and you know that's that's
awesome thank you it's encouraging that
you're around and you're always here to
leave comments and talk back to me
that's awesome then I also want to send
a thank-you to Emily widths or Emily
vitz because you know some some people
pronounce the W as a V so emily has been
a fan for two years again that's a
really long time and she's still around
today like if i post a facebook comment
or if i post a video she is one of the
first people to watch she doesn't always
leave comments but she does like my
facebook posts I can't see who likes my
videos but I'm sure she's there too and
then shipped him shipped him value if
that's how you pronounce it you know
he's been a fan for one year which is is
cool and he hasn't like he has been
engaged but not as much as everybody
else but one thing that he did do which
I think he's just so cool is he made me
some fanart so i'll i'll put that up
over here somewhere and then i'll also
i'm gonna try put this on my website or
something and anybody else who wants to
make fanart for me if you want to send
that in i'll put that on my website and
yeah i think that's just it's so nice to
have people that actually went through
like the time and the effort to make
something for me that is just so cool so
thank you shepton sheesh yeah that is
kind of a difficult name too
when I look at it from English spelling
and the last person I want to thank is
Gary Ramirez now this guy is super cool
like I actually feel like I know him and
he seems more of a friend and less of a
follower just because you know he's been
around for two years he always leaves
comments he always oh he has sent me a
cup of private Facebook messages but he
always watches my videos and he's
actually sent me pictures of his whole
family so I'm gonna put a picture on
screen now but he's got his eldest son
Steven Miriam Erin and Timothy so
Stevens 18 Miriam's 15 Erin is 11 and
Timothy is 10 and at night they'll go
through my videos and actually all learn
together which I've got that picture of
it and it's just so cool to see that
like somebody's actually using my videos
in that way and it seems to be making a
positive difference a positive change
that was like that's nice for me to know
right so yeah just thanks Gary for
sending me that and also Timothy has
also sent me a video where he wanted he
told me he wanted to make tutorials and
I think that that video is just so cute
so I'm gonna if I can put it up I don't
know how to download videos from
facebook but if i can i'll put it up
here may be a deterrent yeah just thanks
to all of you guys thank you for
supporting me for all this time and to
anybody whose names I didn't mention but
you are also regularly engaged you know
like just keep keep commenting and keep
supporting me and I will make a thank
you message for you guys as well and
that is all I have for you in this video
so I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
