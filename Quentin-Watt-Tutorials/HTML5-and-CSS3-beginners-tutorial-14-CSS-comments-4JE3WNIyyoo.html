here and welcome back to tutorial number
fourteen and in this tutorial we are
going to talk about CSS comments okay so
of course CSS comments are used for the
same reason as comments in HTML they're
just there for you as the programmer or
the designer to see what your code was
there for okay it's just to leave notes
for yourself like why you wrote certain
code or just to help other people out
and I got a message here but we'll
ignore that okay so that's just
basically what CSS comments are used for
so let's go ahead and take a look at how
to use them okay so they're actually
really simple and if you guys are
wondering where this code comes from
this is just the code from the previous
tutorial it's just one paragraph and
then we change the fonts or whatever
okay so to change or to add comments to
CSS all you have to do is put in one of
those slashes and then a star and as you
can see everything kind of turns green
and that means that everything after
this is a comment until you reach a star
and another slash okay so basically this
means that our comment starts here and
then our comment ends here and
everything inside of this is now our
comments so we can say CSS from tutorial
13 I guess and that is our comment and
then like later on we could actually add
notes side notes to ourselves about
certain other things as well like for
instance this is font weight then font
style then font size and then family so
you could go ahead and say weight style
size and family so now we know what
order we were supposed to put
these values in when we're using this
font shortcut property okay
and that's actually all I have for you
guys in this video it's quite simple so
thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
