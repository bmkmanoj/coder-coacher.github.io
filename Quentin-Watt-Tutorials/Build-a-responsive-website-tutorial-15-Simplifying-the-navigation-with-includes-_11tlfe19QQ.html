and welcome to tutorial number 15 and in
this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys
something that is so so useful and yeah
if you guys are used to simply just
building websites in HTML and CSS and
you haven't actually built a language or
built a website using a server-side
language like PHP then this trick is
gonna absolutely blow your mind but
basically what we're gonna do is take
this header this all of this code for
this header so I mean if I take a look
at this in my text editor yeah I've got
all my files open yeah all of this code
from the start of the header all the way
down to the end of the header can be
simplified into just one line of code
and it means that we can take that one
line of code and put it on different
pages and our header will always update
and be the same across all pages which
obviously is very very useful because if
we take a look at our website right now
we've got a home page about Us page
services and contact and if I would ever
you know go over to the about page
normally what you would do with HTML is
you'd have to take all of this code copy
that over to the about page and then if
you wanted to change something in the
header you'd have to come over to index
dot PHP change the header go over to the
about page in another file change the
header and yeah if you have like 100
pages that can be really really
frustrating and really really annoying
it also means that you might miss one or
two pages but yeah the way I want to
show you guys how to do this it's all
gonna be one line of code
so let's actually get started but before
we get started I just want to show you
guys pretty much where your header
should be at this point in time so
basically we've got a header that looks
kind of like this and if I right-click
and inspect elements our website header
is also responsive so now we just have a
logo and the navigation is off canvas so
if I click on this little toggle button
we now show
our navigation or hide and show our
navigation so if you guys don't have
this code or if for some reason your
code is not working the same as mine you
can always go over to patreon.com slash
Quinn's and what and yeah if you take a
look at some of the posts that I'm
posting here you will be able to
download the code for these tutorials
you are gonna have to pledge $1 to
download the code but yeah it is going
towards helping me it is going towards
helping fund my videos so if you guys do
want to help me make more of these
videos and you do want to encourage free
learning for everybody else then that $1
really isn't that much to pledge so now
let's get started on actually
simplifying all of this code down to one
line and the first thing I want to do is
go over to my htdocs directory or my
htdocs folder here I'm gonna right-click
and create a new folder and we're gonna
call this includes and I suppose you
could call it anything you want
although includes kind of makes sense
for this because we're gonna be
including files and what I'd like to do
now is create a new file and we can save
this as header dot Inc dot PHP now the
first part of this name is absolutely
meaningless I mean you could call it
anything you wanted you could call it
table right but the reason why I've
decided to go or call it headed Inc dot
PHP is because that name kind of makes
sense so it has to be a PHP file of
course but heading just tells me that
this is our header and it is an include
because studing stands for includes so
that is just my naming convention but if
you don't want to stick to that naming
convention you can always change to
something else now let's hit save and
yeah now we have our header Inc dot PHP
file here but it is absolutely empty so
what I'd like to do is go to my index
file and let's copy all of the code
basically from the start header tag all
the way down to the end header tag so
I'm gonna go ahead and hit command X
that's gonna copy all of that and paste
that into my header file and I think
what I'd like to do here is just fix the
indenting a little bit so if you guys
don't know how to indent and sublime all
I'm doing is holding down command if
you're on Windows you probably gonna be
holding down ctrl and then you want to
hit the square brackets so one square
bracket goes one way and the other
square bracket goes the other way okay
and it's just fixed that okay so now we
have our header kind of set up in this
file now we can go over to our index
file and just add in one line of code so
what I'd like to do is add in some PHP
tags and then I'm going to inside of
this type the word include and then
we're gonna add in some quotation marks
and yeah what I'd like to do now is type
in the name of my folder that I created
which is includes so let's type in
includes and then we'll add in a slash
and then we're going to name the or type
in the name of our file which in this
case is header dot Inc dot PHP or
whatever you named your file right so
now let's hit save and ok it looks like
something is not right with my code ah
there we go okay it's just a head in
that little space right so now that
should have included our header onto our
page so if I come back over to Google
Chrome and let's take a look at our
website and hit refresh absolutely
nothing should change that is a good
thing it means that if nothing has
changed that our header has successfully
been included using this line of code if
we take that line of code out save this
and come back over to the browser and
refresh we should have no header so
let's go back here and save this and
what I'd like to do now is just show you
guys a little bit more where this is
useful because if you can see this this
other block that I've created here if I
just change this to
you have an h1 inside of it and I type
the word home and then I create another
new file over here so let's create about
dot PHP well actually let's hit command
s and save this as about dot PHP right I
can now take all of this code paste it
on about PHP but without the all of the
header code and now we can just change
the content on the page so we can change
something like the content on the page
to say about instead of home and if we
save this now and go back up to the
browser if i refresh the home page we
should now have the text home and our
menu and if I change my URL to be about
dot PHP we should now have the text
about and our menu but it does mean that
if I ever change my menu I don't have to
go over to the index file change the
menu go over to the bow page change the
menu all I need to do is go over to my
header dot PHP file and I can change
something like let's say I wanted this
link to say contact us instead of
contact and I wanted this one as well to
say contact us instead of contact well
then I can go ahead and do that
and if I jump back over to the browser
and refresh you can see that now we've
got contact us on the home I mean on the
about page and if we go over to the home
page let's just modify our URL there now
we're on the home page and it still says
contact us in the menu so any change you
make to this header dot PHP file is
going to change the menu on all of the
pages at one time and that is pretty
awesome because now it means that we can
go over to our index dot PHP file and
there's a few other things that we can
simplify down to one line of code as
well so basically in includes that PHP
let's create a new file here and let's
call this let's save it and call the
head dot ink ink dot PHP and yeah header
will be the websites header Butthead dot
PHP is going to be all of the stuff from
the head of our document so basically we
can copy and paste all of this stuff
into this file right and then
essentially do the same thing here so
let's create another PHP tag and say
include and then we'll include includes
head dot ink dot PHP and we're just
going to make sure I end off that PHP
tag right and I can do the exact same
thing - where's the about page we can
simplify all of this down to that one
line and then we can do the same thing
for our script tags as well so let's go
over to includes create a new file and
let's let's actually call this photo dot
PHP so I'm gonna hit command s and let's
save this as footer dot PHP or foot dot
Inc dot PHP and the reason why I'm
saying let's call it photo dot PHP is
because when we go get to building our
photo later on we can basically just
build our footer inside of this photo
file along with the script tags over
here so let's paste all of those in and
I think I'll just leave a note over here
to say what will go here in future right
and now we can essentially take that
exact same code here paste it and
instead of including headed up PHP let's
include photo in PHP and I can take this
same line of code and put it on the
about page as well and so now what it
means is anytime I change something
in this head file it will change across
all of the pages on our site
anytime I change something in this
headed up PHP file that's going to
change the header and anytime I change
the footer that's going to change the
footer in all of the pages across our
site but we can always have different
content in this section or in the
content section of our websites so
that's pretty awesome and yeah it's
gonna save us a lot it's gonna save us
so much time in future and before we end
of this tutorial let's just make sure
that everything works because I kind of
just ended off this video without
actually checking all of that stuff and
I I see that I've broken my website over
here a little bit but basically just
make sure that you've got semicolons in
the end of all of these lines over here
as well by the way for some reason the
text isn't changing color here and my
about our PHP I think this is just a
problem with sublime text my code is
correct
I think sublime text for some reason
just doesn't want to change the actual
coloring of this code to look kind of
like this and that must be just the
sublime issue right but make sure that
all of this is exactly the same as your
home page and then make sure that you've
saved all of your files so basically
over here you can see I've got this a
little bit of a dot instead of a an X
over there and that's because I haven't
saved my file so let's hit save and now
if I go back over to my browser and
refresh there we go I now have my header
on the about page or on the home page
and everything is sorted and if I change
this to about dot PHP oops
hits country command s I also have my
header over here and everything is
pretty much set up and sorted as well
and yeah that is all I have for you guys
