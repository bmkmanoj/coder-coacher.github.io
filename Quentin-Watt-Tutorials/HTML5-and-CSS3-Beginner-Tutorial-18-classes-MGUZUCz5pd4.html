number 18 and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to use classes to
style different elements on your website
so if you take a look at the code real
quick from the previous tutorial you'll
see that we've got two headers on our
websites and these two headers actually
look exactly the same when you open it
up in Firefox but you know what if we
wanted these two headers to be different
perhaps we wanted this header to be blue
and we wanted this header to be red then
you already know that when we just use
the normal h2 selector in CSS we land up
having two headers that look exactly the
same
or every single header on our web page
that say hello to is going to look
exactly the same so this is what we use
a class for we'd be able to change how
elements look even if they're the same
elements they can use a class just to be
different so let's go ahead and make a
class real quick and to just to make los
all you have to do is use the full stop
or period symbol just to tell CSS that
this is now a class and then what you do
is you just put in your class name so
I'm gonna name my class read underscore
text and you can actually name it
anything you want but it's best to name
your class something descriptive so that
you know what your class is actually
doing on your webpage just by looking at
the name and then we can go ahead and
over here just set the color color not
Zala color to red and now what we can do
is we can actually make another class
and we can Clovis class blue text blue
text over there
and we can set the color equal to blue
and the reason why these class names
just display in red is just um notepad
is just helping you out just to say look
this is a class you can see that it's a
class just by seeing that the text is
actually red
let's go ahead and save this and now
what we have to do is actually try and
use these glasses on our websites so
let's go back to our headers over here
and let's actually change them up
because to have to plot two headers that
say the same thing it's just a little
bit boring so let's just go ahead and be
like this will be red not Ted red and
then we can go ahead and change this one
to be I wish I was blue and that one can
just have a full stop
so now we can go ahead and save this and
if you view this in Firefox just yet
you're gonna see it's gonna be two
normal header to use nothing's actually
changed just yet but now what we can do
is inside our starting tag of our h2
element we just add an attribute called
class and we can set this equal to the
name of our class so as you can see the
name of our class over here was red text
so let's just go ahead and copy that and
then we can paste that in over here make
sure that I try to read text for red and
then we can go ahead and copy the blue
text name over here whoops
and we can set this one also equal to
class equals and that can be blue text
and now when you go ahead and refresh
this in Firefox we're going to land up
having this header as red and this
header as blue checkers are awesome so
now we have a red header and a blue
header so that's how you would use
classes to style elements on your web
page so now you'll be able to have
multiple elements on your web page that
can all look different if that is your
desire so thank you guys for watching
