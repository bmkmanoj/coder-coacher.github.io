here and welcome to tutorial number 6
and in this tutorial we are going to
take a look at the next task within my
asana setup over here so if we take a
look at asana you can see that I have
checked off the set up a Photoshop grid
task so hopefully you guys have watched
the previous video and you now have a
Photoshop grid set up exactly like this
one if you don't lucky for you I have
set this up in a patreon so go ahead and
just check out the description of this
video and you can go over to my patreon
page and download the actual grid and by
the way just while I'm here if you
scroll a little bit further down my
patreon page you can see that anybody
who is currently pledging on patreon is
getting early access to some of my
videos so yeah if you want to get early
access to some of these videos consider
becoming a patron and well now I'm gonna
finish with that shoutouts so yeah if
you guys want early access to some of my
videos check it out if you don't and
you're okay with just waiting for them
to become available on YouTube then
watch for free on YouTube once you have
this downloaded you can go over to
photoshop and start designing the actual
header for your website now I think what
I'd like to do before I actually start
designing anything is change the
background colors of my artboards over
here because right now they're white and
I think if I use white in a white design
it's probably going to be very difficult
to see for you guys right now and by the
way I think it is going to be very
difficult to see a lot of stuff in this
video just because yeah by the nature of
everything it is really small and I have
to kind of zoom in a lot just to see
anything in the detail that I would be
able to see on my computer because
basically this whole block here is
supposed to represent my computer screen
and it's like we're zoomed really far
out at this point so yeah if you're not
watching this full screen at 1080p
you're probably not going to be able to
see very well so I recommend just you
know changing your YouTube settings to
make sure that your
watching this in full-screen and also in
high definition but now let's get back
into these artboards and actually change
the colors so if I go over the window
and I go over to properties with the
artboard selected I can change the
background to transparent so you can see
that my iPhone background is now
transparent and let's go over to Mac and
change that one to transparent as well
and yeah now if I'm actually designing
something that has a white color I'll be
able to see it a little bit better right
and before I actually get into making my
header let's take a look at some
examples so I can show you guys more or
less what I'm planning for this header
and what I want it to look like so if we
take a look at patreon this is a pretty
good example of something that I kind of
want to use because most modern websites
have this so basically we have a header
over here that is going fullscreen and
by fullscreen I mean it goes all the way
from one end of the screen to the other
so it is what we call in web design a
fluid row or a fluid navigation and I
think I'm going to use a similar kind of
concept except what they've done here is
they've kept all they've allowed their
content within the navigation to go
outside of the container so here is the
actual container you can see everything
else has been censored but they just
haven't scented the navigation and in
other websites kind of like UI kits the
navigation is centered within the
container so stuff isn't pushed right up
against the edge even though the
navigation row or the navigation
background does go all the way to the
end of the screen so that's something
that I want to do with my design and
Apple has a similar kind of concept here
so you've got a full screen or a full
width navigation but the actual
navigation is within the container and I
think if you take a look at Apple's
website this navigation is about 40
pixels high and what what that means is
that this logo has to be really really
small and I think Apple is okay with
their logo being really small because
it's visible pretty much on all the
other products that are available here
so their logo is shown quite a few times
but you will find especially in my
experience we're working with some of my
clients if you have a really small
navigation like this and their logo is
also really small they tend to whine and
complain a lot so I think what we're
gonna do is try work with a slightly
bigger navigation so we can have a
slightly bigger logo so let's jump back
over to Photoshop here and to create a
navigation bar I'm going to use a
rectangle tool I'm gonna make sure that
my color is set to white or my fill
color set to white and I'm gonna drag a
navigation bar all the way across the
screen here and what I want to do is
make sure that my height is at about 80
pixels right and yeah 80 pixels I find
it's just a really good height to use
for a navigation bar it's not too big
it's not too small and you guys can do
with whatever works for you right and I
think I'm just going to close this
little properties box so now I have a
navigation bar for my desktop screen and
the next thing I need to do to make this
look a little bit fuller is to import a
logo so I've got a logo set up here in
Adobe Illustrator so I'm just gonna go
ahead and drag and drop that into my
document and yeah if you guys I'm
assuming most of you guys have a logo
already if you want to know a little bit
more about logo design go ahead and
watch some YouTube videos on it but yeah
this is the logo that I'm gonna use for
this video it's just something that I
threw up really quickly in an
illustrator it's just a bit of text and
a square block right and yeah I think
that looks good so if I hit command and
semicolon to hide and show my guides
that's pretty much what my navigation
would look like with a logo only and
right now it is a little bit bland so
let's show my guides again and work on
actually adding some links to this
navigation so I'm going to grab my text
tool and drag out a square and this is
important
drag out an actual rectangle the size
that you'd like and
then start typing some text in here so
I'm going to type in home about contact
and right now you can see you can see
like the text is not very visible so
let's just select all of that and change
the color of that to black so you guys
can see a little bit in fact let's try
and make this 30 30 30 because I don't
think I'm gonna use completely dark text
on my website alright and so now maybe
that's a little bit easier to see I do
apologize if everything looks a little
bit small but yeah I find that a good
text size for a navigation bar is gonna
be around 18 pixels so yeah in the
design it does look small like I said
because you're actually trying to fit
your entire computer screen into the
small space but yeah it might look small
but when you actually start building it
in the browser at those sizes it's going
to look big enough all right so let's go
home about contact and I think let's
just add one more menu item here so
let's type in services and now I've
capitalized them so let's just get some
uniformity in the capitals right and I'm
just gonna hit come on T no I'm gonna
hit the just I want to scale this box
smaller yeah double click on the text
layer and then you can make the text box
smaller now the reason why I actually
dragged out this text box is because if
you go over to this text tool yeah and
you go over the paragraph tab over here
you can then change some settings to do
with your text so by default it's
probably all gonna be left aligned for
you guys which means that all the text
is going to be to the left and you're
not going to really have any spacing
between your menu items but I find if
you play with this tool and you just use
the paragraph tool and justify basically
that icon over there it is going to
split apart all the words so you
actually have some padding or some
spacing between your your links or your
menu
and then you can just scale that down to
what looks like a good size so if that's
about 15 pixels of space or something
that looks about good enough right and
we just put that somewhere in the center
of our navigation or our nav bar that's
pretty much a good good navigation
design right there and I think something
else I'd like to do here is add in some
social media icons so let's let's add in
some social media icons and the way
we're going to do that is by first of
all going over to our browser if you
don't have funds awesome downloaded onto
your computer just yet go ahead and
click that download button install font
awesome on your computer and then the
next thing you want to do is go over to
the font awesome cheat sheet which is at
this link over here and yeah from here
you've basically got a cheat sheet of
all the icons available in font awesome
and you can search for something like
Twitter copy that icon there and you
cannot see already as I have it selected
it says look up and it's got the square
with a question mark so that means that
the character was not recognized by
Google Chrome but that's exactly what we
want so let's copy this and jump back
over to photoshop and what I'd like to
do now is drag out a second box here and
paste in my icon that I just copied and
if you've done everything right it's
probably going to look like this really
weird square thing so just select that
and change the fonts type to font
awesome and you can see that now it's
actually a Twitter icon it's just really
blurry because we're zoomed in really
far but yeah we actually have a Twitter
icon set up here so if I change the text
to something like 48 yeah it's nice and
big and visible but I find what's going
to work well for my design is around 18
pixels so let's
move that down again and space add in a
space and then jump back over to font
awesomes website and just grab all the
rest of the icons that you want to use I
think I'd like to use the Facebook icon
as well so let's just put that into
Photoshop make sure that I've got that
text layer selected paste another space
back over to my browser and I think
let's grab a youtube link here or a
YouTube icon so the YouTube player icon
looks good and jump back over to the
browser here select that layer again and
paste right so I've got all my icons set
up and I can move those up to where I
want them let's show my guides so I can
get them positioned correctly but there
we go right we sort of have a navigation
set up here I think it's just really
important to line them up here so let's
move that across boom all the way to the
edge of the screen and something I
realized I haven't quite done yet with
my nav items is selected a font so let's
select all of these and I think a font
that I'd really like to use here is
going to be Roboto and I think I'm gonna
use the thin version the thin one the
thin font so yeah with that selected
let's change it to Roboto thin and thin
fonts were very much in fashion a little
while ago you'll see a lot of websites
still use these very very thin Thon's
fonts but I feel like where the design
is changing a little bit and people are
starting to make much more use of a a
bolder font so a very very bold font but
yeah then thin fonts were very much in
fashion because it makes everything look
very light and sleek and clean and I
think
I'm going to keep with that and use a
thin font for my design so if I hide my
guides that's pretty much our navigation
setup in Photoshop and I think it looks
pretty good
so we can actually copy that over to our
mobile navigation for my iPhone so let's
jump back with my browser real quick and
there's something I just want to explain
about the fonts because by the way if
you if you don't have a Roboto
downloaded or if you haven't used Roboto
the Roboto font it is a free Google font
so just Google Roboto font and you're
going to get a link to Google's font
library where you can download this and
install it on your computer and also use
it for your website later right so now
that we've got that out the way let's do
a navigation for my mobile phone and I
think I'm going to do the exact same
thing here I'm going to drag out oops
whoops I need to move over to the iPhone
artboard so that's something I didn't do
yet
and now we can drag this over and just
make a 80 pixel height navigation bar so
I think the fact that it's 80 pixels is
really important to me come on just
seems to be bouncing between 79 and 80
so I'm just gonna tick there and let's
go
375 by 80 pixels great and now whoops
and now I can just grab my move tool and
move that exactly as I want it right so
now it's positioned where I want it to
be and again I want to grab a copy of my
logo that I've designed and drop that
into Photoshop so I wanted there for my
mobile navigation so let's move that up
and holding down shift and alt scale
that down and put it in the center
somewhere around there
boom right so now we have the navigation
set up and centered something else I can
do for this design is just put in a
hamburger menu item so let's go over to
font awesome and see if they have one
interesting I could swear that they
should have had a hamburger menu item
but they don't right I think something I
can do is the placeholders just copy
that one which is actually the text
justify tool and jump back over to
photoshop again and let's grab a text
tool here paste that and then paste in
my icon and change the font to font
awesome awesome
and now I can move that to where I want
that to be which is going to be there
you can just scale that's to size okay
so yeah what I'd like to do here is
actually use a hamburger icon and I'm
not going to be using that actual icon
I'm going to be using the one that comes
with UI kit so if we go over to UI kits
page or UI kits website they actually do
have a if we go over to core maybe and
we go over to nav or let's go to nav bar
there is a hamburger menu item or
hamburger menu icon that is built into
UI kits so that's actually what we will
be using later on but for now I think
I'm just going to use this little icon
as a placeholder it pretty much looks
exactly the same except it's got one too
many lines but I don't think many people
will notice that right and now what I'd
like to do as well as just talk to you
guys a little bit about this navigation
because if we go over to the nav section
here
and we scroll slightly further down the
page there is actually an off canvas
example of what the nav will look like
for a mobile phone
and so this is just using standard UI
kits styling will be able to pull out a
navigation like this and that is on a
half you guys in this video but before I
