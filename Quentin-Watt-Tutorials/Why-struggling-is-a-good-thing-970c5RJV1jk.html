and welcome back to my super awesome
kitchen that I keep attending to film
videos in it's just because it's kind of
a really nice spot there's like a little
bar table here and I've got a really
cool chair that I'm sitting on right now
I can swing around on too close to the
bar now anyway so let's get to the real
point of this video which is talking
about struggling and yeah I'm making
this video because I do read the YouTube
comments on my youtube videos and yeah I
can see from a lot of the comments that
some of you guys give up way way too
soon and way too quickly and sometimes
you just need to struggle through that
problem a little bit more to figure it
out isn't I know when you're learning
something especially when you're
learning something new like how to code
it can be difficult and sometimes we
have to go through the process of
struggling through a problem a lot of
the time it is really easy to kind of
just give up push that problem aside
give it to somebody else
try get somebody else to do what the
problem is when you do something like
that you kind of only delay the
inevitability of that problem coming
back to you and then you have to sort it
out again anyways and also you kind of
don't learn anything by pushing your
problems on to somebody else and having
somebody else for it out you don't get
to learn how to fix that problem but
here's the thing if you choose to
struggle through the problem if you
choose to put up with like the
irritation of trying to figure something
out there are benefits to having
struggle through a problem yourself and
not running to other people and getting
help so I've got my notes over there
that I'm probably going to keep glancing
through every now and then but yeah
let's start off with my first point
which is the struggling is part of the
learning experience I don't think
there's a single div out there or a
developer out there who who hasn't
struggled right we all struggle at some
point because we all will get to
a point a lies where there's something
that we don't actually know and we need
to learn how to do that thing and
because we need to learn how to do that
thing we've got to struggle through that
problem once you've struggled with
something you know that you're going to
come out of that a stronger person or a
smarter person and so yes struggling has
helped you learn and become a better
person and if you think about it you're
not going to easily forget something
that you struggle with right when you
really struggle through a problem you're
going to remember that and the next time
you face a problem that is similar in
nature then you know I already know how
to fix that problem because I struggled
with this once upon a time and that's
all going to be up yet right so
struggling through something can really
help burn the memory of how to solve
that problem into your mind
struggling also helps you think
differently right it helps you think
differently and creatively because this
face it if every problem were easy and
if every problem could just be fixed
like a certain way then you kind of just
have this one linear way of thinking and
it wouldn't be very creative and yeah
you kind of just try the same thing over
and over again and yeah there are
problems that you can't just do the same
thing as what you did somewhere else and
that's how it works
so struggling through a problem can help
you or can force you to think
differently and creatively and that is
going to help you in the long run
especially if you're trying to build
something or create something that is
unique and something that nobody else
has or solve problems that nobody else
has solved so I guess what I'm trying to
say here is struggling through stuff
really gets you using your head right
and that is very very important because
like as a dev I think a lot of people
especially from a lot of the questions
and the comments that I get a lot of
people just tend to assume that once
you've been developing for long enough
it's all just going to like show up in
your mind and you're just going to have
the answers to everything and like
that isn't that again that's not
realistic I think every developer is
going to have problems that you struggle
with and your are going to be forced and
presented in a way where you have to
struggle to figure something out and you
have to use your head you have to start
thinking creatively and out-of-the-box
it also helps in terms of your ego right
because there are times where you might
be struggling to figure out a problem
but when you finally achieve success
when you finally reach that goal it
makes you feel happy right there's a
thrill in finally hitch eating success
and finally beating that challenge that
you've had for the past week or you know
a couple of hours whatever it is and it
helps you become a little bit less
reliant on other people I think when you
choose to to give up too soon and you
push the problem onto somebody else
again like I said you won't learn
anything from that and other people will
just kind of get the impression that you
are way too reliant on them and that you
can't actually solve problems itself
which in the dev environment especially
is not a good thing because again it's
probably going to stop you from getting
that promotion or stop you from
achieving success in your career in some
way shape or form because you kind of
just wanted to rely on other people to
get the work done
instead of being independent and trying
to get the work done yourself I don't
say that to like down team work I think
team work is very important as well it's
just that there has to be a time when
even if you're working in part of a team
you will still have a job to do as part
of that team and you cannot force your
the rest of your team to carry you you
need to be able to perform your own part
and in that case you are going to be
presented with something that you're
struggling with that you kind of need to
fix even as part of a team you need to
fix that by yourself and one last thing
is that struggling also helps separate
those who can from those who can't and I
think that's just life test in general
this is how colleges try to decide who
actually gets to pass the college and
who doesn't
those who are willing to do the work and
those who put in a lot of efforts are
those who can and generally those who
can do dev staff those who are willing
to struggle through a problem will
achieve the path and those who can't
those who are too lazy to figure out a
problem or those who just want to push
problems away and not have to struggle
and just want everything very easily
yeah those are the guys who cause and
those are guys who generally fail at a
college or yeah fail in a work
environment struggling also helps
separate the weak from the strong if we
can put it that way and I think it is a
good thing to have to struggle through a
problem because it proves that you are
stronger than the test that you have
been pushed put through so my advice to
anybody who is ever struggling through a
problem if you guys ever find yourself
in that situation just think about all
the points that I've mentioned yet it is
going to help you become a stronger
smarter developer and it is going to
help you think creatively and
differently and all of these things are
going to be really beneficial to you and
yeah if you are one of those people who
when you're struggling with something
just wants to bang your fists on the
table and swear a lot then you know do
that but also go outside take a break
have a coffee and a bit of fresh fresh
air because sometimes that's all you
need to get back in the game and yes sit
down again and try and figure out the
problem I'm confident that if you try
hard enough you will fix that problem
eventually and just before I end up this
