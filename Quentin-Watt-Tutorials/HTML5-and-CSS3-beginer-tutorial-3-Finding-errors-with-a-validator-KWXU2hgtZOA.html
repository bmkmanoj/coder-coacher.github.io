here and welcome to tutorial number
three and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use an HTML validator so
whenever you're following along with my
tutorials and you're so confused because
nothing's working and like you think you
type the exact same thing as me but it's
just not working you don't know why then
and that's when you use an HTML
validator I know sometimes people like
to panic and act like it's the end of
the world because they think they typed
the exact same thing as me but there was
like a silly little mistake somewhere
maybe they forgot a closing slash on a
tag or something like that
so in order to check for HTML errors we
use this thing called an HTML validator
and I've got the same document open as
the previous tutorial but what I want to
do now is actually validate this code
because I think there might be an error
here and to do that go over to your
browser and you can google HTML
validator or you can go to this link
which I will leave in the description of
the video so go ahead and check that out
and this is a website by w3c now I won't
go into too much detail about this but
w3c is basically the organization that
is in charge of the standards for HTML
so these guys are the ones who decide
what is right when it comes to HTML and
what is wrong and yeah I'd say you can
at least trust their HTML validator
because there are the guys who set this
kind of rule so do do your homework on
them if you're interested but I want to
validate my files so I'm going to
validate by file upload you can also
validate by URI which means I mean you
can like copy someone's URL paste it in
here and check
there's any errors you know but for now
we are just working with the files on my
computer which in this case is this
index file that we created so let me go
ahead and select that file on my
computer so in htdocs' h index dot HTML
open that up and hit check and so the
validator is going to run through the
code on or in my file and find an error
for some reason my internet is slow
tonight so just gonna have to deal with
this okay so you'll see right now I have
one error in my document and the error
is the character encoding was not
declared proceeding using Windows one
two five two so if you ever see that
you've got an error you might want to
just copy and paste this into Google you
will definitely find a solution to your
problem there is no error that would be
undocumented so just go ahead and copy
and paste the error into Google to find
out what your problem is in this case I
already know what my problem is
the problem is that the character
encoding was not declared so that is
something that I need to jump back over
my document over here and just type in
or add an extra tag so a character
encoding if you guys don't know what
that is
basically just tells the browser what
characters we're going to be using on
our website and by default this has
preceded using Windows one two five two
I don't want to use that I want to use
something called Unicode and Unicode is
just supposed to support all or most of
the characters it's like a new world
standard to support most characters so
for example things like the O with the
two dots above it that o with M lots
that may not be supported by some
character sets but then supported by
others so the one that I want to use
will support most characters so to
to fix this error I'm going to add in a
meta tag so I'm just going to type in
mater and hit enter and this is going to
autocomplete a tag for me that is a
bunch of new stuff over here because
we've got a maida tag
but then it's got this little extra bit
of green information and an equal sign
and some other information so let me
explain what this is right this entire
thing is a tag this thing over here is
an attribute right so an attribute is a
little bit of extra information that
this tag can provide and then we have an
equal sign and then a value for the
attribute so in this case our attribute
is char set which stands for character
set and we're setting our char set equal
to utf-8 which basically is the code for
unicode and this will now mean that our
website can support pretty much most
characters out there okay so now that
unicode is or now that our website is
unicode i'm going to go ahead and hit
save and come back over to the HTML
validator and then let me just check
this one more time and now you can see
that we have no errors in our document
so i have officially fixed my error by
just adding in this little meta tag and
all web sites are actually supposed to
have a character set declared so i
should have already put this in in the
previous tutorial but I didn't know T me
and now it's here so we can continue and
I'll see you in the next video I just
want to send a shout out to my sponsors
at dev Mountain they run a coding
bootcamp with courses on iOS development
UX design and web development and they
can teach you everything you need to
to get a job within this field and
they'll do it within 12 weeks which i
think is a rather impressive timeline so
go ahead and check out their website the
link is in the video description and if
you do contact them make sure to tell
them that I thank you hey thanks for
staying until the end of the video that
really means a lot to me now while
you're still here there are a few things
that you can do to help first of all if
you haven't already subscribe and watch
another one of my videos and if you want
to help me make more content more often
or if you feel that my content is just
worth paying a little bit of money
towards you can check me out on patreon
you can also check me out on social
media I will leave the links next to me
so go ahead and click on something and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
