back to tutorial number fourteen and in
this tutorial I just want to show you
guys how to change the background color
of your website and it's actually really
easy so let's just go ahead and get
started but before we start I just want
you to guys I just want you guys to see
that I have changed or taken everything
out of my body so we are working with a
blank web page there's nothing that's
going to display on our web page at the
moment and also there's no CSS so we
haven't styled anything on our web page
but that's because it's blank and that's
okay because we can actually style our
blank web page for the background color
so just go over to your stylesheet and I
know some of you guys are probably
thinking now like okay well if we want
to style something on our web page like
a background color don't we need to
select something on our web page but I
just showed you guys that there's
nothing here to select and I'm just
going to give you guys a little bit of a
hint what you want to do is you want to
change the whole background color of the
body of our whole web page so why don't
we just go ahead and select the body
which is actually a valid selector and
then what you can do is just open up
your curly braces and now you just want
to choose the property which you want to
change which we've already established
is our background and you can actually
use two different properties to change
the background color of our website you
can use normal background or you can use
background - color and after that what
you have to do is you have to set this
equal to a value of any color that you
want to choose like blue and semicolon
and you can save that and if we go ahead
and run our HTML document in Firefox you
get a nice blue background look at that
how beautiful is that but I know some of
you guys are probably thinking like okay
I'm over using all these thing
andddd CSS colors they're so boring I
mean all you've got is like blue black
green red yellow what if we wanted to
get a little bit more creative with our
design and use much better much nicer
much prettier colors so I'm just going
to show you guys how I choose a prettier
or a better color and what I usually do
is I just open up GIMP and over here
where I can choose my colors I'll just
go ahead and uh play around in this
color box and I get my number from this
HTML notation box over here so all white
in this is actually called a hexadecimal
color by the way and all white is six FS
and all black is six zeros and then all
the other numbers that you get or
something in between some of them
actually have letters so they're not
really a hexadecimal number as much as
they are hexadecimal code but anyways
now what you do is you just go ahead and
grab this hexadecimal color oh yeah and
I'll just copy this and I go back to
HTML or CSS and I'll just paste my color
in over here but in order to use a
hexadecimal color in CSS you can't just
go ahead and type the color just like
this because this isn't going to work
what happens if I go to my web page now
and i refresh I'm just going to get a
white page and that's because if you
want to use a hexadecimal color in HTML
you have to use the hash symbol before
your hexadecimal color so if you're a
Twitter junkie basically just remember
hashtag color and you're sorted so now
when we go ahead and refresh this you
get a nice black light blue for your
webpage so if you guys just wanted to
know how to get a little bit more
creative with colors you know there you
go and that's actually all I've got for
you guys in this tutorial so yeah thanks
for watching and I will see you guys
next time
