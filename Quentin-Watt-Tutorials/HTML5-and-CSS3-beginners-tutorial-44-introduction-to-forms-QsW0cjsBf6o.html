here and this is tutorial number 44 and
in this tutorial we're going to start
taking a look at forms and form elements
so just in case you guys don't know a
form is basically an area that we can
add in form elements onto our web page
that allow us to gain data from the user
so in other words we could add a name
section in where the user could fill in
their name and a password section where
they could fill in a password etc etc
okay so the reason why I left these
tutorials until right until the end of
the series is because forms actually tie
in with JavaScript or a PHP or any other
kind of scripting language because we
can't actually use the data that we get
from the user unless we're using a
scripting language because HTML by
itself doesn't have the ability to
handle data but as soon as we use
JavaScript or PHP then we're able to
handle that data and actually do stuff
with it like store it in a database or
email that data over to someone or
something like that okay so yeah that
was just my introduction to what forms
are all about and let's actually get
started so the first thing we need to do
is add a form on to our web page and to
do that we simply open up a new tag
called form and then we can end that off
as well and inside here we'll put the
rest of our form elements okay but
before we even get started
on adding other form elements into this
form I just want to mention to you guys
that there are two other attributes that
we have to place in the opening tag of
this form now the first attribute is
called action and the second attribute
is called
so these two attributes are required
because the first attribute action is
basically asking where do you want to
send the data from this form where do
you want to send that to so in other
words you could place in the URL of
another file
hopefully it's a smart file like a PHP
file or something that would actually
handle the data that is in this form and
then the second attribute here is the
method and the method is basically
asking how do you want to send the data
from this form to the action page okay
and there are only two different methods
that we can use the first one is post
which kind of sends the data in the
background it's nowhere where the user
can see it so it's a lot more secure and
you're able to send a lot more data or
data through to our action page but
there is another alternative to that and
we could also use get but unfortunately
get isn't the most secure method so in
other words if I were to run this in
Firefox okay get actually sends the data
right here on the end of the URL so in
other words let's say I fold in my name
then we might have something like name
is equal to Quinton appearing on the end
of the URL and it's okay to use get in
some cases but in other cases it really
isn't recommended okay so you'll notice
that when you're searching on Google
that you might actually see your search
words included up in the URL because
Google is using get to search for your
words or using the get method to
actually send your search words through
to the next search
and like I said this action is basically
just where do you want to send the data
to so you could specify another file in
here like index dot PHP or something
like that and we would send the data
through to that page but right now I
haven't actually made this page it
doesn't exist so I'm just going to leave
this blank and what this means when we
have it whenever we leave the action
attribute blank is it means that we're
going to submit the data back to the
same page which means whenever I submit
this data it's going to submit right
back onto index.html and you know
unfortunately we don't have any
scripting to handle the data so we're
not going to be able to do anything with
it but that's okay because like I said
this isn't a scripting tutorial this is
an HTML tutorial so we're just going to
take a look at what all the text do and
how we can use them okay so don't forget
to come back in the next video where I'm
actually going to start talking about
all the form elements that we can place
inside of this form and I hope to see
you guys then so as always don't forget
to subscribe please feel free to leave a
comment like or share this video it's
really going to help my channel grow and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
