tutorial number 41 and in this tutorial
I just want to talk to you guys about
labels and text boxes so as you can see
in the last tutorial I left off with you
guys and I told you guys what forms are
and we had this blank input box on our
screen so let me just go ahead and run
this in Firefox just to refresh your
memory and as you can see we've just got
this blank input box there's nothing
there and it's a blank web page other
than the input box and you can see how
this might be confusing when a user
comes to your website if they just come
here and they see an input box and
they're like okay what the heck you want
me to type here and you know like what
the hell they don't know what to fill in
so that's why we have these awesome tags
called labels and what you then do is
you just start off with a starting label
tag and then you have to end it off with
a ending label tag and I'm just gonna
give some space there and whatever's in
between here is your label so we can go
ahead and say just put in name and when
we save that and we come ahead and we
click refresh here we now have a nice
label for our input box another user
comes to our website and they're like oh
okay you want me to fill in my name okay
so now they understand okay so I've
probably said okay a lot but now they
know that they need to fill in their
name so that's the reason why that's
there and it's good practice to link
your label to the input element that
it's for so the reader the way they do
this is you have to add in an attribute
inside your label called for and equal
sign and inside here you will put the ID
of the element that
this label is for so seeing as this
label needs to be for our input let's go
ahead and give our input an idea our
first name first name and we can
probably just go ahead and copy this
because these things have to be the same
paste and now our browser knows that
this label is for this input box so
that's pretty simple pretty
straightforward and I'm pretty sure you
guys understand that but if I go ahead
and i refresh this there is no like
visual change to the website so what I'm
gonna do now is we're just going to talk
to you guys about a few more attributes
that you can put in your input box and I
can see we're probably going to run out
of space here
so I'm just gonna go down to a new line
and one of the most commonly used
attributes on a text box is the max
length max length attribute and what
this does is it's it's a maximum length
for our text box because if I go back to
our browser right now and I type in here
without refreshing anything just yet if
I just type I can type away forever and
ever and ever and the text box is just
gonna carry on taking whatever I type in
and putting it inside the text box so 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 you know so and so
forth but if I go ahead and I add in
this attribute called max length and
I'll set that equal to a number so let's
go ahead and set that equal to 10 and we
go ahead and click Save then I can only
type in 10 characters over you have to
click refresh first okay cool so I can
only type in 10 characters and if you
don't believe me
1 2 3 4
six seven eight nine and well zero for
ten and as you can see there's no more
space so while I type I'm just gonna
lean over my keyboard okay while I'm
typing it's not going into my text box
there's nothing going in there so now
you guys can believe me it is once you
got max name you can't type anything and
the next attribute that you've probably
got you guys will probably use a lot is
called the size attribute and what that
does is it just changes the length of
how long your input box is so let's say
I set our length to our size equal to 10
and then I go back to our browser over
here and I click refresh you can see
that our input box got smaller and then
if I go ahead and I set this equal to a
hundred okay we're now gonna have a
really long input box when I click
refresh so refresh and you can see
that's now 100 long so those are pretty
much the attributes that you'll use all
the time when you're using a text box so
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys in the next tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
