here and in this video we're still
talking about jQuery selectors but if
you're getting a little bit tired of
jQuery selectors then don't worry we're
actually almost done we only have
another two more videos to get through
and then I'm gonna start talking about
some really cool jQuery stuff but we
need to get through all of these
selectors so that we know how to select
whichever element we want to select so
this one is going to be a little bit
more complicated I'm actually going to
be talking to you about the contains
selector and that's going to be useful
whenever you're searching your page for
something so let's say I've got these
four paragraphs over here and I wanted
to find everyone with this surname what
then I might use the contain selector to
look through all my paragraphs and
search for the word what with a capital
W I might also once you see how many
people have the letter J in their name
so I could search for just the letter J
and that's pretty much what we're going
to be learning how to do in this
tutorial so it's actually rather simple
I'm just going to go over to my script
and I'm going to obviously start off
with my selection tags and we're going
to select our paragraphs because we want
to look in our paragraphs now and that's
the four paragraphs that I have yeah
although you could combine this with a
whole bunch of other selectors that I've
taught you about previously so you don't
specifically have to use a paragraph
here but the part that we're going to be
using now when this is the part that you
guys want to use or gonna want to use is
the word contains but it has to be after
a colon and what this is gonna do is
look for all paragraphs that contain
something and to be honest I actually
want to use double quotation marks on
the outside of the selector because I'm
going to add in parentheses here
and I'm also going to add in single
quotation marks over here so what we're
going to be doing is searching for
through all of our paragraphs to see
which one of them contains whatever we
add in between these single quotation
marks inside these parentheses so like I
said I want to search for maybe all of
the people in my webpage that have the
surname what which would be myself and
my brother if I go back to these
paragraphs so of Quinten and then I've
got Jared so that's me and my brother
and what we want to do now is maybe
let's just change the color or the
background color so I'm gonna just say
dot CSS and we're going to be using the
CSS function to change two properties so
we'll change the background and we'll
set that equal to yellow and I meant
we're going to use the CSS function to
change one property to a value not two
properties but there we go now this
should actually run pretty much as soon
as the page runs so if I go back over
here and I run this in Firefox you'll
see that we open up the page and
immediately Quintin Watts and Jared
Watts are highlighted because we used
JavaScript to search for all of the
paragraphs that contain the word what
and then we change the background color
of those paragraphs to yellow so let's
see what happens if I add in the letter
J then I'll be looking for every one or
all of the paragraphs that have the
letter J in the paragraph and we'll
change the background color of that to
yellow so if I go back over to Firefox
and click refresh you can see instead of
Quinton and Jerrod highlighted we now
have Jerrod and Justin highlighted
because they both start with a capital
letter J and this is a very simple use
for our jQuery selector obviously there
is a lot more complicated ways that we
can
use this but I haven't started showing
you guys the rest of jQuery that we'd
have to use to implement something like
this but I could have a text box on my
web page and then maybe start typing in
a user's name so I could have a text box
up here at the top and start typing in
names of people that I want to find and
then highlight those people in yellow
according to whoever's name matches
whatever I typed in that input box but
again I need to show you a whole lot
more in jQuery before we can do
something like that so that's all I have
for you in this video but don't forget
to come back and watch the next video
and also don't forget to subscribe
please feel free to leave a comment like
and share this video and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
