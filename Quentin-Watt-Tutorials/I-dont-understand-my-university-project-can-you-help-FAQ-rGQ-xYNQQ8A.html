questions about university projects and
usually they found quite innocence I'm
not gonna lie usually people will say
stuff like hey Quinton I I have a
university project and I'm really
struggling with understanding the brief
and I don't know where to begin could
you please help me and it sounds very
innocent and it it would it sounds like
when i get a question like that and it's
worded so politely it does make me feel
bad to say no I can't help you all know
I won't do that but unfortunately i have
had very very many negative responses in
the past where guys have asked me
exactly that they've are super politely
about a project and then I say sure yeah
let me help you send me the brief and
then this is what's happened every
single time I've said that I'd help
somebody with a project every single
time it's always resulted in them going
okay sure here's the brief here's my
code and i'll drop their code in zip
files into an email and send it to me or
they'll drop it in to facebook and you
can just drop code on facebook and then
i'll say sure okay so here's a brief
here's the code make it work and like to
me that other than the fact that that's
cheating if i'm coding your project for
you you definitely add downright don't
deserve a single mark you get for your
university project because i'm the one
who did the work and that was cheating
but other than the fact that it's
cheating it's just insulting man like i
never went to university because i
couldn't afford to go to university and
now you have the gift of going to
university going to university is a gift
and you are benefiting from that because
you're the one who gets that it is a
degree or the qualification at the end
of the day and you are now shrugging off
your responsibility or your gift of
going to the University by just kind of
shrugging all that work over to me and
saying hey Quentin please code for me so
here's the thing about getting other
people to Cody you know
city project for you and I'm sorry if I
sound too much like your mom or your dad
or your university lecturer when I say
this but your school project is your
school project you're the one who gets
to degree at the end and you're the one
who is going to have to work in this
field for the rest of your life after
you get the degree if you can't do the
work and you have to pass it on to other
people to code for you there's a very
good chance you're studying the wrong
thing and you need to drop out and go
study something else you should want to
code for yourself if you need verbal
advice if you just need tips and
pointers and things like that I honestly
wouldn't mind helping if I have the time
if you inbox me nicely and you're not
going to just drop code in my inbox I
would help but if it comes down to the
fact like that is just kind of drop your
code in my inbox and expect me to code
for you definitely a big no-no and I
wouldn't I would never do it for anyone
if I'm going to link to another playlist
over here that might answer some other
questions you might have and if you do
have a question that's not in this
playlist you can go ahead and just leave
a comment and I'll try and answer it as
best I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
