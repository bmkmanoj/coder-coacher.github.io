here and welcome to tutorial number
seven in this PrestaShop series and in
this video I want to show you guys how
to import products using a CSV file so a
lot of you guys will know especially if
you're experienced in setting up online
stores is that if you have like a
hundred products and you have to set
them all up manually it can take days to
set up all your products but if you have
a CSV import option then basically you
can just gather all your data into the
CSV file and import all your products
it's gonna take you you know ten minutes
and all your products will have been set
up and all you got to do is just go in
and tweak some of the information about
all your products or whatever so yeah
let's let's take a look at how to import
our products and first thing you got to
do is log into PrestaShop and then go
over to advanced parameters and CSV
import and over here is where we get to
import all of our products or even
categories or something so here you can
see we get to choose what we want to
import and by default this is it two
categories but there's also products we
can also import manufacturers suppliers
etc and each one of those would
obviously be a different CSV file so
depending on what you want to import
just select that over here upload a CSV
file obviously you would select a file
from your computer and then we've got
the options you choose like what our
field separator is and what our
multi-value separator is etc if you
don't know what this stuff is then I'll
explain in just a moment but for now
let's take a look at actually
downloading a sample CSV file so this is
how PrestaShop is expecting your CSV to
look like and I will download a sample
products file because let's say I want
to import some products okay
let's save this file
and I'm gonna just open that up and
there we go if I look in my downloads
folder I've got a file called products
underscore import CSV so that's the file
I just downloaded from here I'm gonna
double click on that and on my computer
this is opening with numbers but if you
guys have Microsoft Office and Excel or
something then you can open this file
using Excel and edit there as well
and this is basically just a file with
or a table with a whole bunch of
information about your products so you
can see in the first row over here we
have some column headings so a lot of
these are going to be quite
self-explanatory like ID is the ID of
your product and that increments from 1
to whatever number of products you have
so here we've got 7 products so this
goes 1 to 7 and I'm not gonna explain
all of these column headings a lot of
them will be self-explanatory like I
said like price tax or tax rules I mean
you guys know what that is but if we
scroll further down the file over here
where is it the image URLs that's what I
want to show you guys ok
whenever you are importing products you
might want to specify an image URL for
your product so that way when you upload
this file and import this file all of
the products that you're adding will
have an image so what I would do is go
to your old sites where your old store
is or whatever your images are if you
have a list of images for all your
products or something then upload them
to this PrestaShop site or just a folder
somewhere on your PrestaShop site and
then add all the URLs over here and it
just means that when you import all your
products they're all gonna have images
ok so yeah once you've actually fold all
this information in hopefully what you
can do
is just like copy paste or your columns
into the right places and then hit save
or if you're using numbers you might
want to go file and export to CSV and
yeah this is where you get to save all
your options
I'm only oh I've only got this open to
show you guys that my file is utf-8
because PrestaShop is going to be
expecting a utf-8 text encoding so let's
just say next and I'll save this as
product dot CSV so let's export that and
yeah now I should if I open my downloads
folder
have a file called products dot CSV so
this is the file I can then import into
my store and what you guys might want to
do if you're worried about losing your
current information in your store like
your current products and stuff then you
can go over to DB back up and then just
read this disclaimer make a backup and
you've got some instructions here on how
to restore a backup if you ever need to
and you can see I already made a
database backup not too long ago so just
before I started recording this video I
made a backup and then something else
you can do is if you go to catalog and
products then you can take a look at the
top button over here there's one for
export and you can export a list of your
products as well but for some reason
PrestaShop doesn't give you all the
information about your products this way
so if I save this file you take a look
here product CSV so this is the file we
just exported of our products and you
can see this table isn't very big it's
just got an ID and image URL a name
reference number whatever so
if take a look at this file you can see
there's this one has a lot of
information so that's something I don't
really like about PrestaShop is you can
import all your data with all the
correct information but then you can't
export it and it like won't give you all
the information you need to export your
file which yeah it's annoying but hey
I'm just gonna leave her as is I've
already saved my products CSV so let's
let's go back to advanced parameters and
CSV import select my products and then
hit my upload button over here select my
file which was this one okay cool
field separator and multi value
separator that was something I said I
would show you guys now so let me just
open this up again
if I take a look at this file products
for CSV the one that I'm importing right
now if I open this with TextEdit or
notepad or some kind of text editor then
we can see exactly what our text
separator is so you'll see that over
here we have ID semicolon then we have
active semicolon and name star semicolon
etc so our text separator over here is
the semicolon because if we open this
back up in numbers you can see we've got
ID and then what separates ID from
active is the semicolon so yeah if you
guys didn't know what a text separator
is then that's what it is
okay so let me close this now and yeah
I'm gonna hit next step so that's gonna
allow me to line all my headers up with
their correct values I guess so yeah
over here you can see I've actually used
the sample product CSV so all of my
headings are going to be in line but if
for some reason whenever you were
editing your CSV file
you shuffled your headings around then
you can change them up over here so like
let's say that this heading was a
different heading you can go ahead and
just choose the right heading from the
drop-down over here and you can see that
we also have lines to skip set to one so
that means that when PrestaShop imports
this CSV file it's gonna skip all these
headings which is good because we don't
want to import our headings we just want
to import all the values so yeah once
that is all set up and you've hit all
these little next buttons just to make
sure that all your headings align
correctly you can say import CSV and
yeah then you'll that'll run and you can
see I've got some errors of a year so no
name ID cannot be saved property name is
empty I think that was the 8th column or
the 8th row that I had edited and then
deleted so let's not worry about that
but eight warnings so these are images
with bad URLs interesting okay that's
fine yeah let's just take a look and see
what the damage is so let's go over to
catalog and products and yeah you can
see that I've actually got the product
set up so we've got our iPad iPod Nano
showing over here because we never had
an iPod Nano in the store before iPod
shuffle that's here and there is
actually an image for both of these
MacBook Air didn't get an image so and
macbook so we'd have to take a look at
those and yeah it looks like we did lose
some information and the reason for that
I think was if we open up our products
over here you can see that I've got IDs
here 1 2 7 and we also have IDs here why
to seven so when I imported my products
because they had the same IDs I kind of
over wrote the old ones with new ones
and yeah it was a bit of a bad thing to
do but yeah if you guys are ever having
that problem then you guys know that
that was the problem was that I didn't
change my IDs for my products so that's
something you guys should probably do
but anything that didn't have a
duplicate ID is still showing like this
has an ID of 12 and it didn't get over
it and that was my product that I set up
previously so yeah that is all I have
for you guys in this video and I will
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
