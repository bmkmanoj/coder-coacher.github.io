here and welcome to tutorial number 33
and in this tutorial I am going to show
you guys how to use some built-in sort
functions to sort arrays in PHP so the
first thing we're going to have to do is
obviously have an array that we can work
with so I'm going to go ahead and make
an array called fruit and this is
obviously going to be an array so I've
got to do this and I'm going to give
this array three different values so one
two three and the first value I'm going
to set as oranges the next one can be
apples because I always use apples as
some kind of a variable and then
strawberries okay so we've got oranges
apples and strawberries okay now let's
take a look at how to use some of these
different sort functions so the first
function is actually called you guessed
it sort so let's go ahead and just type
that word there sort and basically what
this does is it sorts our array into
alphabetical order and if you were using
numbers in your array instead of words
then it would sort it into numeric order
okay starting from the smallest to the
biggest so let's go ahead and just put
in our array here as fruit so that is
the only arguments that this sort
function takes and now we've actually
sorted our array being that Apple starts
with a that should appear first then
oranges then strawberries so let's go
ahead and print this out and see what we
get so I'm going to use my 4-inch loop
and
obviously we'll just set all that up for
now okay
so for each fruit as a name because
we're going according to the name of the
fruit then we'll just echo out the name
and we'll just depend on a break
tag as well just so that everything
appears on a new line
I suppose I could also use the new line
argument but hey okay
so now that we've saved all of this we
can go back to you
Firefox over here and click refresh and
as you can see we now have our array
printed out and it is indeed in sorted
order
because we've started with apples even
though apples was second over here in
our array it's displayed first over here
so this does mean that our sword
function has sorted everything in
alphabetical order correctly okay then
the next thing we can do is instead of
sorting it in alphabetical order from
biggest to smallest or like from A to Z
we can reverse sort this array as well
and all you have to do is use the
function called our sort so now that
I've saved this and go back to Firefox
when I click refresh this these words
should all be flipped so we should
actually start with strawberries and end
with apples so let's go ahead and click
refresh and as you can see we now have
our array sorted but in reverse order so
we're starting from the back and then
going on to the front so strawberries
oranges apples okay and if you were
working with numbers then obviously
start with the biggest number first and
go down to the lowest
now there's also one other function for
sorting that I want to talk to you guys
about but this one is a little bit
different because this one will sort
your array
according to keys so it means that we
actually have to have an associative
array so let's go ahead and make an
associative array so I'm going to call
my first index or my first element fruit
one and we can probably just go ahead
and actually copy that and the next one
I'm going to call three two and the
third index I will call fruit three so
now we've got this associative array
over here we can actually sort this
array according to its keys so I realize
I've actually made a mistake here
because I should actually have my keys
in a jumbled up order so that we can
sort them into a proper order so let's
start off with fruit three the middle
one can be free to one and that one can
be free to okay so now they're actually
in a jumbled up order the function that
we can use to actually sort this array
back into its proper order starting from
the key of fruit 1 then 3 2 then 3 3 is
K sort which stands for key sort okay
and of course we just have to change
this up a little bit so key as name and
then we'll just print out our key over
here and we'll leave a space obviously
we've got to append these things on so
don't forget the full stops and now when
we save this even though our keys are in
jumbled up order here they should appear
in sorted order in the browser so fruit
1 was apples but as you can see fruit 1
is actually in the second position
position here but then we sorted it into
the correct position over there cool so
that's how you use the different sort
functions in PHP I hope this comes in
handy guys and as always thanks for
