in here and welcome to this tutorial on
yeah how to set up a Photoshop grids so
this is tutorial number five in my build
a website from start to finish series
and if you jump over to asana you can
see I've ticked off the previous two
tasks that we took care of in the
previous videos doing research and
researching current design trends so now
let's move on to this one and create our
Photoshop grid so I'm going to jump over
to photoshop and you can see that this
is pretty much what I'd like to have
done by the end of this video I'd like
to have a Photoshop grid setup for a
desktop size screen and then another one
setup for a mobile phone screen and I am
gonna be doing this using artboards and
yeah our pods are a relatively new
feature in Photoshop so if you are going
around downloading grids from other
websites you're probably not going to be
able to have this feature available
where you have your desktop and your
mobile phone screen exactly next to each
other or right next to each other so you
can compare designs so yeah artboards is
a again like I said it's a relatively
new feature it hasn't been around all
that long and I'm gonna show you guys
how to set up a grid with these two in
the same Photoshop file I think
previously what people would have to do
is they'd set up grids in multiple files
of one for one screen size one for
another screen size and one for the
other screen size and essentially you'd
have to have more than one Photoshop
file open at a time and you'd have to
view and compare grids in such a way
that they were always in a different
file whereas here we're gonna be using
artboards next to each other so before
we actually jump into creating our
artboards i do want to give you guys a
little bit more background information
for those of you guys who don't have
photoshop or for some reason cannot
afford photoshop you guys can also use a
free alternative which is called photo
pia and photo pia is a
based alternative and it does pretty
much everything Photoshop can do so it
can actually open up Photoshop files so
if you hit file and open you can
actually open up a Photoshop file so I
think I have one and the tutorials and
build a website from start to finish and
mock designs I actually have a Photoshop
design that I have set up previously and
yeah
Photo Pia opens this up perfectly fine
you can see we've got the grid here in
front of us and we're able to view and
edit anything we want the only
disappointing part about this is that
there are certain things about photo pia
that you know photoshop has perfected
and photo pia doesn't have that quite
there yet so if i hit view and guides i
can hide and show guides but i have to
do it this way around whereas if i go
back over to photoshop i can do it with
a keyboard shortcut which is just
command and semicolon and that will hide
and show the guides so they are not in
my way okay so now that we've got that
information out of the way i also just
want to mention to you that you can
download a uikit grid at any point in
time so if you go over to google and
google UIKit grid for photoshop you'll
see the first link available here goes
to be hans and yeah it's got a little
download link to download some PS DS
which i already have downloaded and in
fact i've already opened them up in
Photoshop as well it's these these two
grids here so yeah for some reason when
people do designs they like to put
little background colors background
stripes in there I I'm not really a fan
of that so I prefer to just add in the
grids and then leave my background white
and I'm going to show you guys exactly
how to set this up now so let's hit file
and new with Photoshop open and of
course that is going to take us to this
new document window and I'm going to go
over to the web tab
and from here I can choose a bunch of
standard sizes that have already been
set up by Photoshop you can see that
we've got web most common so the reason
why this one is the most common is
because pretty much every single cheap
Windows laptop uses 13 1366 pixels or a
screen that is 1366 pixels and width so
anything that is like fairly cheap and
affordable it's probably gonna be using
this size and that's why it's the most
common because most people will buy the
cheaper stuff and then web Lodge is 1920
by 1080 so we know that this is pretty
much the standard size of any desktop
screen I don't think there's even
desktop screens that are sold that are
smaller than this resolution at the
moment if they are like honestly I think
just really really poor people are
buying them or companies that are trying
to save a lot of money but for the most
part yeah we're all using 1920 by 1080
I'm sure at least and then we've got web
medium so web medium is more the size of
my Macintosh screen so my Mac is a
15-inch Mac and yeah my screen is pretty
much the size except the fact that I do
have a Retina display so actually every
one pixel is 2 pixels which means my
screen is double the size of this but
hey yeah this is pretty much what my my
screen gets rendered out to be so I'm
gonna be choosing the web medium
function over here or web medium
template and that's because you don't
really have to worry about the
difference too much between web most
common and web medium they're pretty
much the same thing but I think I'm just
going to design for my screen at the
moment and then before you actually
click create make sure that you've got
this artboards checkbox selected because
if the artboards checkbox is not
selected you're not going to be able to
create artboards so that's super super
super super super important and yeah
I've got a feeling that maybe somebody's
gonna forget to tick this box and leave
a comment below I'm very free afraid
that but I have stressed enough so just
go ahead and check that box and hit
create and now we have our first
artboard setup and this is 1440 pixels
in width so now I can go ahead and
create my grid so let's hit view and new
guide layout and yeah what I'd like to
do here is have 10 columns and the
reason why I want to use 10 columns is
because if I go over to UI kits website
which is the front-end framework we're
going to be using for this website or
for our design you can see that the
maximum amount of columns that it
actually has here is 10 columns so if
you're used to bootstrap or if you use
to another front-end framework a lot of
these front-end frameworks have 12
columns but uikit has 10 there is a very
big difference between UI kits and the
others so yeah just make sure that when
you're setting this up in Photoshop
we're using 10 columns not 12
okay gutter is gonna be 30 pixels and
then we're going to need to add in some
left and right margin and the reason why
we're gonna have to do that is because
yeah basically right now our columns are
reaching all the way to the edge of my
canvas and of course I don't really want
that to happen because yeah again I can
go over to ui Kids website and if you
take a look at the customizer and if you
wait for everything to load you can see
that it gives you some container max
width sizes and yeah these are
changeable but I think the default is
going to be 1200 pixels and I'm just
gonna go ahead and keep that default
which means that yeah the largest my
website can actually be is 1200 pixels
and then I want to have a container that
is going to be centered in the middle of
the screen so let's go over to my
calculator and we need to calculate our
margins here basically so if I say 1440
which is the current size of my canvas
now and I'm minus 1200 pixels which is
the largest our container can possibly
be
I get 240 right so what I could do at
this point is set a right margin of 240
pixels and that's gonna put everything
or all the margin on the right meaning
that this is now going to be the size of
our container where everything is
pressed up against the left of course I
don't want that to happen so I'm gonna
divide that 240 by 2 and I think my
maths is solid enough to know that
that's going to be 120 by 120 on the
left and the right and so now we've got
the margin here and a margin here and
we've basically got our container if I
drag out a rectangle shape tool here
basically I can have my content my
container over here in the middle of the
screens that would be the size of our
container right so now that we've got
that one set up let's take a look at
creating our second dartboard for a
mobile phone so I'm gonna go over to the
top of my Photoshop file here and what
is normally the move tool can actually
also be changed into an artboard tool
but only if you remember to check tick
the the artboards button when you set
this up right and now i can create a new
artboard over here so I'm gonna just go
ahead and drag and drop any size and
from here I can now go over to the Edit
bar at the top here and I can choose a
preset so I can choose iPhone 6 as a
preset and you can see that Wow it has
made a really big iPhone screen size so
in comparison I mean this is a computer
desktop this is an iphone size
I don't know what Photoshop was thinking
actually I do know what Photoshop was
thinking they've basically accounted for
the fact that an iPhone this phone has a
Retina display and because it has a
Retina display wherever they would
normally be one pixels there's actually
four pixels so we kind of just need to
have all of these
pixels or pixel amounts so instead of
being 750 this needs to be 375 and
instead of being 136 this needs to be
667 and that is pretty much our iPhone
screen size that's actually what it
turns out to be and there is a way for
you guys to double-check this by the way
so if you go over to your browser and
you type in what is my browser size you
can also Google this on your phone open
up one of the websites and it'll pretty
much tell you what your screen size is
so you can see right now my browser size
is 1440 in width by 799 in height and
the reason why I think it's accounting
for a lower height is just the fact that
my browser only starts here and so it's
it's taking all of this stuff out of
account also if I made my browser
smaller mmm do you think I can't
actually do this yeah you see the number
goes down right so yeah the height isn't
really important it's the width that is
very important and yeah let's jump back
over to photoshop and yeah you can see
that now I've got my iPhone grid set up
there and what I'd like to do is say
view okay with the artboard 2 or iPhone
we can actually rename this to I phone
and Mac we can rename my screen sizes
but with my iPhone artboard selected
let's hit view new guide layout and
we're going to do the same thing 10
columns with a gutter of 30 pixels but
instead of having a left margin we're
going to have that set to 0 pixels and
instead of having a right margin we're
gonna set that to 0 pixels and I now
have my iPhone grid set up perfectly
fine
and so there we go I now have the grid
created for both my Mac and my iPhone
and I think what I'm going to do is make
