that after lunch is regularly
challenging to enough focus of anything
except basically chilling out and having
kind of food coma so hopefully I will
keep you awake today people are like
glancing and then passing by don't will
be attractive enough to go in
you know it's almost like an exam right
now is like dead silence even though I
have
okay majority of them of you okay that's
good how many of you are from Europe
okay see that one British the gentleman
the bus together well do we have anyone
from us no one from us oh no one
gentleman okay do we have do one anyone
from Asia okay here okay that's nice
that's nicer presentation but i see that
Australia Dominic I don't know why okay
I think that made you slowly can't start
what do you think I fear yeah okay how
did you enjoy the lunch good good food I
think that yeah it was really good
because you're like kind of food common
or cheering go to do is good okay today
we'll be talking kind of you know it's
related before would be like gluttony
because blood on you usually when you're
talking about that is related with like
you know eating a lot and a lot which
features could be similar in terms of
people want more and more and then
suddenly realize that even have a lot
off on our plate well sometimes we can't
eat it and sometimes in terms of the
feature we just increased the complexity
and it's not really that you know good
as we fought in the first place so my
name is customer of them and there will
be your host today and the title of my
talk is how to defeat feature gluttony
and I see one personal sized oh come on
come on no told you guys I'm not looking
at active enough well okay but I hope
that you'll enjoy method anyways so what
this feature gluten is actually about
this is the carving I start talking
about so once more and more the question
is why and we will try to answer this
question during my talk and also I try
to give you a bit of a recipes how we
can deal with it and how we can maybe
improve and how we can talk with our
business partners and in our technology
partners in order to avoid constant
growing wishlist which
fortunately sometimes happens so Who I
am I'm Ketchum originally I'm from
Poland is the country in Central Europe
but Lesnar right now I'm based in London
so that's why I don't have like lovely
British accent I'm really strongly
connected with agile community I was
coordinator of agile in Europe which is
that agile unconference really popular
I'm also part of the community which is
called a jolly new year ops so the same
as a conference surprise in back home in
Krakow where I'm originally from I was
part of well I was one of the organizers
of our jolene enthusiasts and feel free
to follow me on Twitter how many of you
guys use Twitter perfect so you can also
tweak you can make pictures if you like
something if you doesn't like something
though well you can treat as well but
you also really I like feedback i would
like to improve it now we add up people
like to improve so if you spot something
that could be better just let me know we
can discuss after the talk or you can
tweet i prefer talking communication is
the key i also have my own blog so feel
free to check it out i try to also
described kind of nice tips around how
to improve communication how to improve
requirement gathering and all those
things connected with with scope and if
you don't want to treat don't want to
talk with me and don't want to read my
blog but you have still questions you
can reach out to me via email so let's
start what the gluttony is and why
actually it's bad or actually is it bad
because you know we are paid for
delivering features after all so leave
our customers want more and more
features it's good isn't it we get money
so we can pay our bills but they're on
the other hand sometimes it makes our
life more miserable because our software
is getting more and more heavy maybe one
other question before I go forward with
this and how many of you works in
startups
case you and how many of you work in
like companies 500-plus of sight ok here
ok another question how many of you
worlds and products that are older than
one year ok keep your hands up older
than five years older than ten years ok
older than 15 years my god fielder a few
heads up oh there's m20 I'm scared to
ask ok I will that more so in terms of
my background I'm currently I'm a
consultant but before I was working in
software vendor company software house
and internal IT department so I seen
like full path I was working and I was
advising for start-up and as well as for
companies that are more established on
the market so I work in a various
environment and basically what i saw
that basically if our software grew
older it's like more and more difficult
if you have a lot of features especially
those that are not really crucial ones
but we will talk around this during my
talk so returning to the point ok what
is so bad around if we are delivering
their the stuff that customer wants and
maybe without verification well you know
all the stories have some examples in
your life I've seen you your lives we
basically our software starts to be a
bit heavy and overweight and you can see
ok I'd say ok those cartoons that i'm
using they are funny but is it like in
your life like that so insistent if you
have like big system that is kind of erp
base and you can still do whatever you
want let me see if i will be able to
switch it down so you have a lot of
features you're adding more and more
your performance is slowing down but
somehow you know in the end of the day
it just works right so our users are
able to finish their work and it's
basically kind of fine but what happens
when basically our software is like
growing and growing we are adding new
features we know that it's like
starting to do risky and then we just
are asked for the event is one last
feature and suddenly become like have
this on the production so instead of
like running we are like spelling by
failing I mean basically crashing on the
production and everything is fine if we
have a way to get up really quickly and
easily but sometimes we don't especially
with the software that are a bit older
so I'm sticking to people who are like
10 plus old software maybe not
everything has automated tests returned
through it maybe there is no full
coverage of tests as well so even don't
know if we can predict if something will
fail after adding another feature and
change this oh my god changes to the old
features are having more the most
terrifying thing ever because you don't
know what will happen especially if you
don't have any tests written to it so
then basically people like you know
productive online product person usually
ask oh just one more just one more just
one more and you are a bit guilty of
that situation because you are not now
we are just thinking oh you know we have
brilliant team they are each time
developing the features that we want so
maybe we can submit we cyst one small
thing and suddenly we are growing with
the scope growing with the requirements
and stuff as I showed happen so
basically we have troubles on the
production okay so in a nutshell how it
basically affects our product so do we
have any UX people on the room 12
so what it's starting to be challenging
is trying to wrap up the complexity that
we have in our product into 90 wide and
I'm not saying that our product
shouldn't be complex because that's the
idea right we try to solve their complex
business problem with good IT solution
that should be easy and smooth but if we
have too much features especially with
squeeze bell on the one screen then
starting to be challenging maybe instead
of having one really heavy app we should
have to maybe that the solution may be
the most of the solution our users don't
know where which path to follow because
there are lost also you know complexity
of our code base underneath it's also
growing if we start adding features our
team is growing so communication between
team members also kind of challenging
because it's more and more and good work
users they're always saying that they
want more but there is about this time
that have if they have enough to fill
the fulfill their task they will ask for
more but then they will just feel lost
and suddenly they will just see okay I
can't find the feature I actually really
need to have and maybe sometimes there
is a not core functionality features
that we are adding maybe those are
things that actually doesn't influence
our core business process and are kind
of you know additional shiny new things
that are not giving any business value
to actual users so one more thing that
is also really challenging if we add an
add more and more features or baby p
feature requests it's like a clock
itself and again maybe I shouldn't tell
it because if we have more requirements
you need more people like me select
product people but in the end of the day
we are not producing code right and in
the end of the day documentation backlog
requirements are not working code and
it's not something that we are paid for
we are paid for delivering something to
the production and if we have like
troubles with having been
you know rod McGrew a road map really
far ahead then we need army of people
like product-specific in order to
maintain the road map and the deadlines
and deliverables and also what it means
that we start to commit and if we are
told that all you know we are working in
agile you now and then someone says
they're working measure but we have
roadmap till 2020 and I thinking okay
where is the flexibility how you can add
new things that are at hawk if you have
commitments for certain days it just
just doesn't work like that and I just
said magic word agile how many of you
know what it is okay there's a few hands
if you have they're not a bad i don't
know it's like like being skeptic and
saying agile is bad or it's more like
okay i just don't bother how many of you
work in agile okay perfect how many of
you know agile manifesto who is willing
to tell it out okay yeah you know the
trouble with modern kind of doing agile
is that we are adapting kind of scram we
have stand up we have iterations and
basically that it sometimes if you are
lucky you have retrospective in the end
sometimes we have planning and we have
the timing only because someone needs to
produce the roadmaps two years ahead so
they need estimates so they could lead
to a planning session and let's waste
eight hours for plan everything ahead
for two years up and let's waste another
time to basically produce the backlog
for this but this is a different
discussion I thought itself is a
philosophy I will talk about it as well
later on so just having the iterations
and working in the manner like this it's
not axion agile because we are not
adaptive and this is that this is the
whole point so then after the roadmap if
we estimated all of those things the
back of itself is a issue as well why
because it grows and if we have like
thousands of user stories or backlog
items or however you call them because
there is a plenty of fans
names for the backlog items you just
don't know what it is and what the
priority is the priority changed or not
because it's too many and even if you
have army of the product people they
need to communicate between each other
and we are creating waste and yes I
agree some companies has really huge
product itself so it's not really easy
to work in agile manner and make the
size of the backrub backlog in their
reasonable manner no reasonable I names
on having like 10,000 user stories and
one of the companies I was advising for
I started with the backlog decks
basically was given to me and they say
okay that's 1053 user stories deal with
it and maybe 1,000 doesn't sound that
bad but if you have one person it's just
not manageable so if you have the
backlog just ask yourself a question is
manageable by one person if not then it
means that maybe it should be cut down
another thing is the purge is that I
test if you have this reauthorization
takes time so this is another waste so
just imagine that you have room full of
business people that are connected that
need to prioritize it because they are
pretty senior stakeholders then you have
also well in the room should technology
people because without them they can't
do prioritization because this is
different level of the technology
complexity so usually people want to
know if they prioritize slightly
differently how it influenced the
magical timelines and magical deadlines
because obviously we work in agile but
we won't know when it will be delivered
right so we have the expanse of people
in the room for an hour or two in there
in terms of to make the protonation of
tens of thousand items and probably we
just discussed three or four because
then there is no enough time so this is
another issue that we struggle if you
have a lot of requests another thing is
how to document it and you can like
those people who know the agile
manifesto can like they come and watch
the hell the documentation is doing even
here right in agile we are saying that
we should have like you know
communication over documentation and
stuff like that however you know after a
few years of having the software
development you seem to have some user
guides you need to have some something
in order to know what actually is built
personally I recommend to having a test
rather than documentation because no one
read it and basically it ends up like
this so it's like a big fake we just put
whatever just to have it done and dusted
so automated tests are usually better if
people actually writing them well as
well but it's another issue okay are you
freaking you are silent so I'm afraid
that is okay well i will try to make it
more entertainment because next part is
about cleaning up but let's quickly sum
up why having too many teachers that
works or basically maintaining is like
difficult for our product and basically
hard for us so obviously one side if you
have a lot of features a lot of things
in the backlog we'd probably get paid
right but on the other hand we have
troubles with our UI design we have
troubles with the complexity and also
our users in the end are not happy even
though they ask for those features and
we delivered them so as well as
maintaining our own backlog and our
roadmap it's another thing because it
just creates waste in terms of time and
money and then we say okay why
development so expensive right those are
the main issues that we are facing and
then we try to figure that okay how to
basically clean it up and how to make
communications to our customers but
maybe we can make it easier maybe
instead of having five features that are
doing more or less the same thing we can
have one maybe instead of this beautiful
exit actual spreadsheet integration
maybe we can just write API and the
system can communicate with each other
you know without human interface that
actually uploads the XO stretchy
the system I know weird idea but api's
are working pretty well so what we can
do so one of the idea that seven times
development team are doing is trying to
the estimate because if you were anyway
first to do the estimates why not you
start on how about you guys do you think
it's good idea raise your hands if it
thinks it's a good idea to start point
okay there is a few people okay well we
can scare the customers with the story
point that's true because it would give
like really high estimate it was
something that they totally don't
understand because if we estimate in
t-shirt sizes story points or whatever
we use they usually don't have a clue
they have their own magical spreadsheet
where they put those numbers and then
they produce their deadlines and their
budget and they may be our skirt for the
first time but for the second time they
already know that you delivered
previously they're highly estimated
thing to the production and everything
was fine so because you know our
developers are so skillful that even
though they put the huge estimate
because of its really difficult they did
it so we are proud of it and then learn
obscure so what what else the story
points are not the best idea so first of
all as I said our business don't know
what third point is maybe actually I
should start from asking in the room how
many of you know what third hold up okay
everyone almost three people don't
didn't the right hands why you don't use
the third point or don't know or don't
believe okay so in a nutshell third one
is the way of measuring that kind of
effort required to deliver one of the
backlog items that you have and it
should be consistent of like three
things one is the complexity one is risk
and one Steine basically for business
people this is just a number as I said
they basically are used also to those
numbers to be big even though in terror
in agile
if you have story bigger than 13 you
should like split into smaller parts but
sometimes we just can't because this is
the reality and something is really
complex really difficult and we have no
clue how to break it down for instance
you are writing them I don't know some
forecasts engine and it's full of really
heavy algorithm and mass which is
basically depends on one of the other
and you can't deliver half of the engine
because it simply won't produce the
forecast what else they usually have
their access so they put this number and
then translate themselves sometimes
without even asking us so they have no
clue that Third Point actually represent
us all the complexity for them is that
just measurement of time why because
third ones usually are used also in the
context of the sprint so during the
Sprint the team so stringent design
books where the development team is
doing them the work this is used during
them having a scrum there are also other
methodologies but for simplicity just
assume that we have scrum usually we
have average numbers of storage points
delivered by the development team
because it's average we just assume the
story points are equal equal and we can
do the average in practice I would argue
because the teams are different
especially if you have more than one
team and we try to compress the response
it's not usually the case that we even
can compare them because those are
different set of people and they
differently estimate so sometimes you
have the guerrilla ridiculous situations
that some things are the very delivering
like five story font which is actually
like really nice set of the features
that are actually working under are
tested after the sprint and they look
really bad because another team is
delivering 23 points and none of their
features actually working so it's really
tricky in order to compare them to make
the average and say TT to use them but
here we go we have burn down charts that
show the storyboards and all other
things that help us to bring some
transparency to the
yes but the question is if it's actually
transparency or not that will discuss it
during the talks no worries hopefully I
answered the question is more clear now
perfect why also the excels are
dangerous again deadline sometimes if we
give any numbers or even t-shirt sources
it means that we just committed to
something even though it really didn't
want to until wasn't pay attention the
most important thing I cut for the end
our business prospers actions don't
understand that the big estimate in this
case was given because it's not
beneficial for business this is also
kind of misunderstanding between like
technology people and business people we
really want to be one team but we don't
speak the same language business
sometimes speaks in a language we don't
understand and we speak in a language
like story points but they don't
understand so that's why the in that
this miscommunication happens if you are
working in small company in start-up
usually we don't have this kind of
issues because the number of people is
smaller with easier to communicate when
our company is growing and we were
working in for instance a setup that we
have the company that actually orders
the software and software vendor it's
starting to be more challenging because
we have few people in a way in a chain
that me to communicate the customer that
actually the request that they have is
difficult and it's not beneficial for
them for instance you have like
marketing people sales people in between
that also needs to be aware that it's
not only costly it's also not really
good from the software strategy
perspective okay so basically how to
clean up on how to communicate those all
things as I basic respect so first of
all how to start the best way to start
is always to having a vision that's
having a vision it's difficult right
because if we have something put in the
linear manner people automatically will
fit date to it and say okay you just
committed it you just gave me the order
of the features so
roadmap issue is really hard how we
solve it in the companies I worked with
product tree what basically this so you
are producing the nice diagram could be
mind map we are using tricks only
because it's visual and as you can see
in New your life bases are not merging
to each other and it's easier to say to
our business that if we keep our
features separately that they are not
much and they are not intervened we are
just getting rid of the complexity and
we are getting rid of the dependencies
that are really hard to track later on
if our software will grow older so what
we have we have liked current style box
and anything which is like future
current and books can be sprint if we
are working in a scram manner if you are
working incumbent convent manner we
decided that we'll be working for let's
say a month this could be a month of
work everything outside is basically I'm
defined in terms of when we are doing it
why just all some flexibility let's have
an example my favorite example is like
fingerprinting it was the new LP few
years back but what basically happens
let's say that we are like producing
application like customer applications
for banks and then apples have this
beautiful innovation with fingerprint
login if you are one of the first that
actually deploying the login via
fingerprint to the production it's like
really good from like marketing
perspective our customers will love it
and basically it's really good if you
have brought much three years ahead and
dependencies and other people actually
think that you deliver something you
can't quit innovative ideas into your
backlog it may be there is some
flexibility but not this kind of this
level if you have it on the idea of
level like for instance integration with
like new technologies or new ways of
logins you just can take me one of the
features and put your to your time books
that you are working on the final and
deliver it will send the ten books that
you having in mind sounds really are
indeed it's in the real case not because
business is not usually
ready to cooperate that manner when I'm
trying to convince my business
colleagues why we should do it I usually
give them a example of actual
application they use for my banking
system because once I had the
fingerprint login I changed my bank to
the one that actually allows it it
sounds ridiculous but a lot of customers
actually do it in terms of like
application just to make what is easier
for you especially the product of a core
products of the banking systems are
really really similar and there is no
major difference between them this can
be differentiated even though its
technology and happening across the
business if you have example of uber
what basically did two taxis right
example of our B&amp;amp;B how it's basically
right now works for like booking the
rooms and there's a plenty of other
things like that that thief our business
is able to adapt technology in order to
serve them it just can win the market so
this is the flexibility and how
basically in really how to prepare it
right because this looks nice and you
can say ok how to go to the state that
you actually can music so first of all
it's worth to basically define what are
those branches those branches are like
modules of the applications for instance
and those are features there are not
user thursday at those are the ideas
that we need to define and detailed we
keep them high level why because if we
detailed the stuff that we want to do in
the future then after half a year maybe
just a way maybe the technology is old
and we don't want to go there maybe we
have new idea maybe just word goes
forward faster than we thought and
basically we waste our time to write
beautiful specification to agree on
details and then it waited and we didn't
even want to do it so this is the pure
way if we have like one liners or like
few words around it it's a good enough
to keep the idea in mind and if you want
we can detailed it in a manner that
actually shoot the environment
around us so after having this and
basically knowing what is our time box
we can actually start thinking okay what
of those feelings we actually want to do
and this is the metric that I am also
trying to convince people to use money
everyone understands we want to have a
profit what is this love thing so each
of our application have some core
functionality that we want to curl take
care of sometimes we want to have
beautiful UI and you are like focusing
on it sometimes you want performance so
we need to assess our new feature it is
actually improved for instance our
usability or it improves our performance
so it's basically worth doing it while
we actually should do it this is another
question we asked to show in the
corporate world lean startups is there
weird concept no one test the idea
scissors at least mental test if it
actually makes sense does our brilliant
idea exactly fifth of something right
even in power is it actually someone
there who is willing to pay for it is it
actually improving our performance at
least that we can then assess our
assumption what usually happens is we
have users during the backlog we deliver
it and we have no assumptions connected
with any profits from it like anything
so what we can do is basically taking
the ideas from our current time box and
try to assess at least mentally where
they are so basically this corner is the
most profitable in terms of a kite it's
something good for our our application
and should be like this in return of the
investments some people call it MVP it's
like easy way to define it if you have
noticed everyone asks you for MVP MVP
could you give me it's like one of the
ideas you can do important changes just
to assess this together with business so
make a meeting stay together in the room
discuss the ideas and understand why
something is for instance profitable and
something is not and also from
technology perspective
is also a lowes to business people
understand why something actually
improves our software and why something
is not also we need to have a bit of
self check maybe one of this card is
actually security and maybe it's even
not in the corner but we need to have it
I mean let's say that we have this
logging feature in our app and we just
ignore security and someone will just
you know take all our customer details
pretty bad especially if you are banking
probably we wouldn't want that so always
comments bands needs to win with all
those kinds of methods of sorry that we
are using because otherwise we can end
up really badly and again assessing this
kind of things just helps to bring in
the conversation and understanding in
the same place because this is visual
people are in the same will the same
room they are using the sticky notes and
there are like talking and now you can
ask me okay but what will happen if we
are cooperating via WebEx or any other
conference tool that we actually not
sitting with the same room right it's
getting more and more challenging so for
the three I would advise having a mind
map for this again we can use any of the
drawing tools like vision omnigraffle is
plenty of them or even PowerPoint
because it's just picking the things
into one of the other corner more
entertaining if we are in the same room
but can be can be done so how it looks
into your life for instances yes
so the lovers part no no this is more
like for instance that you are writing
the ticket engine like basically you
customers are looking to our flight
tickets and you need to fill the pricing
engine that will calculate the price of
the ticket and allows you to book so
loving that perspective will be the
performance why because people are lazy
just imagine that you are searching for
our flight and we want to book it with
sundar place the price that you are
interested in in let's say to Millie 6
milliseconds so we are happy if we press
and we are white five minutes then it
starts to be tricky in terms that
probably someone just click exit and
turn all different booking engine
because our was too slow so depending on
the product this love will be different
sometimes maybe you are more concerned
about you I maybe we are doing the
website for her dresser and our
customers are women and they can't wait
two seconds because for them is just you
know looking and stirring for some nice
pictures of the hairstyle and they are
not bothered but they want to have
really nice you are in terms that they
are looking for something pretty if
everything depends what is the call
function of our application what's meant
to be doing because it will vary and I
know that now I will sound like a
consultant it depends and if you have
the travels is like assessing what is
the ones he think in your tool you can
move it like having like view of this
kind of charts I wouldn't advise to put
it on the one even though we can have
three dimension if we have good
imagination we can have four dimension
but then it's adding complexity and from
my perspective when I cooperate with
busy business people they don't like
complexity they like simple things that
allows them to actually understand our
decision and help in asserting their
decisions because you know if you ask
business people for prioritization they
sometimes have the gut feeling that this
feature will be like you know really
good but they can't actually explain why
this is
I think that can help in actually
bringing the students discussion up and
saying oh you know I think this feature
is good because actually it brings money
maybe it's obvious but sometimes we
don't fit so this could be this or maybe
it's good because we think it's good
performance at least from the business
side and then technology people say oh
no no connecting with this overseas
database with tickets from let's say
some weird island and no one even
thought that it exists it's not good
idea because then each query will be
taking longer because we need to query
this overseas server maybe it in China
so it's really hard to get in and we
maybe even lose the connection between
and won't be able to get back down sir
so it's actually terrible idea so this
is the level of conversation that we can
bring in and validate our assumption of
the both sides but what else we can do
once we have this corner over here
assess you can actually see that there
is a plenty you know what happens
usually do during those sessions that we
have only few that are like less
important and everything is really
profitable and everything is really
improving right so what we can do next
because we still need to pick what is
basically happening I use another matrix
just to see okay is it improving the car
business functionality of the tool or
not let's say that again we have the
example of the booking engine right and
let's say that we want to have the one
of the features that the first feature
that we want to have in a queue is let's
say someone would like to book the
ticket and choose the color of the
aircraft maybe it's new hits their way
of booking tickers you don't care about
price you just want to choose the color
of your aircraft in order to have that
does some dodgy date pestered you need
to connect in and you are tracking two
okay I know that from my perspective one
of the thing is how quickly I can
retrieve my my booking and the price
another is let's say you I and how
complex UI is in terms of actually
picking this color and let's say the
third thing is if I actually can do
booking afterwards once I retreat
at that price right so those are the
three core things that I've actually
caring about if I'm doing the booking
engine and let's say that in the first
case so the performance actually it's
pretty bad because this database is
somewhere and it's disconnected and I
have really a lot of troubles with 80 is
so i can guess that's actually do a
stroll down it's my assumption later on
we'll talk about validating it then in
terms of the UI maybe actually it's not
hard to improve the UI in order to that
add one chat box with pic of the colors
so it's not influencing bad and could be
good from the marketing perspective
because you say all you see it's
beautiful new feature no other booking
engine has the color of the aircraft so
now you can shoot the pink one if you
wish or red or blue and then you can
basically try to assess okay if it's
good or bad why we are saying that
there's like three three heesun 380
business things because if you have to
it's hard to tell right because one is
good another is bad and then which is
the winning one if you have three it's
not too complex and you can still pick
if you start growing probably five it's
still okay but nine it starts to be like
time-consuming because like the quick
thing that allows you to access is the
idea is actually making sense or not if
we decide that it makes then you can
obviously measure the performance and
all the things that I was talking about
and then check the numbers why I put
this magical thing over here because at
the beginning when we discuss the ideas
and we don't have yet the detailed
requirements because this is the stage
that we don't have detailed requirements
we just don't know and trying to put the
number well I know few magicians that
have let you know the special crystal
ball and they're saying that they can
estimate but in my practical life I've
barely seen good estimates at this level
at harlot where I'm at level why because
there is so many unknown and so many
things that we simply can't predict that
it's really really hard and again we are
wasting time to do the estimates who are
quarreling we are
trying to figure out the number and then
in the end of the day there will be
someone hotel oh you know you committed
to that number and it's not correct
white even if we try to do our best so
that's why it's better to use something
like you know these funny things but
maybe our business will be like laughing
from but at least give us some kind of
quick answer okay those are the ideas
that are wolf worth to basically
detailed out again unfortunately work
it's not so easy and good for everyone
and sometimes we need to use estimates
some people are bold and things you know
quit the job if they ask you for
estimates I'm not so bold maybe because
I'm consultants and I say it depends but
basically you can also bring some flavor
to the estimate and make them more
understandable for people across and
making them more high-level quicker one
of the ideas was just using those funny
faces another is asking to add the
distribution if you remember the diagram
and show you with the arrow why this is
one of the things that we can use to
assessing business value ourselves
because if something is in the damn
corner and then businesses whole no no
it's actually having a big business
value then we can start asking questions
okay why because maybe there is
something behind the money maybe it's
not something that gives you action
money but may be good for marketing
perspective or for something else that
we need to understand is actually good
to deliver and sometimes we fail in
communicating back another is actually
giving their number which represents the
risk why because as I said people don't
understand that the response includes
the risk if we have explicit or is
written down it's easier to actually
understand so let's say that we have the
store user stories of the backlog items
and storage for those who are not
familiar with agile and with the
sequence that it used 21 it's really
really
geeks again some teams don't bother and
have the big SMS in practical life this
is really complex really risky and very
time-consuming so what we can do it will
have this user stirring and let's stick
to the example I said at the beginning
so we are the bank we have the login
system and we want new way of logging
and let's say this new way of logging is
this fingerprint but across the devices
or maybe voice recognition login because
fingerprint is no longer I think right
because now it's everyone so let's say
that we have voice recognition and we'll
say okay we have no clue about this
technology is risky because security
issues we have no clue how to do it in a
way that maybe someone else voice won't
be recognized for my customer but
something that value may be tricky maybe
they know another thing to be and
basically we see that it will sell and
maybe we just got from our customers
from other banks just because it has new
fancy feature connected with voice
recognition what we can do if we really
don't want to do this feature we can
break it down to alternatives that we
can actually present okay let's do
something else which is slightly less
risky it's still big because it's new
technology it has lower business value
because let's say this is all devices
and that they do this device that is
most frequently used by our customers so
maybe it's android phone for instance
because our customers are using android
maybe it's Windows Phone who knows but
this is made with you I don't know what
your laughing guys the surface so who
knows what this is basically it's
something that you can easily detect
just looking at your database and
determine okay what are our main
customer base so what we are targeting
then we reducing the other its coverage
because you are just targeting one
technology so it's easier and maybe
instead of voice recognition we have
something else that it may be easier in
terms diagn a GP Restless scheme so we
can present it it's you know any way it
can be game changer as well but because
you're
using the number of devices and
technologies it's easier to experiment
with on the other hand we can also
present something totally different so
instead of voice recognition I think
that some android phones have like
custard so let's say gastro drug login
which can be a bit risky because someone
can see our guest the gesture and is
easier to see the oxy typing the numbers
that are usually our passwords these are
value is probably low because not a lot
of people may be familiar with the
technology and it's still complex so we
can compare the options and give our
business a choice then it actually
brings the conversation in and we can
see okay what needs of our users of our
aunt user are actually made by the
stories that we are presenting sometimes
we can see that for instance in our
alternative story to the voice-over
login maybe not all the needs are you
know fulfilled because people are using
Siri or additional things and want to
just open my banking account and it's
just happening and I can't do it if I
have this alternative user story so
maybe actually this state okay sorry
guys you still need to do it but maybe
just flop important and you can live
without it at least for the experimental
phase so again this allows us to have
the discussion just quick think remember
to add recommendations in the end
because sometimes those kind of things
are not obvious what we are trying to
fight so if we present all those tables
with all those comparisons just say what
you think is the best way to do it okay
one of the last topics I want to talk
about because features work on me okay
in one side is like adding features and
trying to have more and more and
actually even not assessing if we need
this or not if we did all the exercises
with you know II remember to the tree it
was full of ideas then we went through
the diagram so we pick up only those
from the corner and then we narrow down
even though from the corner by like just
mentally assessing the performance and
stuff and we figured out okay those are
the five items out of
they 20 that we wanted we just did tell
them devil deliver them and then we can
basically except if it was good or not
and measure but how about actually
deleting the wrong ideas right or the
features that we will develop this seems
to be really scary I mean who knows what
will happen right sometimes basically my
dear I collapse right some business when
they're here okay our code value getting
complicated how about removing stuff
that you don't need and they are
terrified oh my god first of all we have
our marketing materials our users pop up
we are using it there is that and what
will happen with the codebase we don't
know if you developers know what will
happen and sometimes we even not
communicating clearly that don't worry
we have automated tests so once we
delete the future everything will work
if we don't have tests then sort of the
I wouldn't suggest even thinking about
deleting but assuming that right now
everyone once of these two have a test
we are just trying to add them so what
it basically means that uncertainty
causes fear so if we put automatic tests
and common type of business that don't
worry we have the coverage and we can
actually experiment with this new
feature and if it's not working we can
remove it it's basically bringing a bit
of a certain digital business that
suddenly our application won't just fall
like the kitten at the beginning when I
show you right because business people
also they're afraid about this that they
will need to face of the customers or
angry users because suddenly starving
broke down and we don't know why okay a
few stories from my life around removing
features my first word was in an
internal IT department and you are
delivering software for dating be
putting apps to the broadcasting TV and
there was a few features that weren't
used at all at least we thought that
they are not you
so we decided okay let's measure if
someone actually clicks there or not so
we put additional into the fold and
start observing we upset for a half a
year no one use it and then was festive
period by first if I mean like Christmas
and stuff we decide to hide the featured
am and guess what it was the feature
that was used only during the festive
period because there was some special
act during the term and needs to be like
specially labeled so then people start
asking like I didn't know we have this
feature but we can't find it I don't
know if something change the UI
fortunately we didn't delete it we just
unhide it and everything was working
fine so one lesson is understand what
you are hiding because you have
seasonality in the applications as well
and we can argue that if something is
used once a year or twice a year maybe
you don't need it sometimes you do be
considered the core business
functionality and you can survive
without it so understand what you were
hiding measure it and if no one
basically says anything for a long
period of time hide it wait a bit just
in case someone will suddenly remember
that it exists communicate across that
you plan to delete it because you have
the numbers that prove that no one uses
it still feed them so you can unhide it
if some will just start arguing that
they needed but if they don't you can
just then delete them having cleaner
coal face this is one of the approaches
that is basically working if you are
more adventurous so we are maybe working
in smaller company and you can hide the
thing and basically do it more in
autonomous way that's even better for
you this is a further advice for the
bed-leg for the big companies with like
a lot of people involved another thing
if you are thinking about hiding
something and you are working for let's
say software vendor or software house
make certain that you communicated
across marketing teams why they have
magical power points and they have chemo
instances so if you hide something on
the new and
demo instant and God forbid your self
person or marketing person just want to
present it to the customer they will
look silly if they look silly because
they have something on the slide and
it's not on the tools they will be angry
at you and also it would be really
awkward situation across the business
okay what why actually it happened so
it's really important to actually
communicate it across and make certain
everyone knows everyone updated their
materials and everyone not happy how to
actually convince people that deleting
is something that we should do
performance so especially if we have
applications that are slightly older and
it's harder and harder to actually keep
selling them because everyone knows that
they're slow you can tell you know
actually we can improve the performance
so it will be easier to tell customers
that is you know nice and quick and
smooth so your job will be easier
another thing is maybe our software will
get more stable you know because if
marketing people need to sell something
that constantly breaks even under the
binos it's hard job for them as well
right we are not happy as a developers
because we have something which is like
breaky and we are not really proud of it
they are not happy because they need to
struggle during the demo presentation so
we can really cooperate and talk to each
other and try to get rid of the things
that are not used it's especially
important if we have old software and or
if we know that our software will be
used and it will be growing and Daniel
will be struggling with performance so
this is like leaving a bit more clarity
and certainty to removing stuff okay
because I'm running out of time I will
try to quickly wrap up and hopefully you
have some questions so why if we were
asked to deliver more and more instead
of just getting the money and get it
shipped we should actually think so
first of all we struggle with the UX
then our customers our struggle with our
yolks as well we struggle ourselves of
the complexity because it's just growing
we have travelled with our road maps and
backlogs because we need army of people
to manage it in East army of developers
to estimated and everyone in the process
getting miserable so how we can actually
try to talk with people and convince
them to change so first of all instead
of having linear roadmap that someone
sticks the data to having something that
is not in a row it could be the product
tree by the way it's from the innovation
game it's really good book with a lot of
ideas so really recommend to adapt I
just a variation of the product tree
there's plenty of other things that you
can use if you are in a distributed
scheme i recommend mind maps because
they are having the same concept so you
can't merge the branches and this means
that you just avoiding the dependencies
which is also important if you get in
grid of them is just easier okay and
next thing that you can actually do out
of all the ideas just select those that
you think are beneficial from the
business perspective and also from key
business process perspective from your
tools then remember that if you are
giving the higher level assessment of
the features it's better than giving
exact numbers because unless you have
the skills of reading from the crystal
ball it's really hard to guess that
except number if you need class they
might try to give alternatives and try
to break down like story points for
something more meaningful as well like
adding risks and adding the business
value because then it helps you to
access one more remark over here if you
struggle tracks you have business
involved in giving your business value
if you have discussing around this you
can try to assert it after all yourself
and they say okay let's double check if
you agree with this sometimes they say
no no you're totally wrong this is lower
because value and then again it's easier
to assess if you are like prepared okay
that's it i hope that you enjoyed both
green one you will be going out and do
you have any questions yes
please okay so there are like those okay
so in terms of the things connect the
leg with refactoring I believe it's
actually business revalue behind us as
well why because it means that we can
maintain our code easier so it's cheaper
it's really hard to measure and justify
in terms of acolytes cheaper especially
for people who don't know but we can try
to learn so especially if you have the
engine related things that you calculate
something and you basically just found
out that maybe instead of using Scala
you should use coupling because it's
that easier for some reason let's have a
second example you can try to measure
how much time on average the current
calculation takes and what are the
improvement that you think that will be
delivered after refactoring so obviously
then you need to assess and sometimes
you will be wrong and instead of having
performance improvement you are going
the same way as you did but this is one
of the approaches also when you are
trying to complete business that fear
factor in Zach she needed again being
like error prone and being certain that
our code base its able it's another
thing that you can drink up in terms and
okay now we are relatively fresh but
let's try to do more I don't want to use
word future-proof because some companies
are like really like time to market and
they don't care if it's featured proof
they want to deliver it because our
competitors are like really
your ass and we want to have something
deployed and then we also need to
understand from technology perspective
okay so maybe we can break down to the
refactoring two part and instead of
doing everything we just do baby steps
so this is the kind of conversation that
needs to understand as well usually if
you are software house we web something
future-proof because it means that we
will develop on top of that especially
if our idea was already a valid data
than we were you are already on the
market and we know that our customers
are buying so maybes actually have time
to invest for something better the scary
thing about refactoring is some people
do refactoring only of the sake of
refactoring and we also need to
understand if the thing that we are
actually touching what are the benefits
right because if it the core feature
that you are doing refactoring and we
know that we build something on top of
that yes done is worth if it's something
that we think that we may delete in the
future and no one knew we'll use it then
I would hesitate if we actually want to
do it another approach is actually a bit
like maybe we're taking one step back is
doing sykes first and then developing
actual figures and then it's easier to
justify why you are switching the
technology because we just obsessed that
you know starving that we used before
it's not really good because I don't
know we can't write our optimization
engine because there is not enough math
function in the language that we choose
or maybe to flow or maybe we just don't
know the language and the entry river is
too high and we can't learn and we don't
have developers to do it so those are
the different things that we can try a
first I will advise to try to read down
the point that you are thinking while
you're thinking that the refactoring
will be beneficial because if you tell
refactoring to the business person they
will ask oh but how I can eat it oh it's
not food so what it is right they don't
understand the word so we need to say
okay it's connected with our work it
will make our work easier we can develop
new functionalities on top of that if we
do it
the performance can be better by I don't
know fifteen percent blah blah blah
depending on what they're a factor
induction death yeah from that point we
were getting are you from yeah do that
yeah we have to grab that limit about
all the pitches well that congressional
yeah exists an ending t so that process
of getting getting busy and it can be
any less durable to trace of a united
would be tough yeah really holla how was
your price so I was once in okay so when
I work in a company was a software that
was developed like before Internet
Protocol just even start to exist and
the company decided okay let's rewrite
it it's 2010 so this is really old we
need new ones so as you can imagine by
this more than 20 years there was like a
lot of features in that old software and
obviously everything was needed for the
customers so first of all it's good to
find smaller customer that is not yet a
customer who haven't seen the original
things when we have the smaller customer
that is willing to invest a bit of their
time to have like filthy data or however
we call it then we try to narrow down
actually cutting from old design and old
features why because first of all time
move forward and actually our customers
don't need the old features but they
don't realize that you know sometimes
you find in the eye overrun so really
quickly saying that sometimes we don't
realize that we are using things that
are not useful and email and we can make
things simpler and instead of having 10
functionalities we can replace it with
one so first step finding someone
willing to experiment second thing will
be like actually
sorry to say getting rid of the old
approach I think the the main enemy
actually will be your business people
who are really used to it but maybe they
can understand if you present okay let's
start from the blank page and try to
produce new ideas from the scratch so if
you haven't been using it start from the
beg actually having brainstorming with
the tree and having blank without even
modules without any ideas so i will just
advise this yes sorry we need to stop
really thank you for the conversation
and thank you for being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
