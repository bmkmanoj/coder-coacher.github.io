you so much for coming along my name is
Dominic Miller I'm the tickler bleed for
zero in Canberra my presentation today
is about managing cats is easier than
herding managing developers so a little
bit about sorry so I run a team in
Canberra and we have 30 developers that
includes sorry groups of testers bis and
project managers so it's an interesting
challenge so I guess the first thing you
ask me is like why are developers really
like cats and it tomates pretty obvious
they're the moody they like to sleep
they like to eat and they do cover up
their mistakes or they do pretty well so
for me it's a pretty close some pretty
close comparison you know we've got to
go back to the early days and think
about why we started out in this game
and to me I always think back to you
know graduating from uni and you know I
became something I was like I started
out as a developer and it was great it
was a wonderful stage of my career or
some people like enough to be testers or
you know you might be a bi and you drink
lots of coffee it's some it's an awesome
start to career because you really
you're very excited about you know
making this start in a wonderful
wonderful career and you've got so many
things are you looking forward to so you
know that's great and then suddenly you
know so maybe a few years you get a
promotion and like wow this is great
I've got a promotion new title maybe
some more money got a phone call
interference I'm so proud of you thon so
well it's career advancement you know
and a LinkedIn update so what could be
better than that you know it's all it's
awesome
hang on the cats or something is
something something I've just missed now
I don't know if you can see but um it's
a little management responsibility
that's interesting but that's okay
because you know managing developers is
really easy we know
we know that all times behind very
similar you've got a well-known set of
instructions for managing people and you
get a handpick experience time and one
of the course things you start out with
one person and then you might get given
another person yeah he's doing to it
really slowly and then you get a mentor
to just cover you all the way all
through your your your period of looking
after people you've got this mentor so
it's really really really quite easy
it's it's it's just you know in fact why
would they even bother mentioning it's
 okay I'm sorry but if I'm gonna
give you one quote to go away from today
it really is just remember this the
reality of managing developers is it's
hard like I said quote me on that
I'm prepared to front Parliament and put
my my reputation on the line I've been
doing it for a long time it's not easy
okay it's it's not um standard you know
production release day that's what it's
like and if you you know that you're
coming and you've got to release it
might be early morning that's what I
deal with anyway but you know you're in
charge you know seriously the buck now
stops with you we know that projects are
complicated we know that they often fail
and and suddenly you know problems
actually they get escalated to you with
that release when it's gone to it's
in your it's in your court and you have
to have mechanisms to deal with it and
managing developers is it's hard work
they're hard work um people don't always
get on well together they have hard days
there's stress and pressure team members
have high expectations they will get
sick and they have pressure outside of
work so you know you might think it's
easy the reality is it's not but the
good news is there's solutions and I
guess that's really why I'm here today
because being a manager of development
homes for as long as I've been doing it
I think I picked up a few little tips
over the years so first number one thing
to remember it's a big jump ok so when
you when you're transition from being an
developer to managing just remember
it's a big big job you need to think big
picture you know to Shepherd your time
and you need to think about things like
suddenly you got to do things like
one-on-ones you know and you do have to
do it don't think I'll just get what I
don't have to do a one-on-one this week
do you one-on-one keep keep contact with
your developers so that you know you
don't know that you actually care about
them um don't be a bully
okay suddenly you've got yeah you've got
a little bit of power and you might be
able to make changes to people's you
know careers and you might be able to
put pressure on don't do it just they
kind be understanding be fair
consistency is important because you
have to be consistent across your entire
team you've got to be as hard on anyone
in that time and really just don't don't
be the bullying prepare for failure ah
classic game I'll that I get on on a
release morning the release has had a
few issues this morning no website the
database hasn't been deployed the
release really has had a few issues this
morning hasn't it um it's it's also part
of what I probably think about the step
a little bit of project management goes
a long way um it doesn't mean you have
to produce Gantt charts or go to coffee
every five minutes like the project
managers what it means is you've got to
you've got to think about just just
tracking a little bit track projects
track your time keep an eye on when
people are sick for periods of time
because the more you do that a little
bit the more you start to realize that
it's your rep as your responsibilities
of being the manager you've got to keep
tracking and pushing projects along and
neither they'll fail like just always
keep in your head it's probably gonna
fail it's a good position to be in
because then you have backup plans and
backup plans is probably what my career
I guess is probably based on um releases
they don't go to plan practice failure
and have contingency plans just keep
keep backup options always open um this
is probably one of the hardest things as
a technical manager try and keep coding
or try and keep the drive to code to
some extent because this is why you got
into the game in the first place you you
didn't really start you didn't
so to do like a university degree or
invest large chunks of your early career
to suddenly go I'm just gonna sit in a
room and watch all this happen like it's
not what you did it you you still got
the drive to keep doing technical stuff
do it um so keep reviewing keep
designing solutions keep uptodate come
to conferences like this like if you've
got the opportunity to come to Indy soon
you know how good it is um come to it it
is just awesome
keep the fire the belly and and most
importantly manage the balance because
at times as a manager you do spend a lot
of time managing um you've just got to
readjust and if you've got to be selfish
at times be selfish have ever died from
home and do the technical work that
still has to be done teach um and think
about the importance of why why you
teach so if you're now in command of a
time you you want to actually teach
people in that time um tell them about
the pitfalls if you've been in
development for some time you'll know
why things fail just you know pass that
on to the next group of people who you
know might have to do this one day think
about good conventions and standards and
thinking about giving people the ability
to step up so someone's going away for a
period of time or you're taking life
give someone the opportunity even just
as an acting opportunity to to take on
the time responsibility and teach them
to teach and one of the big things we do
at 0 is we actively go to universities
and we work with universities and high
schools and we actually teach them about
you know why you would get involved in
this career I'm bringing your tomes into
that and give them the opportunity as
well so so you know even though I've
sort of explained you know it's really
quite hard and I've said there's few
solutions why on earth would you
actually do it like one of the time is
stupid enough to do the job that I do um
pretty pretty obvious money no that's
it's not it's not the only reason it's
not but as part of career growth it
probably does help a little bit it the
key for me is you know in terms of
whether you get to make decisions you
take responsibility it's part of career
growth you might get a pay rise that'll
be great
you get to influence strategy and you
get other skills which is pretty cool
but I think that's all secondary because
most importantly you actually get to see
these developers grow and and this is a
bunch of of our wonderful zero graduates
we have two graduates in this room they
might like to stand up and just get
slightly embarrassed so they're they're
part of you know what I'm really proud
of you know you can say you have the
opportunity to do lots of things to see
developers grow is just priceless so I
just wanted to say thank you so much
happy to have questions after it will
grab me after this session um thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
