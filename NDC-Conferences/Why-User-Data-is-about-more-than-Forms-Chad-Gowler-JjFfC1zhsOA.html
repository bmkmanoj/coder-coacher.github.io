stay so uninformed on the program
because I do have ASL at the beginning
of the tour title when I gave us to it
before I realize there's a very Merry
set of people in our ASL stands for and
some people to alternate on sometimes
too young to know response or too
depressing so I've got to permit or
title but talk so I just a bit about
myself and for your side my name's Chad
and I think the clicker I'm a web
developer and up in the sky up in Leeds
sorry not in time I was i watch this guy
in their lead and so I basically do a
lot of work as make a java script a
little bit of really on the sky.com
website i have also done work for so
I've not always in the words whether
I've also kind of had a brief stint as a
producer which is a bit like a product
owner so kind of things like interactive
design user testing and co-creation
workshopping that kind of stuff and also
my spare time a lot of stuff is going to
go over this talk I kind of do I was
kind of casual training for companies
and stuff like this kind of done talks
firm so kind of do do something about
rubbers my pronouns are they in them i
don't use a she and him i'm going to
actually kind of cover why people might
be telling what their pronouns are and a
little bit later on but if you kind of
treat about this or blog right this or
your first is later my by day or them
not she on cotton on twitter and github
and all of the things and electron cool
and my email address which ipod to the
end if anyone's got questions they want
ask me later on tomorrow you should tell
her graduation subscribe sighted people
are complicated people are complex and
software is nothing without people to
use it okay because if you weren't usual
software eventually women numbers
getting paid software doesn't work
unless people can use it potentially
people a fundamental part of everything
that we do when we build software design
software people complicated we come from
an infinite number
background histories experiences you
know no single person is alike the
problem is computers as computers are
very not complicated and they can kind
of be very complex things that they're
not really complicated as people but we
try to funnel all of these people all
these experiences we funnel them through
kind of single user journeys right to
think about like Amazon if you're buying
a book from amazon we all go through the
same process to buy a book from amazon
we all go to the same process and we
sign up the rise conference ticket for
example even though we've all come from
different countries languages and Sienna
gender socioeconomic backgrounds all of
those things and the way kind of your
excess traditions they opted out with us
it's by trying to cast a really wide net
to catch as many people as possible so
like I want as many people as possible
to be able to buy this book or greater
this journey or use this service and the
kind of Crassus really wide net from the
problem with that is there always a
recent if you leave out people you can't
use your service for ever reason and
also you might have captured users have
attributes or histories or something
that you quite work for expecting so
there are issues with funneling
everybody through single journeys and
we're trying to move away from it I
think and this is kind of what the
future of the web especially so
something like Spotify is discover
weekly where Spotify basically he
doesn't just look at the middle I
listened to looks music everybody listen
to and uses that to generate me a
personalized list of music it thinks i
would like and as kind of you know these
kind of buzzwords like big day and
machine learning is these become easier
more affordable kinders you have like
medium-sized businesses to be able to
kind of handle this information and work
with it we're going to see more and more
of this kind of personalized web and
that's kind of a big thing that's going
on so sighs you're using behavioral data
SMS it's looking at things that I've
listened to my other people listen to
and how things relate to each other but
a way that people can and I do do this
on a smaller scale is to use demographic
data it's to look at you and say okay we
know where you're from we know what
gender you are and therefore we think
you're going to like these products or
you're going to want to use this
churning or you're going to want to use
this tone of our service etc
so it's incredibly war- participants I
guess I'm going to talk a bit about
assumptions and that's from the main
times thruster talk I guess we know that
all responses are wrong it's cuz I can't
believe in the names but we use
assumptions alarms on your stereotypes a
lot but you know in our hearts that
they're wrong and you know it girls like
pink for example it's an assumption we
know it it could be genuinely correct
but we know that it's wrong and then
kind of the inverse of this is we know
that all facts of right and I know this
kind of a very tentative straight for
thing to say or what I mean by this is
where experts right we're experts in our
domain we know you know if you're
working you actually know users you know
you talk to the media research on them
you do testing with them and you're
experts in your domain you know like I
work in the media just do therefore I
kind of have a domain expert and how the
media industry works you know we're the
experts so there are things that we know
in these things are facts and people pay
us because they don't know things the
issue arises when we forget what is an
assumption and what the all our
assumptions become correct there are too
many things that we just know and we
don't remember how we learnt them where
we learned and he taught them to us
there are lots of things we just we just
know animals of housing area yeah we
just know everybody knows like it's
things that are so obvious about people
or culture all these things that you
never really think about whether there's
any scientific backing to them and it's
like there's no evidence for it but it's
a scientific fact sorry know these
things and this is already with people
so that's let's go to an example so i
think this is a little bit still going a
bit kind of like wooly I'm gender so
gender is something I kind of
specialized then I kind of given talks a
lot about gender before and but this is
business things we know about gender we
know that people of males or their
female we know that male and female of
two different things we know I'm not
very good at drawing Venn diagrams but
this is attentional it is right so
people are either male or females are in
one of these circles they're not in both
of these circles
they're not outside to be circled and
that there's no kind of crossover or
these Marines aren't there's like this
is what gender is this is when people
talk to you about the gender binary
disappoint we're talking around which is
how we end up performs a look like this
so when you're asking is what their
gender is you may think to do something
like this or radio button gets used a
lot and everybody who uses your site can
you just drop down and there's no issues
with it these are the thing we know we
know that there is female we know there
is no no there isn't Mammon either as
women we know there is other stuff that
these are assumptions you lots of fact
just facts are kind of really much more
complicated and I've come up with many
torch of analogies Vijender like there
was a worse version as a Venn diagram in
which I've been so this is the generals
gender spectrum analyzer and what all if
I go out this bit is when you're asking
from what their gender is what do you
actually want to know it's a very
complicated question genders actually
built of lots of different things and it
means lots of different things so if we
think about and every day so you think
about chromosomes write something quite
kind of genetics you might say and as
developers I don't think we can people I
don't think we actually want to know
what people's genetics are we know we
have this concept that there's XX for
women and XY is male and this isn't
strictly 100 per century and if they're
not as kind of following the issues
whether there's an ops missions with
athletes and the Olympics athletes who
appear female but you might have Y
chromosomes as there are things like one
in a thousand women right actually have
three X chromosomes and you'll never
know it's not since you don't have any
symptoms nothing is already causing the
effect you might have 3x crimes ranging
up to 2008 a woman go first nothin ye
but she had XY chromosomes but she
naturally still gave birth to a daughter
who also actually had XY chromosomes so
it's not for another ten cent of time
but you're not really asking to what the
criminals are and sexual characteristics
you might think about nagarik Haven
em say we're developing abscess most
when I think the sort for motive the
questions I get a people vote in the
medical industry mr. yeah okay well
we're doing Annapolis about childbirth
we're doing an abscess about like a
period-tracker or something around my
mind therefore only women are going to
use this application because that's what
we do is going to say if you have the
ability to get pregnant you're female if
you have ability to impregnate somebody
that needs your mail and that's kind of
how these boxes work we have the concept
of being assigned a gender at birth so
basically when you are born a doctor
look to space it your genitalia and goes
female or male and that's what goes in
your birth certificate and it's kind of
very simplistic but we have people who
are intercepts for people who are born
with an attribute that actually doesn't
quite fit into these boxes very well and
we also i'm kind of also trying to talk
about transcending either so transgender
people are people who are assigned one
gender at birth but actually transition
to the another gender later in life so
this means that there are people who are
male they're legally socially rail they
identify as male but they can still have
kids there's been a new story recently I
think right last week about the UK's
first pregnant man you can't assume even
is something that you think I know that
only women get pregnant that's not a
thing that you know us an assumption and
you might want to ask people what their
gender expression is this is kind of how
people presentment enters the world I'm
just very feminine today's but I'm not
like in heels or anything which is good
I feel very overdressed already compared
to everybody else and I think I try to
address on I don't know facts about that
you might want to be asking about this
if you're kind of going well I'm
sterling you know a makeup product or
something I'm actually might might
answer about gender in that circumstance
but actually you kind of anyone cut my
makeup is not really a thing
gender roles obviously being a woman in
tuc having women in fact that something
the kind of goes outside of your gender
role I know that places like Twitter
cert it doesn't ask you what your gender
is if you ever go to threats analytics
it what are you how many followers use
whatever his gender and it basically
tries to work this out by kind of the
name you use on twitter and also the
things you talk about so a lot of
services is gone well i basically only
really talked me into that about
software engineering or video games so a
lot of sites will assume I'm a guy
because they are male things to like so
you might look at your stats and I most
followers that there's a lot of says
I've got like eighty percent of my
followers of men and I know that's not
true but eight sent my photos are so for
engineers so you know in kind of we're
making these assumptions and then we
turn them into facts that's about gender
roles about saying well women have this
role men have this role and therefore
i'm going to use that to make some
societies she'll go into a little bit
and then identity so the issue is
Wells's we don't really have any good
numbers for this but between kind of 105
sent the population identifies something
that is not male or female identify as
non-binary gender queer a gender these
words you might kind of heard about and
what that means is that for people so
I'm non-binary myself so it means that
for people like me if you give me this
field for my concert about because I am
neither of those things and there are
lots of people for lots of different
reasons and neither of those things and
we'll hit issues if i come to your site
and they have to fill this form filled
out what kind of issue so what is this
what does kind of mean to use a business
so I think retail right user experience
well i'm not a director and the samee
user experience is half about is
basically these are things my company
wants these are things my user once and
it's part of my job ever when I've come
bitch producing or even at the front end
developer to kind of find that nice
middle ground so what does this mean to
your business if you're asking me about
my gender but I can't fill out correctly
it means you have data about me which is
wrong and theta which is wrong as
useless essentially that you are wasting
people's time developers time analytics
time especially all of this data which
is inaccurate it means then you're going
to use as an accurate data to make an
accurate
I fennekin I was I thought this was only
meet a lot of people brought this up to
me another talks m youtube there are a
lot of pregnancy test adverts on youtube
like all of the time has anyone
experienced this what's YouTube them is
like the progresso suburbs ya see your
vocal opponent really shaken head all
the Ghazis can be very brightly and but
yeah i mean i have this like I was even
if i was watching pregnancy videos i
mean i was watching like video game like
playthroughs it's just kind of like
every 20 minutes going okay pregnancy
test for night what do people think it's
on female so reasons i don't quite
understand it's going ok then you must
be females and we all know that all
females want to have children and we
know that all people want our children
are going to want to buy like are really
expensive testing stuff practice tests
and things letters we can see why we
like these are kind of assumptions based
on assumptions based on attention and
that's wrong mean that's wasted
advertisement space essentially like if
you actually look for the videos i was
watching an m1 hey we just advertise
your like this in your ps4 game i might
for that you know advertising space is
kind of limited and if you're wasting it
based on poor assumptions and something
that's kind of mess revenue it might
mean I don't need for service at all and
I think the more people try becoming a
bit with me more aware of later in it
not just gender but days in general and
if you have to fill out a load of
questions when you register for site or
by-products you drop out I find this
especially the product i can get out
where I go you know you buy the thing
and then they go oh no you have to
register for an account and like I don't
want an account I just want this like
pair of socks or this book and there's a
lot of times I'll get to the account
registration especially ask me a load of
questions and I guys you know what I'm
fine Wi-Fi is terrible for this use
public Wi-Fi they ask you a load of
questions gender as well and I kind of
go out to actually 40 because I don't
want to have yet another site and
register T I don't have yet another
company any data are me when I might
literally I don't come to London that
often sorry I don't want to have to do
what its registration process but
service i'm going to use maybe twice a
year and so I want you to service and
I'll tell my friends not to use my your
service
because the thing you find with minority
by the kind of ethnic minorities gender
minority sexuality minorities is we all
kind of will find to each other we all
know each other it think about
conference is actually and one of us has
a bad experience at conference because
maybe there's no code of conduct maybe
the gender balance is really heavily
weighted in one direction might say to a
friend hey man as conference as a very
good you know there's like there's no
women here or you know there's no like
gender neutral toilets here or wherever
what does this mean for me as an
individual source of business
information can be painful I don't like
watching the pregnant a-starboard I
can't have children I'm not going to
have children it's annoying but for some
people perhaps who maybe have lots of
trial recently or have had by and their
families on their friend you're
basically people people service maybe
notice can't use the internet they can't
use YouTube because the constant answers
that are wrong a painful they're
difficult and so they just dropped out
the service all together there was a
case in America I think this unit
America where a shot by doughnut shop
his target maybe and basically knew that
a teenager was pregnant before she knew
she was and they just kind of sent a
load of things for a house going like
congratulations on the baby and she was
like a what and then I dad was like what
and you know that's caused issues starts
causes issues and it has nothing to do
with it's not really the websites for
necessarily know but it's something that
happens to people long after they DS
your website this is something that's
going to affect somebody's life minutes
and hours days weeks as they've actually
kind of left your site when you're
asleep not if when security is terrible
at the moment and everything is getting
leaked all of the time when we've had
what like 23 yahoo leaks now more and
more site so pornography sites are
getting late the Ashley Madison leaks
really good example of this well
actually when that lady was lead that
hurt a load of people because all of a
sudden have this massive list of people
who have committed adultery and we have
opinions about that society and those
people are still kind of living those
consequences people are vulnerable and
if you think about so I'd only get too
into politics
and there's this big thing with Trump
opposite the minute and he was on about
building this registry of Muslims
webiconnnn women in the country and a
lot of people in chat kind of quite
rightly said well we don't want anything
to do this we're not going to build your
Muslim register we're not going to build
your registry of gay people its kind of
happening in some American side but
we're kind of doing this we're playing
about facebook facebook is already a
registry of gay people it's already
registry of kind of ethnic minorities
religions all of these things and if you
have if you ask me for about agenda even
if you allow them to say that they're
trans gender non-binary you'll basically
now have a list of data that's really
really sensitive is really personal and
could be used to hurt people but you
don't think of yourselves as having a
registry of all the transgender people
or having rester all the gay people or
whatever you think yourself I'm selling
some books i'm selling some you know I
work in a platform as a service whatever
and all data is connected I worked for
an organization where on the employee
profile the sexuality lift is restricted
by the gender I had to choose at the
beginning so I can't just say like I'm
gay I have to say like I'm weekday women
so basically you've you've got things
through these things are really
connected to each other so you get one
thing wrong so that might not be the
only thing you get wrong I think we've
gone a little bit it's got a little bit
weird hasn't it I think genders don't as
complicated so I think we should go back
to meet really simple plate names links
are simple and we am living with a
gender stuff we don't always talk to
people about gender and I see anything
that's something less popular and it
means I'm kind of running out of people
to talk about our gender for a song and
I thought starting with the subs but
things right we always have to do what
my name is because we're either going to
send them something we want to research
them in an email we want to check right
against some ID etc etc this is what a
name looks like so we have a tie or
first name optional middle names and a
surname so we can bid middle names out
no one cares Bravo's we know that
minimizer optional I mean it's very
rarely I've never been asked on the
internet from my middle name and then I
don't have someone to drive so a name is
a title or so famous I name so start
beginning
tiles there's someone who I heavily
respect and admire and it's myself and I
have quotes about titles please stop
asking people what their title is so
first of all I you don't have to use it
right what's a bite or what I'm talking
about mr. mrs. dr. Katzen flight command
or whatever and they're obviously legal
things around you can't use a title in
order to kind of view for autumn it if
you can't say like oh I'm dr. i can't
say i'm dr. chatham and like get some
insight that means a hospital or I can't
say you know like I'm captain whatever
and then try to get a military discount
stuff like that but the social titles
you mr mrs smith and others there's no
legal obligation to zoe's it is
perfectly legal legitimacy to not use
apply to a taller I have lots of friends
we don't use titles so if your title
field is mandatory or I have to give you
an accurate data or I'll just write you
some sites at all you people don't have
to use it and the reason i don't like
toy horses because no one ever allows
the title that i use on that drop down
so i use mix this with tyonne it's
gender neutral and papers have been
reporting it to transgender title which
i think a lot of people aren't using it
but it's not like it's for everybody and
I spoke to a journalist actually who
switched to using mix because it allows
him to have an extra step that I
limitÃ©e so when people see is article
instead of it being from and I like mr.
r jones or whatever just now some mix rj
as it has in that extra level of kind of
separation makes me slightly difficult
slightly harder to find or slightly hard
to kind of look up and the reason this
is an issue and is this smells like a
really really tiny thing and a lot of
people say to me like well it doesn't
really matter like just pick whatever
title of the list if you can't find the
one that you use this is on my driving
license so i did it for a rental car
company and they were like oh we don't
allow this titles like but you want
people to give you information at their
driving license but i can't give you all
information on my driving license
because you ain't lamented at my real
name on here i also recently I went with
children and why do you curl ups and
stuff so I just have a criminal criminal
record check every so often and the
website which is the only time I've ever
had to use my middle name on the
internet and all over all the messaging
over it is
the name has to match your ID the erd
your for supplying like your
registration you have to map the idea
because you've got middle names and
driving license you have sent the note
names in here if you use your full name
we have suited for name in here etc but
they didn't allow me to have mix as a
title and i spent about 20 minutes
worrying about it's like well this is
going off like this is checking out
right police records and stuff and i am
giving you my ID with mixer on it i know
it's tiny but you're going to look at
this and go like what are you trying to
do there and i kind of still went
through this i still need to do it but
if it's just a site where I'm barring a
product or I'm registering for some
Wi-Fi whatever I knew what you say to me
at three in point to use your real name
but I can't use my real title I'm not
using your website so please do this
either stop asking about photos make
them optional or add mix because it's
great so now we've established that a
name is a first name in the surname
don't forget here's as facts we know
that surname and in Christ I was just
going cuz i SPECT comedy crates around
facts so here's an practically no mat so
named we know everybody has one we know
everybody has one so name which is why
we kind of say to people it can only be
20 characters long in our forms or
whatever we know that surnames a family
thing they come from basically the man
has immense ownership over you so that
is either your husband or your father
and I kind of kind of kind of cause I
jokes like this for my girlfriend's
really run with it but yeah if we get
married me am I missing my partner we
basically can't have a surname and
putting our names come from they come
from the man who's closest to you so
they were there a family thing or I see
that you have your father's surname and
we have some surname and we know that
surname luckily and family name they're
all the same thing we can just swap
those labels in and out as much as we
please so if we go to the 4-minute says
first name last name that's the same
things first wafer name or given name
family name or whatever we know these
things are facts to our expert facts
about surnamed I'm still learning a lot
of these and because what people
actually transyl's so Portuguese and
some languages have multiple surnames so
they have a surname of both parents
and I've got twenty-twenty point about
this and she was saying it basically set
that her name like her name is her first
name and then at two surnamed but that's
that is her name she caught issued the
last one because that's not her name and
although kind of people have to do for
convenience or they use the first one
but then so if you just have what you
can't have one surname and it can't have
spaces in it or it can't have
double-barrelled names you know they
have license in and a lot of people in a
few ways that you put characters on the
names example so the river and anguish
and cultures have multiple surnamed
obviously kind of there is we're going
okay there's an illegal rotation you can
keep your children your surname you can
give your children or every name you won
Miss masters when you want to do
something like so you have a family plan
for something and Spotify doesn't do
this but it what for I have family plans
and and some types of our family plans
where they say we have to all have the
same surname at the same address we're
not families don't have the same surname
you don't have to give you kids your
surname you don't have to change the
surname you get married obviously people
get married remarried families are
different and if you say well your
family has to order the same surname
those are really work so I kind of
surnames a family name again now doesn't
quite work very well a feedback friend
told me that you can't change her
surname in Quebec at all even you get
married a woman was very obsessed about
this because you can change her surname
to a husband so named because it's not a
thing that's allowed what you'll never
live to change your surname over nessa
front of very very exceptional
circumstances and I think France might
be similar I don't know and it means the
married couple are going to have to say
my name so it gets I infuriates my
mother something chronic when she gets
letters to mr. like dad's initial and
her initial so names it's very annoyed
about it because you're not mr. is like
my dad it's not like the pair of them
combined and some kind of like for
affixing and I mean kind of places like
planning are you say the surname first
it's not that it's not the last it is
the last name but it's not the last name
in your kind of cracks restraints women
in an email or a family conversation and
you know there's different levels of
politeness when you defer name when you
use a third name you know we tend to be
very overly perhaps slightly mouth you
know you don't if you make something you
don't know you don't say like
paper I'll be saying like hey mister
whatever i'm not very good at making it
means on the spot as you might have
noticed as we got them and this isn't
even all of them you know there are
names where the spaces are important
there in names for the hyphens are
important I've got Irish friends who
can't use the apostrophe and their
surname because of bassist video
Besiktas websites or wherever so we've
established that a name is first name
and maybe some surnamed kind of one for
money but really on everything you think
you know about names is wrong there's a
really good blog post of a continuity
which is terrible but it's called
basically assumptions programmers have
about names and it is a list of hundreds
of things we think about names and
they're all wrong um in the UK there is
no such thing as a legal name i thought
i'm currently the process of changing my
name service which I doesn't remain my
parents gave me I'm in a place has kind
of changed my first name but that's not
a you know there's not really big thing
to do that will you change your name
legally in the UK is to just use the new
name it's not I don't have to get like
read crystalyn and to go to like a
massive thing is LCD poles and stuff
like this all around there but there's
no such thing is that the vision is
illegal mean you know people have stayed
named people have nicknames Michael
Caine was nothing recently right he it's
not his real name obviously if not name
is born with it is his actual name is
his stage name but he was fed up
forgetting to talk to airport because
people looking to go all your Michael
Caine but it's passport with his birth
name on it and then go this can't be you
this company your passport you know and
they think you run afford going on but
it's not just because people have people
have multiple names and people might be
using fake names for reasons you know
maybe domestic abuse survivors you know
they may not want to be found by kind of
relatives or kind of people next time to
chasing them and so they will use
different names so you can't just say
somebody what's your real name because
there's not really any such thing so
like a thousand more examples of this
that are actually good there's a really
good book called design for life which
goes into a lot of things about
basically all these things we've seen by
people is going to basic facts about
people how they can cause distress
or harm how they can be publicly our
systems can break them how they can
break our systems and there's conference
called nu X and Sarah she did a really
good key notes from last year talking
about all this stuff and kind of things
that she's had to fill in that actually
really difficult were pressing basically
no one thought about this human first
you know things about I hate your
website say good morning so non seen
this you login to website miss a flight
good morning and then kind of sometimes
you go I'm not having a good morning
yeah and it's kind of like a slice of
talk to you suppose for are basically
others complained at you and we get for
time so um I basic just kind of
complaint at you and told you everything
you know is wrong but that's not why I
want to take away from this because
that's a very sad place and then you
leave me like horrible read notes on the
way out what I want to talk about for
the next kind of 20 minutes is things
you can actually do to to kind of help
along with those things ways to kind of
start conversations or ways to kind of
start thinking about this in your design
process in your development process it
can just help you think about all these
things and then hopefully design
services are more inclusive and are easy
for people to use and will give you data
and information that's much more
accurate newsea to you see so many
businesses stress the same is so
stressed cases it's a phrase that comes
from design for your life and it comes
fact that is developers and how many of
you are developers we all develop wisdom
we like the word educators a lots as
long as you get a book come in that says
client current uses forms as we can't
accept their ' with boston a surname
when you go isolated case i currently
people of God fast food in their name
but people aren't educated people human
beings with lies and experiences and
then to use those cases it's kind of
very impersonal it kind of stops us
thinking about users it's just we just
think about the computer them so the
idea is that we call people
specifications because they are playing
stress on our systems by having
circumstances or actually the point
being aware of something when you're
creating personas or even when you're
just kind of thinking about users of
have at least warned you that you think
of all kind of have designed that would
put stress on your system
through maybe what does peasants have a
bank account and we have to go through a
different process what if this person
doesn't have a name that we're expecting
what this person doesn't have a gender
that we're expecting so these are the
people who when they encounter these
issues its high impact for them but it
might be low frequency and that's part
of a discussion you kind of go okay if
this is only going to affect one percent
of our users but that one percent of
users can't use our service at all do we
want to mitigate that risk in some way
do you want to accept them having to go
through a separate route like maybe
we're just going to eat the causes and
going through the call center to that's
cheaper than us Hamels has been
developed a time on it etc but by
thinking about that use and kind of
having that in your list of persona
interview kind of website persona driven
company Candice probably have that
conversation again also from Des Moines
real life this is from a book called
forms that work it's called the crushed
in protocol and the idea is that when
you're designing a form and doesn't even
have to speak about users we were
actually anything but when you want to
give you some information about
themselves or their business or your
family wherever so each question can't
have a little card where you answer
these four questions so this is who
needs this and by Hugh you mean like an
actual person you're ganization the
league will need this to marketing need
this and do we need this because we've
got an ancient data center that we can't
change and so we need to feed it into
there why do they need it do they need
it because it's a legal thing again so
they need it because so don't assume
whatever so who needs it why do they
need it do we need it or do we just want
it can it be optional is it required and
then what happens if the data is wrong
so this is required and the user can't
feel this then what happens to them what
happens to us if they have to sort of
whom is beta that is wrong or fake or
isn't it just fill it in with fake data
anyway so kind of the fun of it what
happened sort of the business at hand
for them as individual and having this
is popular design process and you're
thinking about your base models or
thinking about eating you know any point
in the process musing about forms
Ordover just to have these questions
into sits a team and think about them
helps you to have that conversation
because i'm not trying to tell you to
stop traffic is what my name is or stop
asking people what their gender of the
kids also you know businesses come first
and we can't just have people just
buying stuff meant sending it anywhere
or whatever but if you take anything
away from the talk is that it's about
having this conversation
you think about it ask people if you
don't know ask people i went to really
good talk about people talking to a
security team from often and it was
mostly few exes but it's actually about
thinking just kind of talking to
different kind of places new
organization thing about the data that
they want why they need it tops
communities you know if you're kind of
going okay we're a uk-based company but
we want to move into kind of the
European territories we need to kind of
talk some people with the mainly one
command taught some people kind of from
those countries but for most cultures
and ask them what be the best data for
them what we have us transform design
for them because people know who they
are you don't we're the experts in terms
of maybe how people use computers or
maybe how maybe we're experts in our
domain but we're not expert in here
people are so someone emails me and says
I can't use a website because of XYZ
they're not wrong you're wrong and it's
about kind of making that compromise
between those two things and be flexible
people need to change the information
with you often so that I might be
publicly arrived yesterday so I'm going
to spend next week changing my name with
everybody and I'm expecting it to be not
fun and please try to make it more fun
and people my age but people need to
change places that do not expect some
change like the James I like their name
and not even because I've gotten married
or anything I'm just changing my first
name so it's going to come at a time
when perhaps you don't have a process
around that you might propose us around
one doesn't get some I maintained a
surname you might have a process around
someone's changing their first names of
fun or for fun but you know II and to
think about the future these things are
only gonna get figures we've has become
more internationals become more as we
kind of push into countries territories
languages that you know as their kind of
coming on board to the internet
especially the thing the agenda with
non-binary people as that's becoming
more visible that's the normal people
are going to start kind of identifying
as non-binary I think in the future you
need to make sure that you've allowed
space for us but you don't start you
know it's like translation right you
never do translation first you would do
site in England then someone going to
sneeze translating then you go our
translation framework would have been
really good it's about kind of hiring
thinking about written is beginning
hangar like your UK now but you're going
to move forward people mother countries
live in the UK's you can't just go what
we're going to review Kate things with
an easy
this name standard isn't really worried
about forms because I noticed said it's
about more than forms it forms are
important users love text fields I love
tax field like four names just have full
name in a text field for gender just
have a text field as developers and we
hate this because they're easily
spammable unless it Kate it's very
difficult to get names out to get they
threw out to think about gender you
think about our theory women and it's a
blank gender field one well how would
you write that down to write women's
rights females right f you know do you
write what your was going to someone who
thinks are really clever and they're
going to write like dolphin in it you
know how thorns on safe sex on land and
people right yes please in the margin
because we're all very clever you know
like that's just going to happen and
that means there's actually much harder
to get data out those fields and it
would be if you just had kind of his neo
radio buttons for example when I'm stuck
when I'm lost another and I don't know
what to do I always reached my friend of
mental deloitte Berg and say well why
not grace and why I probably have both
of these things as they not recognize
the middle ground facebook look at
examples so this is a free text really
but back at a time arises this side the
gender facebook allow lately had a list
about 60 options agenda and I could pick
as many of them that I wanted so for me
this is as open this is fairly own so I
can kind of build my gender are fees and
out of lots of different terms and
things so to me it's lovely i from
putting more at one and you can still
going to go to your data and say how
many people sitting on binary image
ender feels you know there's that mixer
so that's one way of doing it scratch do
a thing where you can put male female
and then they've got blank text box for
the third option if you can still anna
like this they can still look at this
and say subscribe to the tool for
teaching till how to code century so
they can still listen it goes what
twenty percent man's work 25 miles 40
cents emails and then a number of people
who are the third option but i can still
put in whatever I want begins to get
Daedra office when it comes for names
I've not yet seen this form design in
the wild unfortunately and but people
tell me about their you can use a few
you can use the full name field visit
this place is really really good
I'll put the slides open Internet at one
point and by w3.org it goes through
loads of things for international names
I'd never heard I've never even thought
about before some more different
countries it's not just about forms but
this bit so after what a full name is
and they can just so they can write
whatever they want in their make and
make sure you can market for characters
and places outside things but you
actually what you actually want to know
is how do I dresses email to you how I
dress is letter to you how do I put this
information on your social network
profile or whatever and that's what the
second box is full and then people use
stage names or you might much they
actually use the first box is your legal
name but what's the name you actually go
by socially and because i'm not done
ranting so one of the piece of echoes
currently worsen actually is redesigning
the forum for people to kind of in that
kind of personal veto from the sky
website and i believe a lot of code
reviews which is fun and exciting but it
was a nice way to ease me and after the
Christmas break sort when I went in I
was like a Hartman when you code it's
been two weeks so I thought I'd do some
code of using on time I remember some
JavaScript end of it and because of that
I've been looking at a lot of form
builder the lock code of things for
Moses let me look at our very messages I
am NOT invalid invalid is not a common
word and if anyone's ever actually if
anyone's ever seen like the xkcd with
the upstairs five the idea that their
face es hours there's basically the top
styling words that people use and the
comic is about explaining what the
Saturn five rocket is only using those
top thousand words so you can't say
rocket program plus watch popular and
invalid isn't in the top thousand words
it's not a word that people you is not
words like muggle geez where we use it
as service a lot because it's got a
meaning for us an invalid is a word with
meaning but the people you want in
technology invalid doesn't mean anything
really it's not already here very often
if you just don't set your sister and
help make informed inputs we're very
restricted on the characters we can
allow my name's which is infuriating but
you can't station when your last name is
invalid because it's not a cell phone
and help them make an informed so
actually it's a saying you're my limited
valid so we can't expect your last name
of spaces and then you kind of go all
this is annoying but maybe you can use
like
capitals to show that they're two words
or you can put hyphen in or those kind
of things it's not the users for that
your data structure is old or broken
arrow and flexible and it's not like you
consider it because you you as a
developer myself you know I'm kind of a
thousand steps away from the actual kind
of data center I can't just turn around
to someone and say the data structure is
changing because that one matrix has a
mixed title for example like the amount
of developer time it would take to put
back into our system doesn't justify
apparently the benefit of so allow clips
just don't say to me my title is invalid
just say we can only accept these titles
my mouth and kind of go okay that's fine
so really is everything we know wrong
and it might seem like so which is
life's just been telling you that for
the last 45 minutes I don't think
everything we know is wrong I think
everything we know is incomplete I think
that there's lots of things we're still
learning about I think there's lots of
things that we haven't thought about and
that no one's ever really forced to
think about because we don't see maybe
people offending maybe was ending loads
of emails to our complaint department we
don't see that we removed from that
developers you know that's something
that goes to your wax are some of the
goes to support every not really sir and
what I think is really important is
actually I job to find out we want to be
experts in our domains we wonder if
we're asking users about information we
want to be experts more information and
how it support to people so we will need
to go and find this out thanks very much
to commit to talk to find out like I
said you can email me hello excitation
or application on Twitter I say this
because actually lot of people want
asking questions but mi Chris any
questions in public because I want to
seem like a federal agenda sort of
Soapy's worry about being offensive I'm
not easily offended because I also want
to give you this informations hi what's
going on and also because I'm working
part-time at a minute I'm available if
people want me to come a comment or
company about this or talk to your
clients about this because I kind of
push back to clients to the hardest bit
of any process of changing anything or I
guess so we've got five questions are
way outside a post questions there are
fewer questions or bo Susannah grabbed
me I'm here for three days the people
inside grabbed me whether and thank you
very much
and thanks for not dying of heatstroke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
