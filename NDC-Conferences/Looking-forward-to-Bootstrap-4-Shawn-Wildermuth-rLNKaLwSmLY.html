everybody hear me everyone who can't
hear me raise your hand so I'm Sean
Wildermuth some of you might know me by
my appearances on daytime soap operas
and morning shows I like to do cooking
shows we're going to talk about
bootstrap how many of you use bootstrap
already in some form how many are still
using bootstrap to more than they would
like you to yes and and so everyone else
is using bootstrap 3 anyone actually
using boot rep for yet sort of yeah I
was the idiot who my new a blog site
used to be trapped for don't do that so
when I originally pitched this idea back
in October September to do a talk I
assumed by time in DC london and sydney
would happen that we'd be in beta or
maybe even released alpha 3 came out
about 4 days ago so my one advice for
everyone out there who's thinking about
doing a talk never do one on anything
that's marked as an alpha so we're gonna
have a little fun today and hopefully
it'll go well last time I did this talk
someone in the front row had to give me
their USB stick because the the feed to
the bootstrap for failed during the talk
yeah that was a fun day so we'll see how
this goes so let me talk a little bit
about what bootstrap is if you're here
you probably know what I am blue trap
for if you live through the bootstrap
223 transition you'll remember that it
was incredibly painful they took the
sort of unpopular but probably right
approach of renaming almost everything
in the entire framework which broke a
lot of code so a lot of people that were
depending on templates in bootstrap to
actually a lot of people are staying
with booty up to because the pain to go
23 was pretty high the transition from 3
to 4 is nowhere near that big
change to us underneath the covers
they've decided to rewrite a bunch of
things so a lot of it is new code but
the the classes in in the CSS and all of
the API is all the JavaScript API s are
staying similar to what they were doing
before they're still going to be a step
to convert but the changes are much more
evolutionary than revolutionary so if
you were like I'm never going again
because making that change was really
painful this isn't as painful but we're
going to talk about some of the things
they've done in some of the things they
took out and what they replaced it with
to sort of see what that looks like oh
that's still me so let's talk about
what's changed in big pictures and then
we're going to go ahead and apply it to
an actual web page so a big thing
they've done is this internal rewriting
to go from less to SAS so if you're
using bootstrap is the basis of your
build of CSS which a lot of people don't
they just use the generated CSS but if
you're using it to extend bootstrap
you're going to need to move to sass to
make that change and so for some
organizations that's quite a bit big
change the languages are similar enough
that it's not that painful SAS is a
little bit more powerful less is a
little simpler so if you have to make
that transition it actually isn't as
painful as that sounds and they've
rewritten the JavaScript from scratch
because as we all know JavaScript
written about five years ago if we go
back and look at it now we're
embarrassed we don't tell our children
that's what we did we pretend that we
did PHP because that's less embarrassing
oh there's no PHP guys in here right and
so their goal here was to make as little
surface changes but to really fix a lot
of things they weren't happy with
performance wise maintainability
extendibility in the rewriting of the of
this of the of the styling as well as
the API they added support for AMD so
you can now load it on demand as you
would want to
and that's really important and they're
adding optional flexbox support so
flexbox is a new way in in edge browsers
to to handle layout in a more logical
way if do any of you think CSS is
logical it's usually one liar in the
back so flexbox is trying to address
that but they're only allowing you to
opt into the Flex bak support because it
limits the number of browsers that
actually works on so in order to
maintain the compatibility with as many
browsers it's off by default but you can
opt into it they're also improving the
grid system and the big thing with the
grid system change unlike the way it was
between bootstrap two and three is
they're maintaining what they did before
but they're adding a new support for a
new size which is super big which is
retina screens really they want to have
that one extra so the you know 10 10 24
wide isn't the same as you're going to
see in 2,000 or 3,000 or 4,000 pixel
wide displays anymore and this is
probably the one that hurts people the
most is Wells thumbnails and panels are
gone they've been replaced with one
component that really does the same
thing the three ones did it's called a
card system as the st. it's as close
it's pretty close to what the panel's
used to be but they can be used
standalone to get the functionality you
saw on thumbnails and functionality you
saw in Wells before so I actually think
this is a good solution but it does
require some code change and glyph icons
are gone this is one of those
interesting things that I was kind of a
fan of and that cliff icons are fine but
we also went to font awesome or one of
the other guys a couple years ago so why
they were sort of keeping both of them
in the same box was not all that
necessary so they're simply saying just
use here's how to use cliff icons here's
how to use font awesome or whomever you
want to use for your icons we're not in
that business anymore we're not there to
suggest what kind of icon
you want to use with icons was great
when there wasn't anything else right we
were all doing bitmap sprites and things
like that back then and they've dropped
support for ie8 this is the one that
also hurts a number of people mostly in
the enterprise space because hopefully
ie8 is dying out there actually on real
at least consumer machines they're
continuing support bootstrap 3 and we'll
for the near future so people who need
that support are just suggested not to
move the blue stripe for that's really
the advice there so this is the most
asked question i'm on the slack for for
the boot for bootstrap the trip has a
slack if you want to talk to the team
and mention things or work with some of
the other guys on asking questions about
how things work it's a great place you
can join for free and this whenever
someone joins the slack channel they go
to the v4 message window and they say
when will it be released right I did it
because that's what why i joined the
select channel i thought someone might
know so like I said they just released
alpha 3 and if angular 2 is an example I
think it's going to be done sometime in
the 2018 or 19th time frame because
we've still got betas and 13 release
candidates that go my hope is that
they'll get to beta soon and release
soon afterwards but they're they're
trying to do it right instead of quick
and so one of the issues here is they're
making changes now because there's still
an alpha they're not promising not to
break changes right now and so I my blog
which is using bootstrap for I'm on a
I'm on alpha 2 and I'm probably not
going to move to alpha 3 CH because I
just have to fix some things and for now
it's it's just a blog right that's not a
real web application it's just a place
where I can complain about anything I
want to complain about like qantas
airlines well we can take that off awful
so what's happened in the world of
bootstrap is perplexing and interesting
and I think what happened was that used
to the cool job in software development
used to be the game developer right ooh
I want to work on the next X game or why
or whatever and one of the things that
they always liked was that they could
say it's going to be done when it's done
and then people realized how lowly paid
game developers were an overworked they
were so they all moved into JavaScript
frameworks and so the same guys are now
doing this it's going to be released
when it's done whenever we get done with
it so there is no answer here so you're
getting ready probably ahead of schedule
but I've heard people sort of whisper
about maybe end of year certainly beta
by the end of the year we'll see I
actually have a contracted pluralsight
to write a bootstrap for course that I
thought I was going to write in
September of last year so I'm I'm just
waiting so one of the big changes in 4
is the response of break points that I
sort of mentioned that earlier so I want
to talk about that because bootstrap for
like 3 is a couple of the changes that
are interesting here is one they've
moved away from pixel sizes and gone to
em and REM sizing instead you're going
to see that throughout all the CSS is
em's and rams rams more than ms and this
is exactly where they break apart and
you'll see this larger column this this
new XL size throughout the framework for
for different things it wants to do
unfortunately I my laptop is only 10 19
x 80 so I can't really show you how but
how these breakpoints work but if you
have a Retina screen if you have an
Apple product of some sort it's pretty
easy to see these break points
and even though I'm showing them four
columns you're going to see these same
sizes being used for a bunch of things
like for for instance a pull right
doesn't exist anymore to now pull md
right LG right or XS right it's there
now have break points at these different
sizes as well and you're going to see
that through throughout the framework
and the reason they pulled it out is
saying pull XS for the extra small size
right is the same as what we used to
think of as pull right right it's the
baseline pull it right unless I have an
exception whereas if I say pull right md
it's for MDM larger and and you're going
to see that with buttons and font sizes
and everything is sort of correlated
with the same naming conventions and so
one of the improvements they made that
is going to affect you guys when you
want to convert is that some of the
naming conventions are gone like I think
it's table condensed is now tabled sm
because it just makes more sense to beak
is to keep the naming consistent across
the product so let's talk about the grid
system I'm going to start with in a
sample i have here and this is one HTML
page this isn't a a complex actually let
me make one change thought i had already
done this sorry about this so you can
read it i'm going to bring this down to
about 720 so you can see it in the back
it's a big screen but still so here's my
beautiful website i built so simp it's a
single HTML page i could be using
layouts and doing all sorts of asp miss
things that are awesome but everything
I'm talking about doesn't apply just
asp.net it's to any web thing and so
this is a going to be my new blog if you
like bacon or any meat really I think
you'll enjoy this and of course the
problem with this is this is what it
looks like on a
on a iphone right I've lost all the
stuff and I have the best thing I always
want on a phone which is scrolling left
and right I love that if you if you
decide to write a website please let it
scroll left or right because it's so
intuitive so this doesn't have any sort
of CSS that's designed to help me with
structuring my site for four
different-sized apps or in a logical way
i'm using fixed widths and all sorts of
all sorts of things so let's start by
doing a couple of things first I'm going
to take my CSS file which isn't big but
it's pure CSS and i'm just going to
comment it out so you can see that we're
going to start from really nothing this
is what my first ten enterprise web
applications look like right i had to
change the font to serif but other than
that I'm into saying Sarah better than
that this is pretty much what every
internal app I ever wrote looked like so
we're going to start from that point so
how do I get bootstrap
there's a few different ways they have a
CDN for the latest version they have
direct download but instead of going
against a specific version for
development I'm suggesting people just
go straight to github so there's a
github link we can put here instead of a
version number so bootstrap and it's
going to want to help me by saying 33 is
the latest version but I'm actually
going to use get and let's let's just go
out to github so we can see what that
looks like because of course this is all
open source is there is a branch called
v4 dev that's the latest may break you
it everyday sort of branch they do have
specific endpoints if you want to stick
at one of the alpha version but I like
to play loose when I'm doing a talk and
hopefully they didn't break it again so
github com whoops
I always forget where it is here now
that that V for dev let's see if it
loads it I may have forgotten one level
as I often do so I keep a cheat sheet
yep i forgot to level
that's sort of the easiest way to stay
on on the latest branch let's see if it
actually loaded it nope it's restoring
it should be there in a minute oh cool
and it brought in the other dependency
for tether as well which is one of the
libraries it uses that you can opt in or
out of but let's go over to my beautiful
bacon page which happens to be an MVC
view but it doesn't have to be and I'll
do the trick of just including the dist
right first the CSS one thing you'll
notice in booster for there's no more
theme so they're getting out of the
business of giving you a default theme
the default theme is just what you get
and then you'll want to apply whatever
themI and information on top of it one
of the things they're doing is they're
opening a theme store there's actually a
couple already available for four so you
can kind of see what they're doing
because they realized how much money
everyone else was making under trap
themes and they weren't getting any of
it to support their product so that'll
be whatever it is and then of course we
need the JavaScript so when I usually
introduced bootstrap to people for the
first time and I add those two they're
awfully surprised what sorted here when
they're awful surprised when it doesn't
get that much better right we change the
font woohoo but it's you know it's not
magically fixed because we now have the
CSS and the JavaScript included because
we're not really using it and so let's
let's start with the grid system this
site is really made up of I'm making a
little small so we can see it but it's
really made up of a couple pieces
there's a header piece a column piece
that has information about bacon and
then another column piece which is
supposed to be sort of a the right
sidebar that's more bacon information in
case you're interested in and then a
footer that just includes some
information so there are these pieces
logical pieces of the UI that I want to
be able to fit
the page in a logical way oops so let's
start by first coming to each of these
pieces so I have the nav element in the
top and I'm just going to add something
called container now there's still a
container in a container fluid and the
difference between these is whether you
want to be centered on the page or try
to be stretched across the page they
don't really suggest the stretch across
the page but they're still leaving
support in it because what tends to
happen is the web the magical internet
people want the sort of centered
approach because it often makes more
logical sense but then in the enterprise
when they want it to be more of a this
is what our screen looks like and I have
a lot of information because this is a
dashboard they often want the fluid
version and so I'll repeat this with my
editor inheritance on each of the three
main sections the header the body and
the ultimately the footer and we're
already looking a little better may not
make it so small because at least we're
now not taking we're sort of centered on
the page and as we go to different sizes
that container is forcing us to be the
width of the page so even with as little
as that one use of the container or at
least we're no longer having to deal
with that much scroll right we're
actually still scrolling right here
because our images are too big
especially this one which i think is
actually chicken bacon but meat is meat
heresy in fact
so the grid system says I would like to
separate the the page into these logical
units these columns as they were a 12
column system since most of your views
that are going to do that but it's it's
the what you're specifying in bootstrap
for especially is that you're going to
go from this that you're specifying how
wide this should be within certain
screen sizes so let's take the naive
approach and I'm just going to do with
the center section is I have two
sections in that center section the
sidebar on the main section and I'm
going to wrap them in what bootstrap
calls a row this isn't a new idea but
when you're going to use columns they
want you to be in a row that way I can
tell this first section with a class
that I want to column for when it's
medium and above so when it's a standard
size screen and above I'd like this to
be 9 logical units across I when I first
started doing this it gets a little
confusing because the larger the larger
the number the more of these 12 it takes
in my mind I kept on thinking that was
like one ninth I got it very backwards
in my mind for a while and I kept on
changing numbers until it worked and
we'll do the same with the with the
sidebar or I put the sidebar but in this
case I want to say three put it because
we're dealing with a grid of 12 and so
often you want to make them equal 12 at
the end of the day so if you want three
across they're going to be column fours
if therefore across you're going to have
column 3 etc and so we now have that
idea of a sidebar in a main bar of a
main section and a sidebar and what's
interesting is the default from
bootstrap 3 to 4 has stayed the same in
that if you are dealing with medium or
above it assumes you want to stack them
when you get too small and extra small
devices you can override that but the
behavior is that they're not going to be
side by side
they're only going to be side by side
for lard larger screens so let me go to
the top so you can kind of see this work
so as we're going from small tablet
we're going to eventually hit small sort
of desktop sighs and we're and that's
where the medium hits and then we're
going to hit larger this is where large
hits and then I can't really actually
get to extra large so it has these ideas
actually I think I just fine barely get
extra large in here and the idea behind
columns I know I'm a lot of you already
know this what I'm going to cover it
anyway is if I want different
formulations for different sized screens
i'm going to add more classes so if i
want to go small and make this six
across and i'll make this six as well
again trying to achieve the 12 then on
this screen it stays nine until i start
to make it small whoops and i'm going to
hit that small section there so now its
side by side because to even columns and
then once we get two extra small it's
going to go back to the stacking them
because obviously but I could override
that with these different ideas and so
the grid system is about the same the
place where this really starts to change
in bootstrap for our offset so if we
wanted to push this out by saying I want
to offset this a leave some white space
and then start it let's say I want to
make the sidebar one whoops that's not
the right word key I want to make it one
wide I might want to push it over by a
couple of columns before I had the
column because it by default it's going
to put them all next to each other and
so what we used to do is have to write
this lovely class name column offset
whoops medium to to push it over by to
right and all they said is if you want
on
offset you know it's already a column so
they've changed the name to no longer
include the column I'm not sure that the
four character savings was a big deal
but someone really was passionate about
it and won that fight oh I said medium
didn't I
well it's not showing for some reason
you'll have to trust me i think it might
be medium dash offset second Oh save the
file that's a formidable question there
we go thank you one thing I always
forget about saving the file so let's go
back and talk about the next interesting
piece and that's not where I wanted to
be cards I talked about briefly earlier
that cards where this idea of replacing
wells and panels and thumbnails so the
idea behind car just is that it's a new
component a new thing you're going to
use replaces these three and they want
it to be more flexible so they wanted to
be extendable and sort of this one thing
that could handle most of them so let's
turn a piece of our page into cards I'm
going to get rid of the opposite because
it doesn't make us much sense to show
you this demo and I'm just going to take
this little piece of our code and I'm
just going to put it in a class called
card I've got a paragraph I've got an
image no actually before we do the card
one change i forgot i wanted to show you
that does affect you is images so we
used to have an image called responsive
that we used everywhere we've probably
even injected it in our database so that
we had it and so this is one of the more
painful ones is there to alleviate some
naming irregularities they're calling it
fluid because they have fluid in the
name for things that that are handled
and so if we change these three whoops
come on there you go
I used to be able to type in front of
people it's like pair programming with
30 of your closest friends
and this gets rid of all of our normal
right to left scrolling because it
finally makes this giant image always
fit into the columns therein that's
fluid fluid or responsive takes an image
and make sure it fits in the container
it's in effectively these aren't getting
any smaller or bigger because they're
not bigger than the frame there in but
if they were bigger they would make sure
and shrink it to that sounds so let's
take this piece and let's create a card
or get what we're going to see over here
is that you're getting sort of the
minimal it's a little hard to see in the
back because it's actually great ida
fault this little well but the well has
this idea of a body which you can
actually put right here on the card as
well i'm sorry not body called block and
then it actually looks more like the
wells you're used to so a card and card
block is giving kind of the same
functionality that we used to get with a
simple well to make this more like a
panel we can surround these with card
block and then use other decorators for
things like card text
to give you that same behavior but the
reason why you would want to break it
out in this way is because we can add
headers and footers so let's add a
header and a footer real quick card
header card title
oh i forgot i don't need the block once
you're using headers and bodies you
don't need the block so we come back
here and get rid of that i forget the
order of these right you're getting more
of that panel like experience and just
like that we can still color these with
card let's say success right so we're
getting some of that same behavior that
we saw before let's go ahead and add a
couple things we're going to do a quick
card subtitle
and then finally surround this all with
a card body I'm sorry heart block so
we're starting to get that sort of flow
of these rectangular sections and I'll
go ahead and put make up a footer as
well just so you have a little bit of
all the pieces
we're getting the that and last thing is
we can go ahead and say card in verse
when we have a dark background so these
little helper classes to sort of build
these these you know cards in your
system you can use as much as little
they're trying to get away from what
they've done before which is to make
this work we're going to need 30 for
nested divs and this is exactly what it
looks like if you're missing what it's
all going to fall apart they've done a
lot of this by getting rid of the so
we're looking for the opposite of
ancestor the the child CSS flag they're
allowing anything to be the straight yes
thank you so cards are pretty simple
once you sort of see each of the pieces
but it doesn't mean every panel well and
thumbnail you were using will need to be
converted over most of the names are
pretty conventional with what you were
using before so it's a pretty in place
change so navigation the nav element
they've been simplified this is a an
interesting notion because when i
whenever i do about boots rep site i
would start a you know my site i drag
boot rep over and then i would go to
bootstrap calm or get boost rep calm and
i would go find the nav example and i
would copy it into my project because
there was nothing intuitive about the
way that the nav stuff would put
together it looked right at work right
but he I really could never remember
exactly how it went along and it's still
complicated enough that I still have a
little time a little hard time
remembering it but it's a lot more
logical than it used to be so let's
convert our beautiful navigation into
the new nav element oh yeah and
responsive menus actually make more
sense than or easier to put together
than they used to be so go over the code
and you know I told the client that this
is what all websites look for navigation
but he seemed to think that something
better than what this looks like is what
he wanted so we're going to start by
moving this we can actually leave the
container there is adding nav bar to our
section nav arnav to tell it that we
want it to be a that this whole element
is going to be the nav of a nav bar and
we're going to go to the bacon is love
peace and add nav bar dot brand so they
renamed a lot of the classes to be now
bar prefix instead of some of them being
nav and some of them being nav bar some
of them are still a little confusing and
wonky but you can you can know that if
you start it with nav bar you're going
to be pretty close so we're going to get
closer so the bacon is the brand is
showing the way it should but our little
menu still looks like a unordered list
because it is an unordered list and one
of the notions here is that they were
using the unordered list as the sort of
structure for it and they're now saying
you can it's fine but you don't need it
anymore so I'm actually going to go and
just change this simplify it by getting
rid of all the list eNOS of it because
part of what using a list meant was
there had to be rules to make it not
display like a list and so if you don't
use the unordered list it actually
becomes a little simpler because it's
really just a list of links and they can
style that in the way they need to makes
more sense and is honestly just a little
simpler well before we do the nav bar
let's talk about something I'll come
back to that in just a moment I promise
so one of the things that we used to get
with the nav bar is sort of this
coloring of the nav bar right by default
it's not really doing any coloring but
we could add
navbar dark for instance and there's a
dark and a light that's probably not we
were looking for right and the reason is
they want to separate this notion of the
dark and the light being just for really
the text colors and what is the
background color so there's now a BG
colors so i could say fuchsia if i was
building this for my wife and for some
reason it's not showing that's odd we'd
ever get to save it again huh ok let me
go to my cheat sheet I must have screwed
something up that's all that
what's right this way in verse that's
what I told it to do okay not sure
whether colors aren't working it may be
in the build we have it's broken so we
have it as dark and if we go back and
tell it that why i want navbar dark
ironically it changes the text away
right but what i like about this
approach is that I no longer need to be
building classes for one off so inverse
might not be what I want I might just
want to do as I know evil as some where
you were going to say it is but you
could do this with a class as well
right I could just create a background
color and unlike before it's not going
to try to override it so by default it
doesn't have a background color
associated with it it's only applied
afterwards and whether that's with the
class that's built in a class you build
or even in line and so they're trying to
treat that because one of the things
that happened with bootstrap 3 was it
was so successful that every website
looked like a bootstrap 3 example page
right through the bootstrap ification of
the web and they're really trying to
make it as much in a way that this just
doesn't happen it's still going to
happen because some of the idioms don't
have some companies don't have designers
behind all this and they're just going
to try to get it working especially
inside of enterprises but it's still
helpful so let's go back to the menu how
did I get to Intel centers at once that
is sexy and if I remember right that's
oh yeah we don't need a anything there
so now the things I like does the
container no longer needs anything but
we do need a class in each item which is
nav item and optionally nav link so if
it's an actual link and not just a
button that's containing other things
you would just have nav item if it's a
link itself you'll include both you may
not need both of them if my memory is
incorrect you may just need length but
i'm going to do both because i know that
works right now and so we now have a you
know our background isn't really helping
us we have actual sort of buttons and so
let's take this and do what everybody
does which is pull right right pull
right that should work so you'll see
here that it's now implying pull LG
right because all the rights and the
pull rights and pull eps are now by size
so if you want the behavior of always to
the right you're going to actually want
pull XS right because this is a
mobile-first framework so everything is
applied from the bottom
mm-hmm let's make that a less offensive
color I don't know if that's less
offensive but it'll do the same idea
with a navbar fixed top and bottom
continue whoops continue to work but you
still need to manually push your content
down because it doesn't know what size
you want your header there isn't a
default of body top down 50 once you
apply this and getting that to actually
work gets a little weird so I'll go
ahead and add this as the only piece of
styling we actually need body margin top
50 I probably should use an e/m or a rim
but I'll get away with it because I'm
not a very good developer so we have the
beginnings of our nav bar or not the
beginnings we have the non-mobile
friendly nav bar because as we get
smaller at some point we're going to get
that we're going to run into it which is
why in smaller devices we tend to have
pop-out menus or pop in menus and they
don't they're not getting into the
business of fly-in menus or any of that
there's plenty of ways to do that and
these menus aren't difficult to
implement that way but there's nothing
built in the bootstrap for that's that
you can say fly in from the right hand
side of the screen or any of that sort
of magic it's actually only a couple of
lines a few lines of CSS to make it
happen so it's not that big a deal but
we do need the ability to change this to
add a new element so let's start first
with the magic button right you like to
have a button with the let's see if I
remember right 976 is that right whoo
it's an unstyled ugly button but it's
the hamburger menu right it's just a a
default hamburger menu the old examples
used to use that
of li three dashes on top of each other
mess so the Unicode usually work you can
of course replace this with any icon you
want if certainly with font awesome as
will show you later so let's make it
into a button let's say i'll just do a
primary button it's ugly but it'll work
but we now need to actually make it do
the job right and so there's a few
pieces here first we want to say nav
what is it called again toddler now bar
toggle nope toddler and there's
different ones for different sizes if
you want as well but toddler tells it
that it's the type that's willing to
toggle the menu and then down here I'm
going to want to give it an ID because
we want to know what to toggle and i'll
use my awesome name of the menu and data
toggle collapse and data target equals
pound the menu right because so this is
effectively these helper attributes
saying this is the thing that toggles it
this is what it's going to toggle which
is the collapse class and then this is
what the the actual thing to taco and so
the last thing we'll need if i remember
right its collapse here as well so will
it work i think i need actually collapse
well i'll leave it there for now
nope I was right the first time
oh I put it on the wrong element
like I said it's still not perfect well
that's not working I'm now collapsing in
every case let's try it one more time so
we have our menu we don't have we have
our button that's collapsed but as we
get smaller hopefully come on you can do
it nope you get from everyone I could
remembers things because I do not oh
there it is yeah that was all right
and I forgot about navbar toggleable
let's say small
going to do what I should have done
earlier which is this should be the one
just so I don't waste any more time
remembering what class I forgot it
approved you that it works and then
we'll go on before we run at a time yeah
we're good
yeah yeah yeah
happy
really sorry about this I know let's do
this
so there it is and when we make it
smaller you're seeing a preview of what
else we're going to build we've got it
and it shows up as we toggle none of
that's worth writing any javascript is
all by specifying these class names and
the attributes and it will work and I'll
make this work before i post it up on my
site later so you'll be able to get the
completed version sorry about that
so custom form controls form controls
are an interesting one we started at
what 40 right yeah yeah okay form
controls are an interesting one because
there's uh they've always had sort of a
strength of building forms in a rich way
and that really hasn't changed but they
there are certain controls that just
haven't looked consistent across
browsers so checkboxes radio buttons
selects and drop downs and the file
browser control and so they've decided
to do two things one is we're going to
build a way that if you want to opt into
it you can use a control that's going to
look the same across browser we're going
to do sort of the owner drawed version
of these controls because we know that
this is a common thing and a lot of
people go outside of bootstrap to go get
the these controls but they also decided
if we're going to do it let's make it so
it's an extendable way to write controls
until they've built up a way to have
sort of the base class and based styling
and then being able to supply the the
drawing mechanic of how they're going to
replace it on the screen now all this is
drawn with CSS but it's drawn by
replacing the original element drawing a
new element in its place and that whole
sort of trick until we get actual
composition in HTML where we can
actually have a component that's made up
of other components they'll probably go
to that but for now this is sort of a
good fix so let's start by sort of
proving that forms haven't changed a lot
so I have this little form at the bottom
and I'll do it we all have to do which
is add form group to each little
grouping
I'll do the same here I think that's the
last one oh I'll put it on the input as
well and this should make this form a
lot prettier oh no it didn't I forgot we
need to do the other piece which is to
make all the controls form control
except for the text box because that
makes the text box looks weird right due
to do it's used to be a lot more fun
think that's all of them so you now have
a form looks fine I'm in style the
button i could go ahead and style the
send button as well and we have the
firefox looking drop down in the firefox
looking checkbox right these are really
consistent the inputs but the checkboxes
and in this case is select isn't is
different depending on the browser on
this especially it gets weird when you
get into mobile browsers because we all
know we still have Android to two users
that sometimes visit our our website and
we want to hate them but we're going to
try not to hate on them too much so
let's start with the checkbox there's a
new class called CB it's not CB is it
like they may have changed it give me
just a second
oh yeah yeah that's for the checkbox is
we have the check box and that is
summarily the the probe the thing you're
going to program against and in its
place for check box this is a little
simpler for select but for check box
you're actually going to create a span
of class indicator where did you go to
the custom patrol indicator did they
change that already now it should be
custom indicator let's see if it works
this may be one of the places where
they're still changing it because the
label also needs a custom control I
believe it's indicator might be just a
custom input that uh their way
let's see if it actually worked did I
save it I said I saved it but didn't
change the look they may may be one that
that's changed since let's see see if
that actually works for us nope well
thank you I ran through this the other
day maybe they've changed it really off
recently let's try with the Select is
that to me is the more interesting one
anyway
and also the simpler one because there's
fewer pieces so they've changed this so
this is the exact look at a look
regardless of the browser you're on
because their owner drawing it as well
that makes sense but this idea of custom
control and custom type of control is
something that they welcome you or want
you to extend into your own type of
control so if you have custom sort of
things they want to provide sort of a
framework to start because in order to
make this work it's a set of CSS but
it's also a set of JavaScript that's
looking for the selectors to do the
magic of when someone opens it show the
items when someone selects change the
underlying select so that your
programming will still be against the
underlying objects but if you looked at
this in the debugger you'll actually see
the Select has been hidden and then
there's this other piece that is all the
drawing mechanism in its place and so
it's doing the job of communicating
between what the user sees and when
you're programming against and let's
talk about the last few changes so font
glyph icons are gone you use your
favorite font Alex to show you that a
second we'll talk about figures and
we'll talk about progress bar so these
are the last three important changes
let's start with font awesome because
it's awesome and it's full of fonts okay
maybe one font how many of you already
used one of these font awesome or one of
the other most of you so this won't be
new for most of you and I'm just going
to use this in one place you can see
instead of the default you're going to
just want to include font awesome in the
project first I forgot to do
and then I can go ahead and use that
magic I still want to know why they used
I guess icon instead of at Alec but
whatever font awesome font awesome what
was it called cutlery there's a lot of
fonts in there so second so I like
screwed it up thank you we now have big
and his love over here and we still
don't have that quite working I'll fix
that before we get to it but you can at
least see the font is being used and
that's how you would use it instead of
the glyph icons it's not the glyph icons
are better i stopped using glyph icons
because their class names were so long i
just got set of typing glyph icons that
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that
alone was worth it so let's talk about
progress bars real quick actually let's
talk about figures so if i want to have
image figures there's a new convent
whoops distributing cash there's a new
convention called a figure a new element
called the figure and on its own it's
not doing a lot in changing the way it
looks so let's refresh this and go back
up top which one did I do the second one
yeah so this is now a figure and you can
see it's not really doing anything
different what's interesting is that you
can now inside this container have a
figure caption
right and that's not that big a deal
it's just a little sort of decorated one
but it knows about the container so that
if you decided to pull let's say extra
small right it's going to stay in the
container it's really attached to it so
needing to annotate figures just a
little nicety that I'm glad they put in
because I've had to do that a lot by
writing my own classes and finally the
very sexy progress bar I love the idea
of a progress bar because the nature of
of the web is that every time we show a
progress bar it's really not accurate
right we're just guessing or moving it
we're trying to distract it's like it's
like we're taking pictures of toddlers
right look at the bouncing ball trying
to get them to pay attention to some
place so the big difference here is it's
no longer this convoluted structure it's
Oh HTML has a progress let's let's use
it now that more browsers have
implemented it so the standard
attributes are now being tolerated max
and data state no value there we go
let's say 50 so on its own the unstyled
progress bar by press save whoops
really
you know it's too far up now that that
headers too big sorry let me just take
the fix top off for a minute because of
my stupid not think that working there's
our lovely default oh there's our check
box there's the bug so I wasn't working
there's our beautiful progress bar as
default in whatever browser and such and
again to make it look the same in all
browsers you can now just add classes
called progress and there's some other
progress sort of bars so I'll do
progress bar striped in progress bar
let's say animated really
I think I have the old one in there
striped and progress let's say warning
that's better so we're going to get that
same sort of be able to style it in some
standard ways we instead of that I think
it was three divs nested and amongst
each other in order to do it in the old
version having to actually be able to
use progress bar and it used the HTML
actual values instead of having invented
their own so the big I think the big
takeaway is if you think a buscar is
going to be important to you this is a
good time to sort of poke around and
look at it but not to adopt it it's not
i'm not sure whether i would adopt it a
beta but they've been pretty good of
when they get to beta they're going to
stop breaking the api's they're still
making changes are still getting rid of
and adding different pieces small pieces
but pieces so that we're it's still
pretty early for this stuff there's a
link to the docs for v4 already they're
pretty comprehensive for alpha docs I'm
pretty impressed there's the blog
announcing the the first alpha that was
back in Oh August isn't it August now
last year august and there will be a
bootstrap for course on pluralsight as
soon as they get off their Duff's and
finish it because Twitter doesn't isn't
doing a lot of work right now they could
easily just write a new framework right
any questions here
I don't know I know that so the question
was the controls have been reworked has
the accessibility been improved and I
don't know because I haven't really dug
in and tested that I know that it's on
their list of things that they're
improving but I haven't looked to what
extent that be a good question for them
on the on the slack channel say again
probably probably other questions the
witch yes yeah the validation markup
really hasn't changed and you can still
style them away from what they're doing
but they really haven't done anything
different they're no see again fitter Oh
footer no not really so the question was
did the footer change any and not that I
could discernibly tell the same classes
to stick it to the bottom or to have it
float are still there and they just seem
to work like they always have so I don't
believe so they have done some
improvements in grouping and some of the
pills and tabs that are you there
visibly they don't pop in and out as
much as they used to when you're
changing screen size and some things
like that so there's been some
improvements animations have been
primarily moved to CSS versus JavaScript
animations and things like that so there
is some performance increase in for as
well but until they optimize it and ship
it who knows other questions yeah
I
so the question was whether things like
angular material that doesn't play well
with bootstrap been any talk about the
group's talking to each other and
traditionally since Google and Twitter
or really good friends I don't think so
i haven't heard of anything but i
haven't been the know on that that would
be something that they could probably
answer you on the on the slack channel
way better than I could to be honest
with you other questions or you in for
cookies who's in for cookies well thank
you very much i'll be up here if you
have some questions and thanks for
coming don't forget to vote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
