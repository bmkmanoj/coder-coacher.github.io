and I also work for the main and today
I'm here to talk to you about designing
voices or interfaces for Amazon Alexa is
here with me today
so yeah it's she's gonna be she is gonna
be helping throughout the presentation
how many of you have used alexa before
or i've owned one all right cool so for
those who don't know that's just there's
not much to it it's essentially just a
bunch of speakers a microphone and then
everything happens online so you can do
fun things like say Alexa introduce
yourself I'm Alexa and I'm designed
around your voice you can ask me to play
music answer questions get the weather
and sports scores create to-do lists and
much more isn't she great yes I think I
am alright go so the talk today is more
about how to design good user interfaces
for voice but what is really so
different about about voice UI is right
well there is no screen right so your
users can't really discover how your
application works or what it can do this
is the only cat picture for today I
promise
so to me it reminds me a lot of when
smartphone starts you have to come up
and you know when we all got access to
the web everywhere that was pretty much
unusable right zoom in zoom out
everywhere
all those flight menus that you can
click but then you can't select anything
because the second is that you finger
off yes it's it's gone away so this is
the same forearm to me it's very very
similar for our voice you can't just use
the same flows as you would use in your
mobile apps or in your web apps and just
make a voice interface for it so with
with Alex are you can teach it new
tricks right and those new apps are
called skills so what's the skill
essentially that's just an API they
would run on your service does a few
things and then send some JSON back to
to the device which is then gonna spell
it out for you cool
the first step of it is to define an
interaction model so that's how Alexa is
gonna understand what you say and take
actions based on that so you don't have
to worry too much about doing the
natural language processing and all this
kind of things it does everything for
you
and you just get some Jason back but so
you've got three components there
utterances slots and intense so let's
just look at an example assuming that
I've got an app called skilled demo I
would call it like that so I say Alexa
asked skill demo what our skills then it
would give me the definition about the
skill so you have to say Alex I was just
waking it up it's not listening unless
you say this that's at least that's what
amazon says then when say ask is gonna
say oh okay I need to start the skill
skill demo is just the name of the skill
so that's how it knows that yes you know
in the case we're going to look at in a
minute it's gonna have to start the
domain up for example the domain skill
what are in this case is the utterances
so no look at that you did to try to
find out which which action in your in
your skill to to trigger and then skills
is just a viable but in in Alex our
language is it's called the slot now if
you're already in the middle of a
conversation with that with Alexa you
wouldn't wake her up obviously because
she's already listening it is already
listening and you will just say tell me
more about what skills are in that case
tell me more about what are is the
utterance and skills is still the viable
the slot and the combination of the
utterance and the slot gives you the
intent in this case here it figured out
that the intent is to get a definition
and viable the parameter for it is
skills so yeah I thought we might as
well just go through a real-world
example and show you what we've done at
the main we've played with it a little
bit so I could say Alexa asked domain
what my property is worth and what would
happen here is that before it reaches my
AP is Amazon is actually gonna pass all
this and I'm gonna get a few things in
in the request in JSON so again you
don't have to worry about passing the
text and all that it's gonna be
The Voice and although it's gonna be
done for you so here I know that it's an
intent request so okay so it triggered
one of those intents we were talking
about and the intent that it picked up
is get property value we'll get to that
in a second and there was no parameters
so how how did you figure that out from
that sentence that I wanted to get the
property value
well that's because you stopped by in a
developer portal by defining your your
interaction model in this case here I've
defined to intents the first one is get
property value and it doesn't have any
parameters and the second one is a free
text intent which is just taking some
random text and it's gonna try to
process it as a postal address there's
also a bunch of built-in intents that
Amazon make available to you guys you
have to make sure that you add them to
your app for some of them to your skill
or your your your your submission could
get rejected as well like you need to
make sure that people can get out of
your skill if they want to and they
don't have to listen to two hours of
your book all at once so the ones that
will be especially using here are the
yes intent and no intent and then you
have to map all this so there is a
section for utterances on deaf portal
where you just start with the name over
the intent and then give it an example
of what your users might say to figure
this so in this case here for that get
property value intent the utterance
could be what is my property worth now
you don't have to to have every single
little cases here they do a lot of all
the combinations I mean because Amazon's
gonna do a lot of a lot of the natural
language processing for you say here if
I was to say what's my property worth or
what my property is worth that would
work just the same but I do have two
examples because I wanted to work with
property and with house so for that had
to have a difference and then the last
instant I've got here the second one is
free text intent which is just gonna
take everything I say as a variable then
you'll see what it looks like in a
second
so again Alex I asked the men what my
property is worth sure thing
where do you live okay so your API is
just just as to how to return this you
bits of Jason here where you've got the
output speech in our case the exact text
and after a few seconds if you don't
reply it's gonna ask again and you get
as a developer the opportunity to change
the text a little bit so here for
example I dropped sure thing the last
the last thing here is should end
session which is set to false meaning
the conversation is still going don't
we're not restarting from the beginning
every time so I'm gonna give it my
address
this time it's it's gonna pick up free
text intent that's the second intent we
declared earlier and I do have a viable
this time which is my address exactly as
I said or is it not quite because it
picked up that I said seven hills and
turned on the the the word into a number
so just be careful about that when when
you do your your processing behind the
scene with your API okay I have found a
property at 13 Jeanette Street seven
hills New South Wales 2147
is that yours so I'm not gonna go
through the details of the response this
time because that's very similar to what
we had before but just you know best
practices for designing your your voice
your voice UX when you do have
complicated questions when you expect a
lot of free text just confirm with your
user that you actually understood what
they want right cool so I'm just gonna
say yes this is my house and this time
is gonna just use the built in yes
intense this property is a house with
three bedrooms two bathrooms in one
parking space it is on a block of land
that is 683 square meters this house is
estimated to be worth around seven
hundred twenty-eight thousand dollars
with a range from six hundred thirty
thousand dollars to eight hundred
twenty-five thousand dollars would you
like to hear more so there's a lot of
information here so and there is a lot
more that we can give as well
again you don't want people to have to
sit through the two hours of you book
all at once or sign of that so maybe
just make sure to keep things short
enough and if you really have a lot more
content ask if they want to hear more in
this case here we're running out of time
we're actually out of time already so
I'm just gonna say no
here more and I just get the no intent
everything works as expected you'd like
to claim this property on domain home
price guide so this part I really like
again there is no screen so there is no
way for your users to discover what they
can access and what they can't right so
means when they're just about to get out
like that say well I don't actually do
you want to do this because that's easy
and that's just a yes or no answer as
well so so why not some of course right
I'm gonna do this
not at this time even though I said of
course it still picks up the yes intent
that's something that Amazon deals with
as well it knows a few ways of saying
yes and that's just gonna map it
automatically John all yours
so here yeah just make sure that you try
to keep the personality of Alexa as well
if you try a lot of the building
built-in tasks that come with the device
you see that schism it is it's got a bit
of a personality so try to keep that as
much as possible it's not a robot after
always you personal assistant right and
then here there is nowhere to go so I'm
just setting shooting session to true to
say yes the conversation is over and the
next time I want to ask something I'm
gonna have to say Alexa asked domain and
go again so that's good because we
already knew how to get Alex attitude to
answer these questions for us give
Esther about the give us the property
value but let's just assume that we just
install the app and we don't know what
it is skill and we don't know what it
does right so you would say Alexa start
domain right and we don't know what
happens so this time the the the request
type is different it's not an intent
request anymore it's a launch request
meaning that's in your skill in your API
you can actually do things a little
welcome to domain how can I help you
today
you can ask me what your property is
worth in what your upcoming inspections
are so now that's very very clear for
the users that there is only to two
things that they can ask and yeah
there's not much more to talk about here
it's just gonna go with the same flow
again so I can just say hey what is my
house worth again it maps to the same
things as before do you still live at 13
Jeannette Street Seven Hills New South
Wales 2147 so this is very important
input by voice is difficult
so as much as possible try to remember
things about your users so just to make
it a lot easier for them the next time
around when when they start using your
skill cool so that was a simple scenario
but every now and again actually needs a
little bit of a hints on how to
pronounce things and to use that to do
that you can use something called SS ml
now since you always forget what is s ml
is for though speech synthesis markup
language thanks Alex
so there's just a little bit of markup
that you would drop into the text of
your responses just to give it a hint of
what how to say things this had a quick
example great job how you you are
correct
okay so how would she say that great job
you are correct now I don't know what
you think about this but my first
thought when I hear this is come on just
say it like you mean it right it's
better so your first instinct might be
to try to do something like that
EER job you are correct
yeah not quite so that's why you would
just drop a little bit of markup like
this cool at an emphasis with a strong
level and that should sound much much
better great job
you are correct no I believe it okay
next thing to them to be careful of
numbers and especially phone numbers
dialing 18-billion 1234567 so that's
very impressive that's also pretty much
useless right but we want this more
something like this dialing
1-800-455-1052 or mated I haven't
actually formatted the phone
now last thing before before we go for
today my favorite audio tags so as of
just a few months ago you can start
dropping now sound effects within within
the speech that Alex would read out
that's very useful for some applications
there is a game called the magic though
and that's just an adventure game in so
you know you find yourself in magic
world and you keep going and make
decisions and things happen so you might
have something like that in a game
oh my do you feel that cold wind it sure
is getting dark we hear wolves howling I
don't like that so that's all good
you've got this part he is very
descriptive but really it's not really
engaging right so what if we were just
to drop walls in in in this speech back
that would sound something like that oh
my do you feel that cold wind it sure is
getting dark I don't like that it's all
of us I'm not a lot more engaging in no
you can play this game for hours so yeah
check it out actually it's very good
game so I think that's all we've got
time for today actually like if you want
to see him or about an exercise there's
a session this afternoon room seven by
either downing about how to build those
API so more getting into into the the
crowd of it and if you want to see more
about the cool things that we've built
at the main go to check that the Malcolm
3 you if you're interested in the api's
that we used to build this skill that
you heard about it just before head to
developer the domain will come to you
we've just made all this appears public
a couple of weeks ago don't forget to
tell them we're hiring no that's right
we're hiring as well so whatever you
doing front-end backing mobile if you do
it we need it so yeah get in touch on
links you know after the talk thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
