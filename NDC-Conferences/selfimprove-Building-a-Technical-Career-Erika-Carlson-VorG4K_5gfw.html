thank you so much for being here as this
is the 15th or so conference I've spoken
at but still every single time I panic
that nobody will show up to my session
and then I think actually that wouldn't
be so bad and I could just like you know
go here one of the other five sessions
that I really want to be listening to
you right now but thank you for watching
that fear for me and I really appreciate
your being here because at a multitrack
conference like this this is now my
second end you see conference every hour
there's like a ton of sessions that I
want to go to the quality is so high so
I really appreciate you choosing to
spend some time with me especially all
the cool tech stocks like you know if
you're just here because you're
completely like exhausted from all the
tech talks and you need to consider the
back and sleep that's okay I get it but
I'm glad you're here so before I get
started a little bit about me America I
am ia Carlson everywhere on the internet
that matters I'm a software developer um
I started in back-end Java years ago did
some JavaScript did some other stuff
primarily to iOS iOS development these
days it work in a little company called
Detroit labs in Detroit Michigan and I
train and coach software developers my
current role is the director of our
apprenticeship and training programs a
couple of years ago we were really
struggling to hire mobile developers
because it turns out mobile developers
can get paid a lot of money and then get
paid a lot of money to go work in places
where it's not winter for nine months
out of the year so we thought okay what
can we do and our company has a really
strong teaching and learning culture I'm
going to get more into this later in the
talk but we thought what if we could
take that culture and apply it to people
who didn't have any prior experience in
software development so we started our
apprenticeship program and we brought in
10 people who had no prior experience as
software developers and over the course
of three months we trained them they
learned iOS and at the end of those
three months we hired them and they
joined our team full-time many of them
are still with us we did the same thing
in the fall with an Android program the
next year one of our clients came to us
and said you just trained yourself 20
developers that's phenomenal could you
do that for us so with the JavaScript
program for a major out
client Detroit we just did another iOS
program for another major automotive
client Detroit so at this point we've
graduated close to 50 people from our
program we're really proud of it and I
am really proud that I get to run it so
coaching and training or a big part of
what I do every day I also coach a lot
of our regular employees who are
interested in growing who want to build
their careers I kind of fell into that
because my career took a really
interesting trajectory if you'd asked me
five years ago when I was happily
banging away at Java if my job was going
to be trained in your developers five
years down the road I would have been
like no I don't know enough and B I hate
talking in front of people so this seems
like a really bad combination for me I
learned a lot along the way and one last
thing which is kind of where this comes
from before i got into development my
background was psychology I did
mediation which means I help people get
divorced which is about as much fun as
it sounds but I learned a lot I learned
a lot about what motivates people what
brings them joy what makes them struggle
and how they grow and so that background
in forms a lot of the work I do now and
informs a lot of what you're going to
hear in this talk speaking of the suck
I'm going to talk to you today about how
to grow as a software developer and I
think that technically and inter
personally and professionally this talk
involves ten strategies that are drawn
from my career and from my experience
coaching others I like to think that
it's relevant no matter what stage of
your career that you're in because it's
never too late to grow and hopefully
throughout our entire careers we're
finding new challenges for ourselves
explore new opportunities and pushing
ourselves really quick I like to know
who's in the room with me raise your
hand if you would consider yourself to
be a junior developer got a couple nice
okay mid-level okay and raise your hand
if you're a senior tech lead any of that
good stuff awesome okay a good mix this
time so lots of mid-levels lots of
seniors a couple of juniors great as a
developer you know that growth and
change is part of who we are right
like we don't really have an option the
work that we do changes daily weekly
monthly I was an iOS developer before
there was cliff and then suddenly there
was a new programming language we all
kinda went ah and really quickly while
also maintain all of our good to see
apps pick up this whole new language but
that's just part of the job it's part of
the deal it's really exciting because we
don't have to do the same thing day
after day year after year we get to go
do new cool things and explore them but
it means that growth is part of our job
if we stagnate we die all right so we're
going to start talking through our
career progression a little bit with
what it looks like step one senior
developer you made it you got a job yay
you congratulations so you learn to code
and you learned a problem saw when you
learn to use code to problem solve and
you learn to deal with other people kind
of and every day you hopefully get
better at all of those things and your
primary job is to learn the middle is
where it gets weird because one day you
wake up and you're not a junior
developer anymore maybe this is because
somebody says to you that you're not
adding your developer anymore but more
likely it's because you look around one
day and realize you kind of have some
idea what's going on and people are now
coming to you and saying hey can you
help me with this can you explain this
to me you go I know things we don't
magical but you're definitely not a
senior Deb yet that's so like you know
way off in the future and this is great
around the point where the career path
gets really confusing for most people
one of the biggest questions that I get
from people that I coach is how do I
know when I'm a senior developer I used
to say when I gave conference talks that
I would give people 20 bucks if I give
me a good answer and then I got enough
to the answers that I stopped making
that offer so sorry no dice today but
that is one of the biggest questions how
do I get here I'd okay now that you're a
senior developer when your job title is
senior developer and or your salary has
an acceptable number of zeros in it I
work for a flat organization so there
are no job titles but I've discovered an
interesting phenomenon whereas people
will start calling
senior does at a certain point even
though it's not really the thing that we
have we don't have juniors or mid levels
or seniors we just have developers but
people will still say oh yes so and so
our senior iOS dev so everybody else
noticing you're a senior developer you
just gotta figure it out career paths a
weird in software because they're
different they're different between eyes
you're a startup on if you're at a flat
organization like mine which has a
hundred people and no managers that's an
adventure or if you're an additional
hierarchy I'm from Detroit a lot of the
big automakers are there they've got
like twelve levels that are just
technical and then there's like 18
miniature your levels above that I wish
I were kidding but I'm not so it's very
there's not really a clear you start
here you end up in the middle here and
then here's your goal five years ago
somebody said to me what do you want to
be doing in five years I hate that
question mostly because I don't usually
know the answer to it but also because
for a developer it's a limiting question
because the work we do is so flexible
and applies to so many things it's
constantly changing so in five years we
could realistically be doing anything
I'm not doing now what I thought I would
be doing five years ago we will end
about that someone you aren't either so
with this talk I want to introduce a
different way to think about growing
your career although I mean that does
look like a bad goal to me
so strategy number one is to begin with
the end when I talk to people about
careers and when I begrudgingly sit down
and think about my own a focus on two
questions where am I going and how am I
getting there and we're generally is not
in five years I want to be CTO or in
five years I want to be an architect or
in five years I want to be specific role
where is a little more general and I
break it down like this I start with
what I want my career to support because
your career supports your life and what
you want your life to look like is the
important part way more important the
job that you end up doing so do I want
my career to support a family do I want
it to support international travel do I
want to be able to live wherever I want
do I want to be able to live in a big
city do I want to buy a house do I never
want to buy a house I have a house now
and I regret that a little bit but think
about that what are the things that you
want from life but your career has to
support do you have to make enough money
to do you have to have enough time to do
and make you have to have the
flexibility and freedom to do so that's
question one everything else lives in
that context question 2 what are my pan
jable and intangible career goals
tangible voles are things like I want to
make six figures I want to manage at
least 10 people I want to be able to
work remotely I want to be able to take
six weeks sabbatical every year those
are tangible goals intangibles are
things like I want my colleagues due
respect to me I want to be the first on
the team that people come to when they
have a question about this technology I
want fulfillment I want recognition and
those are different for everybody next
what's in my way what are the obstacles
it is amazing how often the answer to
this question is yourself amazing but
write those down my job is not going to
get anywhere I want to go but I can't
quit it because X we'll talk about that
I really really really want recognition
in my field that I'm really scared to
talk in front of people talk about that
too what's in the way and then last
great we have all these wonderful goals
we have these things that we want our
career support we've sketched out this
whole vision now what are you doing to
get there for me sometimes when I ask
these questions I get to that last
question and I go oh nothing since right
the second i'm not i'm doing a whole
bunch of stuff but none of it is the
stuff that's going to get me towards
those things so that question helps me
evaluate where I'm at in context of
where I want to go strategy number two
learning is who we are it's what we do
developers have to be exceptionally
skilled learners and it turns out that
learning is a skill in and of itself I
discovered this when I started teaching
for most of my job i looked at our
apprentices who succeeded in our
apprentices who did not and the biggest
difference is that the ones who
succeeded knew how to learn but if
learning the skill you can teach it
great news for all of us and these are
some of what i consider to be the most
important components of effective
learning the big one is asking good
questions this is the first thing that I
try to teach new developers how to
answer ask a question because forming a
good question helps you understand the
problem sometimes if you ask a thorough
enough question you actually will hear
the solution to the question in the
problem in there to the question in the
pin you're in your
solution the problem in your question
identify appropriate resources what that
actually means is we need to do
world-class Googlers really one of my
favorite tech interview questions is if
you don't know how to do this thing what
would you google I can tell a lot about
how effective somebody's going to be and
how they can hit the ground running by
their answer recognize and apply general
principles most of us are past the
points in their career so we can just
copy and paste answer a stack overflow
and have it work for our needs we need
to be able to look at a solution or look
at a best practice or look at a
suggestion and go okay here's the
concept being explained here and here's
how I apply it to my specific weird use
case and we need to be able to filter
out noise turns out there are some bad
answers on Stack Overflow you know who
did not know that brand new developers I
get some code and I go where did you in
their life but it was on the internet
you know so we have to be able to filter
out noise there are bad tutorials
there's that information there are bad
articles out there you've got to be able
to look at a resource because there are
so many and no and about 10 to 15
seconds max if that research is going to
be useful to you or not
being a good learner applies tech skills
for sure we have to have it for
technical skills but it's also really
valuable in interpersonal skills and as
a business skill client's love when they
can you say things one time and they
never have to repeat it because you've
got it the first time or because you
then ask the appropriate clarifying
questions to get a second time it's a
really good our personal skill because
let's say you've got a teammate who
really hate to be interrupted and you
learn that when they have their
headphones on that's the sign don't go
near them and if they have headphones
off that's probably a good time to go
ask them for something you can learn
about people and it makes you more
effective working with them it's good to
load know your learning style as you may
have noticed based on the amount of
verbiage of my slides I am a very verbal
person i'm also a verbal learner so i
read things and that's how i learned
them it turns out as a verbal learner
i'm also a verbal teacher and that works
great until my second class of
apprentices when i had a student who
raised her hand and went yeah can you
draw me a picture first of all I lack
the design skills God gave a squirrel so
that was you know a bad time to start
with and second of all that's just not
how I think I don't think in pictures
and I know that which is good for me
because I know to not really go looking
for visual tutorials I have a really
hard time watching videos about how to
do a programming concept doesn't make a
lot of sense to me but if I can read
about it and then go do it that work if
you've gotta know your learning style
we're really lucky in our field that we
have so many venues for learning
available to us you're in one right now
so if you're here you're already off to
a good start I think of opportunities
for learning is kind of broken down into
three different groups there are three
different types and the first one is
group conferences are my favorite thing
I leave them so inspired I have so many
new ideas and I just I'm so refreshed
and ready to go back to work and that's
awesome I also need to take about two
days to work remotely
I get back because I'm totally peopled
out by the time I get home and that's
okay I know that about myself so it
works but to me it's worth it the amount
of inspiration the amount of learning
packed into a short time is invaluable
classes some people learn really well
when they have an instructor to ask
questions I am NOT one of those people
but I know a lot of them workshops same
deal meetups and user groups I have
gotten every job that I have gotten
through people that I met at meetups and
user groups and this is a challenge for
me because I'm deeply introverted and I
hate nothing more literally than
glandular roomful of strangers and going
hi I'm Erica I do this how are you 14
times in a row it's the worst but it's
an incredibly valuable way to meet
people and build your network and
incredibly valuable way to learn next
there is what I think of as solo
learning and this is wearing that focus
just on you but there's one other person
involved and mentoring and coaching fall
under this category I'm going to talk
more about coaching mentoring a little
bit later and last step is self teaching
I was home-schooled doing a big fan of
self pc and that's kind of how i learned
to learn growing up so self teaching
involves books tutorials and doing your
own projects to apply concepts in
figuring out if you look at these some
of them probably sound like better ideas
to you than others and that's fine
that's individual person to person but I
would encourage you if there's a form of
learning that you really like try
something else once in a while jump out
of the bubble I was really horrified to
go to my first conference and I went and
I didn't speak to anybody and I sat in
the back row in every single session and
I went home to bed for like three days
afterwards but once I kind of like
recovered from the people I went that
was awesome I learned so much that was
so cool so worth exploring
one other thing to think about will you
go into a learning opportunity is be
open to what secondary learning learning
opportunities there are for you from a
conference you might learn how to talk
to strangers in a professional context
from a workshop maybe you build your
skills in asking structured questions
from one-on-one mentoring maybe you get
better at receiving constructive
feedback calmly and thoughtfully that's
a valuable skill all right strategy
number three learn to teach I think of
knowledge is having kind of three levels
of depth and the first is understanding
I theoretically know that test driven
development means I write a test and
then I write code to make that failing
test patch level two application I can
actually set up the test framework write
the test have a failing test write the
code make the test pass and then there's
teaching I can explain to somebody else
so that they hit understanding and then
they get to applying and if I'm a really
good teacher maybe they also gets
teaching eventually to let me tell you
there is nothing in the world to make
you learn a concept like realizing
you're going to have to explain it to a
room full of people who are going to
stare at you and then ask you a lot of
questions that you don't know how to
answer seriously like before I was a
teacher of developers I would say things
like hey don't use too much ram with
your iOS s just like keep them like not
memory intensive small memory footprint
thumbs up good okay move on and the
first time I did that somebody raised
their hand and went well how much memory
can i use and i said as little as
possible and i figure out how much
anyway and so i had to say i don't know
in front of a class which is a humbling
but valuable experience what i learned
from that i went home in the next iOS
class that I thought I spun up an app
that just ate memory and Iran
like four different test devices to see
when they would Chris when they would
when they would say memory warning and
then when they would just straight-up
crash into the next class I went in and
I said if you use fifty six percent of
the RAM and eyes on you an iPhone 6 you
will get a warning and at sixty percent
it will crash everybody went okay and I
went so teaching taste your knowledge to
a level that you might not need to go
otherwise I had to narrow down my
components of effective teaching history
so I picked the three that were the
biggest revelations for me and the first
one was seeking feedback and adjusting
in real time I thought of teaching as I
prepare a lesson plan I delivered a
lesson plan and then everybody goes home
which was cute the first time I
delivered a lesson plan on passed by
reference versus passed by value in Java
somebody raised your hand and went can
you explain it to me with otters I did
by the way it took a minute but I figure
out a metaphor teaching never goes
according to plan you have to adjust in
the moment have to look around and see
are you losing people are they falling
asleep do they look forward or their
eyes glaze over are they distracted or
they on their phones are they do they
have that look of horror on their face
like I understood four of the last 18
word you just said and you have to be
responsive to that in real time next
constant opportunities for practice the
more that I teach the left that item of
the left I talk I talk a little bit and
then I say okay now go put your hands in
the keyboard because what I quickly
remembered from when i learned a program
was that I learned very little from
someone talking at me but I learned a
lot from getting my end in the keyboard
and making mistakes so when you teach
say some stuff and then give space to
practice the third one was the hardest
thing in the world
and that is allow the people that you're
teaching to fail if you're a senior
developer and you have a junior pair
that you're supposed to be mentoring and
coaching great let them mess up it is so
hard to send your hands when you know
the answer you want to go no you just
got a semicolon if you could just but
don't say sit back and go I don't know
what do you think the first six months
is my career I paired with a super
senior java developer every single day
and he would do that all the time and it
drew me in sings I knew he knew right
like he would look at my code and go
home we now is she did that thing again
but he would never say that he had this
incredible patience this incredible
grace of knowing that if he let me get
to the answer myself that would be far
more valuable than him just going oh no
you just do that thing so make room for
people to fail teaching there's a lot of
benefits and you can teach in a lot of
contact I'm lucky in that I have a whole
apprenticeship program and I get to
teach for about six months out of a
given year but you can teach at
conferences you can teach workshops you
can they use your groups you can give a
one to learn at your company there are
all kinds of ways to build teaching into
your career we talked about deeper
knowledge you can learn to build rapport
with a room that's really important
because a lot of us has developers
especially as we go up the levels and
kind of move into leadership and tech
lead roles we're going to have to talk
to room full of people we're going to
have to sell the value of our work we're
going to have to explain why the thing
we did makes a lot more sense than the
thing they asked for very often we're
going to explain to non-technical
audiences so it's really good to teach
because you learn to break down complex
concepts into sixth grade words and you
learn to do that feedback thing where
you look at a room you go okay they got
it they didn't they did I'm going to say
it this way and see if that makes it
better you build your communication
skills one of the toughest lessons that
we learned was that the best developers
we had did not make the best teachers
tough for them too they know so much
software development involves so much
contextual knowledge think about the
work that you do and then think about
all the other things that you know about
that enable the work that you do I'm an
iOS developer I know how Xcode works
kind of I hate it but yeah but I know
about Xcode I know that echo does some
really stupid inexplicable things that I
would not know if I didn't use it every
day I know version control I know how to
use git I know how to use our build
tools I know how to use our test
frameworks I know what a test framework
is I know what a framework is see what
I'm saying contextual knowledge we have
so much terminology we have so much
additional stuff beyond just the code
that we write and so taking super senior
developers and putting them in front of
new people they spoke their own language
they spoke developer speak and the
nuvola developers went sorry what could
you I don't oh god I'm an idiot I should
totally understand this I see this a lot
with developers speaking to
non-technical audiences as well every
project that I've ever been on has had a
product owner that was not a technical
person they were a manager or they were
marketing or they were some other area
and so giving them a demo could not be
us up here talking developer words we
had to learn how to explain the work
that we were doing in understandable
terms so teaching once you practice that
peeking helps you learn to give and
receive effective feedback those are
both skills we're going to talk about
them more a couple slides and finally
teaching lets you practice public
speaking in an environment where
theoretically at least you are the
expert I used to be terrified to talk to
people in rooms like this like I would
get up on the stage and immediately lose
like 40 I two points just just out of
sheer fear and then I spent a lot of
time talking to junior developers which
had the marvelous impact
to me that I actually know more than I
think and then I started coaching more
experienced developers and then I
started coming to conferences and
hopefully saying things that are
valuable to people that have more
experience than I do so teaching is a
great way if you are like most people
afraid of public speaking to get started
all right number four if you're here
you've already got a great start on this
we are so lucky with the community that
we have in software development there
are so many opportunities to learn and
to be supported and to grow in both
professional and a personal context so
I'm from the US um we have meetup groups
galore use your groups local stuff
conferences all over the place so easy
to find like you go on the internet and
your legs Detroit Python and there's
like five different groups to talk about
that which is fantastic so look and see
what you've got close to you if you are
from a tiny little rural town and
there's not much of a tech community you
can still access the community there are
tons of flat groups i'm a member of more
flex and i want to admit i might need an
intervention twitter is great for making
contacts for reinforcing contacts you
meet somebody conference talk to them on
Twitter after that if they live in your
side of the world you're still in
contact and I say this in the context of
career building because professional
contacts are like gold they can mentor
you they can commiserate with you they
can conspire with you to build really
cool stuff they can inspire you they can
support you and of course it can help
you find your next rule I have never
gotten the job by sending somebody
resume ever I have got any phenomenal
jobs because I knew somebody and not in
the kind of you scratch my back I'll
scratch your back kind of way but in the
way that someone you know understand
that there's more to you than your
resume I got my first developer job with
a couple of programming classes about a
year of self teaching and a sparkling
personality and that was literally it
look I went to the tech interview and
the only thing that I didn't do was cry
yeah but I met the guy who interviewed
me at a meetup group for a meetup that
I'd started
and down here I say if you don't have a
community create one something I noticed
in Detroit was that every technical
event that I went to was full of men and
men are fantastic I like them a lot but
I never met other women developers and
that was kind of a bummer so I found
this organization called girl develop it
which was founded in new york in 2010
and said hey can I start a chapter in
Detroit and they were like we don't know
if any is going to be an amazing to be
interested and I was like I don't know
if anyone's going to eat it either but
i'd like to give it a shot so a friend
that I started this chapter of girl
develop it in Detroit we thought
nobody's going to show up to our first
meeting and 75 people did it has now
been for years and girl develop at
Detroit has three thousand members has
taught a thousand women to code and has
a thriving and vibrant community that
was not there before so if you don't
have a community you can make one and I
got my first job at that first event
when this technical recruiter said to me
you should come interview for me and I
went in you don't want that which is not
a thing you should say when somebody
says they want to interview just for the
record and he said oh why do you say
that I don't know anything like I should
have taken some classes I really want to
get into this field I'm so excited about
it I want to learn I want to learn but
like I don't know enough yet I can't do
this for money and he said yeah okay so
you said all those things which are all
the right things and you're here and you
started this thing and that's huge for
me starting that group has been one of
the most valuable professional moves
that I ever made because I would good
hundred isn't deterring people would go
oh yeah you're the girl who did the
thing which was way better than just
being oh yeah you're a girl so so that
was my first job and every other one
that I got came out of a relationship as
well
when I say relationships I don't mean I
hate the term network you can I also
hate networking when I go to events I
talk to everybody that i can because
that's great and it's good practice talk
to people but when I form relationships
I think about quality over quantity
because you can only manage so many
relationships you should focus on the
ones that are going to be really
valuable to you I also focus on what i
can do for another person versus what
they can do for me because if I focus on
what I can do for them whatever they can
do for me will usually show up at some
point down the road so begin those
relationships as a giver number five
know the business raise your hand if you
are writing code that to make money yeah
yeah all of us right so either we're
doing it to make money for ourselves in
our own business or for somebody else in
their business raise your hand if it's
for somebody else in their business yeah
most of us okay so if you are working
for a client learn everything you can
about their business about their model
about their goals their vision their
strategy about what they are trying to
accomplish if you're at a product
company working on our product know
everything about that product talk to
the designers for the product manager to
the owner learn about the vision the
goals and the challenges I say this
because i had an apprentice who had just
graduated from the program so she had a
solid three months of software
development experience and this is on a
team that was otherwise very very very
senior and we had put with the client
and then another client said oh hey i
need ios7 i'm flying with juniors and so
we said okay well the team she don is
pretty big so we're going to pull her in
front of civic team and we did and the
next day when she wasn't in standup the
client went where is so and so and we
said well well she's been looking at her
client they went no we like her bring
her back this is somebody was literally
three months like she could write a for
loop and that was about it right and we
all kind of went
oh ok so we did we got her back we said
to the client you know like why is this
person valuable to you we think she's
great but why you and they said she
talks to us in a way that makes sense we
trust her when she says things we
believe her this was the least
experienced person on that team by a
salad for years which in development is
like I know ten year Hollywood marriage
right but to the client she was one of
the most valuable is not the most
valuable people because the skilled is
she had cultivated which was to
understand what they were trying to do
and to understand how they wanted to
communicate and to tell them things they
wanted to know in a way that they
understood that don't trust she was in
that team for two years and we still had
and she was ready to go learn something
new we still had to really fight them to
get them to let her go so even if you
are not the most experienced person the
team you can still be the most valuable
next up
as it all efforts we kind of grow every
day we don't really have a choice you
know we're always doing something new my
favorite part of my job is that I go in
and I have a problem in front of me that
I don't immediately know how to solve
and so I get to go through that process
of figuring out how to solve it so we do
grow every day we just we have to but
growth where it goes beyond that growth
work means intentional growth above and
beyond kind of what you learn in the day
today and this could be things like
studies and professional goals and
working toward them it could be
intentionally building new skills if
you're a JavaScript developer maybe if
you learn the new framework user or
you'll learn a new build tool you're an
iOS developer maybe it's you learn how
to success in Xcode that nobody else
instead of solve except by starting
holding down and reinstalling it if you
know that by the way let me know it can
be asking other people for feedback and
saying hey I'm trying to grow I'm trying
to improve and trying to figure out
where I'm strong where I'm weak I would
love to know how you perceive me and
then taking that feedback and using it
to actively work and overcome your
weaknesses somebody said to me recently
I think of you as a leader in the
company but I noticed that you tend to
be kind of quiet we're having
contentious discussions that I think
your voice would be valuable in and I
went well I hate conflict like sometimes
I'm not even at those contentious
discussions I hate it that much but it
was valuable feedback and made me go oh
okay that's nothing i can work on and
lastly you can work with a mentor
professional coach I did this for the
first time this past year has been one
of the most valuable career experiences
that I've ever had and the coach that I
work with is not a developer she is not
technical at all I went to the
experience going I'm not really sure
that I can learn a lot and I after my
first session like had my head blown off
with how much I had learned so I highly
recommend that as well you can get a
long way through reflection especially
if you're pretty self-aware to begin
with but a huge part of your success in
your career is about understand how do
people perceive you and working to shift
the perception if you have to
which leads me to feedback feedback is
actually the other thing that I'm giving
talks about this year and I'm giving
talks about it because I historically
been very bad at it both giving and
receiving and I worked very hard to be
better my company has also been
historically very bad at feedback and we
have worked very hard to be better
because feedback is one of the best
tools you have for making performance
better positive feedback is great it
feels good it's motivational it builds
relationships and helps you look at your
strength because you may not know you
have them and build them up constructive
feedback which is what I say instead of
negative feedback helps you figure out
where you can be better when you seek
feedback I encourage you to do so from a
mix of colleagues it's really tempting
to just get feedback kind of from your
inner circle but those people are just
going to tell you how great you are and
that's nice to hear but it's not the
most valuable thing you can ask for so
ask some of those people ask them not to
be too nice to you ask some supervisors
and ask a broader collection I try to
get what we call 360 feedback about once
a year from our team and these days even
though it scares me a little every time
I ask people in the company that I know
are not my biggest fans they are great
colleagues we work well together but
they're not like personally in love with
me and my work in a way that would blind
them to the things that I have to get
better at and the feedback that I get
from them is the most valuable that I
guess because they're seeing things from
perspective that I don't have and the
people closest to me don't have giving
and receiving feedback are both
incredibly valuable skills and they are
both incredibly hard skills that most of
us don't get a lot of practice with
raise your hand if you think that your
workplace makes excellent use of
feedback as a performance improvement
tool oh boy that's less than usual all
right you're also in good company
because most workplace cultures don't do
that because it's hard it's really hard
but your ability to give honest and
thoughtful feedback whether it's
positive or negative shows your
colleagues and your company that you're
invested you care about their success
that builds a lot of positive things
your ability to receive feedback
graciously and act upon it if you need
to also engenders respect and builds
trust with the people around you like I
said this is a whole talk all by itself
but in the interest of time I'm going to
give you the really short version here
are my five fastest ways to improve your
feedback skills number one if somebody
gives you positive feedback they go you
killed it met me or I really loved that
thing you do with your code i'm chillin
your sanity to explain you later but
like I think this is awesome don't do
that thing where you go oh it's not that
was so dumb oh my god I said that stupid
thing don't do that look them in the eye
and say thank you harder than you think
this one's even harder accept
constructive feedback without saying
anything don't argue don't push back
don't have a lot of feeling to the
person giving you feedback pause breathe
brace your teeth if you have to and say
thank you for the feedback and then go
home cried about it if you have to I
have to sometimes sit with it wait till
the feelings simmer down a little bit
because they will emotions come and they
go when you are no longer emotional
about that constructive feedback then
decide if and how to act when you give
feedback be specific you did a good job
it's not helpful to anybody tell them
how you did a bad job is equally and
helpful to anybody tell them how be
thoughtful say it in a way that will
help it land gently for example I know
you probably did not mean this because I
think you were a good person but when
you said that thing in the meeting it
made you sound like a jerk and be direct
this is the hardest one for me I'm not
somebody like to say you messed up
really badly
it's so hard for me to just say that and
then stop there but sometimes that's the
most important thing you can do and
before you give unsolicited feedback ask
it starts you off on a good note you may
say to somebody hey I have some feedback
that I would like to give you are you
open to it and that will start off the
conversation far far far far better than
if you say hey you really mess up this
thing this thing and this thing and also
as need to tell you for a while that
other thing is that it prepare someone
unless I'm decide if they want the
feedback right then or not and finally
always assume positive intent when
you're giving feedback to somebody who's
messed up but soon they meant well and
if you are receiving feedback that's
hard to hear assume that person is
giving it to you for your growth they
are probably not giving you constructive
feedback because they hate you and think
that you suck they're probably giving
you that feedback convicting that you're
great and you could be better number
eight have an escape hatch have a way
out I have what I call a forget you fun
and I have that because if you want your
career to grow you have to be able to
get out of situations that sucks if
you're in a work environment that is
toxic that is hurting you or is it just
not letting you grow you need a way out
so that might be having us forget you
fund so that you can just quit but a
better way to handle that a broader way
is to build career security this is
different from job security job security
means you could keep a job that you have
career security means that if you lose
the job you have tomorrow even with
another one and not have it be too hard
you can do that by building a network by
having those relationships you can do it
by keeping your skills current through
that learn to learn thing we just talked
about and you can do it by making your
work visible and searchable for most of
us that means github or some other way
that our code is on the internet but it
can also mean blog posts it can also
conference talks it can mean all kinds
of things put your value out in the
world people can see it you should
always have a plan B and if you're a
control freak insanity even if you love
your job you should still be able to
picture the future in case things go
south tomorrow I love my company like
really really love it like not just
people say oh I love my company but like
I really love it it's part of my family
and a huge part of my life and I adore
it and I adore the work that I do but in
everything unloaded tomorrow I know who
my first three phone calls would be this
is a big one you can have the best
career in the world the best job in the
world the best everything you can have a
great community and have great
fulfilling professional relationships
and none of it matters if you stress
yourself sick if you are overwhelmed
with anxiety if you are in too much pain
to go to bed in the morning if you're
struggling with depression you have to
care for yourself and that means your
body it means your mind and it means
your heart we have this weird career it
can be incredibly rewarding it can also
be incredibly stressful working on your
deadlines is hard if you are one of
those people who have said be on call
the software developer a I'm sorry and B
that is stressful it's also not a job we
get to move around a lot unless we think
about it my company does have a
treadmill that you can work on by never
seen anybody doing it like we just we
get into mode we suddenly loosen your
desk for eight hours a day we also have
this really cool ability to do our work
anywhere in the world sounds great right
no it's not it is but only use do dish
ously because that ability to work from
anywhere can turn poison really really
fast it can turn into work always I say
this is so important because even if you
do everything else right poor health can
take it all away and it can take it all
the way really really fast so
I am NOT gonna lecture you about diet
and exercise I love cheeseburgers and
last night i binge watched 30 rock for
like eight hours because I and I justify
it because I ran a half marathon three
months ago so again no lectures but I
will encourage you to find a lifestyle
that works for you and that makes you
feel capable of doing the things that
you want to do in life similarly I will
not lecture you about working too many
hours because that would be hypocritical
my work is really important to me and I
invest a lot of time energy in it but I
would encourage you to set boundaries
ensure that work doesn't get in the way
of everything else that you want in life
I don't really believe in hard and fast
rules for work-life balance but I
believe in listening to yourself and
being kind to yourself and caring for
yourself in such a way that you can
learn and grow and experience joy and
fulfill your responsibility to the
people around you I'm going to skip
through this really faster than bring
clothes at a time here that's why it's
in a slide for you to take home with you
I built this little self-care inventory
and this is something else I using
coaching that I used for myself and to a
series of questions about physical
health about emotional health and how
work factors into both of those things
alright my last strategy if you are not
familiar with Dharma comics i highly
encourage you to check them out they are
written by an original facebooker who
helps build the like button she now does
comics for a living I know what this was
about software development but this is
phenomenal one of my favorites with this
little guy and he's like oh god the
Dragons gonna eat me then he goes how
did i give to dragging a hug which is
pretty much how I go through life and
check it out just to write a dragon so
my advice to you is to love your dragons
and when I say dragons I mean spheres
because your fears are the biggest clue
for how you can be awesome they're your
opportunities there the places that you
could grow in a way that will change
your life
we tend to use series of the cop out oh
well I'm just I'm just scared of public
speaking I'll never be good at it so
like I'm never going to be somebody who
teach other people nervous I maybe speak
at conferences I'm never going to assist
who I am untrue fears are not in a
reticle part of who we are they can be
changed they can be grown through when I
was in your developer I was terrified to
say I don't know because like most of
your developers I was convinced that
everybody else knew more than me I did
not know enough and I was probably going
to get fired tomorrow fear of saying I
don't know somehow led me to become a
teacher and I had to face that fear
square in the face because the first
time I ever gave a lecture about like
introductory JavaScript i said i don't
know like 14 times because even total
beginners can ask questions that you're
just like where did you come up with
that and the first time I did it I like
self the ground fall out from underneath
me a little bit but I said it anyway
everybody went okay and I went what and
then I learned to say i don't know but
because i'm a developer let's google it
let's figure out together let's find a
way through and suddenly I don't know
stop being scary I stopped being afraid
to not know things cuz we all don't know
things especially in a field is broad
varied and crazy and changing his arse
there's always going to be stuff we
don't know I am because of my career as
a developer I am no longer scared of not
knowing things which is a pretty huge
thing more recently I was scared of two
things I was scared of public speaking
and I was scared of flying and now I
speak at conferences internationally he
had told me a year or two ago that I was
going to do that I'm gonna laugh at you
and then we're out of the room crying
probably the first time I ever gave a
TED talk I did three shots tequila
before hand and the video was still on
YouTube
and I didn't get on stage for their two
years of that because it was so
embarrassing and I was so horrified by
the whole thing and I thought I'm just
not a good speaker I'm just too scary
I'll never be good and then about a year
and a half ago I went to a conference
and I was so inspired by a talk and I
thought man I have something to say I
think I can say without tequila no
Sheila today by the way and so I applied
to a conference and I got in and it was
in Kentucky so I could drive there and I
worked through that first fear a little
bit and then a little more and then I
got into a conference in Norway I
mentioned them from Detroit right also
fear of flying like severe fear of
flying but I thought why am I going to
do at Oslo again and speak to a
Norwegian audience of all things in the
world so thank you in DC I flew
internationally for the first time in 25
years and for the first time ever
without whatever was that my mom gave me
the child to keep me calm and now I get
to fly over the world and all over my
country and I get to speak and I get to
do these incredible conferences and it
is amazing it has changed my life and I
mean meet people and let me grow in ways
that I never would have if I had just
stuck with I am scared of speaking and I
am scared of planes you should just be
on the ground there is no reason to be
on a metal tube hurtling through the air
that whatever miles is just know it's
still there a little bit but I share
those stories because I know the spheres
can be grown through so here's my fear
inventory ask yourself what are you
afraid of what is the underlying fear
because I'm not just afraid to say I
don't know I'm afraid to look stupid
what could I take what steps could I
take to overcome that fear they can be
small steps and then one could you gain
and that last question imagine a little
bit dream a little bit if you work
through this year what actually happened
this might be even bigger than what you
imagined
those are my strategies I always talk
more than I plan to this is the first
time I giving this talk so thank you so
much for being here for the debut of it
can I answer any questions help ok good
ok the question was where do you find a
professional coach a good one which is a
good of a good qualifier my coach was
actually the coach of my boss so there
were a couple benefits to that I could
talk to somebody could work with her and
knew that she was fantastic she knew the
weird flat structure of my company
pretty well already because she had
works with somebody that already worked
there and that was really helpful to me
so ask your colleagues if they know
somebody um otherwise the great white
internet is available to you but if you
can get a recommendation from someone
highly suggest that even like Queen out
and saying hey I'm looking for a coach
you know in this area does anybody know
anybody can be valuable other questions
sure the question was do I get any time
at work to do reading this growth work
and learning that kind of thing I do I'm
very lucky our company has what we call
Friday hack days and hack days are for
you to get better at whatever it is that
you want to get better at for some of us
that is learning a new programming
language for some of its new frameworks
for some of us it's crying over X code
for an extra eight hours a week and for
some of us it's reading and blog posts
and working with coaches and growing in
other ways so we do have that a whole
day is a lot that's been part of our
company since the beginning if it's not
part of your company your that's normal
right that's not a usual thing that we
get but it may be worth seeing if you
can get your company to build in two
hours a week half a day a week something
like that because we go home and we have
lives we have families and we have jobs
and pests cars and house and all the all
these things right so if you can get
that growth building to work that's
incredibly valuable good question yes
yes uh-uh question was you have a flat
company structure who gives you a pay
raise so we actually have four
co-founders of our company and one of
them is the people co-founder and he
meets with everybody at least once a
year but also if you have made a sudden
big stride in your career so I had
gotten a raise as a developer and then I
got moved over to rain our
apprenticeship program where
theoretically I'm producing 10 to 20
developers for the company a year that's
a big career change so I also got
evaluated for a raise at that point so
that's our systems definitely once a
year and then if you have some big
things happen in a depression all right
fantastic I will be up here for a few
minutes afterward but I want to create a
stage for the next speaker so this is me
and that's my dog find me on Twitter
please email me I would love to hear
your questions I'd love to learn about
your career path I would love feedback i
will say thank you for the feedback and
i will smile at you and i'd be happy to
answer any questions that come up after
the talk so thank you so much for your
time Thank You NDC London for having me
