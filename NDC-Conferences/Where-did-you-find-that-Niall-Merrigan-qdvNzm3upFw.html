picture yet good awake there you go
there's a man laughing he's her I didn't
even notice that I thought it was just
there for show this is this is really
what my talk is all about and i will
show you this is gonna be pretty nuts
I'm gonna start if you're if you're the
last person and you get to do the talk
you should stop she just physically
stopped hi I've been holding the stage
for you come on relax okay let's rock
and roll this is where did you find that
the most top-secret talk in the world i
have i'm just going to warn you this is
a level 100 200 talk ie very low
friction perfect time the day if you had
a little bit of coffee some sugar this
will be a lot of fun I do think it's
kind of one of those things that you
will just have to hang on because i have
a hundred and forty two slides try and
keep up right we start quickly my name
is nyle Merrigan i am a managing
consultant with capgemini based in
stavanger in norway if you are confusing
me with an American it's not I'm Irish
but I live up way up north I am an ASP
insider as your advisor am also an MVP
and the last sentence is very important
if you ever meet me inside that Mecca
that is called the Baxter in all right
I'm very very proud of finding that
little bar you can treat me down
Merrigan i am at available a 10 mile at
Merrigan Delano and you should if you
would be so play nice go visited my
company's website to say thanks for
letting me speak around the world and if
you are sadistic you can visit my very
old website now Security's hard kids
it's very very difficult why is security
hard anyone want a willing to make a
chance of this come on anyone security
is hard because you've got to think of
all the problems that can physically our
software affect your applications in
your infrastructure and all I have to do
is find one single mistake nothing else
as soon as I find that little hole I'll
go Boop
I needle just did a twiglet a little bit
and you'll be wondering why there's a
small little hacker like running around
like a gerbil inside in your
applications and your infrastructure now
I like to kind of talk about different
things and one of the things I'm going
to wail on today is IOT the internet of
things combined with big data and
machine learning is the Triad on buzz
word triad of the internet right now
because you know you'll go up and know
someone say or we've got an IOT
connected device that is using the Big
Data machine learning and you just go
that's a really cool ID bingle and they
will go what I said just nothing I swear
but everyone is seeming to be wanting to
juice do internet-connected stuff now
I'm going to tell you a little story
because I like stories and I'm Irish and
we just tell everything true stories
it's much easier it's much simpler when
we have a glass of beer like and in this
case it would be a glass of wine so
picture yourself back at your parents
house you're sitting down with your
mother and she has a big glass of wine
in front of her you're sitting there and
we're just talking about different
things and she very nonchalantly goes
niall what I OT now this 65 year old
woman with glass of wine in front of me
goes iot and I'm like oh like every
single person who has parents that ask
them to tech support you stop and you go
why are they asking about technical
stuff so the only is true answer to this
is you just go why and she just goes
well your father wants to buy a smart TV
I thank god that's simple I can he just
wants to watch Netflix it's no problem
and I said that yeah that's okay and she
goes but seriously not what I OT and I'm
thinking oh god okay take a large glass
of wine it's tricky big gulp out of it
and hang on and she goes okay I said
well I OT is connecting devices to the
Internet she goes such as I said like a
fridge shows a fridge I said yes
connecting your internet that are
connecting your fridge the internet is a
common thing and she goes why for the
love of God would you want to do that
said very simply imagine you open your
fridge it knows exactly what ingredients
you have and it tells you you can make
an omelet
that sounds really good I said yes but
imagine it's even better and i could
tell you tell your my dad where the
butter is instead of even having to ask
you where it is she was all that would
be bloody brilliant and said but it gets
better she goes what I said I imagine
you're there and you type and you say oh
we need to get something you put it on a
list and it'll send a list Evernote and
Evernote will go to dad's phone and dad
will forget to buy it and he goes oh
that's not so fun I said exactly but the
thing is it gets even better she goes
the key way you keep saying even better
is worrying me I said yes there can be a
thing called an internet-connected
toilet and she goes oh god I said yes it
is one of those things she was why on
earth would you have an
internet-connected toilet as just
because reasons and she goes okay and I
said but one of the things the cool
things about the internet connected
devices is they share data now at this
point my mother scrambling to get
something stronger than wine and she and
I said well what happens if you take a
flush and your toilet could talk are
your toilet could talk to your fridge
and tell you exactly what you need and
in my case we'll go son you need more
fiber okay come on it's a five-minute
wind up for a joke I'm just getting
slight golf claps of cub hitters thanks
very much that was good you're worse
than a Norwegian audience there you go
thank you very much good nice clap
thanks sir I'll your get your 10 or
later but we all know if we go to the
bathroom without a phone we're in there
for about five seconds if we go to the
bathroom with it with the phone we
probably there for a little bit longer
catching pokemon and other things but
you can also imagine that an
internet-connected toilet will lead to
these phenomenal headlines hackers take
control of a toilet using bog-standard
computer skills futuristic high-tech
toilet vulnerable to cyber assaults
which could have very messy consequences
the head is just write themselves now
the thing is there was this
advertisement it says what if my toilet
could talk to my doctor and in this case
I thought that is a pretty cool idea but
I kind of going to take a little bit
back what we are going to see things
like this on forums after a while when
you have a very much internet-connected
devices sounds like your fridge needs a
soft
update to use the new API version I just
want to open it and get my eggs but
everyone's on this very much this IOT
craze and fit and like going I want to
connect stuff too I want to connect
different objects to the internet such
as this smart mattress cover right this
was funded to this tune of 1.2 million
dollars for a smart mattress cover and
it will end up with things like this the
mattresses run out of battery I'm sorry
honey we have we can't go to sleep I've
got a plug in the mattress and a little
us beating and then the kind of thing is
I wondered what what this smart mattress
does and it was it's effectively called
ass mattress and it does this it sends
an alert to your mobile phone whenever
someone is using your bed in a
questionable way minds out of the gutter
kids it's when your children are hopping
on your bed I swear I'll there's little
Johnny you having a good what is it what
was okay it is the internet telling you
is just go and shut up and take my money
don't do it now if you are very
interested in finding how to confined
interconnected mattresses and fridges
and toilets there is a way to do this
and we use a particular piece of
software called show done when showdown
is a search engine for the Internet of
Things now one of the things it's very
good at finding is very weirdly open
devices that shouldn't really be
connected such as this brewery where you
can go off and you can log in without
any authentication it's running on port
5900 and for those who a little bit
older in the audience it that is a port
number reserved by V and c pn c stands
for virtual network computing it was a
version of like or DP and remote desktop
before or DP was fully baked into
windows it is free and I was one of the
reasons why it was used it was cross
class and people still use it today but
it has a very cool option of not
allowing or allowing you to install
without a username and password and
people do this they enable these type of
devices so once you've had in fountain
played with your beer on the internet
you decide you want a hamburger so this
is a front end point of sale system for
some place in Spain I think where
someone has paid seven years and
thirty-five cents for whatever they want
like men you see five after you've had
your few beers and you've had your
burger you decide you want to cycle home
but you can't rent a bike so you decide
you want to take a boss instead at this
point you're getting a bit upset and you
can find out the bus is broken and you
end up deciding you want to take a taxi
and this is a Spanish taxi where someone
is in it and they're paying 30 euros you
get out of your taxi you end up in a
boat and in this pose you have a whole
lot of engines and alarms you can play
with and at that point you just go ah
screw it i'm just going to go to get a
hydro massage and it you just go holy
crap somebody can log in from the
internet without any authentication and
play with the pressure now you will get
water we are not supposed to get water
okay this did this this hydro massage is
very aggressive but how do we fix this
we use the internet which I said which
all right this lady we talked to a witch
who caps viruses out of computers with
magic I'm thinking chakra stones or
stuff now this is all a bit jokey but
it's a bit of fun and we can show you
how bad the internet really is but the
problem is there is a ton more connected
devices out there that people can play
with without any authentication such as
this composter where you can log in and
I use the term login very liberally as
in connect to and you can get to the
bunt on/off switch in the top corner
alright it's been running for 22 days
it's got some oxygen and bits and pieces
but this is not life-threatening all
right this is this is a pool control
system now the eagle-eyed viewers in the
audience will notice the two giant
barrels that say acid and chlorine two
things you do not want on your skin or
you do not want some 15 year old pimply
kid with a black hoodie sitting in his
compared room going I think I'll play
with this and see what happens you can
turn it on and off a nice big on/off
button again still you can turn the
alarms on and off if you so wish again
do not need any authentication to log
into it you get more advanced you is
like this one I think this is from
base in Germany I don't know what it
does but it's fairly simple they start
getting bigger like this silo where you
can drop one point seven tons of animal
feed on somebody just because you're
feeling a bit annoyed worse you get this
filtration system i have no idea it's in
French and but it allows you load of on
and off buttons you can do things I
don't really know what it is it just it
just looked funny i found this silo
system I again they starting to kind of
I think they're getting worse they just
the UI kind of you ended up somewhere
I'm very flashy something very good some
are very bad but I don't know
realistically why these are still online
then I found this pump system which is
got it looks like a spear pump or
something that drilling up water doing
filtration out and then we start going
into Bernie things this is a don't know
what it is but it's got a lot of very
impressive things on it's got some
settings got a shutdown button you've
got this system where it's burning other
things it keeps again you can still see
how quickly we're finding these types of
devices this one in Sweden allows you to
has do some regulation our temperature
regulations and then I found this
factory in Sweden now what strikes me
about this Factory is the whole thing
has a simple on/off switch in the bottom
corner so somebody can come along go I
do you know what the wind's blowing the
wrong way that steam or whatever smoke
is coming out of that chimney it isn't
it's annoying me I'll turn it off it's a
good use for the internet I found this
am mujh aggro where you can play with
some chickens and turn things on and off
if you so wish I don't recommend it if
you'd like fried chicken apparently
setting that number 1 to 100 degrees
works really well you found this German
thing I when I found this I just gave up
I didn't know what it was but it just
looks like a slide I think I can big
large conveyor belts with a large alarm
I found a sawmill and I finally found
what i think is the best UX design of a
control system ever this one now I want
to point out a couple of things one
there's a giant msn messenger manual
auto button in the corner all right
there's a bomb back collar which I got
told by mice one of my Spanish residence
guys he said like that's actually means
a water heater and he said he looks at
and he said well besides it looked like
the designer had a spasm when the desire
to design the system it is probably a
home control system for a pool and
whatever this makes me sad this may
actually this picture makes me very
happy because it's james Van Der Beek
crying and that's always makes me happy
because he's part of this thing CSI
cyber which to me is the best invention
on the internet because many people go
is this legit and I'm going no this is
like I I honestly think that when they
have CSI cyber they said how many
buzzwords can we put in a TV show to
annoy tech people all right because if
you've ever watched this with some of
those non-technical dude is that what
you do I make no that's not what I do
I'm respectable I don't do this so I
want to point out something because this
this clip really makes me happy
right did anyone spot the technical and
accuracy in that number one men are more
likely to be red green colorblind that
is not an accessible you I okay number
two static in groups to you I have no
idea but if one of my devs came with
this I'd slap them back to the Stone Age
and say learn the code and honestly if
you're going to hide malware in your
application you won't have a thing
called in fact alright see you sigh
cyber for the win now every so often
when you're doing looking for factories
and other types of power plants you come
across people actually doing real work
and at that point you kind of think well
what are they up to you kind of find
people playing games apparently running
around a something with a hammer counts
as a game anymore I don't know what it
is and people are using Facebook this
poor guy Timothy hatha is going to have
a real bad day very very soon because
he's got a couple of updates including
Java anyway we found this person also
using facebook again as you can see port
5901 in this case is an alternate
approach for VNC they are browsing the
internet I want to point out one thing
very specifically with this picture what
do you see besides the word karma take
away that what do you see excuse me
authentication disabled come a little
bit down this is gonna be really cool
dead air in the middle of talk okay I'll
point this up because we're gonna be
here a while answer I appreciate you
actually helping me out here but I have
got a 100 slice get through you hey what
this is is an internet cafe most likely
one in an airport where someone has you
know those like little things that
they'd say here's if you want to check
your Facebook lights for the last hour
here will charge you ten dollars for a
minute all right this is one of those
because what has happened is it's got a
remote system where someone can log in
using VNC to troubleshoot it okay so
that is why you should not use internet
cafe is or the internet devices at the
airport especially if you see people
like me knocking around ok as will do
this I found this one where the guy was
actually online chatting
and we could have a little bit of fun
apparently based in Birmingham and a
student there there was this Syrian who
was using facebook so I have no idea
what he's planning but I'm fairly sure
you saying hello and I then found this
person using email as you can see what
you can log-in do whatever they want it
has the d-zone daisy digest in the
bottom now what would you do if you
found someone's computer with open VNC
or VNC with an open connection what
would you do would you sit there and
laugh a little bit like these people
random person here to ya la everyone can
connect that's assuming what that is or
actually I'm like yeah read it but
everyone can give it I'm something or
would you be the absolute bastard and
download something more dangerous such
as this ransom 32 so someone has been
having a very bad day here today they
have used a VNC enables they have now
someone has gone on and downloaded a
ransomware program double-click the file
it started encrypting the disk and it
says you have 24 days left to pay one
Bitcoin approximately 350 dollars when
the provider time ends the payment will
increase to ten bitcoins 35 thousand
dollars so this is what the person has
done they said okay I found an open VNC
server I just going to download it from
mine and then just get them to encrypt
all the files the later versions of
crypto where what they are doing is
they're not encrypting the computer
first what they're doing is they're
encrypting all network shares first and
then encrypting the device and the
newest version that has come out is
exceptionally evil what they're doing is
they're injecting child porn onto your
computer and encrypting everything else
and then telling you they have this
under using psychological warfare to get
you to pay for this sister are get to
pay for the removal because you know
what happens someone says well they
found child porn in this computer that
stigma never goes away doesn't matter if
it wasn't you if you didn't do it they
will use that against you so the ethics
involved here are not like you know the
typical oh look some with a la la la la
typing
a computer they are going to try and
make money off your pain at this point
you decide I'm going to move into a
hotel and here we can find different
devices where they have probably been
provided by the same vendor and it's a
very good way if you want to find out
how to do your business around the web
where it's cheapest to do it now it
wouldn't be if I started off with
internet toilets in a toilet it wouldn't
be that type of show if I didn't show
you the least some more and this one is
from Singapore where you can connect and
rate somebody's toilets I like to point
out that the bottom of the screen says
this screen is sanitized regularly
however your network is not I then found
this one in I don't know where it is but
it is the Sunnat ronix international
it's one of those automated toilets
you're the ones you go into it cleans
itself afterwards where this one you can
logon change and open the doors while
someone's having whatever they're doing
and if you want to even clean them and
then I found the upgraded edition which
is the Sweden jumbo too it also has a
very big button call start VNC because
if you just need it now the problem with
internet connected toilets is they will
lead to kind of app application error
message such as this there's none on
user on the toilet potential criminal in
the home yeah I'm fairly sure so you
know what I can see that as an
anti-theft device you know what you're
there you're robbing someone's home and
you say oh I got a bit short take and
sit down and then the alarms go off and
you're like damn s they have an
internet-connected toilet why didn't I
see this right jokes aside let's go dark
this is the point of the talk where I
say tell people if you have kids I'm
sorry I have two kids I this part of the
talks makes me very sad it makes me very
conscientious of what I do as a parent
but the problem is that we are also
internet connect or doing
internet-connected devices towards baby
monitors normally have you any of you
have kids excellent do you have little
baby calls little take the small little
two-way radio it's a little two-way
radio that what instead of your child
deciding they're going to be the
ultimate asshole so if you've got kids
what they will do is they will be there
and they'll be quietly sleeping and then
they will let their breathing go
and every so often then it'll stop and
there's new parents you'll just go I
just broke it and then they'll go if you
don't you stop it and then someone says
you will be good if we are little
two-way radio and so we could hear if
little Johnny's burp or fart is just
that and we're not getting trying to
rush in every five minutes check their
life and then someone says well you know
what web cams are really cheap now let's
put a webcam on this device so you can
see if little johnny is just burping or
farting are actually doing interpretive
dance you know you might catch that
movement now the problem is they are
using standard software and they're
using things like upnp universal plug
and play which on your router allows you
to connect automatically out it will
configure the router to say yes there's
this port needs to be used please let me
out the router goes yes that's fine so
you don't have to doing a homework and
do all the magic routing it does that
for you and then you end up with things
like this this is theo's room theo is in
germany Theo does not know that his
parents have a webcam because he's too
young he doesn't realize what this is he
just thinks his little teddy in the
corner Theo doesn't understand why some
man is breathing down the microphone and
shouting obscenities and sexual noises
at him Theo's parents don't realize that
he is available to predators on the
internet and his address is being
donated around the dark web Theo doesn't
understand why his picture is in my talk
Theo doesn't understand what the hell is
going on and Theo's parents are idiots
for allowing this worse still he is not
the only one there is more cameras
around the web that are available
unfortunately without any authentication
running of a real-time streaming
protocol you have this poor fellow we're
just an empty one but every so often you
catch the kid in bed I'm were still the
these kids are there and they are trying
to get some sleep and they're just being
peaceful and some sick predator is like
breathing down and trying to make them
awake them up and make them cry because
they're gonna get their jollies from it
you see other like the Jamie cam you get
the upside down picture here where a
camera has either been incorrectly
configured or some pieces of malware
have attacked it we found this poor
child sleeping in his parents bed and
then we get things like this a stranger
hacks a video baby monitor and talks to
a child at night video and this is where
we end up with this type of thing the
smallest one was Madeline so you can
secure yourself porthole the tendons put
their two year old Gracie asleep always
keeping the eye on her with this video
monitor our privacy was just invaded
Wednesday pre she was at home playing
with mom when old son
music playing from the baby monitor at
first mom thought it was all a joke but
quickly realized someone had the camera
we started doing you're dead did a
little research and found out the person
who most likely violated his home camera
has done it before video similar packs
on YouTube play that same song and
bragging about breach on Twitter yeah
take me a lot because I mean those
people don't even know about it better
on videos we kind of felt violated like
we did just scared off over PC health
services David spoon artist don't make
it easy for hackers it has to be quite
easy especially when there's a whole
forgot to change the preset factory
username and password that came on the
camera allowing relatively easy access
have been increased in a number of baby
monitors that have been hacked recently
so those are some good all right did you
all catch what the password was blank
right this is where I issue my challenge
to all the devs in the audience and
product managers in the audience if your
customer or your product team says we
want to ship this product without a
option to have a username and password
sit down and say that option must be
must do not have it optional for the
love of God protect the people and the
software and the and the information
that is being given to you and entrusted
to you you have a duty of care to people
so stop being idiots change the security
patterns in your applications and in
your organization to say do not allow an
application to go out without offense
location change it to must and do it
right and that is one of the key points
of this talk because all the stuff I'm
showing you is because someone you know
what we won't allow are we can give them
an option to not have a password
passwords in this day and age are a
standard feature of life people get it
do not allow blank passwords and all
passwords for the sake of convenience
allow protect your users because you'll
see something like this this poor
gentleman who probably doesn't realize
that this camera has been hacked and you
can or has been placed in a certain
position and they're sitting in their
underwear I did find this poor Greek man
and I kind of do it here just to allow a
small bit of humor as we come out of the
dark part of it but this poor gentleman
is like you know it's not something you
probably want to find on an internet
camera Google are tending to patent an
option here where they're going to be
have remote control of devices and allow
you to kind of interact with your child
from remotely and can you imagine if
that didn't have a username and password
and your kid they're going wonder why
teddy is like swearing at them now as we
come out of the dark parts i'm going to
show you how to do something a little
bit different let's go and attack petrol
stations I really should work on a
transition anyway these are gas tanks or
petrol tanks that are underground now I
work in Norway and one of the things we
do a lot of is oil and gas and one of
the biggest problems they use is how do
you solve getting product from the
refineries to places that need them so
you can do it in the most optimal
fashion it's a standard programming
problem you know how do i do the
quickest way around the town without
making repeat stops so someone says you
know will do we will have gas tanks and
fuel tanks where they have internet
connected gauges and you can find these
by looking on showdown as well and you
can see here we have something
equivalent of two and a half thousand
different devices around the us alone
now the thing is it only runs on poor
10001 you have to use telnet to get into
it this particular device is an example
of what you can find this is from a
Norwegian northern Norwegian place can
you read what the text under product
says Jess a one
Jess a one better known also as JP one
is Jet Propulsion fuel or jet fuel now
I'd like to point out that this is
actually a honey pot this is a fake
because it's running a bittorrent
tracker and obviously you wouldn't be
running BitTorrent where you're going to
be downloading are going to be running
your fuels because also the other thing
that points this out is the volumes in
the tanks themselves I don't know how
many of you you have been on airplanes
but generally they don't put about 5000
litres they put a lot more so this is an
example of one from Germany which is
since closed this is showing that it has
12 and a half thousand liters of fuel
and it's forty three percent full so you
can guess that about in the kind of
normal case it would have 26 to 27
thousand liters of fuel in this
particular device all right now if we
look at one that is actually legit we
can find one here in Dublin it's from a
top station in Canberra kits a very
similar to like a calyx or whatever and
you can see here it has five different
tanks there five different with running
like unloaded on three and diesel on too
and also has some manifolds where for
example they have underground storage
the thing is all you have to do is tell
them it into port ten thousand and one
and then you have to run that command I
2100 and the reason I know this is
because the guys who have written the
software have put a very good
documentation online that you can just
go off and download and read so this is
my other thing developers don't document
anything make it hard for hackers
customers are like a god damn anyway
this is an example here it is running on
10001 automated tank age you can also
find for example these type of devices
which is the running on windows XP which
is super secure but it also is like you
know where you have the where it goes
ping cling cling cling and you're trying
to get it to run this is that the thing
is I talked a little bit about having
honey pots as well if you are going to
run a honey pot be careful where you put
us okay i'm highlighting the address of
where this is computer amazon AWS calm
i'm fairly sure my local status station
doesn't have petrol in the cloud okay so
if you are going to run a honey pot make
sure it runs legitimately as in its
in the right place it's running the
right services don't run all one honey
pot on one cloud instance in the cloud
are and you know because people won't
connect to it here is an example of what
is known as a Coriolis well and wellhead
software and this one I found I am
terrified that i actually did find it
this as you can see here has gas stiff
pressure gas ecstatic pressure gas
temperatures and it is probably in use
now I'm hoping this is a training and
simulator rather than an actual live
system because realistically I just
talked to one the guys outside i'm gonna
use his joke that he said and very bit
dark but you can imagine like saying
open up twitter in one side okay open up
VNC in the other press stop and wait
through twitter to kind of light up to
find out where it is you know it's a bit
bit dark but you can imagine that
someone would do this just for the good
for the giggles so again someone has
installed VNC probably for remote
solution or remote systems and allowing
this i'd like to kind of say I didn't
ask this question but how long do you
think it takes to scan the internet I
did this in my talk yesterday but I'm
fairly sure I can do it again how many
long do you think it takes to scan the
internet first for a single service all
fillion are all four billion IP
addresses around the world now not on an
Australian internet connection on a
regular normal internet connection you
know with good speeds 10 minutes yeah
about that 28 28 when you're using a 1
gigabit masscan and 1 gigabit network
connection they have got it down to two
and a half minutes to scan for billion
IP addresses around the world okay
you're doing you're talking about like
to 10 gigabit nics attached to a pipe
the size of Google's but it that's how
quickly it is and the problem is that if
you think about it you have two and a
half minutes when you spin up that naked
vm to secure us before someone is
starting to do things to it two and a
half minutes kids before someone is
going to go poop and that's on the
absolutely stream that assuming you get
them on the runs are on site right let's
go and take the piss out of something
else let's go have a go at MongoDB
now mongodb had a really cool idea they
said you know what security is an
optional extra until about version 14
because they had a point where they were
listening on all IP addresses for any
incoming connections and would accept
them now showdown searches for a lot of
MongoDB instances and what it does is
give you this nice gooey nice UI feeler
for this and this one you can see
there's 32 gigabytes and 13 databases
and it's got hosted sweet event hosted
sweet avensis clarendon clarendon
enterprise center and a couple of other
different things now the problem is
there is no authentication required you
can connect to this database system if
you wish I'm fairly sure that most
people most developers when they thought
about it goes no sequel no query no
worries and you know I couldn't get the
data out so it doesn't matter but I said
okay let's go looking for other things
and let's see what we can find here and
I found this one I want it with 12 m 1
gigabytes it's on dev one sap com so the
developers are spun up data okay now
getting like something at 11.9 gigs of
data inside your MongoDB where would you
probably guess they've got that from
developers start thinking where if you
need 12 gigs of data good man production
sorry it's a very good enough lousy
actions resulting yeah nevermind
production sorry oh yeah you don't know
what's going on in my head it so it's
like a little all i hear is noisy Spoony
sorry dev one supcom so I'm fairly much
they're thinking they probably got
production software sitting inside in
their dev box and that's exposed online
without any single authentication
required okay so there's more there's
like 4.3 70 gigs 158 cakes 380 1.7 gigs
of data lots and lots of data to play
with and there's people certainly like
look at things and going okay what's
that if you find any if any of you are
working here and see your clients names
in here put up your hand sure this
happens every so often deleted because
your didn't password protect your
MongoDB cuz you can someone even though
it may be a bit obscure you think oh no
one knows how to use no sequel they will
probably someone will go well actually I
can do that just delete it because I can
because you
an idiot now I found this 11.1 terabytes
of data reading on amazon I'm fairly
sure it's probably a just analysis or
like you know some sort of scientific
software but you do find something every
so often a bit weird because I went
looking for things with the underscore
prod name in us if you find things like
underscore dev underscore staging or
underscore prod and production software
sitting on an unsecured MongoDB means I
don't have to crack the front end date
you I I just have to go back and go here
tada so this is a French what do they do
they rent cars so you just put in some
kind of information and then you can go
and rent a car probably a loaner from
someone else so you can imagine what
type of data is sitting in that back in
database if you want to play with it now
I'm gonna do a thing here which is home
automation systems this is another thing
that people are playing with and they're
installing a lot of and a lot of people
are kind of trying to rush to market
with not being secure etc and trying to
make their systems they're just trying
to get out to market because you want to
be nest you want to be like that person
has because sorry let's take to you want
to be the name that people recognize so
for example like everyone looks at a
pedometer and they stink Oh Fitbit it
could be a serger not a surgery it could
be like a polar loop it could be a Nike
Fuel but it's it's Fitbit to everyone
else you want to be the Hoover II one
with the googly one of the Xerox of the
different worlds because then your your
market share and your brand is super
strong and people want to buy what
you're selling so here we find all the
tips of automated systems where people
have these kind of things where you can
like play with the buzzers you can play
with their kind of the cameras you can
also play with the kind of temperature
inside the room you can do things like
this in turn if you have three rooms to
control Sarah's and Alexander's and
Dina's and you can also make their life
a living hell by linking all three of
them and then say well well what else
can I do well I can do this and I can
see that they have a control system here
for someone's home where I can see like
the the entry I'm gang in gang so in
German means entry and then you can have
the kitchen and the outsides and just
play with them and if you wanted to open
all the doors in a house so imagine
being the guy found I know where this is
they've got a home automation so
some of this kind of level they're
probably not going to have a cheap house
okay so now I could probably do is how
would you find this house well what you
would do is you go in you'd have a look
at the light switches you start flicking
them on enough and have a guy just like
circling where he's got like basically
the house from the shining going nuts
and say that's the house we need to
break into okay now we could also send
up some music can you imagine just by
extending right of the Valkyries down
someone's at three o'clock in the
morning that would be a probably a
pretty impressive and dangerous thing to
be doing here we have a plex screen and
you know they're kind of watching all
different things I found this a kind of
control system for a TV in a motel and
then I found this geothermal system
which is like one of those things where
the mad pipes they spread out over the
ground and I haven't buried and it just
takes and does a heat exchange then we
have a look for example a house many a
menu from a Swedish House it has two
house do control and you can play with
the warming system you can also play
with lighting etc these are type of
things that could really make a person's
life miserable again available without
any type of authentication I also found
this car system I have no idea what it
does but looks it a bit pretty cool
again these guys are stealing the msn
messenger logo again so i don't know if
it's just a standard template pack
they're using what leads me to the fact
is that with all these different home
automation systems you're eventually
going to get a text like this your smoke
alarm do you want to what you want to
call the fire department or do nothing a
I'm sorry you're not a premium
subscriber you know and then eventually
we will just go reply yes it will charge
you 10 bucks people these these type of
devices even though you kind of have to
ask yourself why do we connect this
device to the Internet did it really
need to be there and why is allowed to
be without any single form of
authentication whatsoever moving to
another type of house doctors and
medical devices strangely enough medical
devices come with Wi-Fi enabled now
funny sad story my brother he was in
need of a kidney and he got a little bit
sick and he had appendicitis and the
problem when you have a need of a kidney
is when you get appendicitis stuff can
go wrong so he ended up in ICU for nine
weeks all right
now I went down from Norway to Ireland's
visited and usually what happens is when
your your big brother comes down to
visit you he turns around goes am i
dying and I would no you're not you're
fine boss being the in the waiting room
and being the security guy fired open my
phone okay and I just do a quick scan of
all the different devices around me and
I found a dragger which is a oxygen pump
unsecured in the ICU so I'm sitting
there is a security guy going right my
first thing is to find the IT department
and secure this so that no one can
access this and accidentally turn my
brother's life support off because that
would be a really big problem for me and
he goes and he's looking me going like
what are you doing I says I'm trying to
save your life and he goes how I says
don't ask questions you don't want me to
explain because this is really screwed
up and he goes okay so after a while we
talk to then they got a fixed and was
like thank God and he goes it was just
an accidental Sumner suppressed Run
button and that's what happened but very
simply a simple mistake could have cost
somebody's life and I was thinking my
brain was tight then thinking why was
this allowed and I don't know if it was
just a bad and old system i don't know i
really didn't care the time he's got
better since got a new kidney we're all
good but weird thing i found this this
is a high-frequency ultrasound now if
you google hi foo hikers high frequency
understand they'll tell you it's for
treating of prostate cancer all right i
am not too sure I'm very sure the
prostate is not located under the ice if
it is but there's been a lot my doctors
been lying a loss or the thing where the
every time I go to the US and they do
the do the ads for different things and
that the guys speeded up the end easy to
tell you it can cause every sort of
illness known to man anyway this was
just this is someone who you can imagine
if someone was using this at full speed
and you decided to you want to increase
the density or a power you could they
could have a real bad day i found this
which was a pharmacy information system
now this is a standard issue one where
it's a it's in france and you can see
all the kind of different things around
the bottom the google ocp point whatever
but what kind of struck me is that you
end up at a UI like this where
you can find out what people are
ordering drugs wise or even order drugs
for yourself now if you're in France and
you kind of say I would like I want to
basically write up a script for myself
from the doctor and just inserted into
the database so when you go up and you
want to collect like you know you're
very heavy drugs that you want to make
meth with you can you just do it because
you know ones that I authentication have
I mean I will have you seen breaking bad
excellent great have you seen Breaking
Bad Europe edition right Breaking Bad
Europe addition mr. white I'm sorry you
have lung cancer because how am I
gonna pay for that because don't worry
mate the government take care of a good
night breaking bad's over you see that I
did that in the US and there was like a
real sucking of air cuz with that
Obamacare I just launched it was like oh
all right anyway so you can just do
other things here but then I found a
drug identification system and I kind of
thought well seriously this is one of
these old systems why is this there why
would someone want to put this type of
device or this type of system online
that I can modify and you can go in and
change the drugs and probably change the
colors i change the pricings if you want
to you can see the the unit price is
fifty eight dollars it's definitely in
the US and lead whatever cost etc and
then you kind of have this which is
basically a prescription filled system
again you can go and look for different
patients and doctors and try to get the
drugs and then as I line them up to
whatever you need it kind of struck try
to be a little bit of like why on earth
are these things online so I'm going to
finish up my little tour of the internet
with some of the random things I have
found that are just batshit crazy weird
I found things like this this is a login
system for probably a printer but you
can see that someone's messing around
with and trying to play with things and
just doing login in 10-15 5 I found this
which is you know they're kind of the
when you go to the like coals or Woolies
in there gonna you want to weigh
something you want to put the button and
it prints out the little receipt for you
that's one of those really odd you got
this I don't know what it is but it's
got 5,000 watts of power and it just
looks awesome this is two-factor
authentication done rice it's an RSA
token with a webcam in front of it
so what uh what the guy is done right is
he's gone oh bugger i got a login just
goes to his IP address it goes there's
enough he goes bloody brilliant ok i
found the sun as our bridge which i
didn't know what this was but I was a
bit terrified to figure out what it does
and finally the most crazy thing I have
ever found ladies and gentlemen what's
this if you know the answer you've seen
this I've told you before please don't
shout out because it'll scare the crap
what everyone I wanna take a look at it
anyone think it is nuclear reactor
that's the general answer there's a
person after figuring out what that
button is it is an online crematorium
now for the darkness in me you'll see
infant button just under defaults which
terrifies me a loss the thing is this is
a medium sized body of 100 101 to 200
pounds within a cardboard container a
male and it's the fourth case of the day
ladies and gentlemen ask yourself why is
this online unavailable now you can see
the day 26 26 2012 thankfully this has
been removed from said internet
connections because I'm fairly sure you
know people going to have a bad day if
you kind of mess around with these
things yeah that is probably the most
crazy thing I've ever found so now i'm
going to show you one of the best
hacking tools in the planet google
google is awesome you don't lie to
google google knows everything about you
even in incognito mode it really does
now when normal people google for stuff
they do things like this recipes for
chicken recipes for kids cool thing
though really odd recipes for chicken
means you're cooking chicken right
recipes for kids does not mean that just
pointing this out i'm doing the kids
thing a little bit too much but anyway I
just I kind of think that you got of
everything there and it's just like you
can imagine someone trying to learn
English I want to cook some chicken and
now I've got KITT bugger what's that
next when I'm googling things i Google
things like this right why does I i I'm
really should have left like why does
Donald and let's see what it kind of
Trump do something odd I know but I do
like this why does donc not wear pants
and white this one someone pointed this
house is why does Donald
have custody of his nephews that is like
the you know the thing that people want
to find house is there at Google auto
Calise I was like oh never thought about
it but anyway why does why does don't
talk wear a towel where he comes out of
the shower it's question the alias stop
his feet getting wet sorry and also so
the kids won't copy him that's the other
kind of other answer I got every so
often I do this I do a Google dork and I
do some like things like this and I go
in url view index HTML you pretty solid
choice talked we talked about the way we
work on fixing but one the cool thing is
if you do in your L it never comes up
with anything nice it always comes up
with someone playing hacky stuff you
know there's like index PHP ID equals
that is a sequel injection start point
you have the main login asp AirWatch
login and admitting that aspx every so
often you do find the ural ftp and then
people download things i recommend you
don't but if you don't if you don't want
a sorry if you do want to see what's
inside it but don't want to get caught
look the next slide because you will
find things like this the data source
for the sequel express the catalog the
user ID the password and then you get
what a sight the person is done with our
mail servers and they've got mail that
human insurance to come and then they've
got the test one rightly come to those
very handy so don't comment out your
coat or see this i'm saying don't
comment your coat it's hackable right I
found Twitter consumer keys and secret
secrets and tokens which means i can
take over the twitter account if I so
wish I also then said well what happens
if I go one step up because if you're
doing open FTP and I've got can access
your web.config file I can probably go
back up one step and download the entire
source source source files and modify
them now facebook has a bug bounty and
what someone did was they found it is
DNS recon and they found all the
different dns is registered to facebook
the founder thing called files at
facebook.com/ and they said that looks a
bit odd and connected to it and it turns
out it was a particular file drop point
for employees and he noticed the
particular you i had a kind of number on
it he went on to the google
exploit database or the guests are the
expo database checked found that that
had a flaw and then found to pop a shell
and got access to the machine when he
got in there he's looking around he
noticed something a really odd process
someone was tailing a log file and
sending that information somewhere so
someone was in there six months before
hands had uploaded a different variation
of the PHP file so that every time you
logged in it just copied those
credentials to a log file and then every
24 hours sent those in that information
to an a different location for six
months someone was a siphoning off
facebook employee credentials very
easily so if you can access this type of
thing you don't have to kind of go up
and delete anything you just make a
slight adjustment to the code and all of
a sudden no one's the wiser you can you
think as I said you can get this from
the google hacking database like files
containing passwords passwords love God
Google is found passive Google finds
everything if all of this is too hard
for you to comprehend in one single or
one like multiple tools in one place use
search diggity it is a single
application integrates showdown google
hacking database all the different
hacking databases for you it's free it's
from Bishop Fox I think it's version 32
at the moment and it is exceptionally
powerful and it all does all different
things like bang bing bing bang malware
searching finally i'm going to show you
one of the coolest ways to annoy people
and get information and use github get
up is where code goes to live or squares
code is created how many people not
using it up here or get 0 well okay how
many people use in TFS 0 0 this one poor
guy he's going sorry sorry i'll make a
joke anyway github is very cool because
you can start looking for different
things that people have lopped loaded to
know that amazon have a hook in github
that every time someone uploads and
amazon key they find it and then they
will disable a key because what happens
is people spin up medium instances to do
bitcoin mining very simple you get a six
thousand dollar bill they get a quarter
of a bitcoin here's what you can do if
you type in smtp gmail com you get
config settings that people have
uploaded and have for example something
in switzerland with my rabbits
798 1 which means i'm fairly sure they
were born in 1987 there's probably
people going how did he do that right
you get the other encryption you get the
kind of smtp gmail.com again with a shop
you'll eventually find things like this
which is the i like doing it reason i
put this in is because it's a spring
security login and registration and
they've left information in the config
file that was just a real odd thing you
kind of if you use password equals
you'll get five and a half million
results you factor down a little bit
more and do config passwords you'll get
two hundred forty eight thousand results
and if you do filename web.config pass
where you get down to 134 so you can
have github dorks and start looking for
specific code patterns that people have
used and then use that to find out where
people are uploading files you'll get
things like this where you get like the
restaurant assistant connection string
with the whole data source using dynamic
dns with the username and password you
need to play in also think about it
people in organizations are uploading
couldn't confidential information and if
you want to analyze your organization
within github you can use a software
called get robbed now from two ways one
is an OS into where I'm going often
trying to find stuff about you but if
you are trying to figure out well what
type of files are we accidentally
uploading and we shouldn't be doing this
this software what it does is it takes
an access token checks all the
organizations you are connected to and
then see and then tells you which files
have potentially got juicy information
that you are making available very cool
tool for doing this very powerful very
handy here's a resources if you want
take a screenshot of this or take a
picture this is all this it's actually
on my website as well and finally
contain and oh sorry you want me to go
back one there you go try it I really
want to put a QR code on there for the
shits and giggles see what you'll do or
the shiggles it's like I told one day so
you know I judge my talks by the number
of times you look at your phone
it's the only time everyone does here's
my contact information lay down any
questions comments scary thoughts yes
square yeah it would for all that V and
see what it says just as getting past
the nap boundary yes because what show
done is doing is it's just connecting to
the IP address and it's using the it's
bein like do you can know you can
program against VNC there's an API for
it what you can do is just taking a
screenshot of that and just returning
that JPEG or PNG back to the system
because there's an API for VNC you can
actually use because VNC is open-source
certain variations of it and what they
have done is they said well okay if I
want to interact with the system here's
how I connect and here's the line of
code you need to to connect using
anonymous and then you just do
screenshot so VNC is listening on port
5900 outside your standard outside the
firewall or the firewalls allowing it in
good question anything else going once
going twice go get some coffee thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
