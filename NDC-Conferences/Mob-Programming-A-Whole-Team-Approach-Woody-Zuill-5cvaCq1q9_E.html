developer and I've been riding
1982 or so when I could first buy a
personal computer before that if you
want to do computer software you had to
work someplace that had a computer or
you were really early adopter a couple
of my brothers built a computer in the
late 70s looks like a table that size of
a table that's a regular table just
covered with wires and it actually
worked really well
they had a teletype machine for both the
input and output it was pretty cool
anyways so just so you know I've been
around doing this for quite a while in
starting about 20 years ago almost I
started writing software for other
people initially I started writing
software for myself so everything I did
was solo and I wrote it for a business
that I had couple businesses where we
needed software and you couldn't buy
high quality software in those days for
for you know these kinds of computers
mine was a CPM machine but apples and
PCs or whatever they had back then most
of software wasn't worth owning you pay
a few hundred bucks for a piece of
software you start using it and it
doesn't do what it's supposed to do I
figured I could do just as poorly as
that myself so what I actually asked my
brother I said do you think I could
learn to program and he said any idiot
can learn to program so he was implying
I think more than just I would be able
to learn I want to start with this
little saying from Peter block the value
of another's experience is to give us
hope not to tell us how or whether to
proceed so I'm not here to tell you how
to do something I'm going to share with
you how we did something so that might
be useful to you it might not be useful
to you but I'm not here to I would hope
that you would go away from here not
going oh woody said this so that's what
we should do but you would say oh here
with some ideas I heard and I'd like to
experiment with I would love for that
but this is important to me because I've
been to a lot of talks over the years
where people told us basically how to do
stuff and later on you find out they've
changed completely to something else and
they're just they're maybe slightly too
confident in the stuff they think work
so this worked for us in a specific
setting and people using all over the
world now will share a little bit about
that in a moment so here's the basics of
what mob programming is it's all the
brilliant minds working on the same
thing at the same time and in the same
space and that's basically what a j'l
software development gives us so that's
what agile software development focused
on the idea let's not separate people by
time which means a phased approach of
doing our work if we get rid of time
let's get them all working and talking
about the things we're all working on
right now so if we're close enough to
each other where we can easily have
those communications that helps mob
programming just take spare programming
a slight step further and says let's
just work at the same computer we're
going to take all these people and be at
the same computer while we're working so
how can we make that happen and how did
it happen for us that's what I'm going
to share for you today well I should say
I really appreciate this conference
these folks here do a stellar job this
is the I was here last year and I'm
really really happy to be here this year
so no matter what I want to make sure
before I get too far into this and I
forget I really I'm very thankful for
them for inviting me and having me come
to NDC London it is a great gathering of
people I love it so when I talk about a
mob programming team and this is all
about really working well together as a
team we're going to have all kinds of
different skills all kinds of different
capabilities working together at the
same time on the same thing it's not
like a homogeneous or whatever group of
people it's all all developers or all
testers or all database experts we're
going to have all the skills we need to
do the work we're trying to do that's
part of what this is about
the way that we work this is what it
looks like from the front you can see
there's six or seven people there it's
whatever you need to get the work done
that you're currently working on
you need all the skills need so you're
not wasting time going and asking other
people that aren't sitting with you
questions you're not spending time
trying to track down answers to things
and this is what it looks like from the
back so I'm going to show you a little
bit of a video in a moment but I really
want to show you this as well it can be
done remotely I had to just slide in
about a year ago because everybody would
ask for what if you're not sitting right
next to each other this actually works
pretty good the last two years I've
worked quite a bit this way this is a
company in Richmond Virginia I don't
work with them but I visited them but
they they work they have their team
members remote and they can work using a
you know web conferencing type set up
there's lots of ways to do it now we
won't get into that today
one other thing I want to share before
we get into the meat of this thing is
this was all originated at Hunter
industries in San Marcos California
Hunter industries is a manufacturer of
very high-quality irrigation products
that are used for landscape irrigation
also lighting products when I went to
work there they had hired me to manage a
team of people and I'll talk about that
in a second but their primary thing is
manufacturing and the reason I really
like to show this slide is there by line
there's built on innovation and we'll
talk about more about that in a moment
this is what it looks like at Hunter
industries right now you can see about
five or six workstations we'll see a
video in a second we'll show more of
this another view of them but now I'm
going to show you a bunch of use of
other people these are some folks in
Alaska France I think the UK perhaps I
haven't be able to track down where that
came from Hungary GTS in London you've
probably heard of London Boston unruly
in London you guys something I was just
talking to some folks here they know of
unruly that is Alex right there some
folks in Sweden so folks in South Africa
they made a video you can find this on
YouTube let's see what else we have here
some other folks in Sweden I'm showing
you that there's all kinds of different
setups but there's a couple of the
purposes as to why I'm showing you this
here's another group in London I believe
here's some folks in South Africa I've
noticed that the people below the
equator face the other direction than
the people
and I'm not sure what's going on but it
has something to do with the different
hemispheres I guess here's the folks in
Prague look at that setup dang some
folks in Florida a bit more relaxed kind
of a work area some folks in Greece I
want to show this one specifically this
is a meltwater in Gothenburg Sweden and
you'll notice these people are sitting
they just put some desks together some
tables together they're sitting
comfortably and across the way they
pulled in a table so they could put a
larger monitor sitting on it this is a
sufficient setup as long as you can see
the monitor and everybody can kind of
read it without squinting Tiff's when
squinting is something we had to learn
to deal with early on in our in our
escapades because it was giving some
people headaches so we figured out how
do we make it where it's just as
comfortable to work as a team as it is
to work as an individual when you're
sitting at your own workstation you
could set things up to suit yourself
but when it's a team you have to figure
that out and I like to show this next
picture say they need some bigger
monitors and I give these guys a lot of
kudos is that the right word respect
because they're trying to work and get
some stuff done and work together but
it's not a comfortable work area I do
like to say you're not really on a team
if you can't smell your teammates but
this may be a little too close here's
some people who did get some large
monitors you know these guys aren't
programming as such but they're this is
a really cool example of what it means
for a team to work together on a single
thing at the same time and those bigger
screens is information everybody has to
stay aware of but they'll have other
things that they're doing all together
at the same time now I want to show you
a couple things stain life of a mob
programming team I want to show you a
video of this I'd only going to show a
couple minutes there's no sound of this
you can find it on YouTube but let's see
what we can do so we put this together
in 2012 because people start asking us
well what does this look like and I
start getting invited to go speak at
conferences
so I said well why don't we just put
this together one of the team members
took yet a little iPad or something that
could take a time-lapse video you'll
notice that we spend the first hour
studying together we never have to do a
stand-up we actually do almost no
meetings as such we're working together
this is showing us we had dual
projectors at that time now we use
monitors a single computer through which
all the work goes you'll see there's
other computers around here but this is
the important thing we've got somebody
we call the driver the driver is a role
that changes at that time every 15
minutes and everyone else is a navigator
the navigators are guiding us on where
we're going and the the drivers just
typing it in so to speak the product
owners come and spend time with us we
always have at that time I worked as a
manager with them I was a coding manager
for a while but I was trying to hand off
all that work to the rest of team so
that's about where I'll stop this one
because I want to show you today same
place now you can find that on YouTube
so you know you can show your family and
spend a lot of time with your friends
looking at videos about mob programming
I think you would enjoy that and I'm
just kidding so here we go
same place slightly different work area
we we took a larger and I no longer work
there I want to make that clear but I do
go back and visit them every month or so
you'll see basically everything's kind
of operating the same but we now have a
bunch more teams there's an our skills
learning session that happens every
morning sometimes people be doing
retrospectives during that time once
they kicked into work you'll see the
teams are basically gathered around
their own work areas we put in it's
pretty much the same video just with a
lot more stuff going on same things that
we're saying here you can have see in a
second this has got a tremendous graphic
that shows you all the teams as security
and enlightening to see the spark
leanness and you'll see that these six
teams now there's eight teams there so
there's six teams we have a continuous
integration continuous deployment or
delivery area each team's responsible
for getting their product deployed and
we have complete control of that the
product owners stay
a or a lot of times stay in our area
they have their own office to work and
they come out and spend time with the
teams I'm gonna go ahead and shut this
down after one more bit because you can
see this on the internet why spend the
time here with it we put in there that
it's happy programmers only because
everybody who could ever come to visit
us
have said something to be effective
everybody seems to really be enjoying
their day so there's other things we can
see in here we're not going to we have
an hour for talk here oh one thing I
will point out you notice we pretty much
all take lunch at the same time we got
to the point where we wanted to optimize
the amount of time we were spend
together as a team so if everybody comes
in at about the same time in the morning
spends about the same time during lunch
and it leaves about the same time every
day we're optimizing the amount of time
we get to spend together and working
together I won't point out any specific
people but just in this picture alone
there are two authors who who are well
known for their specialties who have
written books over the years at least
two that I can see maybe three so that's
kind of fun okay I'm going to go ahead
and shut that down I brought in Twitter
or nothing we don't need to see this but
if we if we go to Twitter and put in mob
programming I surprise myself every day
because I do this at least once a day
and I'll see all kinds of people
commenting on it people who are trying
it people are speaking about it that's
amazing to me let's get back to the
presentation that's just bragging so
okay so to be able to do this requires a
number of things the primary thing is we
need to learn a way to work well
together so I'm going to just share a
little bit now and in a moment I'll tell
you how we came upon this but the basic
thing is we use this idea of the driver
navigator the driver navigator team from
a friend of mine I learned it from a
friend of mine I'm not getting this to
click very well there we go
Llewellyn Falco it's a brilliant
programmer but also very
forward-thinking extreme programming and
agile
mind he just really is focused on how
can we make things better all the time
so this is the thing we've got the
driver and everyone else was considered
the Navigator the drivers main job is to
trust the navigators that he's been
guided in the right direction and just
translate the ideas that we're trying to
get into code into code the navigators
have to navigate the person who's at the
keyboard at the level they're able to
accept so we can actually have a
complete code newbie who has never
written code before and join a team and
they can actually write code because
there's people there who can guide them
while the codes being written the rest
of team is sore peripherally at least
paying attention to what's being written
it's usually a line or two at a time
we were always using test-driven
approach and they're talking about well
what do we do next
so we would give a little bit of an idea
of what's got to get just translating
the code give our ideas about it and
then the teams moving on as a group
that's all thinking about what's coming
down the pipe so as questions come up
there's always somebody there to answer
them we'll cover that a little bit more
in a moment this might seem like it's
not very productive and we'll cover that
in a moment why would we have five
people all at one computer it's not
about optimizing the individuals but
again we'll talk about that in a bit
so here's the thing you know I reached
over there to click and the computers
over here so it really doesn't work for
an idea to go from somebody's head into
the computer it has to go through
someone else's hands so I'll ask you the
audience here what would that entail
what does that mean we have to be good
at communication and communication is
not a one-way thing to be done right we
have to be able to express our ideas our
intent we have to be able to scrutinizes
it a little bit we need to be able to
say things that we can get into code
quickly and easily so we're going to
break it down it'll very small bits as
we go and the person that's hearing
these things is translating to code they
have to be ready to ask questions if
they don't understand what's going on so
this is all part of a protocol of how
can we work together to actually write
code
I'll do this real quickly here because I
kind of think we stumbled upon something
that's a little different way of
thinking about computers so first of all
we have a dumb input device the keyboard
it can't do anything unless a human
activates it by clicking on it why do we
use a keyboard by the way does anybody
know do because we always have good at
least we got an answer because everyone
else is sitting there going well I don't
know how to answer that no better option
so what would be a better option now if
I've sat down to try and invent a better
way to program than using a keyboard so
here's the thing I would never I don't
talk to you like this D RI ve r slash
but that's how we talk to our computer
you really want me to talk more in the
form of ideas than even in sentences or
words so that's part of why a picture's
worth a thousand words as they say so
let's see what we can do what change is
here when we have a driver
we now have any California that's pretty
much what the person's keyboard might
look like when we have a driver we now
have a smart input device so we have the
dumb input device and we have the smart
input device I can talk to the person
who set the keyboard and they can
translate what I'm thinking and saying
into code if you work with a product
person who doesn't code at all and
doesn't watch the code they can start
expressing ideas I think that we need to
drop down there and then go you know
what that drop down really needs to have
some checkboxes in it or whatever and we
can communicate and that person turns it
into code we've risen the level up of
who is a programmer programmers anyone
who has a useful idea for this product
not everybody has to take the keyboard
it's not a requirement that anybody
takes the keyboard we'll talk about that
in just a moment everybody's a navigator
though in other words there's not a lot
of value in having somebody there on the
team if they're not contributing to the
effort that we're doing and that's an
important thing to think about there is
a kind of contribution that is just
merely learning so if you feel that
you're learning something that's kind of
contribution as well it's I see
an equal first-class level contribution
to be learning just as it is to be
directing so the team is discussing
things but we have to have a way this is
our mechanism we use a rotation so the
person at the keyboard isn't stuck there
all day long and this was the way we
worked you might find a different way to
work if you decide to try this for
yourself we use the timer that
represents our timer with the timer
that's actually software we we wrote for
ourselves you can put the list of the
people who are working that day start
the timer and it comes up and it just
says okay if Chase is the first one
Jason please sit at the keyboard and
start working and the rest of the team
will say yeah first thing we need to do
is this whatever it is and they open it
up it could be as simple as this I could
say well working on this customer
Dunning project where if a if a
customer's late on their payments all
the time we have to send them an email
saying you're going to lose your credit
rating if you're not paying on time so
we need to so I would say well we need a
custom be able to get a customer object
and we're going to look at their last
year's worth of invoices looking for
late payments and the person the
keyboard might be able to just start
coding that they know that there's a
customer object that exists they know
that there's going to need to be a query
to get that person's invoices maybe
we're going to need a invoice object and
some way to display this stuff but if
the person of the keyboard isn't that
far along in their abilities to program
especially in this particular language
and/or on this project we might go down
to a lower level all the way down to
saying go to line 32 type in you know
new customer equal a new customer then
lower case customer equals whatever and
or you can capture that so you're going
to get a VAR customer equals new
customer we just navigated to level that
person can accept pretty soon whoever's
at the keyboard
starts becoming a better programmer as
we rotate through the day I've actually
seen people start who had never
programmed before in their life and
after a couple weeks they're kind of
programming at least within the
environment that we have here so it kind
of looks like this somebody sits down
Jason let's say that is and they start
working I want to show you this I'm not
clicking it's a completely animated
thing it took me four hours to do that
so I have to point that out because that
was way too much work to have people
ignore so there we go we just rotate
through and then when we're done we
start over again so you notice that
we're keeping this same order throughout
the day and that just makes it easier
for us to work but you don't have to do
it this way I've seen about five other
ways teams work as long as we use the
basic concept that for an idea to go
from someone's head it has to go through
someone else's hands
we're okay that means if I'm at the
keyboard and I have an idea like oh I
think I know what to do we either stop
the coding for a while and talk or I
give up my place at the keyboard if I
think I can navigate it and let someone
else take the keyboard because we want
to hear it out out loud and we want to
see it on the whiteboard let's just
start diagramming stuff we have a key
thing about working on a team is
visualizing things and that's hard to do
if we don't use visual elements to do
that another important thing about a
team is to have words you can describe
things with so it's as soon as we get an
idea that we think we can make a name
for or word for we're trying to look for
a way to describe that thing in a word
so we can condense down our stuff so
this pretty much is the way it works I'm
going to show you with you real quickly
how we discovered this when I first
started doing these talks people would
ask questions and so I would start right
into the questions down for the next
talk I'd try to answer them and then
during my next talk I'd try to include
in the talk so this chunk this next five
or six slides covers a bunch of
questions people used to ask like did
you set out how did you set out to
invent this and we didn't so that's what
we're going to share here we discovered
this accidentally I'd been hired this is
a representation of me when I was young
and handsome and very capable when I got
hired I I had some ideas about how to go
forward they brought me in to help a
team that wanted to learn to do a lot
better than what they were doing and
they really felt the doing stuff in an
agile manner would be worthwhile
personally I consider agile a good way
to go it's not probably the only way to
go
so I was sort of a maybe a good
candidate for this once I went to work
for them they showed me well actually
before they had some big nasty problems
and some big nasty projects I looked at
I reviewed the code in all these
projects and I knew there was a lot that
people needed to learn but I didn't want
to be the kind of boss who comes and
says I really reviewed your code and I'm
really ashamed for you guys you know I
didn't want to be the kind of boss that
says you're going to need to really come
up in your skill level what I wanted to
do is because what to provide an
environment where they can learn the
things that I was hoping they would
learn they could decide for themselves
how to go forward and someday they would
come to me and say hey we even looked in
some of our code and it's got problems
in it so then I'm not the bad guy I just
want to make it easy for them to get get
better at what they were doing so first
thing I did is I put the big nasty
projects on the back burner because it
was more important for me to learn some
things that we're going to see next then
to get the work done so we kept taking
on work while I was there during this
first chunk of time but we were taking
on stuff that was of the sort that would
allow us to learn quickly instead of
stuff we were already being dragged down
in you know if you've got a situation
where everybody's going home at the end
of every day going we didn't get
anything meaningful done that's probably
not a place to be so I wanted to where
we were getting good stuff done every
day one thing that's important to me is
this let's figure out how to work well
together that doesn't mean anything more
than we need to get along well and help
each other as much as possible I've
worked in a lot of organizations where
that doesn't really happen and I've
noticed when we get that we get a lot
more value out of our time spent on
stuff this is also really important to
me so people doing the work can figure
things out they're often not given the
opportunity to figure out how to do the
work this is about doing the work itself
it's about how are we going to raise
ourselves to do the work one thing
that's really critical to me is that we
learn to practice and study together and
the reason I think the practicing and
studying together is important I really
love this picture
so probably you've all noticed that
somebody related to me makes these
pictures then my wife is a children's
book illustrator and this was actually
for a story she was coming up with and
so whenever I see a picture that kind of
fits what I think it's my slides should
use I asked her if I could use it and if
she does let me use it then I put them
right in my slide pack I love this one
the thing is when we practice together
we're in an environment where we're
helping each other when we're working we
just under the pressure getting work
done when we're playing or going out to
lunch or some together we're in a
different mode which is more just a
social mode but when we're practicing
together we're actually trying to help
each other and I think that that's a
skill that's good to have to be helpful
to each other and we bring that back
into our work once we start learning how
to do that by studying together so we
set aside three hours per week every
Friday for three hours and we would
study together and we did it very
deliberately using a coding Jojo style
in the coding dojo style we would have
one person at the keyboard one person
navigating and everyone else was an
observer but we were rotate so everybody
every four minutes would have a turn
rote navigating or driving and so as we
would rotate through the the observers
have to be ready to navigate in a moment
as soon as they come up they can express
their intent and off we go
whoever's at the keyboard just accepts
whatever's there and works from there
there's like a couple simple rules one
of them is if you don't like what's
already been done but there's some test
in place that proves it works
you can't just delete it you can
refactor to better so this is just a
coding dojo style that I've been using
at coding code camps and conferences
just for fun getting people together
just have some fun and we just used it
as a study mechanism it works pretty
good for that you might try it if you
haven't already but here's the thing we
were getting good at this and this means
the communicating to listening to each
other there was another rule only the
navigator can speak the observers are
not allowed to speak and tell us their
turn the driver can't speak except for
to ask a clarifying question they can't
ask a question like wouldn't it be
better if you you know that's not a good
question the kind of question you say is
wait did you say a customer object you
know let's get Claire
to other things this is important to me
let's get good results from our
retrospective if we're not good at that
we have to figure out how to get good at
that and the way we worked at getting
better was we were trying to weaken
retrospectives we decided to try to do
them once a week then we decided to try
to do them every day so at the end of
every day we'd have a 10 minute
retrospective it's kind of like with me
I I am in a pretty good shape right now
but I can wait a lot more than that way
right now and I've had it where I've
weighed considerably more and I noticed
that if I weigh myself every morning
it's easier for me to keep on tracked
and if I weigh myself weekly or once a
month so I've gotten a habit of weighing
myself every morning and now I go oh I
didn't do so good today and try to do a
little bit better tomorrow it's easier
for me that's how it is with a lot of
things like this I've noticed with
retrospectives it's often of time where
we get together find some things we want
to get make better to put them on a kind
of a list of things we want to make
better and then over the next two weeks
we don't do anything about them so we're
like have a it's a collection of things
we would like to do better but we never
get around to doing better with this ten
minute retrospective we just chewed off
or bit off enough to chew for that next
day it worked pretty well for us so the
last thing is turn up the good so this
time I learned a long time ago from
reading kit decks book extreme
programming explained where in the first
edition somewhere in there he says I
pictured all the practices I was using
that I thought were good and I was
wondering I was picturing them as if
they were the knobs on a control board
like a sound board I was why would it be
like if I just turned them all up how
high could I turn them up I like that so
I just adopt that for myself
we often are looking at what are the
problems on our team how do we fix the
problem and to me what he was saying was
let's look for with authority going good
and make that better maybe that's a
better approach and I found it to work
really well for us so one day we need to
resurrect one of these really nasty
projects it had had a nine-month
deadline now it have a three month
deadline
we didn't put it off so we would feel
more under pressure because you work
better under pressure nobody actually
does I don't think but I knew there were
a lot of problems in the code and I felt
the team had gotten to the point where
they were ready to notice the problems
themselves and I didn't have to point
them out the two people were going to
take on this work had worked on it
previously with some contractors and as
they took on the work they start looking
at and saying oh there's a lot of
problems in here let's get the team
together we want to have the help of
everybody to look at this and decide
maybe we need more people to work on it
who's going to work on this with us so
we got this one of these standard
meetings where we're going to look at
something people going to share some
information we're going to talk about it
analyze that information we're going to
spend some time making some decisions
about whose work on what then we would
assign that to people to work on and
they off would go and work that's like a
typical meeting but once as soon as we
got in the meeting somebody on the team
said I see we have a big long method
there let's go ahead and clean that up
because there was a little thing we
learn along the way when you have code
that's hard to understand just refactor
it for a little while and it'll start
clarifying itself to you so we start
refactoring it that was done
automatically someone on the team just
noticed that the person is a keyboard
noticed it so they put the keyboard off
to someone else
and they stood up and they're using a
coding dojo style now basically someone
else takes the keyboard so I'm going to
say my idea loud and it's going to go
through everybody's gears and it could
get distilled into the fixes so how do
you fix a long method who knows
what do you do fix a long method it's
tracked outside paragraphs in it the if
clauses and whatnot so you strike them
out give them good names and pretty soon
you're composing a method that's not
that hard to do
but I notice two things the team had
learned to recognize that it's one of
the things we were learning and the team
knew how to deal with it so off we went
after 10 minutes we went to the next
thing in the next thing after an hour
and a half
somebody came into the room and they
said something defective you know you
folks have to leave we've reserved the
space so it's the end of the meeting so
this was a I think a foundational thing
for us at that very moment someone on
the team said let's go find an empty
room somewhere
we could have just said we're done the
meetings over let's go back to our
cubicles and may we'll meet again in a
few days to look at this some more we
wanted the good to continue that's
really in real-time
turn up the good no retrospective needed
someone says their intent let's go find
a room right now we went on our
scheduler found a room that was empty
went to it as soon as we got there
another team member said well why don't
we just book rooms for the rest of the
day that's telling us a lot the first
observation was why don't we just keep
working this way today or for the next
few hours the second was well I think
this was pretty good too why don't we
just do this the rest of the day we did
that nobody said no we can't do that at
the end of the day we did our regular
short retrospective and everybody said
why don't we just book rooms for all
tomorrow that was five years ago more
than five years ago now five and a half
years and that we've been working that
way as you saw every day since we just
stopped going from room to room we found
a permanent little closet kind of a
space not much bigger than maybe twice
the size of this stage moved everything
to one side put a table in there project
it up on the wall we were working on
things together it as soon as it started
for us it started becoming clear that
this was something we didn't want to
stop doing so that's why I'm sharing
this with you I don't think I could tell
you that this will work for you is just
something that works for us and we were
in a space that allowed us mentally to
say let's turn up the good so this
little combination of ideas I'm putting
wrong way this little combination of
ideas grew into this concept that I've
been using for about 35 years to
paraphrase this for software I would say
the object isn't to create great
software is to make things in such a way
that great software just happens that
means you put together an environment
where good things will happen where
people can excel at their work and if
you do that good things will happen so I
like to ask this question I'll do this
as an exercise why would we work this
way share with me just imagine why might
this be good
with me a few ideas anybody yes it's a
very fast way to onboard new team
members I don't have enough time to
share all about that right so we looked
at Slyke a double loss something comes
on this team they're instantly become
familiar with the code we have and they
can use their coding skills if that's
what they bring are their testing skills
right away what else the bus factor
so basically we're getting we're getting
a little bit of redundancy that if some
way we would lose somebody from the team
we can keep going what else you have
something back there oh so this is a
good so each thing we work on get
started and done at the same time we're
not trying to coordinate overlapping
work is that sort of what you mean I
like that what else
that's about flow yes ah yeah we're so
we're we're becoming a little bit more I
don't know what the right word is we're
starting to get familiar with the tools
that everybody's using and we're kind of
narrowing down on the ones we think will
work best yes
no no merging of code so that was a fad
left something we noticed right away you
know the rule emerges is merge often you
know because you want to get you want to
get it merged in before somebody else
has made changes with this we've never
had merging problems what else anything
else yes
oh yes so we are we are now bringing
everyone strengths together at the same
time on this thing when I work alone the
very best of me and they're very words
to me gets into every thing I write when
I work with a pair the best of both of
us and almost never the worst of either
of us gets into it and when you work
with a group like this it's the best of
a whole team the whole team of people
got to work on this anyways
anything else what else might be a good
reason that we do this yes because we're
reviewing as we go the BA is there to
say oh wait my ideas devil isn't
actually going to work so well I'd
rather do this and we're doing that
feedback in real time that's a powerful
thing so I'm going to share one more
that I often hear I hope some of you
seen this is a lot of fun it's a fun way
to work so it's a very enjoyable way to
work so here's the thing why would we
work this way all gathered together it's
a trick question
all the things that we've mentioned here
are what we noticed and why we kept
doing this but the reason we would work
this way is because we were able to
decide to work this way I've worked a
lot of pace places we weren't even
allowed to pair program if they saw your
pair programming they for more than a
little bit of time they want to know why
are you wasting time I've even worked at
places where you weren't allowed to do
test-driven development I can't hardly
work without test-driven development
because I don't trust my work so it's a
trick question because all those are
values that we've seen as well and
that's why we were paying attention for
good and we turned up the good so let's
look at a couple more things I think
we're doing ok for time right does
anybody know when we're supposed to be
done so we can go forever I don't know
we're probably right on schedule
and and if I get near the end and I'm
not finished we can just stop anywhere
because you're learning the basics here
and there's a few gotchas that i shared
near the end so this is a question
from very almost the very first talk I
gave how can you work this way and it's
usually asked like this how can you work
this way programmers will argue
endlessly
about just about everything and I heard
that over and over and first of all I
have seen that I've seen those arguments
where somebody goes no no that's six no
it's half a dozen no it's six no it's
happened and a go like that for a half
hour
I've seen people argue whether this is a
story point two or a story point three
for an hour and we would have been done
with the work by it so and they'll get
me started on story points anyway so how
can we work this way so we as a team
start getting on each other's nerves
after a while and as soon as we notice
because we were paying a lot of
attention we said let's get together and
and see what we can do about this the
agile manifesto kind of hints at that
and its first value and that is that
individuals and interactions are what
this all about we need to we have
individuals on our teams and they have
to interact if they can't interact then
we really have a management problem
because how are we going to get these
people to get their work done if they're
not really interacting well with each
other so we knew we could see for
ourselves that we would get on each
other's nerves which meant some of us
were insensitive to what other people
were experiencing because of the things
we were doing to them and stuff like
that and in Reverse maybe some people
are feeling people weren't contributing
enough all kinds of things so we got
together in a little retrospective sort
of we spent about an hour on this and we
asked this question of ourselves how
would you like to be treated by your
team members and then we asked everybody
to just take the post-it notes as many
words as they could one per post-it note
write down how do I want to be treated
and we came up with these three we did
in affinity grouping you know group them
by theme and we came up with these three
words everybody was saying we want to be
treated I want to be treated with
kindness consideration and respect
now there's other words we could have
used we picked these as particularly and
then we looked them up verified that
they were meaningful the way we thought
they were but here's the thing
we clearly didn't know how to do this
how do you learn to do this so we made a
little pact amongst the team for a day
we're going to pretend to treat each
other with kindness consideration and
respect and let's see what that feels
like can we even pretend for a day you
can just about pretend anything for a
day right we did it for a day and we
decided to continue it the next day and
after a few weeks a lot of us started
looking up articles we could read about
how do you learn to do this but we were
already getting better at it and I want
to be this really clear I'm not a very
kind or considerate or respectful person
and I can look back over my career at
times I where I was completely not kind
or considerate or respectful for example
consideration is about considering
somebody else's point of view or
considering someone else's feelings to
be able to consider their point of view
what do you have to do what's that so
you have to be able to emphasize so far
we can do that what do we need to do we
need to understand it to be able to
understand their point of view what do
we need to do we have to listen to be
able to listen what do we have to do
shut up that's exactly right so we got
to it that's the five why's you ever
seen a five why's it only took us four
this is the thing we have to learn to be
quiet that's hard for some of us now I
I'm sort of as they call it ambivert I
guess somewhere in between being an
extrovert and introvert I have some of
the same some qualities from both sides
of that but I noticed that in some
groups I don't say anything and in other
groups I'll be more talkative maybe I
feel I need to fill in the gap or
something I really have to learn when I
felt like talking to not talk that's not
an easy thing to learn and when I do my
workshops on this that's one of the
things we spend some time on how do we
learn to not say something when we feel
we really want to say something that we
think that our
it will solve everything and it doesn't
necessarily ever work this is what we
needed to do and I will say I believe
today I'm a much better person than I
was five years ago I have to working
with a team for three and a half years
once we started working this way I've
just focused on all of these things and
I think I'm a much better person
probably very few people in the world
would agree with you but and with me on
that but that's the way I feel so let's
go on just another step this is a
question that people would often bring
to me when they've been trying mob
programming but didn't get much
direction from anyone else wads they
just saw our videos and started doing it
they would say this that we're getting
tired
it takes us an hour to doing this and
then we're starting to get worn out and
our team had been already working for a
year so this way and we didn't we found
it very relaxed we found it very
sustainable so we started thinking about
that and the cool thing happened we got
out we hired a new guy on the team and
he came in and started working and we
noticed he'd come in the morning and
he's had like four or five of those
energy drinks you know and he'd
sometimes he'd open like two of them and
down them all at once it's like okay
that's not a good sign and everyone that
he'd start dozing off you just start
kind of snoring in place and so one of
us asks you know what's what's going on
we thought maybe he's having you know
trouble at home or something and he said
well you know there's so much here I'm
trying to absorb it's too much I can't
do all this I'm trying to learn
everything we're doing and I feel like
I'm I get home and I have to study and I
still got to go take the kids to their
band practice or whatever and I said I
just can't keep up and everyone on the
teams at the same time
oh that's that's a good point because we
don't try to do that we're here to
contribute our expertise we don't need
to know everything that's going on and
we're not trying to learn everything it
slowly seeps in let's find a way to be
relaxed so you have to pay attention to
yourself am i wearing myself out so we
have to pay attention to that and we
came up with this thing that we got from
a book called essentialism
I've kind of slightly paraphrased it but
what you want to do is pay just enough
attention so you can contribute your
best to the team at just the right time
and in just the right way
rather than trying to contribute all the
time even when it's the stuff there
might be someone else on the team who
can contribute better to matter of fact
a big step forward is to realize that
even the not-so-good ideas from other
team members are often worth trying and
you just complicate things by trying to
argue as to why we shouldn't even try it
why don't we try it maybe it will work
good enough maybe I'll learn something
and it's big we still didn't get us
where we needed to be I can contribute
my idea so there's a lot going on here
let's give up the idea that my ideas
have to be proven that we can just go
ahead and let this thing ride and then
we'll see it worked well for us so
that's the question this leads into this
everybody asks the first two questions
are almost always here is how can this
possibly be productive the other is
what's the right number of team members
that second question I'll cover but I
don't think it's nearly as important as
this one so this is gives you access
something like this how can five people
be productive at one computer and my
first reaction was I don't know we just
noticed it is so it's something like
this we'd put a slide together like this
for some product people our company to
show them the results we were seeing
when we worked as individuals we would
get a certain amount done when we
combine that work at the end of the week
and when we worked as a team we got a
whole lot more done now this isn't a
proof of any kind because those yellow
cards aren't necessarily representing
the same sized things but I want to
point this out the tests are in our
group there aren sitting at the far end
or whatever you call the far end on that
side
he noticed out of this group we just
take taking these cards out of art we
have a bin where we throw the cards when
we're done with him put him up put him
on a table to the picture and he looked
at he said hey did you notice everything
there's from two days that's kind of a
testers mind he's looking for that kind
of stuff two days except for one card 17
18th of April 2013 one of them was like
from the 13th so that kind of clicked
off some in our mind let's go back and
see typical two days of work right now
we looked at several examples and what
was it a year ago typical two days and
that
the difference that we saw that's how we
came up with this that's wasn't proof of
any kind but this was showing us
something so well at first I would say I
don't know how we could be more
productive we just are then I start
realizing there's a flip question and I
would just flip the question over what
makes you think your teams are
productive when you're separating the
people who should be working together
now I thought that was a better question
and I still think it's a better question
but then I like to use this advice well
I don't know if this advice this bit of
info it's in the pursuing of questions
and he uses a term profound questions
that we get value not in the getting of
practical answers so this is about if
you ask the right question it will lead
to a better question and that will lead
to a better question and eventually get
a question that you really need to
answer and usually the answer appears
when you get that because you now gotten
to an enlightened sort of an enlightened
thinking about this one thing whatever
it is so I sat down took a couple days
and said what is a more meaningful
question then how can we be productive
with five people sitting at one computer
and I came up with this as the question
what are the things that destroy
productivity oh let's do that as an
exercise right now can we do this let's
spend two minutes
does anybody know when we're supposed to
be done 6:40 okay let's spend two
minutes and group into groups of two or
three people find somebody nearby and
come up with two or three ways that or
things that happen to us that make it
hard for us to get our work done let's
go ahead and do that I'll set my timer
and please go ahead and start right now
does everybody have a couple things at
least two because we could go on with
this for an hour probably I think we
probably have enough I'm going to ask
for a volunteer who has halfway decent
handwriting to come up and capture these
these things would somebody come forward
to do that please thank you because I
could do it myself but then you won't be
able to read it any better than what I
wrote there so I'm going to just any
group will start here what was one of
the things you came up with things that
destroy productivity things that make it
hard to get our work done which is what
disagreement
so let's capture one from someone else
well pick a pick what you think is a top
one lack of focus what about these 15
here the today that delay in getting
clarification for things I worked on
something for a week with a team it's a
place where I was doing a lot of coding
and we finally got at the end of the
week we said you know we don't really
understand this thing we thought we did
we got the part of the person who wrote
the requirement to come it took us a
couple weeks to get them and once we got
the permission to have them come share
time we should read the read this and
explained to us that's our two minutes
are up and what do you think that person
said I don't know I don't know what I
meant
Wow let's go on what's that doing work
that doesn't need to be done I love that
what about were you on a team which team
are you with solo let's go ahead and
back there yes
I can't quite hear you could you
technical debt let's go on that's a
great ones what else another team
distractions oh yes that's like the
drive by to try sometimes that did you
see the game last night
you know it's like I'm in the middle of
doing work and now it's going to take me
an hour to get back to where it was any
kind of starting we can do it to
ourselves what else any other team so
what did you have interruptions getting
stuck on errors and you know one of the
things I haven't heard it yet here does
anybody got bugs redoing work so one
thing I noticed is that all the work
we're actually trying to do stops when
we have to fix a bug so this is probably
enough just to get started we have
besides these does anybody have
something else what it's no fun
can you imagine what you guys none of
you remember World War one but you've
seen movies can you imagine what it must
have been like to be in trenches in
World War one day after day day after
day nothing good happening the best
thing that ever happens if you find a
extra bug to eat in that same kind of
bug this is sad what else anything that
wasn't up here
so I didn't quite catch that let guess
communication between members my
favorite one is you send somebody an
email they don't get back to you the
next day and say well I was in meetings
all day I'll take a look at this
tomorrow you know that's the lack of
communication anything else that we
don't already have up there some people
like to just work on their own and it's
hard to so what's the how does that
destroy productivity what's that well
they can go rogue now in fact one thing
I like to think about is is silos if you
have a silo of knowledge you often will
find along with it a silo of errors or a
file of dysfunction what else anything
that we didn't cover so let's go forward
we did the exercise somebody brought
that up I'm glad we did this is the same
we came up with a list of about 40
initially and every time I've done this
talk I've gotten more and what we've
gotten right here right now pretty much
fits into one of these buckets somewhere
or another technical debt thrashing is
the distraction if somebody I've often
seen it where a someone high level in
the company will come in and say we're
looking at some stuff we're thinking to
doing next year we're going to take a
member from your team to come look at it
with us who do they usually take the
senior most capable person everyone else
turns to for getting answers and off
they go for two weeks for some meetings
about work we are never going to do and
there they are we destroy the
productivity of the team meetings often
I don't know if anybody said meetings
it's a time you did you have it
so meetings is a weird thing because
they really do seem like they should be
good but it's rare that you meet
somebody that says oh yeah our meetings
are really effective so let's go on this
is the thing we did not set out to solve
these problems what happened for what us
was these problems faded away many of
these problems fades away at least to
some degree so it looks like this they
faded away when we start working as a
team I'm going to share one kind of a
problem and I think we'll be done with
the amount of time that we have because
we're in the red zone now they have this
little thing here that shows me
to be done I talked about question queue
time I'm going to do this rather quickly
and then we'll skip some slides the
question queue time is the amount of
time that we must wait to get an answer
to a question is blocking us if we do a
value stream map it would look like this
where Green is we're working on our code
the little blue line going up and down
we've got a question we need to get an
answer for and the red is the amount of
time we waste if this was a full day of
work we've wasted half our day waiting
for answers so we're gonna do a very
contrived example what if for every hour
we work we get a blocking question that
means this bit of work we can't work on
till we get the answer so if you had no
question queue time that you could get
the answer immediately this is what your
work would look like for the day if it
took you two minutes or ten minutes or
an hour
we've wasting half our day or what if it
took you all day I've worked on projects
where you couldn't get the answers from
the person you needed to talk to except
for on the morning of Monday when we had
our review of the last week and what are
we going to do next we would block the
whole week so how do we typically solve
for this how do we typically solve for
we're blocked on something anybody know
switch work on something else task
switching work on this while you're
waiting for that answer so let's like
that of course because I put these
slides together I've put it together
perfectly so this happens and there our
green is just green all the time and it
feels so wonderful to always have green
but guess what there's also red all the
time we're always blocked the context
switching that's happening is a problem
and we never get them to match up like
this there's a lot of techniques people
use to deal with this but we are dealing
with the symptom the symptom is we're
not busy enough we want to stay busy the
problem actually is we're not getting
our answers to the questions we have
quickly we solved for a symptom by
introducing another problem now the
problem is called inventory we've
introduced inventory into our process an
inventory is a bad thing here's
basically what it is let's not solve a
queueing problem by introducing an
inventory problem inventory is stuff
that we worked on that is not yet
delivering
if we're not delivering value on
something that we will that we've worked
on then that's just simply waste in our
system according to lean concepts so
here's the thing how did we solve for
this remember it's a trick question we
didn't solve for it we just
automatically noticed we weren't waiting
to get answers to questions anymore
because everybody was there this is a
fundamental thing to us this makes real
one piece flow we start on something and
we get it done then we go to the next
thing
stories that used to take two weeks for
individuals working separately to get
done we're now getting done in three or
four hours two or three hours we were
pushing to production two or three times
a day on the projects we were working on
we noticed that we were often getting
blocked by not having answer from a
product owner this particular product
owner noticed one day that something
that you get delivered that he wanted
and he came to ask us what had happened
we said we've been trying to contact you
all day but you didn't respond so I was
in meetings all day and he realized
because I put some slides like this
together he said well if I could have
answered you within two minutes what did
that help say yeah we'd been done by now
and so he vowed to always answer
questions within two minutes so this is
kind of what automatic one-piece flow is
so I'm going to go ahead I think I want
to skip ahead through these slides
because you can see these are the best
ones but you don't get to see them I'm
sorry so I want to talk about the ideal
number of team members and then I think
we're done here's the thing I wanted to
share about the question of you time
first because that's what told us about
the right mix and number for the team
it's not like you get five people and
you need a database person and you need
a tester and you need or whatever we
need to have the right people so we
don't get blocked by questions so that
was the first heuristic that we really
saw was important if we need these five
people to get through this work without
interruption
then let's get that together the next
thing was if you feel you're
contributing or you feel you're learning
that's a good thing to stay on if you
don't feel you're contributing you don't
feel you're learning maybe find
something else to do go work alone
nobody was ever compelled to work with
the team if they didn't feel it was
beneficial they go work alone some
people always work a lot so that's our
basic team here
mystics do we recommend mob programming
and I already told you we don't we're
just sharing our experiences and
inviting you to try it
we do recommend or I recommend that you
get good at getting good results from
retrospectives I think that's a great
place to start
pay attention to what's working and turn
it up just turn it up try that for a
week pretend that something that you do
my wife Illustrated the book wolf Camp
she absolutely wrote it - she's got
three or four others that are coming out
soon I wrote a book on mob programming
it's available from lean pub don't need
to buy it but there it is and that's it
so I think we finished right on time
with a minute left for questions good so
thank you thank you very much I had a
great time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
