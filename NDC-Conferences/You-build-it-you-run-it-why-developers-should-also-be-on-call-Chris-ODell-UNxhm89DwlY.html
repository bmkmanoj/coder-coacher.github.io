got a talk here called you build it you
run it because I'm trying to advocate
for developers to take part of on call
and take more ownership of your code so
it's before we continue though some
ideas since and what I'll be talking
about and what I won't be talking about
I think it's very important that you
understand what I'm gonna be covering
and what not so I see that developers
being on call is an evolution of the
software delivery pipeline it's like the
next stage I'm then gonna cover some
tips about being on call some ways of
handling it if you are the person on
call and and running an on call writer
so kind of like the stuff afterwards so
if you've decided how to go about it
says around its its if you made a
decision how to move on to it and what I
won't be talking about I won't be
talking about site reliability
engineering that's a particular
different topic so if you're here for
sre that's night I'm gonna talk about
not gonna talk about things like chaos
engineering to break stuff I mean that's
a whole other topic as well so this is
not for you feel free to go I don't mind
so this is me I'm a senior technical
consultant at Cantina and I've been
doing software there for like 12 plus
years and I wanna SH and so you can get
an idea I've done about three years of
unofficial uncle you know where you're
in a start-up and pretty much
everybody's uncle and three years where
I actually have page Judy and actual
rotor actual kind of official uncle as a
dev supporting my own applications so I
have done this stuff I'm not just
talking about this is brilliant I
actually lived it hmm sidestep written a
little free O'Reilly book if you guys
want to grab that as a download link her
website is CD with windows.net so just a
little book there and I'm working on the
second one now again this is just the
tip of the iceberg I just want to bring
the concept because I feel like the
concept of devs being on call is quite
different and new to a lot of people
your first time it comes across to them
it's kind of like this they we reject
the idea
Ashley and I understand why I mean it's
horrible stories and things like that
and I'm not going to cover everything
it's just an introduction there's loads
more to talk about so I'll start with
the CD pipeline like I say I think it's
an evolution thereof so cover that
briefly ok in my CD pipelines look very
similar to this you'll start with some
kind of analysis step possibly with QA
with BDD whatever it works you you do
some kind of planning and then you get
into the development TDD cycle possibly
pair programming yeah well you do the
red green refactor steps this is all
familiar yeah nod your heads yes and
you'll commit that's a source control
which will then probably be picked up by
your CI server under the build and unit
testing some more feedback your react to
that feedback and update your codes and
then when that passes you'll do another
layer of testing probably some
acceptance testing and automated testing
maybe even manual whatever and that goes
back to the development cycle more
feedback and eventually you might do a
final review before we gets the point
it's pretty standard CD cycle is there
anything missing on that diagram um yeah
I there's a feedback loop missing right
here so you've got your feedback loop
from every other step and in most
environments you kind of stop here you
just deploy it it's done and in many
places that's not even done by the
person who did the code so that final
feedback loop never reaches the people
who are doing the work there's also
another step that was missing that's
actually running the code in production
and once you've written it it's got to
go out there and be in use and obviously
that's missing a feedback loop too in
many cases you don't know what happens
when your code is out there being used
by custom you already moved on to the
next piece of work and that's usually
due to the fact that there is a wall in
many many places as a war between dev
and ops
I mean I'm Deb's over here
incentive eyes to push code out get more
features done doing what changes oh
you've got the Ops guys been please
don't break anything
leave it alone it's working all right it
stop touching things you know it's keep
it running keep it up keep it stable no
risk and those obviously push against
each other they push against this wall
and you end up losing the feedback loops
that we would love to see off the end
here okay yeah the separation cuts off
those feedback loops the developers are
blind and the ops are unable to
influence so some quotes from Jerry
Parsons Airbnb sre manager of this
excellent document if you haven't read
having a separate operations team
creates a divide and simply doesn't
scale it puts the onus of responsibility
for fixing an issue on the wrong team
metrics they're a good way of kind of
making a hole in the wall effectively
you can you can put some logging some
graphite prefer no graphics metrics and
expose those back that way and you can
kind of make like a way of seeing what's
happening this side a lot of places must
have this in place right now you've got
your live logging your live metrics you
can see that you can get all the
information and that's that's born the
metrics driven development and it's
still though one step removed from
actually seeing what's going on that's
telemetry we call that one telemetry
there's a really awesome talk here by
Jordan sis so I will share all these
slice you can have a look all these
extra things because actually a lot of
this is gonna be other resources because
like I said tip of the iceberg loads
more stuff and this give you loads more
resources to keep and have a look at so
telemetry sending operational and
business data from your applications
health monitoring business metrics
aggregated logging so you don't log onto
the box cuz you probably can't you still
a jobs alright and and that'll give you
enough of a bit
information yeah Sam doin here
aggregate logging get all your logs off
the machines where they're generated and
forward them to a central location query
this is not new this has been out for a
while now most people are on board with
this right you'll go get logging if not
please please grab it so the ways you're
blind again now ELQ is a popular
aggregation tool stuck even alternatives
if you if you want to just get started
are like SAS ones so log entries paper
trail those kind of things just just get
some information off your stuff okay
graphs metrics ways of seeing the other
side of the wall stats tigre fauna again
you can get yourself some hosted
versions you don't need to rely on
needing infrastructure locally yes that
gave rise to metrics driven development
and to be specific that's the use of
real-time metrics to drive rapid precise
and granular suffer into it it
iterations so those are the keywords so
real time means the metrics must be
viewable by developers and ops staff in
close to real time to provide an
immediate view of the effect of software
changes okay so that feedback loop
keeping it short rapid so that it's
rapid combined with rapid development
you can take those real-time metrics and
they provide a powerful force for
iterating your software changes precise
again being able to have make changes to
a metric a development team can focus on
a particular metric for each software
change and granular that the software
that each metric is obviously small
enough for a particular change yeah but
it's all based on a mental model that
you make of your system and the way it
works so you put the metrics in you
think you know you want you put in the
logs you think you know you want you
you've made a decision that this is how
it works in production so that's what
I'm going to log so there's a mental gap
in even that and that wall is still
there you got a really got some awesome
talk echoed 'hail metrics metrics
everywhere where he talks about that
mental gap as well
so I say like I said at the beginning
the developers on call is an evolution
of that see departmental metrics two
metrics different development so that
you remove that gap completely you see
the effect of your application in
production you're the one who deals with
the outcome of your changes you are the
one that actually gets that feedback me
shrink the gap the mental model that
you've put up there after a point
software and performance bugs become
more common than low level
infrastructure ones when you've gotten
through your initial stages of
developing something you're no longer if
you figured out what surgeon of stuff
you want to run what dependencies you
need how big a box what size like
networking stuff you want even in the
cloud as well it's even more important
that after a while the stuff that ops
insists admins people generally more
experts in it's not normally where a lot
of the problems are after you've
stabilized that kind of stuffs you in
the apps and that's where you end up
with a bottleneck if you've got a great
big kind of you you need to balance that
out of it which is why I believe you
need to kind of bring some more of that
software dev skills over Blake's revenue
from the Netflix essary manager when
things are broken we want people with
the best context trying to fix those
things again this is related to the fact
that the people on that side of the wall
getting the alerts getting the issues
getting the logs and stuff don't know
what they are what they were related for
what they've created for so they they'll
they'll be scrambling around trying to
do their best without the context of the
the stuff that was created so to shorten
that feedback to spend that time to
fixing it have the people who have
invented it who created it
it's what I'm going to talk about
difference aspect of this is I think
it's related to ownership I believe that
it's very important that we own our
products from the entire lifetime of it
an entire lifetime of your product is
from the moment you you start coding it
to the moment you delete it and I see
that as a prerequisite of the autonomy
mastery purpose paradigm you know if you
want to have some kind of ownership want
to feel like what you're creating is is
doing something if you want to feel like
you can yep
it starts with ownership mm-hmm so if
you own it it means that you have
greater freedom of choice of what you
develop because you're the one
responsible for everything what the hell
is that slide for yeah but then with
great power comes great responsibility
right so if you own everything you are
responsible for everything you are the
person I'm call for your app you can
choose what you're doing no Jess
whatever you know you didn't see chopped
or Nick or - yes I'm the person on call
I can choose that but be careful don't
jump straight into using the latest cool
tool I mean I feel like now that you've
got this ownership of your application
from from from creation to deletion but
you need to become experts in supporting
that existing tool before you get and
get a little bit carried away with that
freedom that you can now do what you
like with that by you know become
experts on supporting it as it is right
now so become discover what features
make supporting applications easier or
tougher than they need to be you can
learn about what metrics and monitoring
information you need before you start
changing everything before to track down
issues or what makes it easier or harder
you can use that information to make a
list of requirements and expectations
and any new technology choices and you
can ask yourself if you really trust
this news
we're gonna do or whatever you wanna
change your application to or whatever
develop your doing right now whether
this is going to wake you or your
teammates up in the middle of the night
so that you don't have any kind of
unknown issues I mean what I'm trying to
say in this section is that if you've
decided to take on ownership of your app
it comes with that responsibility of
being aware of any given impact of your
choices I mean a lot of people like um
have they feel like they're being
stopped like prevented from making any
big changes you know it you want that
latest thing you want the latest tool
you like you've read about Donna core
two and it's gonna be amazing it's in
green we've got a run on Linux we're
gonna make up cloud like stuff a lot
faster we're gonna save money but you
don't even know how to support it is
right now right in many places so before
you make any leaps just kind of
understand your current app support your
current at first so yeah I say that
operating and production is an often
neglected use case of a product when you
write your use cases when you develop a
products or whatever you think of your
customers or your consumers you
generally don't think of the person
maintaining it you generally don't think
of the person who gets the cool alerts
you're the person that has to restart it
in the morning or whatever it is that
you've got and I think we need to raise
the developer or the supporter or the
operators person's profile as a customer
over at it's a it's a it's a very valid
use case that we forget until it's Max's
in the face and everything's down at
four in the morning or whatever
again back to ownership if you are
uncool for your own product it's more
about risk management than control so
there's a lot of I've seen one people
who end up having this full ownership
they start thinking great I can I can
change it I can now own it I can do
whatever I like
I've been prevented from doing but you
need to you end up asking yourself is
this really worth doing yeah what is the
risk of me doing this you have the
balance innovation with stability and
there's not a license to be reckless you
start feeling you start feeling that
push back but the ops team were telling
you from the beginning you start feeling
why it's like that and use that
understanding a bit about each other
you know why it's a fantastic change in
the way you work so some tips about
being on call hopefully I've given you
an idea by this point of why I think is
a good idea to be part of the on call
support of your application so I want to
talk a bit about like what it what to do
to make that easier so it to be part of
that so I say that uncool engineers are
like the first aiders for software
engineering now most people have done
some first-aid training right if you've
done all that you know what first-aid is
it where they where they turn up and
paramedics they arrive and they tried to
do whatever they can to get like the the
person into a stable place they don't
actually perform the the heart surgery
any they just get them just working
again and leave the rest to the to other
people or to the morning water where
they've got more time to think about it
yeah you've probably all been taught the
ABCs you know for software for first-aid
you see check that the Airways are clear
that their breathing circulation is
running pretty standard kind of
first-aid stuff and I wondered if I
could make like an equivalent for being
on call so I give a stop talk of the
ABCs of being on call right Steve for a
for assess where you kind of triage the
incoming alerts be for blast radius
you know what applications are failing
how what is it affecting and see for
compensate which is applying the
mitigating actions this is my first aid
for uncle
probably needs a bit more work but I
something so what are some compensating
actions you're probably asking okay so
these would be things like turning off
feature flags applying some kind of
graceful degradation
maybe redeploying a known good version
turn on some kind of load shedding there
are loads and loads and loads of ways of
you can deal with compensating a failing
system and this amazing talk but in a
Sombra architectural patterns of
resilient distributed systems is
brilliant
she speakers very fast but it's very
much worth watching she talked about
papers and ways of putting in things
like block block bulkheads and and all
the effects of this is you're probably
thinking like I don't have these things
in my app right now and that's true you
don't you've never considered them
that's that use case that that missing
feedback but you never fed back into
your owner before now so you have to
balance again with the ownership of your
app you have to balance that the
creating these compensating actions
inside with your feature develop and
that kind of thing are these things
these terms familiar to everyone oh give
a like graceful degradation what you
fall back to something that mimics what
it does right now but without the full
functionality that kind of thing
brilliant but like the paramedic you
don't do the heart surgery on the side
of the road you don't try to do the
hotfix at 4:00 in the morning or where
everyone else is trying to you get get
it all running again you you that is not
the time to investigate and create the
long term fix that's very important
thing to remember and I realize it's in
the moment it's really hard to remember
that but it's very key that in that
point where you're rushing and there are
lots of information going on that you
don't investigate the root cause right
then you do follow it the next day or
the next reasonable time once you've got
it working on when you've got breathing
space when you know the patient is is ok
for the night
so you hold blameless post-mortems as
soon after the event as possible and by
blameless what we're trying to do is
find reasons for things that happen
without pointing fingers I mean
everyone's probably heard about the
Hawaii bomb notification that happened
yeah so to give you a bit of information
if you haven't it was on the news a
couple of days ago they have an alert
system over there which would send a
message to everyone's phone saying
basically we were about to be bombed
you're gonna die I don't know why but
yeah it tells everyone and they can I
don't know I don't know but it sounds
out that it was sent by mistake and what
they've learned since is that the system
had a drop-down which said test and real
you know basically the guy just miss
clicked a drop down again so I were in
that one a blameless postmortem there
would be like I wouldn't particularly
blame the person who miss clicked but
whoever developed a new eye that put the
real button next however how it got so
far that you ended up with a UI or these
two buttons next to each other I mean
that that's like you know there's a lot
of stages that particular UI went
through before the person clicked it
there are a lot of things that could be
changed about the process to prevent
that from happening again
again the mitigating fixes the UI
changes required go to the top of the
work stream and what I suggest is
knowledge sharing you've learned
something very important right then
after an issue and after an outage after
something like that and don't keep it to
yourselves don't give it to your own
team do some kind of show and tell to
everyone outside of the team there was
one issue in a company I worked in where
they did a show and tell about something
and they discovered that a Singh didn't
work quite the way they thought it
worked and that was it meant that
everyone else had to realize that they
also had the same problem made changes
in their apps to prevent it happening to
them too so John Osbourne in the web
operations book says mean time to
recovery is more important than mean
time between failure what this means
is that recovery getting everything
working again is the thing you need to
focus on rather than keeping everything
from falling over if you have to choose
I mean we generally have to choose we
only got so many hours in a day so focus
on being able to return to a good state
over ensuring you never go down so I'm
seeing a few knots there and I'm and
that feels a little counterintuitive
initially but then when you think about
it a system a distribute system is
complex there are multiple and varied
reasons for why our system can go down
and almost all of them are nothing in
your control so being able to return it
to a working state is the thing that
needs to focus on and that's always
mitigating actions those graceful
degradation --zz the the feature
flagging the renown redeploys there as
where they come in focusing on
developing that is where you end up
needing to put your time yes data loss
unfortunately is the the one of most
types of F's that are a little more
difficult we hard to deal with but yeah
so read the web operations book and the
blog post as well so those two the
ownership again ownership of run time
success belongs to the team it's it's
because you own everything everything is
but kind of your the success is your own
there is no maintenance team in this
ideal world there is no you you are the
person's you are the guys that need to
ensure that the this thing runs properly
in in production and production failures
go back to you in order to fix but
there's a whole range of skills up
skills that kind of stuff that are still
so necessary I am not advocating for no
ups absolutely not I'm advocating that
we knowledge share and share some of
this ownership and this is where I
believe it's very important that you
would collaborate with them they mean
they're specialists in their area we're
specialists in our area I'm most of them
do devs again and that we should we
should work together understand how
things work in production if you've
never operate
in production before I think it's very
important that you shadow you see how it
is right now and improved generally your
knowledge overall about how highly
available systems so you can you can
feed all this back into your development
this is that thing where you learn about
things from inner sombras talk for
existence for example about how to put
in these compensating actions what makes
good logging what makes good metrics
what kind of stuff can you do to make it
easier to operate your apps oh yes some
post mortems I will add a Hawaii one in
when we have it but for now here's some
post mortem things that happened before
so in January 27 2017 does anyone
remember when get lab deleted their
production database
well they quite nicely and kindly put in
their full post-mortem on the net do
read it if you haven't it's it's so
honest and there's a lot we can learn
from it I mean I don't think people
share their failures as much as they
should so do take this one down Darien
they basically go through the chat logs
I mean they are literally showing
everything the chat logs from their
slack channel when it went down like
what was touch what wasn't touching and
how they are preventing this from
happening again I mean I think what it
was they had database names that were
different by like two words or something
I mean it was that ridiculous they're
never gonna have that happen again and
obviously the one when s3 went down like
we lost history I mean we're supposed to
get like 99.999 what up and we lost it
like a day they also wrote a full
post-mortem
about what happened there have a read on
that one as well so again there are
mitigating actions I think is they they
run the shell command on the wrong box
and the targeted the wrong service isn't
and it shouldn't have been so simple to
delete production so they're mitigating
actions I believe were to have separate
credentials that kind of thing the key
part is to never ever fail the same way
twice if you can I don't think either
get lab Amazon are going to fail that
way again they're not going to delete
their databases again they've learned
something
from this piece of this failure so
that's where it gets a little bit
tougher we have to prioritize the the
fixes of your instance over any backlog
work and and sometimes you end up with
that argument about why I should
prioritize over this feature work
whatever but again it's so you don't
feel the same way twice that's the
argument you have to have with anyone
saying to you you know feature work is
more important so you need to ensure
that all of your lessons have been
learned and that you've probably got
some testing on there to the show that
it doesn't go away as well so by now
you're probably if you're I feel if
you're wrong if you're supporting your
own stuff you've written in loads of
lasers like mitigating compensating
things you've got logs you've got
everything else you need to you're gonna
be moving faster
I reckon by now you're we're moving way
way faster so instead now you need to
build in some safety precautions you
need to build in some kind of providing
a sense of safety and allow for failure
and support for improvement and create a
culture where uncool is kind of normal
respected and supported one place I
worked in we even had the CTO on call
but he was like fourth line up but it's
that kind of thing where the whole
company is aware that it's not it's not
second second second class thing to be
on call it's it's it's where you've got
a kind of whole structure and process
that if anything bad happens your phone
beeps you've got all these colleagues
that are prepared to jump in and work on
it with you because you've agreed this
safety net effectively to deal with any
issues that happens yes do not expect
engineers this is like how you can do it
wrong by like expecting engineers to sit
and watch logs and I've seen this happen
I have seen some like at one place I
worked in where they got to a point
where they were like no on call means
that you you sit there and you watch the
logs
that and if you want it to be treated as
a respected part of your job you need to
supply like the tooling that goes with
this so something like pager Judy or ops
Jeannie I've seen at one place where
they had a spreadsheet of telephone
numbers and they would just go from the
top down until someone answered this
right is actually a stereogram so as
afridi magic I picture so I won't leave
it up for very long I'll give you the
slide so you can try and figure out
later but I can come and give you the
answer later if you want point of that
one is signal-to-noise so your focus now
changes to ensuring that the alerts are
useful actionable and they're worth
waking someone up for and I'm stealing
most of this information really almost
world like I said right now I am taking
all of that stuff there this is a well
known way of handling on call and
support and I am learning from them too
so if an alert happens it needs to be
something that's worth waking someone up
for and tells you what exactly is going
on and possibly even includes what to do
to remediate it all in one kind of BAM
was it the fire brigade have to respond
to every call-out so we should to
effectively treat each alert is almost
like a fire alarm right I mean otherwise
and otherwise you'll start ignoring
alerts you'll start getting alert
fatigue that kind of thing don't
actively combat the alert fatigue so you
need to regularly review that we all are
still useful I a colleague is working
somewhere else now where she's taken on
an application from another team and
apparently they have so many of us I'd
like turned warning level on that no one
looks at it anymore and I point if
anything really happens you won't even
see it it'll be in this swarm of
information so some tips now aren't how
to run an on-call writer don't know what
this actually is I mean it's from the
past
it is an actual old-school old worldly
time clock so you used to have to kind
of take a piece of card slot it in the
box and that was like your how you would
say that you'd started work and finished
work so there's an actual rotor system I
have written here this is where the
stalks get even more a bit listicle I'm
afraid there's an amazing blog post here
about running an encore where do you see
it's from 2010 this is where we are
learning just now it's kind of like as
dad's about being on call but this is
from an ops guy who had loads of tips
for other ops guys on how to how to run
on-call rotas so we just take all that
knowledge and learn from them so yeah no
more than one week on time at a time now
I've heard of hero people that are on
call for months on end that's not
healthy for anybody
I suggest change overs he suggests
change overs on Tuesdays which seems to
be it weird but then you remember we
have bank holidays in the UK try
changing over when your based on the
holiday and have an agreed on boiling
process for engineers for new ones so
some kind of ability to shadow on call
when you when you first start doing if
someone new comes in let them know that
there'll be meeting this is the thing if
someone new comes in you will have told
them the on call is part of the job ok
so there should not be any surprises but
that they are shadowing there's a
process you've got where they spend like
the first few weeks not actually the
first one to respond but they are they
get the same error that same alerts as
the other person and you both deal with
it together until they're ready to to
move on and deal with whatever it is on
their own and escalation support as I
mentioned before to support that person
but when they do get the first real
issue they're what they've got help
agree reasonable SLA for a glut
knowledge Minh there can be a
misunderstanding a misunderstanding of
where or an assumptions made on how
quickly someone needs to come back to
you when alerts happened there was you
know so do they have to acknowledge it
within 5 minutes 30 seconds is this 20
min is okay it really depends on your
application some some things they've got
more time that it doesn't matter if
an issue than others so but it's the
lack of agreement that can cause
problems so if you know so have whatever
it is agree what it is that works for
you and go from there
what are over in here yes that was it
people aren't supposed to be chained to
their desks they're not supposed to be
chained to their houses when they're
wrong core it's uncool not shift work
that's the key thing if it's shift what
you need 24/7 then that's not uncool
that is there's a different job
completely
me sre awesome weather and have the
escalation policy that I mentioned to
support it as well oh yes yes build into
the escalation policy the ability for
people to jump if they don't respond
that you've got the backup as well and
agree who's responsible for what where
the lines are drawn so you're you own
the app right but you still have stuff
that the app runs on so where's that
line I mean it'll be different for
different things if you're in the cloud
it's probably all the way down to the
sort of cloud formations stack or
whatever but if you're in a hosted
system it's probably only as far as IAS
or whatever anything below that is
probably someone who's probably ops I
mean wherever that line is agree it so
again it's the miscommunication that you
want to avoid that when saying happens
you know who should be picking up or
helping with a particular thing and that
again prevents future issues here's the
bits where most people don't want to do
on call it is hard on a person and
burnout is a big thing in on call
because again you don't have a if he's
managed wrong if people do not if they
tried to do with a hero on call or
whatever you can end up getting rather
exhausted very very quickly John Willis
co-author the DevOps handbook has a
whole range of posts on how burnout is
killing us he is an ops guy so he's been
talking about this for a few years now
to the ops community but I want to bring
it here too
our deaf community he has this post
where he talks about a friend he was
doing a lot of uncool and only found out
about his burnouts and after a suicide
so very much Froy so he's on a crusade
to ensure that our industry starts
taking this seriously
so yeah be mindful of the cognitive
weight of uncle you actually when you
know that your phone could go off for
any minute that you could potentially be
called in to deal with something
sleeping is not so easy going you can't
you can't go out get drunk because you
know if you're drunk you can't respond
you can't just suddenly book a weekend
away or whatever you can't kind of you
have to have this thing in the back you
mind all the time that you are
potentially gonna get called away for
something so be aware that this does
drain on people so try to ensure that
your team that owns your app and his own
call is large enough to allow for things
like rest sickness and holidays probably
about and enough that been for about six
six people six to eight people is what
is recommended by the ops team so that
you're no longer so you're on call no
more than once every six weeks
no sooner and again if someone takes it
to week holiday though again that brings
you down to four weeks or they get ill
or whatever and allow don't try to
control it as well to to toughly allow
people to swap allow people to change
the shift say on Friday I got to take my
kid out to football class or whatever so
that you can you can swap like Fridays
with someone else and there is a
tendency to go right we need to ensure
that you're on your own to allow freedom
and ownership of people's on calls and
we need to be able to give them the
ability to improve their own call
process to improve their experience of
being on call this is where that kind of
that that that the problem with getting
your stuff prioritized could come in
again you need to say if there is a
flapping alert or you constantly get
something like every Theory every
Tuesday
as this letter always happens there must
be freedom there must be power within
the system for you to be able to fix
that and prioritize these things for
your own health these are the ways like
I say to prevent the burnout is that
people have the power to to stop these
things that alert that annoyed them and
and cause them to be drained money the
next question that ways comes up is how
do we compensate people for for being on
call and they should be compensated no
one should be expected to be working
unsociable hours for nothing
now obviously money is it's a little bit
of a difficult subject because I have
heard of people that want to take extra
on call because they're saving up for a
holiday or whatever I mean it's you know
they want the extra money they want to
be able to pay things off they're
looking forward to it they get used to
it and another way is to use time and
loo time off problem with time morphin
time and Louise can you can you take it
and it's it's it's it only compensates a
little bit because if you say get told
you can have Friday off because you were
on call on Thursday what use is that if
you're given half a day's notice and
your family will you know work or
whatever it's Friday off is not a very
great way to compensate you for losing
your Thursday so your money only goes so
far
time is not a great way to compensate it
it works a little bit and even so
regardless of all these things you are
still relying on people's goodwill
because in our industry you can just
find another job so you've got to be
very mindful that whatever compensation
we do only goes so far and I don't have
a good answer for it which is why this
carrot is so sad you need to figure out
a way that balances the the requirements
you have on people with the things that
you need for your business and how much
conversation they need you have to have
conversations and review it regularly I
don't have a good answer sad carrots add
carrot in my it's looking to me like
devs being part of the uncle being part
of the support is fast becoming an
industry standard I mean all these
companies have some sort of devs on call
right now I've worked at just eat and
they have
proper full-on raita where you are
within your first month you're on call
for your app and you know they've got PD
duty and you switch between your team
and you are responsible for everything
from the cloud formation up because
they're in the cloud I have friends that
working on Skyscanner and they are just
doing the same thing and all of these
people have got articles about how they
do it too so I think that now's the time
we need to start taking pride and the
stuff we're developing take pride in the
things that you're creating
but without destroying your team's
there's a balancing act so you need to
own your apps do it with the knowledge
that on callin and being supportive is
very difficult so if you're going to
build this thing I think you should run
this thing and that's the end of my talk
really thank you now I have
unfortunately finished like how much
surely I do apologize for finishing
really really early but I'm happy to
take questions and they usually are a
lot of questions so please feel free to
ask a few things oh by the way juice
anyone want to have a look at the year
where is it yeah whilst we ask questions
I didn't even know you could do
text-based
magic eyes this is amazing well someone
tries to figure out is there any
questions I see you
um there are links or laser place oh I'm
sorry I thought you I don't know that's
the photos I have these online as well
and I will send a link counts if you
want you can give me a match after so
yeah the question was basically just
this if there was a slight links at the
end could it be repeated please but
there was not so much spray I have this
on slide deck and I've listed all the
links there because as I said at the
beginning this is more of a here's more
info please go read it or there are some
excellent talks out there that dive into
each aspect far more than I have I've
tried to put it all together into that
you can action and start with and
hopefully convince you that it's worth
getting those extra feedback loops and
removing the kind of mental model that
you think it's working out so you kind
of improve and own your own apps there
any other questions or have I bored
everyone to death oh great this is easy
you're all on cool one on your own apps
yeah yeah what's stopping you how about
that what is stuffing you sorry you do
need everyone to agree yeah to think no
you can't say I've wanted to extend you
end up in that burnout situation where
they're the hero person who's on call
I agree with you okay so that's where so
this is where that carrot is sad again
that if people are using on cool and
seeing it's no incentive because they're
getting money every time they're called
out and again the other carrot is quite
quite sad so that balance of reward is
an ownership is kind of Miss balance
there and I see there's probably a way
you'd have to re-engineer that reward
scheme to set to bring it back up to
balance it out yes so one of the things
that as a Microsoft studio we are trying
to build a game that millions of people
will play right and and in the in the
best scenario we will have millions of
people playing and our services which
we're running all the time and it'll all
be perfect but there must be a point
where having the devs being on call
can't work anymore when you're when
you're running the big services that
you've got millions of players and you
have an expectation for brand new
features and and and the game caster
continue moving forward while also
maintaining stability there must be a
point where you have to be able to give
that work over to not necessarily the
development developers who've built the
systems but developers who understand
how to maintain that system so how do
you like is that a thing that you've
come across is there a point where it
fails and if if there is a point where
it has to transition how does that how
do you get around that that's where I
believe sre came from so that's where
Google have kind of developed that that
role that's a kind of a crossover but
with a difference so there are engineers
that are doing the support but it's
definitely and completely for apps that
have reached that stability point where
they're no longer in a kind of
experimental development phase they're
in a this this app is now just chugging
along and we've written we've we've
constrained it we know exactly what is
its domain what issues it can have and
then they I think they have this massive
process that enables you to
promote an app to SR restage it has to
go through a ed load of checks a
shedload of requirements before they'll
take it on so it has to be very stable
so for your your case that's perfect I
mean we've you've reached a point where
the app is ready to be passed over to
some kind of sre environment so I'd look
into that google book for that yeah
which is free by the way I don't know if
you knew that so two things first of all
we imagine if these were your logs yes
on the subject of Bernal yeah have you
heard anything about using heart rate
variability as a measure of potential
for Bernal no I do think they did see
something in passing that there was a
company doing that they were tracking
their engineers when they were on cool
in that way you want to tell me how it
is aren't you I'm going to do something
that I use for a measure of stress in
the body okay either from physical
endurance or from just stress through if
we work so it can be very useful way of
monitoring if you think he might be okay
Michael so that is if your company is at
a point where they know that there's a
potential bought or for a self self
measurement there's a wait I'm thinking
more individual basis but yeah no I
haven't but it sounds like a good idea I
think you know whether you get good
sleep or whether you you hurry because
it's great being aware of whether you're
beginning to have the early symptoms of
burnout yeah
very good point is there anything any
other questions
this is like the quietest I've had from
people like usually people like no this
doesn't work so there's a question right
in the back
hi I have a question about how you can
advertise such change of thinking to the
developers how you can promote
how you can make them make this step
yeah it's probably where I was talking
about leaning on the ownership part I
guess I what I believe a lot of
developers want to do is that they do
want to have pride in what they're
developing they do want to be able to
say I made something great today I'm
working on something awesome and with
the the ability to do it I need to be
able to own the app control the app be
beast be in that position where they
they guide its creation and so I think
that working on the ownership angle and
the pride angle is is where I'd go with
that so like you if you want to make
this awesome if you want to change it if
you want to rewrite it into something
like whatever is cool right now you know
you have to be responsible for it all
the way it's like a little bit of give
and take
I mean I suppose I'm explaining it very
well but as an example there was this
app in a company I worked on which would
been in the company for since the
beginning and it was probably the worst
app and no one wanted to work on it like
seriously no one wanted to work on there
it was like it served up media files and
it was horrible where there was one guy
that ended up working on it and he
started slowly and gradually changing
the way it worked slowly adding more
metrics adding more monitoring adding
more logging and that's where he started
he started with that he didn't really
start with rewriting or anything he
started by adding more information so
that when he started gaining the alerts
or when the ops team at that point there
was no devs on call got the alerts they
had more information on how to change it
how to work with it what's change where
to look for issues and following people
found this really interesting and other
devs kind of joined him on that team and
we're like this is great you're doing
you're exposing all this kind of really
useful information about which end
points are the most used which ones are
crap you know which end points we can
delete what code we no longer need
anymore and give it six months it made
the app that everyone wanted to work on
by using this kind of by turning it
around and using this as information
this monitoring this metric is logging
into an app that they will
proud of and everyone's like whoa I want
to work on that up and part of it was
uncool in the end because what he wanted
to do was be able to take that extra
information that he was getting and make
me a better one does that help yeah I am
gonna need to add more slides could you
incentivize people on having the issues
fixed on the post-mortem and the
recovery side of it rather than on the
call so they're on call and they have to
drive the fixing of the issue that
caused them to be on call I've not tried
that I've absolutely not true that I'm
not sure how you would track that either
I mean I suppose it comes it's very
similar to kind of like bug bounties
that kind of thing I suppose in that way
it would have to need to be extra rather
than conversation because you've still
lost whatever time you would have lost
it's part of on call yeah maybe you
could try it that's the thing that's why
yeah yeah there's always ways we're
developers right systems to us stuff
goes in stuff goes out if you only want
to come out you put the right stuff in
so there's always a way if you want if
money is what you want to come out
you'll you'll put the right stuff in so
it's it's I think this is we're trying
to say balance it out we've kind of you
know the ownership side of it the
building something awesome maybe because
the money is it's still goodwill it's
still you know you're still riding on
someone's goodwill to fix these bugs are
not put in more bucks so yeah there
needs to be a different compensation
different reason for people to be
wanting to do this stuff okay so fun
okay I'm not gonna make you all guys to
here for 10 minutes and I'm very very
sorry for finishing so early but if you
want to go go ahead and thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
