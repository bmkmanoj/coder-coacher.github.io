been able to tell from the slide and the
factory here and today I'm gonna be
talking about who needs dashboards so
this will be a talk of - Huff's the
first half are we talking about a few
different types of dashboards
throughout business and the second half
I'll be going through some frequently
asked questions I've had about the first
half to be honest hopefully with the
idea to give you some help on caring for
your monitoring dashboarding and in
general just being very excited about
the whole subject so Who am I to talk
about monitoring anyway I've been a
software developer for about two and a
half years just started working at uni
days and for the last year and a half
I've been involved in quite a few
different monitoring projects from
dashboarding down to logging and
alerting and there's many different
aspects so I've been involved in a
project that was about creating
standards for dashboards I have
implemented a centralized logging system
in one of the companies used to work for
using elastic so I pretty much like this
subject a lot but enough about me who
needs dashboards so first of all what do
I mean by dashboards and it's also known
as visualization within monitoring the
very tactical approach I like to think
about it is most of us have been in a
car or drive a car you have a dashboard
there it tells you how much petrol we
have what's PD going up
are you breaking any laws it will send
off a little alerts if suddenly your
car's broken for any reason
pretty good for covering what a
dashboard is so why do we care we've all
seen this kind of scene in a movie
right where somebody's surrounded by
screams leader of a movie jumps in
saying I need to know where the bad guys
gonna be and this poor sort I minded my
language
has to go in answer quite quickly now
who could actually do this I know I
couldn't it's way too much information
to process but realistically I've
certainly had to do this in jobs I've
worked at as a software developer I've
had people coming to my desk asking why
the websites down unfortunately or how
many customers are going through a
particular route and this is involved
having to dive through logs or running
tests and sometimes I can't give an
answer at all the information is not
available this is where dashboarding
comes in it's a tool to help you see
information and trends of information in
an easy to read easy to understand
format so this particular scenes from a
film called Minority Report you do know
the film Minority Report right great
because I've had a few people who have
said this films really old and made me
feel quite bad about myself not aware of
the film Tom Cruise there's this very
cool hand gesture thing where he pulls
together some pieces of information and
walks away unscathed I didn't think I'd
ever say this but I would love to be as
cool as Tom Cruise and to pull
information together in this way but
it's just not practical so we use -
boardings to save us a bit of headache
now with this talk I'm going to be using
an example from Rick and Morty anyone
here like Rick and Morty you're gonna
like my slides more this is great so for
those of you who haven't seen it there's
a particular episode with a biscuit
factory called simple Rick's it's in
dark undertones if you've got a dark
sense of humor highly recommend it um
but for the purpose of this exercise
it's a biscuit factory I'm going to give
an overview of four different categories
or levels of dashboarding in relation to
this biscuit factory and who's using
them and why so let's dive in like Tom
Cruise business intelligence
this form of dashboard is mostly used by
upper management the sort of people who
are talking to investors and
stakeholders I'm going to use an analogy
from something I read a while ago which
refers these types of dashboarding in a
war seem so business intelligence is
this deep strategic plan and it's how
we're going to win the war so some of
those things it might cover is the
health of a business how are we doing
compared to last time this time last
year for instance is there business
staying afloat and it involves a lot of
statistics that help towards a strategic
plan what's our next goal going to be so
examples of this and with business
intelligence you may have a customer
model and you want to know that's
accurate so with a biscuit factory
you'll want to know if your customers
tend to have families maybe that's why
they're buying biscuits what sort of
behaviors they tend to have if you've
got a family maybe they're more likely
to buy around Halloween but your
competitors are also going to have
initiatives around that time period what
can we do to stay afloat during that
time as kind of hinted upon you've also
got how are you doing compared to last
year is this business improving is it
not is there any other strategies we can
take to help with this and it involves a
lot of statistics to be honest before I
started talking to people who are using
these kind of dashboards I thought it
was all voodoo but it's it's sensible
its achieving achievable goals within a
time period what are we going to do in
the next quarter why are we doing it and
these dashboards also helpful for
negotiating with your stakeholders your
investors showing in a visible format
why you've made these decisions
following on from this is management
information this is often described as
information that's finite and
financially important to the business
directly impacts the company
and as such it's mostly associated with
the sort of people here you see with
Excel sheets in front of them they could
probably do with a management
information dashboard to be honest it
goes further than that and I will go
into that in more detail but going back
to that war analogy is tactical it's how
we're gonna win the battles to achieve
winning the war the smaller projects
that go towards achieving that big
business goal so simple Rick's again
these dashboards can be used in finance
marketing products many different
departments so we're going to focus on
marketing for this one they know that
there's a business goal of achieving
eight million shekels for the quarter
they say Spreckels is money and Rick and
Morty tons I should have just said money
so you've got to achieve this amount of
money and a certain amount of time how
can we as a department help towards that
so marketing today we're going to
release a TV advert there's more
information to a TV advert than one
might originally think so first of all
that customer model again judging by
your customer model are they more likely
to be in during the day or are they more
likely to be in an evening when you're
going to put this TV advert on this has
an impact on the costs versus profit
when you display a TV advert how long
it's on for hasn't impact on the cost
and you need to have an idea of if
you're going to make any money out of it
because at the end of the day if you're
not going to make money out of the
initiative you're not going to help
towards that strategic goal we talked
about earlier and then there's
monitoring the behavior around this
project you'd have a baseline for how
how many customers are currently hitting
your website what's the behavior right
now because when you release your TV
advert you want to see the impact of it
has it actually been successful has it
been a complete flop you need to have
some sort of statistics behind it to
show whether your
having an impact so already we're
exploring kind of the relations between
bi and mi they're quite closely linked
bi needs to know about the mi projects
to know it's going to achieve that big
grand goal mi need to know about bi it
is kind of a certain that the directions
correct that is going towards the same
company directive and then we have the
last two I'm going to talk about in this
part operational information and
development information this is where it
gets a little bit gray so we'll go back
to that war analogy bi how to win the
war mi how to win the battles going
towards that wall but as much as you can
have two plans and have some sort of
direction on how you're going to do this
there needs to be somebody to actually
do the fighting the execution the
frontline so in terms of a biscuit
factory we have hardware and software
going towards making our biscuits for
doing for making orders for having a
website available with information on it
you can have all the plans in the world
but without actually having these things
you don't have a biscuit factory and the
reason why I'm talking about both of
these at once
is because the information in these
dashboards are quite dependent on
company structure and company size as
well you might have separate operational
and development teams you might be more
of a DevOps format but even that isn't
completely clear you might have
different responsibilities depending on
how your company splits the ideas and
the work these two areas have used
dashboards more than the others as well
probably for longer we're dealing with
systems as we probably all know they
have a lot of cogs turning they're quite
complex by checking inputs and outputs
your being able to find out where
problems are going wrong earlier on and
they use them for more things it's not
just problems people associate
monitoring with finding out when things
are going wrong with the system
but it's not it's also finding out when
things are going right how things are
behaving so you've got a system
monitoring got monitoring for debugging
but also for seeing how your
integrations are working for monitoring
improvements for helping making those
plans so there's a many aspects these
forms of monitoring an example for this
so you've got a database that isn't
quite working the way you wanted to
maybe it slowed down
maybe stopped there's two different
focus so for the purposes talk I'm going
to describe operational information as
monitoring how a system is running on a
production environment and development
information on whether the system is
running as expected so for your database
your operational dashboard will probably
cover CPU memory this space and the
things that your database is running on
your development information will be
looking at interactions with your
database so how you're interacting with
the database in the code maybe it might
look at how you're indexing on your
database maybe there's something effect
that can kind of go either way to be
honest so looking at the same
information but with a very different
focus but they also need to know about
each other
software and hardware so integrated and
so intertwined there needs to be good
communication between I want to say both
departments there depends how you're
working so TV advert again just to keep
it continued continuous a TV adverts
gone life some of the things that needs
to be considered can we cope with the
increased load can people actually make
orders on the website because if the
websites down or if that features not
available it's going to impact that mi
plan they're not going to make as much
money as they wanted which of course
will affect the BI plan and the entire
company goal so that was very quick
I do have a blog on this topic as well
which goes a bit more in-depth but I've
talked about these different areas quite
in a separate kind of concern they all
relate to each other they all need to
know about each other but you can do
something more with this so this is from
a place I previously worked the original
idea was that we're going to merge bi
and MI information into one dashboard so
we could see how the company was
performing towards their main strategic
goal it ended up that we ended up with
developmental and operational
information on here as well so just talk
you through this example graph and yes I
know the axes are wrong suddenly they
want to make 18 million shekels they've
got a lot more ambitious but the light
blue line this one here is referring to
that bi goal how much we want to make in
a certain amount of time the dark blue
wavy line is how the company's actually
performing but then we have these dark
blue sorry dark blue dots and they're
referring to events that might have had
an impact towards this goal so this was
decided by heads of department and a
product owner they had come forward
saying we had this project this is the
effect we had can we put on our graph he
would do it and it was made out of basic
HTML and jeaious and had an Excel
back-end so he could put information on
it without much Deb concern but it was
interesting because this was made for
our every two weeks we had a meeting
cover how the company's doing what's
happening any idea was is that we could
see progress but had a much bigger
effect it actually had a social effect
because suddenly people and departments
could see why they were doing the work
they were doing dosing the impact of the
work what was going on but also increase
in communication suddenly you could see
what other departments were doing maybe
that would
thanks to your future plans or you might
have a third party outage it's out of
our hands but how can we cope with us in
future it started the discussion and it
started bringing together sense of unity
and purpose we're all striving towards
the same goal I know it sounds like it's
kind of a hippie daydream but
surprisingly it did work it was very
good for that and it wasn't what it was
meant for so who needs dashboards I
imagine any amount sir before you came
into this room it was either gonna be
everybody or nobody and I'm very
enthusiastic about this topic so but
before I go and answer this question I
just want to cover again that dashboards
have many uses these are set baselines
to make plans to make targets
it can be used to monitor health and see
issues to plan improvements and there's
more they have this social impact as
well they put everybody on the same page
they start conversations and
communication they put people together
with a sense of unity and purpose
something you know what your works for
why are you doing things I really like -
pause so who needs dashboards really
everyone and we've talked about four
different types of dashboard very
briefly and there are many more types
but I hinted earlier that with MI
dashboarding they can be used more than
just for the people who use Excel sheets
so let's just say that simple Rick's has
a call center people directly
interacting with customers on the phones
I imagine a lot of us have this
situation in our companies and the
people on the phones have some stock
answers something they've been given on
a sheet of paper when you get this
question this is what to say what if
they had a dashboard all of a sudden
they can see how many biscuits you have
in stock of a different type or what the
delivery time is to a certain place in
the UK maybe they can see what's
happening with a website maybe
a problem and they can see it
interactively suddenly their answers to
the customers are a lot more interactive
they're more a lot more tailored to
experience I want to order this kind of
biscuit when can I expect it by we're
currently low on stock on that one
there'll be a couple of weeks but have
you considered these ones instead now
not only does that sound a lot more
interesting to me than having to learn
some stock answers off a piece of paper
but it's a much more improved customer
experience and this is already happening
in quite a few companies and some
companies have taken it further there's
a talk I went to NDC Oslo I know talking
about how a shipping company was using
well as data and dashboards but using
this to estimate when ships are going to
arrive to their port and it took into
account things like weather conditions
so you could alter courses of ships to
get their there sooner all based on data
they had shown on a dashboard I'll tweet
out a link because unfortunately I
remember the speaker's name right now
but it's well worth watching on top of
this we've talked about four level high
for for high level categories at
dashboarding there are many more even in
execution you have security monitoring
performance monitoring front-end
monitoring all kind of specialisms
for their own special purpose and yeah
there's a lot this quote sums up for me
why I'm so passionate about this subject
and a friend lent me a book awhile ago
and this was in it it all goes back to a
scientific method why are we measuring
things we want to have a baseline then
we have an effect and we want to see
what effect that's having if it's good
if it's bad if we're not monitoring
something do we really care about it why
are we doing the things we're doing
without having an intended effect at
some point and if you can't influence or
manage something why are you monitoring
it it's going to stay the same so it's
kind of the idea of
your your dashboards clean and with the
information that you need on there so
for the first half they've probably
convinced you that I'm very passionate
about this subject and I think
dashboards are important if this is a
case how come when I ask people if
they've used dashboards or created them
in their everyday work and they think
they're a total waste of time this is
what I expect to see not quite this
normally my talks on this popular but
you get the idea there's a simple answer
- boardings really hard to do there's a
lot of resource online and there's great
examples about how different companies
have used - boarding and monitoring and
it's very fascinating but unfortunately
particularly - boarding is very fit to
purpose there's not one size fits all
what will work for one place won't
necessarily work for you so it's quite
hard to filter through that and find out
what would be right for your situation
over this second half I want to go
through some frequently asked questions
and some things that I've worked on
myself that helped towards creating
great dashboards so first of all there
are a number of danger signs that you
might see more than there on this slide
these are all kind of a hint that your
monitoring needs some tender loving care
and one of the key points is - boarding
though it works with alerting and
logging and relies on telemetry it's not
a replacement for any things it has its
own unique purpose and to use it for the
right purpose so I'm going to go through
three of the danger signs that come up
most commonly why they might be a
problem and how I probably approach
fixing them so I don't know what the
metrics are for this suggests a couple
of things first of all the information
your dashboard might be a bit stale and
it's not been worked on as the works
being worked on dashboard should evolve
much like systems and businesses do the
other thing is that's probably problems
with communication maybe the person
who's working on these dashboards or
even on your alerting isn't actually
directing with directly working with the
systems that they're monitoring be them
business or otherwise and the idea of
that CRO earlier is that there should be
some kind of action based on the things
you're measuring so having some kind of
purpose behind each your metrics if you
don't know what the metrics are for how
can you react to them I'm going to come
back to this in a second actually but if
you're finding that this is the problem
for you it might be the case that either
you need to go through the metrics that
you've got and try and discover why are
we doing this and trim your dashboards
or just delete them and start again go
back to basics start asking questions
again I'll go into which questions to
ask but asking questions to determine
why you need a dashboard in the first
place tick box exercise is quite closely
related
no one likes tick box exercises they're
boring unfortunately sometimes they're
necessary some aspects of dashboarding
will still involve this every time I
make an API I try and put it's a pattern
called re D raped error and duration
surrounding that but they also need to
add more into that based on the purpose
of the API the danger with this and I've
seen this personally is somebody creates
dashboard or other forms of monitoring
because it's a task on their board and
one of the situations I've seen is a
developers picked up this task on I need
to make a dashboard what do I find
interesting put some stuff on there
later somebody goes to it to debug an
issue in an area but there's no
structure
well if that thing's red should I react
to it what does it actually mean what's
at 72% it's all these things that there
was no actual reason for monitoring them
so you don't know how to act on them and
sometimes you miss information as well
which course is this too so these are
quite closely linked and so it's the
lack of communication between the people
who a need and use this dashboard
because there will be an audience for it
but also thinking about how it's going
to be used
don't make your dashboards a tick box
exercise please please love them they're
really nice really
so again unfortunately you'll be going
back to assess those metrics why are you
doing it maybe having to start from
scratch and this one I haven't actually
personally seen but it's come up quite a
few times you've got one person who does
all our dashboards now it's quite a lot
of work involved in doing all of this
what else does this poor person do I
mean I like this topic but I would hate
that job having to do dashboards for
many different purposes for many
different people making sure they're up
to date it's gonna just collapse
somewhere you can't have that many
conversations and do this work all the
time and still be involved you want
someone who's either directly working
with the project or is going to be using
that dashboard to be involved in the
design of it and to be involved in the
maintenance of it don't have a morty in
the corner responsible for your
dashboards please feel sorry for your
Morty's so again this is bringing
dashboarding back into the team why are
we doing it what do we need it for and
maybe you know giving more to your
holiday so where do we stop there are a
few challenges getting buy-in is a big
one because especially if you're
starting from scratch this is a lot of
work and making sure dashboards are
clear clear
and making sure that you know the
audience for your dashboards I'm going
to go through a few of these now so
first of all the questions that you need
to ask and if you're asking your
stakeholder what they want to see you're
probably not going to get a great answer
or something that's very useful to you
they might have an idea of what they're
interested in
but it's that phrase again what you're
interested in how are you gonna use it
so instead of asking what do you want
there's a few ways in which you can
phrase this if you're working with bi in
MI level dashboards what are the company
objectives what are we working towards
what are our key performance indicators
what shows that this is a success how
might it fail
I like this one because then you will
cover failure and if you know how
something is going to fail you'll
probably surround it with some form of
alerts there's going to be many ways
that you don't anticipate the operation
on development again you might want to
know how your application or your
features working what's the expected
experience this links into failure again
because not all failures are a failure
they might be covered by customer
experience already and not need to be
covered on your dashboard what the key
performance indicators again this
includes service level agreements so the
uptime of your services or your response
times near api's for example these are
all contractual agreements and they do
have a financial impact that they go
wrong you probably want them covered so
going back to our simple Rix example
we've got mi Rick he's very excited
about TV advert yeah hey am i Rick what
do you want is I want to know the
increase on customer rate to our website
almost right you don't want to know the
customer right people could just be
interested in the website after seeing
your advert have a little
not really put an order through that's
not going to affect your profit your
overall goal you want to know how many
customers are completing orders you want
to know where those customers have come
from if we've come through a third party
they probably haven't been impacted by a
TV advert you also want to have that
baseline beforehand as you mentioned and
be able to measure impact so though the
answers almost there you need to
consider what your metrics are telling
you and how you need to act upon them
which brings me to my next point if
somebody asks you to add information to
your dashboards or in the creation of
dashboards you're having these initial
conversations I want you to all do one
thing for me channel your inner toddler
now he's probably all been around kids
when that they're adorable stage where
they won't stop asking questions I've
got a goddaughter she drives me mad
sometimes I hope she never watches this
but I want you to do the same thing I
want you to ask questions why do you
need the information
what does why does it need to live on
the dashboard can it live somewhere else
how long do you need it for so with a TV
advert you probably just want to find
out how that's working the advert will
go off TV you won't need that
information anymore how long do you need
it what use does it provide going back
to having some purpose towards your
metrics dashboards are useful but
increasing transparency communication
and that uniting of a company vision but
communication is key to creating good
dashboards so whenever that phrase well
it might be interesting comes up push
back stampy feat channeler in the
toddler find out why it might be and if
it should be on your dashboard so again
simple ryx is it for measuring an impact
towards a KPI how long does is the
advert on for how long do you need the
information if they're asking for raw
data so that they can do calculations or
modeling on you don't want any
dashboards you probably want the store
somewhere
so that that can be worked on making
sure it's the right format is quite
important which brings me onto lifetimes
we've said about the TV advert lasting
forever so no matter time life times is
key for good dashboarding we mentioned
that the monitoring systems are evolved
projects that evolve so should the
dashboards that are measuring them our
lifetimes can cover two different
aspects at what point metrics or
dashboards should be completely deleted
removed because you're not going to use
them anymore
say errors suddenly been covered by an
alert you've done some work around that
you don't need to keep an eye on it
anymore remove it from your dashboard
it's covered elsewhere but it also
covers prioritization does it need to be
in front of you because at the end of
day I'm matching we've all been in a
situation got a lot of boards up with
really know why they're there
so lifetimes of dashboards the BI mi
levels probably will have a shorter
lifetime than the others and which also
brings me on to layers so different
layers of dashboard as we've already
talked about you've got a strategic and
tactical now these are more likely to be
shown in meetings even the hybrid we had
it available the people to view if
they're interested but it mostly came up
in meetings otherwise wasn't really on
the walls
you've got end-to-end metrics for
journey so I worked in a loans company
and and we had from somebody visiting a
website to successfully completing alone
but another journey was if they were
rejected or if it came through a third
party
and then you've got project and feature
so our TV adverts might be one of them
but you might also have a search bar on
your website monitoring how that's
working and service API website and
infrastructure the reason I want to talk
about layers is because depending on
what you're working on board depending
on what what
shown on the TV and also it links up to
talling so if you're working on a
particular feature it's going to be
unstable for that amount of time as a
developer I works in a team where when
we were working on a feature for a part
of a project we'd have dashboards
surrounding the services we're working
on because it would be unstable while we
were doing that work we'd leave them up
for two weeks after the work had
finished if it'd been fine for two weeks
they've been their problems is consider
stable and stored elsewhere but we also
kept up our feature level because we had
stakeholders that wanted this work done
so we'd show them the dashboards and
they could be able to tell us if we
haven't noticed that something's gone
wrong
occasionally happened but also they
could keep abreast of what was happening
as well you with talling you can also
have a project level dashboard and click
through to layers that you're interested
in that you need I really like that
feature yeah layers and then there's
tooling this is probably what I get
asked about the most and it's the
hardest one there's too many tools I
can't really tell you what you need to
use so a lot of these have specialities
zabbix for operational style
dashboarding and tableau for business
intelligence and you can't really go
wrong and it's not bad to use several
different types of monitoring tool it's
what's fit for purpose but there are
some questions that can help you in
deciding what tool you're going to use I
mean on this dashboard but not dashboard
on this picture here I said dashboard to
me phones I've used a two dog stats the
elastic bit of power bi big Ravana and
I've only worked in three places say
many tools is fine we need to consider
user and development concerns is it for
a particular type of monitoring and
doesn't need to be accessible do you
need to be able to share the - ball
without having to log in what data
sources does it support so the data that
you're showing will have come from
somewhere via Excel or being through
telemetry being sent for your system you
need to make sure that it supports data
sources you already have
does it cover types of queries are most
commonly be using and does your team
have experience at all and if not are
the resources for learning it good
because somebody's gonna have to use it
and I'm gonna have to know how to use it
well cast and hosting what's your budget
for your tooling also do you want to
self host or do you want to host the
solution this will have an effect on
cost and the other features so does it
support alerting in the way that you
want it to a couple of tools will only
support email and web hooks and then you
have to do some work to put it into
slack or HipChat or every tall of
choices some tools will have a direct
integration taking that work away it
makes life a bit easier so it sounds
boring making business cases for tolling
I like to think of it like blind date I
mean 90 is good I'm sorry so you're
asking the questions that you need to
find out which tool is right for you and
if the tool is answering the right
amount of yeses they're not gonna have
all of them but another you think well
maybe they're for me then that's okay
maybe it's cheap maybe people who are
using it know how to use it there they
don't need any training
maybe it'll slack you and you need it
too so if you get really bored just
think of yourself like Stila Black is
how I get through the dark hours so
where can I learn more getting towards
the end now but practical monitoring by
Mike Julien it's a great start at the 10
it covers dashboarding alerting logging
it gives examples from actual companies
I know you can't apply them straight to
yours but it gives you an idea of how
they're used
it's very short I've read it in three
train journeys back and forth from work
and it's not very dry so if you want to
learn a bit more great book online
resources
Brendon Greg's great for operational
monitoring in particular but it covers
quite a lot and the use method is
something that I've used first services
and servers before but there's a lot of
it online resources find what's suited
to you and then send it to me because I
always appreciate something good to read
but the top corner is what I think is
most important so when I first got
interested his topic I started talking
to people in the business I was working
in at a very friendly MD he taught me
about how he uses bi and he took me to
different departments to show me how
they used mi I live in Nottingham and
we've got an amazing tech community
where their own slack so I sent a
message out going I've got a new thing I
want to learn about and suddenly
businesses with us telling me how they
were using monitoring I was having
meeting up with people from operational
engineers to pretty much every
department going that had a dashboard
and not only wasn't learning how they
were using what tools they were using
but I was learning from their pain I've
avoided so much pain from just talking
to people now you're at NBC surrounded
by very smart people from very
interesting companies if it's all you've
been inspired to learn a bit more about
dashboarding and I hope a couple of you
have go ask some questions it's great to
have a chat and if you have a particular
war story come tell me because I really
love this stuff so who needs dashboards
everybody we've covered as many layers
and types dashboards are great for a
social purpose as well uniting us
bringing that transparency putting
everyone the same page having the same
purpose scientific method having that
baseline and seeing how you're having an
impact on your work the audience here
dashboard don't make a development
information dashboard for somebody who
needs it for BI purposes it's not going
to suit them asking the right questions
and pushing back channeling that inner
toddler
the layers of dashboard and what you
need visible tooling and picking the
right tool for you and resources that's
pretty much all from me and I will be at
PubCon from Friday doing a five minute
talk so you won't have to be put through
too much more pain I promise but come
along it's great you'll have a laugh
there's fear there's non-alcoholic
beverages and there's great people I
really love pop Kampf get your ticket
now and I don't know if I have time for
questions probably not one cool but
otherwise I'm available on Twitter and
I've got bright pink Cassie should be
able to spot me over the next couple of
days anybody have a question oh you are
you were saying that obviously you have
to ask why why why why about why you're
making the dashboard but if you kind of
avert that how do you find places in
your business where it might not be
obvious that dashboard could give you
value and identify yeah where you could
usefully put that effort in I've had to
do this personally so quite like
discussion so when I was doing the
centralized logging project everybody
was like we already can see our log so
you can go through different files
slightly different situation but similar
impact and I had to build that business
case and say look these are the problems
that we've had if we had this tool this
is how we could have avoided them and
this is how much dev time I think it
would have resolved so kind of paying it
back to money has a big effect and it's
the same for dashboarding so again if
you're doing it for an mi projects how
do you know how much money you're making
without having that kind of measurement
so yeah always play it back to money
people speak in that language really
well thank you
cool I'll be hanging around anyway so if
you do want to ask anything feel free
and thank you very much you've been
