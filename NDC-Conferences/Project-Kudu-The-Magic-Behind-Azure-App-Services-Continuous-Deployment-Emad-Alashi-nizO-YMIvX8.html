it's NDC it's the last day it's the last
session and John skeet is speaking with
the other room so thank you for
attending I'm gonna make this fast so
we're really gonna jump in and I don't
want this to be too boring so if you
have any comments or questions just I
stopped me a while I'm speaking project
cool do
alright so anyone have seen this
interface before it's it's the portal
and azure portal through which you can
bind your code repository to your web
app so once you push anything in your
code repository it will be instantly
picked up by by your application and
then it will be deployed instantly of
course supporting like the well the most
common code repository is out there this
thing the most beautiful part about this
is that the engine behind that is doing
this deployment is an open source
project
it's called project kudu it's on github
it's active and it's the real thing
behind as well so Before we jump into
the project code itself
I'm gonna brush briefly about as your
website extensions because CUDA is
deployed as a whoop-whoop start
extension but I'm not going to spend too
much time on this if you if you have any
questions or answers questions regarding
this towards the end of the presentation
maybe you can talk about it so the only
thing I want you to understand about our
group site extensions is that it's just
another would application that is
sitting on is next to your web app so
it's just that it's very very simple the
way it's deployed we can talk about it
after the decision or towards the end
but it's just that kudu kudu is like
this so what's the characteristics of a
durable extension it's sitting on the
same box it's it's just next a node next
to your group application is
it shares the same quarter of your
resources CPU RAM this is also true in a
zoo so if your deployment takes a lot of
time be careful and the authentication
deal that you can access to a zoo
website extension most of the time it's
it does not have an authentication
it relies on whatever authentication
layer portal Ezra portal has so good as
an extension it's a special car because
if our website extension because it's
pre-installed so once you run your web
application on Azure once you start it
you already have kudu running behind the
scenes and it also sits in a folder
other than the folder that is known for
the site extensions on Azure so if you
if you want to build your website
extension if you want it to have an
exhilaration that Tron's next to your
main web application you can you can
create your own adorable extension it's
gonna kind of sit on the in this for the
door
alright so talking about the internals
of how this deployment happens once you
create your web application on Azure and
in fact you can do this we can map this
to locally in a minute your you Azul web
app installed and instantly you have
could do with application next to your
website and this this part of the coudl
we're going to talk about the CUDA
project in general this part is called
the SCM part I'm going to call it the
SCM part source control management
services control management we don't
care the acraman is not too important so
you create your application instantly
you have kuru and with kuru a git
repository is created for you for your
service along with some environment
variables that is going to be consumed
once I want to need to deploy so this is
me I didn't put in my face but anyway I
since I have access to this could code
depository I can if I have a web
application I can just push it to my
code repository and if I have future
improvements okay I can keep pushing
what happens behind the scenes is that
this get repository has a hook behind
the scenes it listens to all the events
of of like pushing to this code
repository what's again what's gonna
happen CUDA will be notified it has the
environment variables these environment
variables you have access to you can add
you can remove you can edit that will be
available for you in the deployment kudu
will grab the the code from the code
repository will grab the environment
variables and will look for something we
call the deployment script it's going to
look first in your code repository if it
finds one it will use it to deploy
otherwise it's going to in inspect to
your code and see what kind of project
do you have and will generate one for
you so it's gonna probably it check if
you if it's a an ASP do two web
application probably it's gonna create a
deployment script that will restore your
new get packages run em is a build and
and deploy so once once this happens the
output is generated from this build and
then eventually it'll be deployed to
your as a rebuttal also this part of
kudo is the could do think it's one of
the tools now the the scenario I've just
explained is the less known scenario I
just wanted to explain it before because
it's a crucial for the understanding of
how could runs behind the scenes this
however is the more common scenario
which is you have your bit repository on
external eager to preserve in on github
or VSDs and once and you want to push to
this get repository and then the
deployment happens how does this happen
kudu is not only something magic behind
the scenes it also provides an endpoint
or multiple endpoints HTTP REST API that
you can manipulate your web application
or the deployment of
the most important in point that we are
interested in is deployed so this is
this is the URL of your website if
you're a website it's called my website
the SCM URL is the dot SCM as a website
on it so this this end point what will
happen is if you if you push information
for this in point a deployment will
happen how this happens you're going to
grab this end point and add it as a whip
hook to a github repository and the son
get help web hooks web hooks is is just
and you can think of it as events on
HTTP so if I want to know about
something that's happening on another
service like github I can provide my
interest like if something happens
please invoke this HTTP endpoint and
give me a post with this information
if I open github if if I do this
negotiation between my Azure portal web
application a configuration for my
automatic deployments and I do this on
github
I can if I go to the git repository on
github and I check the settings the web
hooks part I can see my this URL is
saved there so now I push my code to my
git repository on github github will
send an HTTP POST request to this
endpoint sending not only the commits I
didn't have space but everything but it
since the commit ID the repository URL
and a lot of more information about this
committee Kudo in the other hand once it
receives this events it will fetch that
commits from the code repository will
check your code repository for the
deployment script and the same scenario
a applies the output is built and Europe
site is created and I deployed so let's
see some practical stuff up
all right so this is project kudu this
is a protocol in github the main part
that we are interested in is kudu itself
and you can see that it's just a nice
code repository that you have access to
now I want I'd I want to move away from
the traditional way of how a kudu is
presented on other web sites so I'm
gonna do this locally what I did is what
I can do is I just clone the kudu
repository and set up set it up on my is
and just make sure that all the pre-quiz
its are there node.js module two just to
make sure that I can deploy node.js
applications and and some other small
requirements msbuild targets but if you
don't want to do this the MSP team sorry
the kudu team have provided a very nice
setup script that does this for you the
kudu they've set up it's it's part of
the code repository it will do this for
you I've done this before so I can show
you my is so this is my default website
and I deployed kudu here
alright so it's just I have a single
node on my is if I navigate to this
website or this URL I will have an empty
dashboard this dashboard is part of kuru
but it's not the SEM site right this is
just a dashboard that will make my life
easier I will do some of the things that
as your portal does for me so I'm going
to create an application it works off
mm-hmm I'm gonna call it my app because
this is the easiest name and I will have
to create now what's happening behind
the scenes this as a kudu dashboard is
navigating through the api's of Ras it's
creating an application for me a site
for me on iOS so you can see that I have
three tabs with a get URL and two URLs
available for me the first URL is the
application or URL itself and and the
second one is the URL of the SCM site
cool the kudu ACM site if our chick is
and refresh my sites you can see that I
have two sites the kudu underscore my
app this is the my application the one I
will be deploying and this is the SCM
site if I need to get to my application
it's gonna be you're gonna see it's a
very simple web application this is a
default page that comes once you create
a new application from the kudu
dashboard and once you navigate to this
guy this is the SEM site I'm hoping that
you have seen it before have you seen it
all right so this one I'm going to my
application if you go if you go to your
one of your web application I'm gonna
pick one and go to tools and then you go
kudu you will get exactly the same site
if it looks in properly because
sometimes it just gives me a hard time
beautiful see this is if you if I just
zoom in this is the URL of the SEM site
you can see that it's just an extra
subdomain
on the website so what does this SEM say
this this is an interface for the engine
the deployment happens behind the scenes
but there's a lot of more features other
than continuous deployment one of the
most interesting features is the debug
console so if I open this this actually
is a console that is on my server on my
web application this is my if I click on
my for example the folder structure if I
click on my site you can see all the
subfolders and you can see that also the
console changes I can do I can run all
most of sorts of commands that I can
delete I can create directory whatever I
like this investigation if you want to
do some investigations this is awesome
you can also drag an drop files if you
want to and it can be command prompt or
PowerShell there's also the process
Explorer you can you can see all the
processes that are running with the SCM
process itself and it's because it's
sandboxed you can't see all the sub
processes but if your SCM site process
creates another process like a notepad
if I run notepad from from my debug
console I will see a subprocess
displayed here which is this is really
awesome like you are seeing what's
what's happening in your application on
your server a lot of stuff looks stream
you can if you're a web application logs
to your to a folder of logs you can you
can click on this tab and you'll see the
live log that is writing to the folder
on your ass or you can see it HTTP being
displayed for you and a lot of stuff you
can also do like even even the web jobs
creation is part of of kudos
so if I go back to the end
I'm in here sorry if I go to the man
part you can also see the HTTP REST API
that is provided for you we're gonna
come back for this in it
oh so you can see that this is exactly
the same thing this is this this one is
my own my localhost
so this is this is how it's running on
iis I'm sorry I'm on as well if I go
back here for a minute you can see that
this is where I cloned the koodoo
repository from github this is this is
the solution this is good right and I've
pointed the dashboard for this
application check this out this is the
most interesting part this folder is
called apps this is where when I created
my app it created this folder here this
is very similar to what's happening on
Azure the only difference is that the
the place or the folder is going to be
different I'm going to show you two
things this is the repository this is
the one that I told you about in the in
the previous slide that once you create
your could see it's gonna create a
repository for you ready for you to be
playing with this is your duplication
where it's going to be deployed and here
you can see the deployments that will
happen in the future once once I deploy
you can see meter information about the
deployments that that have happened also
one of the things that I want to show
you later is the tools for the under the
deployments all right beautiful
very nice now I have a would application
here
that is a very vanilla it this is the
template from a spinet project I've
created before what I will do is I'm
going to before this I'm going to show
you one
show you a couple of things before I
clone this get repository and add my
code to in this tab you can see all the
deployments that have happened before
also we don't have any deployments this
year because you haven't pushed any code
hour and we are now going to come to
this in a minute and also we have the
configuration the configuration here is
where you can do several things you can
specify which git branch that you want
to deploy from most of the time is going
to be a top net project so you are going
to be using MSL miss build and this is
where you can provide extra information
or parameters for mispelled if you want
to do publishing for some other stuff or
a config for debug versus release you
can do it here and some other more
properties that you can edit I'm gonna
I'm not gonna go through a lot of these
but the nice thing is that you can add
your property
add some properties and you can edit and
you can delete all of these beautiful
settings will be available for you
during the deployment so you can you can
consume I'm going to show you this
intimate so let's go back to our
deployments let's copy this URL of the
git repository and what I'm going to do
I'm going to clone it here alright so
mmm-hmm no make sense clone the mouse
keeps sliding get long this guy now I
have cloned the the git repository that
is on my machine right so it is HTTP
back into my machine because it's local
BRR there's empty folder of course and
what I will do is I can zoom out now
I'll get my code that I have created
before copy and paste here
a lot of God that you have I've been
I've been active I've been programming a
lot so requires some time to copy and
what if I check my con here you can see
that I have some changes I'm going to
add everything git commit my first my
first commit I'm gonna am I gonna change
this I'm going to keep it
my first commit and now I have my git
repository ready what I will do now is
get push and I want you to notice
something
now what's happening behind the scenes I
have I have pushed my code to my remote
my remote has picked it up and it did
not only just update there they get tree
it's also adding doing a lot of stuff
it's you can you can see what is the
added package you are restoring
restoring you know get packages so
what's what's going on this is this is
where could have kicked in it figured
out that there is a push it checked out
my project it didn't see any deployments
crypto and checked it out or okay it's a
dotnet project I'm going to provide you
a deployment script that is suitable for
you I did which is going to restore my
new get packages and build my project
and it's done this beautifully for me so
if I go to my application now if i zoom
out if I go to my application and I
refresh it's gonna take some time to
display so I'm not going to wait because
it's it's the first time I hit this URL
after the deployment but I can go to my
application on Kudo here come on the
mouse is giving me a hard time this this
is it this is the playground
this is dashboard the temp what I'm
gonna I'll hire you
finally so remember this when we created
the my application on is it created the
folder for me if you check the
repository if you remember the
repository was empty and now you can see
that it's updated the deployments voila
a new deployment has happened and this
is the information the metadata about
the information about the deployment
that has happened did the the one the
bit I want to show you though is if I go
deployments and go to the tools if you
remember this tools for that was empty
could I have generated this deployment
script for me so if I open this with
Visual Studio code this is the magic
this is the deployment script that is
happening all of this at the top I'm
gonna skip this is just the deployment
script that is making sure that all of
the requisites of the deployment is
there all right so I'm gonna skip this
and show you the most interesting part
this is it here what I'm doing is I'm
restoring the nougat packages for my
solution I'm building through msbuild
I'm executing a misspelled and this is
an environment environment variable and
if there is no errors
only then sync the folders deploy to
www-what it's very simple it's very nice
now this is this was very nice I have I
have my application now I want to show
you the utilization of the environment
variables and the properties that you
can use in this deployment script
I have two test projects in my
application one called unit tests and
one called integration tests the unit
tests I have very simple test it just
assets true which is true and of course
because integration tests always fails I
have in my integration tests a set rule
is false so it lets let's do this
this let me show you how we are going to
have our
on deployment script so I've picked this
deployment script and I built on it of
course there's there's other ways for
you to get the deployment script from
azure but it's this is a long story
from here so what I will do is I'll go
to my cheat sheet and get these two
files and add them to my repository I
will add them to the root the first file
just like it it declares that well Guddu
beware we have a deployment script here
so don't use your own so if I open this
one you can see that it's only has a
command the deployment script that we
have if I open this one though you'll
see that this is this is the same bit we
have the only difference is I have
edited my script to do the following
build my test project this is this is
called I wrote and invoke the X unit
console runner which is going to run my
unit tests if I have any problem with my
unit tests skipped just don't deploy
jump jump to the error page I want you
to notice something here this guy this
is a variable name also I'm expecting to
push or to make it available while the
deployment script but currently I don't
have it so if i zoom out and I go to my
configuration I'm going to add the
property called this name
and I will put the name of the test
project that I will add now I have this
environment variable really for me while
deploying the script if I go back to my
command prompt you will see that I have
the deployment scripts added my custom
deployment scripts are you know what's
going on just keep sliding I'm gonna add
everything commit um get commit - M it's
gonna be cool if I do a tackle again so
soon commit and then I would push what I
want you to notice now that not exactly
not the same output you'll see because I
have changed the deployment script and
you can see that now it's doing more
stuff there's more stuff happening which
is exactly the thing that we have done
we have tested or we have added the part
in the deployment script in which we
build this project and also run and
you'll see now that here you can see
that we have run the tests and there is
zero errors or our lyric test ran there
is no problems beautiful and the
deployment succeeded probably so if I go
back to my deployments tab I will see
that my second comment has successfully
deployed beautiful now I want to change
the environment variable so not the unit
tests project to run rather than the
integration test to make it fail and I
want you to show that the deployment
will not take place
well I ruined the surprise didn't I all
right so I'm gonna go back to my in
configurations
and then scroll down to the bottom
instead of unit tests and then say well
integration tests see the properties now
I need to change something here so I'm
gonna say just new item file
TSD just to be able to commit it in you
and now sorry and push to my local
remote if this makes sense so I'm gonna
push and the same things will happen
we'll see if we have ours do we have
URLs yes we have an error see the unit
test did not pass if I go to my
deployments you'll see that it failed
beautiful I reminder this is only the
koodoo dashboard the koodoo dashboard
does not do this deployment magics it's
the SCM site it's this beautiful thing
that is doing the magic the kuda
dashboard all what it's doing is
communicating with the SCM through the
REST API so if you do if you don't like
the dashboard or if you have other
automation that you have or if you if
you want to invoke these endpoints
manually this is all available for you
as first API alright now let's go back
to this guy and extend a repository okay
I I understand that we can we can have
the kudu git repository I can push to it
and everything is going to be fine but
they'll well this is not most of our
projects most of our projects we are
gonna have external repositories and I
happen to have one I'll try to clone
this guy so I'm gonna copy the URL and
then go
as a happy person and I will paste my
url here now this is this invocation
will eventually invoke the deploy in
point that we have mentioned at the at
the beginning we this the information
that we are providing is the URL of the
git repository if I provide a hash
commit at the ends of this get
repository I'm going to deploy it that
commit I'm gonna retrieve that commit
and deploy it if I don't provide that
commit ID is just gonna get the latest
from this good depository now if I go
Canyon guess what's gonna happen it's
gonna fail because this is a private
repository github is known about open
source and stuff but if you have a
private repository what are you gonna do
well what you can do is you can either
provide basic authentication at the
beginning of the URL which is not nice
you don't want to put your best foot
like this or you can leverage some of
the functionality that could provide
which is awesome also you can create a
private SSH key on kudou and get that
public key put it in your code
repository and this way you can have
access to that code repository sorry if
you don't know how SSH works and and get
you just you have a private key you
generate the public key you keep the
private key for yourself you give the
public key for the code repository and
then the code repository will accept any
connection that happens from someone
that has this private key so what I will
do I will cheat I also I'm gonna copy
the SCM URL and go to an endpoint so I'm
just going to remove the previous
installation I had and you can see that
I'm invoking the API SSH key and this
ensure public key like once once you
create the
okay four on the code repository send me
the public key so I can use it so if I
invoke this one.beautiful it works
no surprises I'm going to copy this
public key without the courts and then
go to my security tab in the code
repository and add my public key now you
can see how many times I have rehearsed
on this so I'm at how many times have
you written well let me check my set of
keys
add this now whoever have the private
key of this public key will have access
to so if I go back and try to clone but
before I do this I would have to do
something is we tried the HTTPS now we
have changed to SSH so we're going to
copy the URL go to our deployment before
we do this just let me make sure that
our application runs like this is
deployment that we have beautiful I will
paste my friend and then go and
hopefully things will work because but
after that invocation point I have the
private key created for me now you can
see this beautiful beautiful now we have
successful deployment and it's coming
from this deployer this is my path on a
VSDs if I go refresh my page you'll see
that it's the code that I have on VSDs
so beautiful we have we have covered so
far we have covered the the internals of
the deployments the the deployment
scripts how to have
and a public assess keys now all of this
magic is not only for you available
included as is it's not only that you
have it here on local is where you can
have it on your infrastructure but which
is this is the nice thing is you can
deploy your own version of code on your
Azul web app so for example if you if
you have if you have waited for a
feature or if you have a repository
table type that is not supported yet or
like the guys I have the guys have
different priorities on kudu and they
are not really available for for your
priorities what you can do
clone build or change build and deploy
your private guru so I'm going to show
you my whip application here as a room
app I have done this before I wanted to
do some drastic change on the Kudo
deployment for this one but of course
it's gonna be a little bit hard for for
such presentation so what I did is the
following if it also if it looks
properly
and remember you can you can do a lot of
stuff with this availability you can you
can currently it supports mercurial and
voila you see this is this is this is on
a zoo this isn't a zoo and yet I have
something different from I usually have
like unlike other websites if I can't
change the CSS and make it pink I can do
a lot of stuff I can I can change the
code I can change the binaries and in
fact the cool guys the awesome cool guys
they made this very easy even for you to
by just invoking another end point which
was this I'm not gonna do it right now
I'm just going to show you this is what
I did sorry this one this one so I'm
gonna skip for this go towards the end
this is the end point I've invoked and I
just provided my username and password
my deployment credentials on Azure I
invoke this point which is a zipped a it
you can you can unzip any folder on CUDA
by invoking this you can send a zip
folder and in unzip it
one Kudo if you don't provide any URLs
where you where you want it to unzip
more it will unzip on the root of the
site extensions so if I go to my guy
here and check my file structure on this
Azure instance there's a resistance you
can see that I have a folder called hot
extensions and this is this is where my
prophet could who ended it so as long as
I have this the original code will not
look at the Program Files
I start extensions but also it's going
to override it alright so far we have
seen this demonstration now there's a
lot of stuff also I only showed you the
the deployment spot this is this is the
API for the deployment where you provide
the URL and the commit ID there's also
an API to check all the previous
deployments and also invoke or deploy a
previous deployment because you can jump
back and forth or you can even check the
logs of the deployment this is all
available through a REST API the SSH one
I showed you you can also change your
settings through an arrest API so this
you can you can expand your horizons and
imagination of what you can do with this
the agnostic so you can you can see all
the things that happening on your
application even if it's your
application writing its logs to trace to
log it will be written to a file that
you would have access through this api's
extracting zip files and a lot of stuff
now what is more what what does kudu
have more than the continuous deployment
webhooks I can also I don't know if we
have I think we have enough time
surprisingly so I can show you a wood
book so if I if I can do this so we
started 420 right so okay we have some
we have time so if I go here let me just
try because this is was not supposed to
be part of the presentation but it's
gonna be very nice if we show it so I
start fiddler and I can go to the
configuration sorry where did it go
it's sticks
I know it's there pose it to other
couple aggravation come on
I didn't maybe alright I can't find it
what you can do is you can provide whip
hooks the whip hooks you can you can
have a list of your else that you can
invoke on the successful or failure of
deployments and you will be notified so
sad that I couldn't find it so what
books look stream you can also find all
the log stream that's happening on your
application process Explorer I showed
you debug console you can have all this
functionality you can have access to
your console remotely web jobs whip
drops is actually part of project code
so if continuous jobs are running and
triggered jobs it's part it's part of
CUDA so you can you can even have it in
your infrastructure now why would you
care about this well first of all you
can understand what's going behind the
scenes we are not blind anymore on how
this thing works it's it's all obvious
you can use it locally in your
infrastructure you're not ready to move
to Azure or this you already have an
infrastructure you want to privilege to
deliver it you can use it locally and
finally you can customize you can you
can you don't have to wait for the CUDA
team to just add some features rajaguru
is open source you can find it on github
the guys are really really awesome
David able that the lead on the project
is also approachable anytime he is
always there they have also a room on
chat on Java and it's always active and
running by that I finish if you have any
questions or comments objections now on
forming Tomatoes
that's good there's the part of of kudu
is this is this is the nice thing is
that they try their best not to deviate
away from being on an azure environment
or a local environment but since this
happens they well you have to there's
some code branch as you can see in the
code repository of kudu if if is our
environment or if I swipe is available
as a sorry swap is available so if you
have a slot on Azure like you you know
if you if you create and as a room app
you can have different slots like
staining or whatever you can configure
CUDA to to run the swipe for you yeah
but if if you are a lot running locally
this this feature will not be there and
just be ignored
yes correct
right so if you think about it it's kudu
is is just about being an adjacent to a
specific group application so it's it's
all of the focus or and the
concentration of co2 is the adjacent to
application that you are going to
provide the URL for and the file format
so so it's if you want to have another
web application you'll just have another
node that it will be deployed as it
could so as many applications you have
to deploy you'll have as many kudu
instances that are running so there's no
configurations per se like database that
is keeping a list of all the stuff but
it's through the dashboard you will have
this functionality but it's done on the
localized that is installed on all right
I thank you so much for attending my
twitter handle is another sheep please
keep in touch and thank you for
attending thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
