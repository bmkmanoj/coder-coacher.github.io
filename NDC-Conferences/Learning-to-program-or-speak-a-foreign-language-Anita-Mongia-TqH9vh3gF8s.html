it's all nice and intimate um thank you
for deciding to come and listen to me
today I know there's a lot of other very
very interesting talks especially when
going up stairs my name is Anita as you
can see I could tell by my first skin
and the blonde hair I am Norwegian and
I've lived abroad for about 12 years now
and I currently live in Dublin where i
work at facebook but even though the
company that i work for is very
interesting and very relevant for this
conference that were at today i will
actually not figure doing a talk on
Facebook talking about my job when I'm
on holiday is not one of my favorite
things to do this is my first time to
Sydney as well which is an amazing
experience and I just hope the weather
would have been just a bit nicer but
considering it is winter here I I should
be happy it's raining and not snowing I
guess so after having taught and given a
talk on virtual reality in Oslo one of
my friends who is here encouraged me to
submit a proposal for talks at NBC and
after having Google what Embassy is and
sent for I immediately knew what I
wanted to talk about so I wanted to talk
about today how bad I am at programming
I know this is a little bit weird going
to a conference about programming and
developing to hear someone talk about
how bad I am at doing it but i'll put
things into perspective and make it a
little bit interesting but it's very
low-key talk more fun and it has a very
personal aspect of it from my side and
if you have any questions during the
talk just let me know and most people
here come here to talk about some things
are really really good at so i decided
something completely different and come
here talk about something about really
real
about us so I hope I'm good at talking
about a water better is that make sense
so what i am gonna talked about today is
how I'm different from you guys not the
fact that I'm from Norway or don't have
a tan or whatever is the fact that i
suck at programming so i can basically
say that i'm terrible i'll being
terrible and in the fact that is exactly
what I am so I decided to take a look
into why exactly I was so bad at it and
maybe have a little points for myself to
understand how I could get better at it
and so this is a talk about how we learn
to program what cognitive abilities are
needed and how it differs from learning
in actual language of human language so
this talk will most likely not give you
a Eureka moment when you're sitting in
your tub tonight but i'll give you more
perspective on the topic that you're
already probably more familiar with an
eye on and i want to set them into a new
context for you guys and it all started
when i decided to study engineering I
move to Denmark based on the fact that
I'm really good at physics and math and
I guess that's the thing you're supposed
to do a few Gorillaz also don't sleeping
and I actually wanted to become an
engineering and everything that we
learned made sense to me up to the point
where we had to learn programming and I
think that was a during the second
semester would learn all about mechanics
and electronics and all that strain
gauge and all that and we had to put
everything together by programming
program for a letter balance that we
built so this was my reaction to needing
to learn C++ and as I've heard from
other C++ isn't the most easiest
language to learn either but I guess
that was the requirements at the time in
my class in Denmark we were actually
given computers to work
as compared to my fellow students in
Norway that did all the tasks by writing
I don't understand how you're able to
learn how to program in writing when
you're not able to compile even so I'm
kind of glad that I did the the real
ones because I would have definitely
sucked at the first 1i and the first
problem I met was that a fact that i use
a mac and not a computer so i thought oh
this is a huge problem i need to figure
this out did the whole boot camp set up
with my match and thought everything was
good to go and little did i know i had a
little bit bigger problems in store for
me so i was able to understand the basic
and the functions the library the
calling and all that stuff well when I
was set up to program something from the
ground up I didn't really know where to
start and coding is defined as you
probably know as the process of
developing and implementing various sets
of instructions to enable a computer to
do a certain task since Paige questioned
point off encoding as well as a spoken
language improved thinking by
challenging the brain to recognize
negotiate meaning and master different
language patterns so I saw the fact that
I know languages and no mass no physics
i thought well shouldn't I be able to do
this and we were able to do the whole
hello world hello world code pretty
easily but that was very useless on his
own so we had to learn how to write the
code from scratch as i mentioned to get
the lateral letter balance to write out
how many grams and what the price was in
norwegian corners and fortunately I had
really good Co students in my class so
we're able to help me out because I
would never have been able to do it by
myself and we're going to look into a
little bit why and how I could have
improved at the time and
really didn't know where to start so I
think I just at the beginning kind of
just gave up and I felt kind of stupid
and that made me wanted to look into the
topic so i started to dig a little bit
and based on my basic knowledge and how
i could potentially be able to dig
myself out of it and i found that the
several states in the u.s. proposed that
programming languages should be counted
as credit for foreign language so for
example in texas in new mexico and in
Kentucky they already suggested that
programming is kind of the same as
learning a foreign language at this
point I'm like well then what's going on
here and research using MRI actually
shows that programmers brains show that
there are similarities between brain
activities when learning to program and
during a human language and then I got
even more confused because I see five
languages and I still don't know how to
program and being from Norway languages
is a huge part of school we even have
two written languages and you learn
English from one year I think you're
four five six seven years old and then
when you're in seventh grade you need to
pick a third language which we kind of
consider to be a second language and to
my despair my school only had German so
I needed to learn german side German for
three years and when cybelline was able
to use it and that was within sub two
years I guess and when I went to high
school I decided to learn Spanish so in
Spanish move to Spain travel it a lot in
Latin America and I'm able to actually
use the languages but that's not the
fact with programming so how does that
differ though if some people say that
you're able to get the same credit for
learning these two different things but
in reality they're not the same thing
other research say that learning how to
program has more in common with math
than actual human languages and to put
it simple there are blurred lines
between mass and languages because the
math part of the brain that processes
numerals which call that inferior
temporal gyrus is physically near the
errors area responsible for a language
processing which makes it really hard to
actually do research on these things
because when you set up to stimulate
these parts of the brain you can often
misinterpret those signals and the fact
that both of them are really near the
ear canal makes it all so even more
difficult to understand if it's the
speak part of the brain or the
programming part of the brain that's
working so therefore there's a lot of
research out there but everything says
either or and nothing is kind of
conclusive in that sense so I started
thinking how am I am so terrible at this
I hadn't really encountered any subjects
that you're not able to go home study
and then do a test and then kind of do
better at it because programming just
sex you out in the world and like okay
do this you're supposed to work and then
if you don't really know how to set off
yourself there's nothing really you can
do about it and so as I was I don't
really understand why I was sitting in
class and trying to say hello to the
world and I still felt like so stupid so
I wanted to ask you guys by a pro hands
you probably own a lot of program yes do
you know more than one programming
language yes do you speak more than one
language more than two three so okay
this makes me feel even more stupid so I
was thinking about learning a
programming language and there are
several aspects to take into account and
there are several languages and they
have all certain level to the
like I mentioned C++ wasn't probably the
best want to set out with and there are
assembly languages and whether you uses
natural languages or math notation so
everything is kind of very different but
kind of has the same purpose in certain
functions so programming language is put
together by logic and action structure
which makes it have more in common with
math than human language as I mentioned
so tests that show verbal and math still
show that math is more related to
programming and then human language
which is okay like I understand that
part then we can say that the people
that want programming to be a part of
the language curriculum are kind of
wrong but the fact that I know how to do
all my match my engineering my physics
and don't know how to translate those
into programming kind of makes me feel
even more so there's a specific brain
area that's assigned to assisted speech
understanding and there's a specific
area that's for production in human
language is put together by speech
industry and then invented this 2000
years ago you also have reading and
writing but the speech and listening was
like the basic ones so until there are
four language skills reading writing
listening and speaking and by knowing a
language you know and what social and
cultural context context you need to use
them in which makes it sound even more
complicated than actually learning how
to program because programming is fairly
simple it has a yes or no false or true
answer and you can also find those
answers by debugging decided to make a
list regarding programming in human
language to see if i could find out
where the error was regarding myself and
then why i'm so bad a programming so the
human language is the expression of
human thoughts and human thoughts can be
encoded and structured as a sequence of
symbols which can then be transferred
into programming that
make specific actions to specific
machines or systems so the cognitive
aspect of learning programming language
might be similar to the cognitive effect
of learning spoken language so there is
like I said earlier there's all these
pros and cons of am I using this side of
the brain to learn a language or this
side of the brain to use my math skills
to learn programming or are they both
kind of using each other and being
connected when you're trying to learn
programming in specific so I made up a
lesson this is very short I the
similarities are very few so there are
more differences or similarities when
learning a programming language compared
to learning a human language and
vocabulary and syntax is we're kind of
the similarities end and the human
language also lasts longer as we've seen
programming language are continuously
updated and I don't know how many people
even use C++ anymore because there's
other platforms I can perform st. task
even easier and computers and code are
literal emotionless strict and free of
nuance and ambiguity comparing learning
code to speaking a language is like
comparing how to read and compose a
how-to manual and composing to do how to
manual or reading you can do that fairly
early in the stage of learning a
language but the part about speaking and
stinking comes way later and human
languages has a basis in emotion history
and cultural differences and the
receiver and speaker might have
different perceptions of the same
composition which doesn't really happen
in computer languages because like I
said there's a true-and-false what
setting up and Google Translate is the
perfect example of how computers and
human humans interpret the same thing
differently I have an example here
it says will justin fever ever hit
puberty and it's translated into the
innings and then what in fact it means
just the world average puberty so the
fact that humans are the people behind
these translations show that using a
program for language can't be as
effective as using people because
there's a computer sitting and doing
this and they have all these codes but
they don't take into account the syntax
and the actual grammar and setup of the
language into individually so what are
the pros or cons of learning either i
actually just think they're pros to
learning either or both and the con
would only be in my taste that i don't
feel like you can do it and program is
can be looked at as the universal and do
a little common language because it's
the same if you go to Russia or if you
go to the US or if you go to South
Africa and they're all based on the same
Roman letters most of them and it should
be so based on all this information it
should be easier to know learn how to
program then to learn a new human
language due to the simplicity and we
should really encourage both in terms of
especially schools and the education
system and I think that's also one of
the things that we've been doing wrong
all the time is that my schools in
Norway have taught us to learn languages
from a very early stage but the
programming and all that tech stuff
didn't really come until you were way
into your teams so it's kind of too late
for some people with me in the same way
that you say oh I can't learn a language
I'm too old because things get harder as
older you get and so there are some
benefits to being multilingual it just
in the same case as programming and
human languages so multilingual skills
include being better at multitask
detecting errors remembering lists of
sequences spotting misleading data and
etc and all these abilities are actually
required we're trying to learn how to
program which is very interesting to
look at so bilingual people perform
faster than monolingual people at
Tassili require executive control
meaning their ability to pay attention
to important information rather than
irrelevant information and here's
another evidence that kind of works to
my favor but doesn't really explain why
I wasn't able to master c++ the fact
that I'm able to speak several languages
should give me the benefits of a
multilingual skills but still not so I
started thinking again she's the fact
that I know several languages worked in
my favor or maybe against my favor and
there are other factors that seem to
play into account when looking at the
surroundings in which I was in when
learning needs a programming language
one of the fact was that I a woman I
know we're not supposed to talk about oh
I'm a woman for me I can't learn how to
program but we were 25 people in my
class and we were two girls all the guys
just ran off programming their hair
hearts out and me and the other girl
we're just standing there like I don't
understand this I don't understand the
way of thinking the the logic behind it
so I started thinking well maybe there's
a difference in the way the brain is
wired in terms of men and women and we
all know that there are differences but
I wasn't sure if there was a difference
regarding learning how to program so I
set out to find out if that might be the
reason and here's a little example yeah
try again to clean but my cleavage is
just so distracting I can't code because
my long eyelashes make it hard to see
the stream I mean I get lost in them
plus it's hard to keep my eyes open with
these auburn strands of Manx constantly
laying them down this is not how I felt
but this is sometimes how you how people
can interpret the way when I talk about
difference between men and women and
programs when I look into it there are
differences in the way our brain works
in terms of men and female males tend to
have a larger IPL than females and this
is the area of the brain that is thought
to influence mathematically abilities
the frontal and temporal areas of the
cortex are larger in females and males
and these brain areas are thought to
influence language skills so women
essentially are more prone to be able to
learn languages and men are more prone
to be able to learn programming based on
mathematical skills of course this is
not a black-white thing because I know a
whole lot of women that know it's how to
program and they're sitting on right
here and so you're very special to let
me just say that the first grade so
you're defying my whole reason here I'm
just kidding all mountain men tends to
be slider better at math than pml do
standardized intelligence tests show
that knows there's no statistically
significant difference between males and
females so again I'm like mom I don't
really understand why this is happening
to me maybe I'm not stupid maybe my bae
a brain is just wired differently
different harder or at the same time
which one should get more attention like
the left brain or the right brain in my
case working both with maps and
languages at the same time saying that i
also i was studying in denmark so my
whole course on curriculum was in
english and danish so nothing was
my mother tongue which also makes it you
have to do a little bit more of an
effort to think in a different language
I guess so if programming is easier for
someone that speaks English I have no
idea but for me I have to kind of revert
the brain and the thought process a
little bit in order to have the same
abilities in your region as in English
and as we see the world that is getting
smaller and smaller in the sense that we
travel more and we do more business
across borders and we're able to
communicate across borders English has
become one of the languages that's kind
of everyone speaks even my grandmother
speaks English so which makes me wonder
why I would need to or people in the
future we need to learn more foreign
languages and rather just to learn how
to program and then we could make
systems like Google Translate even more
smarter and then we could just use apps
and systems that can translate for us so
we could just speak in another tongue so
that's kind of like I've accepted the
fact that I can't program but then I
look into what possibilities there are
surrounding that so in the development
of learning a language there are several
new products out there trying to solve
the barriers of language across borders
and people have started to use
programming to achieve the same goals
and break the same barriers as we think
that language do today so it take for
example and there's a new product called
pilot from Waverly laps using coding and
programming to solve problems of knowing
a new foreign language I came up with
the idea for a translator
when I'm at a French girl hello d put a
few hear me son oh hey put it here comes
down yeah okay can you hear me French do
you homey little house often I hear you
talk too much but it's awesome but how
you do it this is a wearable use a
translation technology to allow two
people to speak different languages but
still clearly understand each other it's
the dream you know a life untethered
free of language barriers it's just that
it's no longer dream anymore it's real
oh so that made me say so because you
can clearly hear that it's a computer
talking and it's it happen lacks emotion
in lex humor it lacks art as if it
doesn't really understand the history
and culture of a language that I
explained earlier that you need to know
in order to learn and know a foreign
language so in if the future is set in
computers and cold first of all I
wouldn't make it and second of all why
do we need to learn the different
languages at all and and why are we not
offering coding as an alternative or
additive to foreign language I'm not
saying it should be the same thing
because based on research it's not but
we should offer it sooner than based on
the fact that i'm studying engineering
or physics or math later on in life
because i think this is such an
important thing in the future that our
kids need to learn it regardless of what
their setup study as their masters or
bachelors and would we need more than
one language i think so i'm going to dig
into that a little bit should we focus
on learning both programming in foreign
languages and then using them for their
individual purposes so talk less and
write more which seems to be the trend a
thermal
it with the future like that in terms of
using the these machines that translate
for you or google translate I think we
would have a situation of a constant
autocorrect I'll show you an example
later a wonderful earning a foreign
language can be not be necessary when we
can communicate with products like these
but when thinking about it the computers
connected translate like I said but it
can't make you understand or feel or or
be in the history of Russia or China
like a person that can tell you about
the story and feel feelings so even
though we're constantly using more apps
and programs and devices than ever we're
still talking to each other and
communicating the old-fashioned way and
it's a basic human necessity to talk
together to laugh together to be
together and no machine a translator can
replicate that and we'll still need a
spoken language and need to change the
need to communicate even though we're
learning leaning towards data support
communication systems and these systems
like I said they're not able to
understand ambiguity sarcasm and humor
and if we're only relying on these
systems Justin Bieber will never hit
puberty and these guys break up because
of an autocorrect it's pretty funny the
internet is full of them and all these
information the fact that ok we need
programming is very similar to mask but
we should also have our languages which
are also learn foreign languages kind of
makes me end up here anyway in reality i
found up I'm not really stupid in the
sense that I'm not able to learn
programming it's just I'm more leaning
towards lazy or in a hurry because when
we learn programming we had one course
for one semester and they kind of
us to sit down and make a whole sentence
in Mandarin that was how it felt for me
after a couple of weeks and i think the
requirements and the learning path of a
programming language should actually be
comparable to learn in an axial language
because we need to stimulate the same
type of brain activity as well as the
math part of your brain to work together
and I put it if I put in the same effort
as learning a language as i did in
programming i would probably be able to
do c++ looking back I would probably
wanted to learn a different language
maybe Java or something else that would
be more useful at the moment and I said
I would definitely be more it would be
more beneficial to me to have picked up
a programming language way earlier in
life I don't know how early you guys
started programming teens 20s 30s 10
yeah yeah so that's that's what I'm
saying the earlier you start the easier
it becomes later in life and that's how
was the exactly the same for me with
languages I started very very early
speaking English and then it kind of
just gets easier and easier because a
lot of languages have the same setup the
same structure and so on and I guess
that's very comparable to a programming
language and learning that as well and
to sum up in the words of mr. stark I
kind of want both and we need both and
computer language is more stem than
speech and should be treated as such so
like they're doing in the US or because
they're treating programming language
like it is foreign language I don't
think that's correct at all but I do
believe it should be incorporated way
earlier than a foreign language and
research implies guys being more prone
to programming than girls
the end girls towards language but they
don't eliminate each other which we have
a perfect example of here today and we
should use computer language to teach me
really meaningful abstractions and human
language to teach deeper communication
we don't spend as much time on learning
programming language as we do a foreign
language as I said and which is why it
doesn't come as natural and personally I
just need to be more patient and I think
I need someone else that is patient to
teach me to be patient when programming
and it's I'd also need to rewire my
brain to think that it's not just
learning a new language but it's setting
all these logic and math annotations
into a context that is completely new
and I wanted to do like I wanted to have
like a conversation for such a small
group I wanted to hear what you guys
have experienced because I don't have
all the answers this is just my personal
experience and it's given me a bit more
understanding of how languages and
program languages work and what I can do
better to learn better and I'd actually
like to hear about your extension on how
to learn and programming if you did it
in school did you do it on your own and
what what what are your thoughts on
which one is more difficult because you
all speak several languages and more
than one programming language so if you
guys are open to this discussion
yeah so so I that's a completely
different side of the brain so I started
looking into after I found out that
programming was more directed to stem
and the abilities or surrounding that I
kind of went away from the other
abilities which is also why I kind of
don't connect it to foreign language
abilities even though they're very close
in the brain situation exactly so it's
not black and white at all so this is
this is more of a talk to get an
overview of how we learn programming and
how it can be compared to different
learning settings and that we encounter
in life because most of us do encounter
learning a different language but not
all the counter learning a programming
language but very interesting thought
nice did you all learn programming in
school or at home Union
and I wasn't mandatory or was it elected
Lance or so in engineering fuller yeah
so that's what i'm thinking is law which
is a corporate programming a part of the
STEM education way earlier so when I
have science in eighth grade I should be
able to actually learn how to do simple
coding as well because I think that's
equally important to knowing what type
of volcanoes erupt from where in Iceland
yeah
and
exactly towards that Panthers
exactly
yeah and there's also there's very
little research done on these two topics
because programming is in that setting
it's fairly new in terms of setting into
systems and education systems or
comparing it to learning other different
learning of things I actually saw
someone proposing that they wanted to do
research on if people who have a stroke
and lose the ability to speak or a
language with that same thing happen for
a person that's able to code and that
would have been very very interesting to
see if that actually happens but that it
doesn't exist yet I think the generation
where we can actually do the testing is
kind of evolving at the moment and I
think more research like this will come
eventually what that will be very
interesting to see
yep
yeah so there's I haven't we actually
take a course that Facebook's are we
drew learning courses and there's one
called bias which is exactly where
you're talking about and you come into a
situation with already a history or
baggage or an opinion of your own which
might not be the reality at all and
that's why I wanted to also specify the
fact that I I said that where we were
two guards and we weren't able to do
this and then oh maybe that's the reason
and I know for fact when I looked into
the data that's not the reason it's just
a coincidence yes so that's what we did
and I work we do these tests and then we
go into the room and then we discuss
this is the results of the test and it's
very very easy to say you do these tests
based on appearance male female 8 sex
their sex mess email and sometimes you
end up having results for your life what
I didn't know that I would vie for this
or that i recommend everyone do that
it's very interesting and very thing
that you bring it up because it's
especially in things like this that is
embedded in personal experience you're
bound to have biases and I completely
agree
if it's harder to Marilyn so that's what
i'm thinking is is the fact because yes
i know because some of the abilities
that you do use is it is anchored in the
language center but it's also not so but
the fact that you learn math is that the
earlier you learn math looking the
better you will be at it continuously so
as I said there's no research that's
been done in this on it before year old
can do programming better if they start
earlier but my personal belief is yes
because it just makes sense that you
need neuro cords would just be stronger
if you start earlier the other thing
that is cute also curious tonight is a
wonder you know they say that learning
the language is good for maintaining the
health of your brain actually as you get
older or 1947 sounds good interested in
that yeah I wonder if that's true for
computer languages as well a bit curious
yeah that would be interesting and I
think we're at arrow now where where
people are prone to be exposed because
their parents have been exposed to
programming and like my family didn't
have a computer when I was under so I
wasn't able to learn programming when I
was bored I wasn't really a possibility
but I think now as computers evolved and
we evolved and the computer languages
of all I think there's a higher chance
of being able to learn at an earlier
stage and then being better at it at a
legacy look I mean I could talk to you a
lot a lot more about this because I've
actually got a psychology background I'm
and I did a lot of Science degree but i
also have been on a story like that yes
any kind of an interesting combination
it was a whole lot of other stuff around
and how we make meaning of the world and
how we as kind of little autonomous
creatures orientates all the data that
were constantly processing in the world
and i'm so for instance there's this
this idea around and we've got different
systems that are constantly working
essentially to keep ourselves safe from
the world so if I'm you know if I feel
I'm the under threat or I'm perceiving
something that could be a threat to me
then a different type of system would
start to emerge terribly and and that's
not just within me but that's also
within my social context so for instance
it might you know in your in your family
of origin or in your in your community
it maybe it was more appropriate to be
able to speak to speak well or to listen
well then it was just sitting in a quiet
room you know reading books are writing
mathematical equation does not like
there's a lot of complexity under the
surface around it Athene anything is a
very very complex and i'm also the only
engineer in my family so that's also
didn't really set me up for success in
terms of starting early especially with
programming and i didn't get my own
computer until i was in high school so
look I think what I think as we go
further into evolution in terms of
computers I think there's a higher
chance of that being a part of our
evolution like I would teach my kids to
program earlier or to learn from someone
else the program because I see it being
very important in terms of
cognitive abilities later in life yes
and also i'm wondering if you had some
sort of a feedback loop going on around
people's clothes casitas book is not the
easiest of languages to learn you know
you're given you're given a lot of power
but you're also giving a lot of
responsibility exactly so I i was able
to make the program basically at the end
it worked we got it on to the
microcontroller and the strain gauge
worth and it showed kilograms and grams
and Kroners but I would never have been
able to do without the help of some of
my friends but Wednesday's was the
problem is that once they actually help
me start writing something I understand
it but starting out from scratch for me
is like like I said it's like trying to
order something and Mandarin from a
menya definitely trying like you don't
really know where to start and you don't
have the basics to understand where to
start either I see I don't know what the
way that we learned it was wrong or that
my brain was really because we all learn
in different ways so maybe there's more
ways to learning a programming language
that actually just like sitting in front
of computer and then trying to come up
with something smart I don't know you
guys probably have more experience with
that fan I do but my perception of it is
also that it's more of a try and fail
and then kind of just learning by doing
oh yeah did you missed the very start of
your your presentation did you say that
you were good at math and logic yeah you
were so that's why this doesn't really
make sense so that was the basis of my
of me selecting to become an engineer
but it was I did advanced physics math
and English yeah
well we haven't talked afterwards do you
want to thank you guys for coming I know
it was probably a bit low key and that
was kind of my intention as well I just
wanted to kind of how to set a new study
and a context around and learning how to
program because I know all you guys do
it and take it reddit opposes do and
you're really amazing that you you're
actually able to do it which is about
that so thank you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
