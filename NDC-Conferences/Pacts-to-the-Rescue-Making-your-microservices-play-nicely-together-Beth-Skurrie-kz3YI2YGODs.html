my name is Beth I am a developer I work
at dears a consulting company based in
Melbourne and Sydney and I'm here today
to talk to you about pact which is a
testing tool that can transform your
testing process and it's based on some
experiences that my colleagues and I had
at at real estate real estate condo a
year or RA is it's also known where I
was working for about 18 months
JB Rheinsberg gives a talk which opens
with the following provocative statement
that I love integrated tests they're a
scam a self-replicating virus that
threatens the very health of your code
base your sanity and I'm not
exaggerating when I say your life so why
are integrated tests so hated well
they're slow meaning we run them less
often and that means we don't get as
good feedback on our design and you end
up with this many-to-many relationship
between your code and your tests and
that means when an integrated test fails
it's not immediately obvious which line
of code has caused that failure and
because of that many to many
relationship when one test fails it's
likely that twenty other tests are going
to fail along with it and the real
killer is that if you use integrated
tests to check the basic correctness of
your code the number of tests that you
need actually scales combinatorially so
for example if you had three classes
with four code paths inch you'd actually
need 64 tests to cover each line of your
code and nobody wants to write 64 tests
everybody has that amount of time so
we've all had that day where we've been
trawling through our code trying to work
out what's made all our integration
tests suddenly seem to fail at once
for no apparent reason so why do we
still use these integrated tests well
it's because we've also all had that day
where we had over new feature to our
tester and we're feeling pretty smug
because we've used TDD and we know we've
got a hundred percent unit test coverage
and the tester brings up this new page
and they get a big fat 500 error and you
look at the tester as if to say well
that's not my problem on my tester Green
it's your problem
but yeah humor them anyway because it's
your job and then you look through the
logs and you discover there's a record
not found exception and you think oh
that's strange because I know I wrote
the test for when the record was not
found and it should behave nicely but
then you dig deeper and you realize that
you did write that test but you wrote it
and you stubbed the code where the
record has not found to return nil and
in actual life it actually throws an
exception so you think to yourself if
I'd if I'd written an integrated test I
would have caught that bug so now you
have a dilemma if you don't use
integrated tests you can miss these sort
of bugs perhaps even let them go through
to production but if you do use
integrated tests you mentioned
introduced this slow complex burnin some
load into your code base so the question
now is is there another way to find
these errors and the answer luckily
enough is yes and it's called achieving
test symmetry the test symmetry is a way
of checking that the assumptions that we
make when we're studying our code are
actually correct and it works like this
we have two classes a and B and in our
test for a we use a mock B and why do we
use a mock using mock because it helps
us avoid the combinatorial explosion
that I mentioned before in our test but
a we check that a makes the right calls
to B and that it can handle the
responses we expect back from being
this is not life-changing this is what
we do all the time this is what we call
the collaboration test what we miss
though is the other part of this diagram
you can see this diagram is not
symmetrical what we miss are called the
contract tests there's the test that
make sure that B actually responds to
the colds we think it should and most
importantly returns the thing that we
think it should now if we could ensure
this test symmetry was was correct we
wouldn't have any problems but the
problem with mocks
is that they're based on our assumptions
and sometimes our assumptions are wrong
or sometimes they start right and they
become wrong and we don't know about it
sometimes until it's too late
if we could just ensure this this test
symmetry we wouldn't need these messy
integrated tests and we'd live in this
beautiful symmetrical world of rainbows
and unicorns and Happiness so why why
aren't we already living in this world
of rainbows and happiness and unicorns
that's because achieving test symmetry
is hard because there's no automated
tools to do it for us it relies on the
eternal vigilance of the developer which
just like rails does not scale oh that's
good Drake has never worked in Sydney
before it's a Melbourne specific joke so
even the type system doesn't always help
us and and there's just there's nothing
that will look through your code and say
well I can see you've you've stubbed be
over here to return this thing and
you've actually you know mismatch that
over here if you've missed that test
so I post this question to my colleagues
at dears and said does anybody else know
of any tools that can help us achieve
this and there was a whole lot of
silence and then my work mate Ron he was
working on a real estate bill condon au
at that time
said that actually where he was working
they were trying a new tool that did
something very similar to this just as a
bit of background real estate comdata
you has a website that hundreds of
thousands of people use every day and
they've grown really quickly to meet
that demand so it's not surprising that
I have their fair share of monolithic
software which we just used to call
software but now we have a name for it
now that's not to say that all
monolithic software is bad but this was
the the bad type of monolithic software
that was really tightly coupled to all
the other pivotal systems in the company
and you're afraid to touch something
over here because of the effect that it
might have in some completely unrelated
system all the way over here so in an
effort to get away from this
anti-pattern REO started writing small
single purpose services that we now call
micro services now micro services are
really good because they help take your
code and break it down into small
manageable chunks that are easy to
understand and maintain change and even
throw out but the downside of micro
services is that you're increasing the
number of integration points and when
you increase the number of integration
points you increase the number of
integration tests and if integration
testing within a code base is painful
then integration testing between
services is even more painful those
tests are slower and brittle and lengthy
they can take hours sometimes and
they're causing a lot of pain so let me
walk you through a couple of solutions
that they tried that didn't work so well
so they started with having one
integration test environment and that
was the gateway to production so they
had copies of all the the monoliths and
then copies of all these services and
now try and deploy everything in
witches and test everything together
before they release everything and the
problem with having one environment it's
a gateway to production as when you have
a whole heap of services and changes
trying to get through that gateway it
becomes a bottleneck and when you have
really tight coupling between your
services and you're uncertain of the
effects of changes it makes you very
overprotective and you try and test
everything to the enth degree before
releasing and that makes you release
cycles slow and then if you do find a
bug it's slow to fix it so that really
wasn't working so well for them around
about the time that micro services
started becoming a thing and kind of
connected to it
REO started using AWS so the logic went
that if having one gateway test
environment was not working let's try
giving each service its own test
environment and running integration
tests across each of those environments
that kind of worked ok for the new
services which all had automated deploy
scripts but they still needed those
copies of those old monoliths and those
weren't automated the deploys weren't
automated the maintenance wasn't
automated so had to be hand maintained
so this approach was tried for about
three months and there there was a lot
of failures there are a lot of false
positives and only one proper bug was
actually detected so generally speaking
system integration tests are fraught
with problems they scale really badly
there's lots of setup you might need
expensive infrastructure there's a lot
of false negatives the bugs are hard to
fix because it's hard to work out
exactly what part of your system has
failed and they're really slow let's
come back to this tool that Ron was
talking about there were trialing
so this is why I'm a developer because
this is the extent of my graphic skills
now packed packed is the tool that he
was talking about and it was written by
some pretty smart people at REI and
there's now an open-source library and
is based on the concept of
consumer-driven contracts now when we're
designing a consumer and provider pair
of services we often start with a
provider or maybe some data in a
database we go well what's the easiest
way I can get that data out of that
database and into a HTTP response and
often we just end up expressing a
database model which is not the best way
to do it so consumer driven contracts
turns that around and starts by asking
me the consumer how do I want to consume
this data what format makes sense what
requests make sense to me
and then we go over and make sure the
provider conforms to our wishes so
packed users consumer driven contracts
to automatically enforce test symmetry
between the two services and this is how
it works we have service and service B
this diagram probably looks familiar but
in the consumer-driven contract well we
call this the consumer and the provider
and the we write test for the consumer
using a mock provider that the packed
library provides and then we check that
a consumer makes the request that we
think it should to the provider and we
check that it can handle all the
responses we get back from the provider
now at this stage this is where packed
is different from just normal HTTP mock
software because while we're running
those tests in the consumer it's taking
those requests and our expected
responses and it's writing them to a
contract file this is what we called the
Pat
and the second step of this process is
we take that packed file over to the
provider and we replay the requests
against the provider and we look at the
responses that come back and we compare
them to our expected responses and if
they match then we know that our real
provider is behaving the same way that
our mock provider did and then we can be
pretty confident that in real life and
our consumer in a provider are actually
going to talk together correctly so
unlike those integration tests that we
talked about earlier contracts are fast
they're more stable the easier to debug
and the more reliable if you write them
currently they'll scale linearly not
combinatorially and there's a much lower
set up and you don't actually need any
extra expensive infrastructure because
you can run these tests on your local
machine or on your CI build contracts
allow you to develop with agility and
avoid traditional versioning systems and
you're able to do this because the
provider knows it's consumers and it
knows that the all the expectations that
the consumers have of it so you will
know before you commit changes to your
provider or consumer whether or not
you're going to work correctly with the
other service in your pair this means
that you don't have to wait for a
lengthy build cycle to discover bugs you
know before you commit so you're not
even checking in bugs and because you're
designing with consumer driven contracts
you're writing a better API because
you're starting with a real-world
example now if you're anything like me
you don't really get the concept until
you've seen a great example this stage
you have to make a bit of an apology
because I'm from Melbourne and we love
our Ruby in Melbourne and I didn't
realize until I saw the agenda for NDC
Sydney but there's a lot of Microsoft
people here a lot of JavaScript people
but not so many
Rubi people it would seem but I'm the
first person to admit that ruby has 99
problems but lack of readability is not
one so I'm pretty sure you're gonna be
out of follow along with me here all
right every good test has three parts a
range act in assert so this is the part
we arranged we're setting up our world
so we're going to declare that we have a
service consumer and it's going to be
called the zoo app and we're going to
write a pact with an animal service and
we're going to run a mock service on
port one two three four
next we need to set up our expectations
on that mock service so that it will
behave like we think the real service is
going to behave so we're saying here the
animal service given that there is an
alligator named Mary now this is what we
call a provider state and I'll explain
why we need this later the animal
service upon receiving a request for an
alligator with a get request to path
alligators Mary will respond with and we
expect a JSON document with our
alligator Mary and we expected to be a
200 response
next we need to do the act and assert
parts of our test so when we run our
animal service client this is the class
that we're writing to interact with that
animal service we expect find alligator
by name Mary to return us a an alligator
object with the name Mary then while
we're running that test our mock server
is writing our packed file for us so
it's just basic Jason you can see we've
got our provider and consumer names
there and we've got a list of our
interactions so you can see that um code
that we have now been turned into Jason
we've got our description of our request
a provider state and our actual request
and the response we expect so that's the
first half that's the collaboration test
now we need to run the contract tests so
we pop into the provider project and we
do the reverse of that configuration
that we did at the start we say the
service provider the animal service will
honor a pact with the zoo app and we
give it a URL where it can access that
pact file
next we need to set up the test data now
this is a really important step remember
I said we had a thing called a provider
state that I will explain later
now this is where we use that provider
state back in a consumer project we
assumed that there would be an animal
service sorry an alligator named Mary
now this stage we need to write a bit of
code that when it sees that there is an
alligator named Mary will insert an
alligator named Mary into our database
and our provider because if we just
replayed a request for an alligator
named Mary without setting up any data
we'd get a 404 and under 200
so we declare our provider state there's
an alligator named Mary and we insert a
alligator into our database and then we
run our replay all our requests and look
at the responses cut that come back and
of course because we're doing TDD or
test verse we and we get some failures
but then we red green refactor and
until we get to this nice beautiful
green state where we're running our
verification tests and they're all green
and that the text that we use when we're
setting up the test in our consumer is
used to create this really nice output
in our provider verifications so you can
see it reads quite nicely given there is
an alligator named Mary a request for an
alligator returns a response which has a
200 matching buddy Bubba so this test
here when it is green tells us that our
real provider behaves the same way that
our mock provider did so it stops that
drifting mock problem that we talked
about early now let me talk about
sharing contract
so consuming our provider because we're
writing micro-services are in different
projects different code bases different
repos we need to get the contract
somehow from the consumer to the
provider there's a few different ways we
could do this we could push the contract
from the consumer build straight into
the repo of the provider and we could
use build artifacts there's actually
another tool that's been written
specifically to solve this problem and
it comes along with some extra benefits
now this tool is called the pact broker
and it's a central point for sharing
pacts now the benefits of using the pact
broker when you use the same pact broker
for all the services in a given context
is that you can start to mind the data
that is in those contracts in the pact
broker to provide some really useful
information because one of the the dirty
secrets of microservices is that you
can't really kill complexity when you're
writing micro services yes you're
breaking your your code down into small
and manageable chunks but then you're
actually increasing the complexity of
the interactions between them and unless
you have automated tools to help you
manage that complexity writing more and
more services is actually going to be
more of a burden than a solution so let
me show you an example of some of the
information get out of the pack breaker
so this is a network graph of a heap of
services that were in a context at real
estate comm and there's a fair number of
services that are all quite chatting you
can actually see that service true it
depends on about six other services at
that point you might start to go
something not quite right happening
there
you might you get useful stuff out of
this that shows you where your
dependencies are and what your most-used
services are and the other really useful
things
is this auto-generated documentation so
when you have you know 510
micro-services the developer team can
kind of keep track in the heads of what
each service does but if you like I'm RA
who are now probably about three years
down the track they're micro services
that they'll have hundreds of these
micro services and no one person can
know exactly what everything does so
having this auto-generated documentation
makes it much easier to work out what
each services does with really clear
examples and increases your ability to
reuse a surface because you can see what
they all do and go oh there's no service
that already does what I want
let me have a look through these
examples the other benefit that the PAC
broker gives you is that it allows you
to decouple your releases one of the
aims that people want to achieve when
using micro services is they want to
decouple their releases so that they can
deploy their consumer or deploy their
providers separately without having to
do this lockstep thing we have to deploy
that five different services all at once
now when you're running your standard
packed test you'll be testing your head
consumer against your head provider but
when you deploy a new version of your
consumer to production you actually want
to know whether is compatible with the
production version of the provider and
then if you deploy a new version of your
provider you actually want to know
whether it's compatible with the
production version of the consumer so
having the PAC broker and having these
armed version pacts allows us to
do what I call testing the pact matrix
to make sure that if you deploy one
thing it's compatible with all the other
things as the pack Berkshire has this
ability to tag a pact you can say well
this is the production pact or this is
the the test pact and when you're doing
your verification in your provider you
can say well I want to test myself
against the head pact but I also want to
test myself against the production pact
or the test pact now not all services
communicate via HTTP events driven
services are quite popular and in fact
you can actually do rest without HTTP
which is what we did an another project
that I worked on an RA so we did read an
architecture where we're actually using
batch processes to generate hypermedia
JSON documents that got written to s3
and the consumers of those JSON
documents needed to be sure of what the
contents of those JSON documents were in
just the same way that HTTP consumer
would need to be sure of what comes back
in a response this this process we
called hipster batch and it worked out
really quite well for much larger data
sets than you would want to use in an
HTTP request so we used we use packed
but not in quite the same way when
you're using HTTP you get this really
neat injection point where you can put
your your test and your your
verification but when you're using not a
non HTTP based services you need to find
that injection point yourself but
underlying principles are really the
same so you're a consumer you need a
test to show that it can correctly
handle a given message and the provider
you need to test to show that it
actually creates the message that you
think it will
so we used the Jason matching portion of
pack to do the matching and the tests
but we wrote the and then the path
broker to exchange the contracts but
then we wrote those little bits around
the the verification and the set up
ourselves and it worked really quite
well so you might be wondering now do I
still need these big integration tests
now I've got these fancy contract tests
the answer is it kind of depends on the
organization's risk profile so when
we're deploying when it comes to
releasing software there's this tension
between confidence and responsiveness
narrowing the scope of a test increases
our responsiveness but it can decrease
our confidence and whether or not that
works for your organization is something
that only your team can answer but I'll
walk you through what we did at routines
at real estate comm so we did ditch our
integration test and I was wonderful so
then we took that time that we would
have spent investing in those
integration tests and we put it into
writing much more meaningful business
monitoring so we were able to know when
underlying business processes were
broken this worked because the
developers were the people doing the
releases we had what we used to call
accidental DevOps which was actually
because we ran out of ops people because
it was cool is because it just happened
to be ten but there weren't some really
good benefits to this it means that when
a developer is worried about being woken
up at four o'clock in the afternoon they
write really good monitoring a really
good test so contract tests work on
their best within a DevOps system
because
releasing bugs into production becomes
much less risky when you know that you
can find those bugs and you can fix
those bugs really quickly so like every
tool there are problems that are suited
to that tool and there are problems that
are not suited to that tool
Packt is a tool for consumer-driven
contracts and if your consumer can't
derive the requirements of your provider
then another tool is probably going to
be better for you
Packt is really good for use with
internal api's and it's best when you
have control over both the consumer and
provider so not necessarily that you are
writing both but you are talking to the
provider team you have good interactions
you have good communication happening
between those two teams so when should
you not use pact should not use pact for
public api's because a public API is not
consumer driven in the same way anyway
contracts are lined about quickly and
avoid traditional versioning to achieve
rapid change but this can be done
because the provider knows its consumers
and it knows the expectations they have
of it and the public API is do not know
their consumers stability is the key
rather than release responsiveness and
from a technical point of view when you
run the verification you can't actually
test the API you can't set up data in it
without actually using the API that you
are testing and then you get into the
situation where your you can have test
data leaking over from previous tests
that contaminate your tests and one of
the main features of pact is that you
have complete isolation between your
verifications so never in the situation
where a the success of one test relies
on the success of a previous test
because that ends us up in the
integration test tile that we were
trying to get out of
so because the pack file itself is Jason
its language independence so you can
write a packed library in any language
and we're working on it so we the ruby
one was the first one to be written and
is pretty stable and and quiet feature
complete the JVM and the Scala is the
same the dotnet is pretty early days the
JavaScript one is gaining popularity and
the the newbies on the scene are swift
go and rust and they're all being kept
together by this pack specification
which means that if you generate a
packed file in a consumer then the
matching logic will run the same on any
provider in any other language so this
gives you the confidence that even with
services in different languages they're
all going to work correctly together so
in that summary the traditional
integration test covers many layers of
our system increasing the opportunity
for failure and by breaking our tests up
into small manageable chunks and
enforcing this test symmetry we achieve
more reliable and faster running tests
so packed allows you to combine the
advantages of integrated tests and test
symmetry while mitigating the
shortcomings of each it allows you to
modify components with agility and give
you quick feedback on potential
breakages because you know before you
commit whether you've created about not
after a commit and a 30 minute build
cycle ensures you always have up-to-date
documentation without any overhead and
if you're lucky you can even throw away
your integration tests so pact makes you
microservices play nicely together and
if you would like to know more about
pact you can hit up the
I'm Paige up at dot IO and and there'll
be links to all the implementations the
mailing list you can ping me on Twitter
but don't actually email me on that
email address because I'm actually on
maternity leave at the moment with six
month old twins and I do not check my
working mail very often and but you
might be my Clara grabbed me on Twitter
my name is Beth scary and I would like
to answer any questions you might have
now yeah that's a really good question
and my answer is it depends it depends
really which I that was a really great
sentence that I read and one of Sandi
Metz presentations which said follow
these rules but break them if doing so
will save money and time so we were
writing small enough services that it
was just much easier to use the real
database and I've had I've had intense
conversations about whether we should be
mocking that that that just the Aged the
bit behind the HTTP interface but then
you're going to need to do another test
set of tests to make sure that that
mocking matches up with the and you see
where I'm going so so our services were
small enough that we felt that it was
just easier to insert real data into the
database rather than mocking stuff
however when one of our services did
make have to make calls out to another
service at that stage we thought yeah we
really should be mocking that and then
we would have another set of contract
tests between this service and that
downstream service so they're all kind
of linked in together by a chain
I bet I've got two questions the first
is what's your recommendation on
maintaining the pact files because you
mentioned about the pact broker so what
would be a like architectural model of
having a pact broker in terms of a
separate service or we can just run them
locally on each pipeline um I think it's
easier to have one oh I think it's more
valuable to have one pact broke up
deployment context sorry this is another
discussion we had at our ei which is
should we have one pact broker for the
whole of RA or should we have one per
line of business and it you can't you
have to find that sweet spot based on
your organizational setup and we ended
up having a PAC broker per kind of
largest group so we actually didn't want
we actually didn't want too much chatter
between the services and different
organizations in different parts of the
organization what is it to be chatty
within the little ones that are close to
each other and then the slower
conversations between the the wider area
ones so we kind of had a pact breaker
per context and that that's better than
having like a pact breaker pair of
services because you want to be able to
get that the network diagram are there
to work out what's talking to other
things also the overhead and one thing I
should mention about the pact broker is
that you can get a docker container for
the PAC broker and so their setups
pretty easy now with AWS and my second
questions how do we are scheduled tests
on the consumer and provider side what
two years pact
yep
so there's web hooks on the pact broker
as well so that if you can trigger a
build on your provider from
webhook then you can set that up when
the consumer publishes a pact to the
pact broker it can kick the build off in
the provider otherwise depending on your
radio development we just found
scheduled builds on the provider worked
as well we often found that we were
writing more often than not we were
actually writing both sides so the
