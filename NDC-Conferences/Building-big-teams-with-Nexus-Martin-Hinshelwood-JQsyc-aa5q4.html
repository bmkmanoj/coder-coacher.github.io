professional scrum trainer we scrum the
dark and also
to deal LM MVP which makes me sit in a
little weird world since most process
guys hate the tools guys and most tools
guys hit the price ask aids but I kinda
have to hit and have arguments with
myself and I want to talk a little bit
about building big teams with Nexus has
anybody heard of Nexus to the front
awesome so I want to just clarify what
specifically I want to talk about so
that I want to be very specific I won't
say that scrum well I knew there was
gonna be a lot of engineers so scrum is
just an implementation of the agile
based class sports one team that's
what's comes for one team that's the way
it's designed and there's this thing
called Nexus which inherits from scrum
so it's still just scrum and then adds a
few extra things that we need so we're
really talking about this idea of are
more than two teams and one project
that's pretty key if you've got one team
in many projects you're just in a
painful place there's not a lot of help
so that you get a project manager you
figure it out there's too much going on
you're not going to get focus you're not
going to get good delivery if you've got
many teams and many products you're
probably looking at portfolio management
I'm not going to talk about portfolio
management that's something that does
have to happen but I want to talk about
the kind of engineering side of that so
Nexus sits in the sweet spot of actually
what six plus or minus three
same as team size in scrum so kind of
3-2 to nine teams working together on
one product you can do stuff with more
but that's the bit I want to talk about
just now just to clarify that so a
little bit about me I'm from this little
place to the the north of England just
above England I did not vote for brexit
in case you were wondering
all the groups below the border decided
that it was a good idea to do you know
to get off the terrain which is just
that I don't think it's good regular
idea but there we go that's the politics
out of the way
but luckily most of my customers are not
in the UK most of my customers are kind
of distributed randomly across the world
which is kind of fun
and it's interesting because the work
the world has changed a lot in the last
20 years
anybody know Adam was going to be here
Adam Cogan and he said he was going
through my deck in helping me out he
said you have to have a history section
so that people set the context for
people that don't don't know it but
we've been using this thing for many
years some people call it waterfall
Maurice s sadm depending on what you
learned at university it's been around
for for many years it's always been a
bit of a fallacy and in 1993 scrum came
along the first scrum team was life
critical systems in the Netherlands with
CMMI level 5 that's a long time ago so
it's not another newfangled thing and
then Along Came XP because a lot of
people failed it's delivering with agile
weather whatever flavor implementation
of agile you were using scrum being the
most predominant one we failed at the
engineering practices so XP brought in a
lot of those engineering practices that
are absolutely awesome we need those
things but it just that still didn't
quite get us there so around ILM has
been around for quite a while but the
terms were coined around the early early
2000s Application Lifecycle Management
was talked about a lot my MVP used to be
called an LM MVP I think they're
probably going to call it DevOps at some
point that they've just not changed it
yet our visual studio LM HP ALM all the
products popped up and kind of stole the
term but then it still smacked of this
waterfall thing because LM didn't mean
agile
LM just man you know kind of all the
things that you need to do so this term
DevOps can a came along in 2008 and it's
the agile flavor of LM as it were so
bringing in all the processes and
practices around everything and it
depends who you talk to what DevOps
means to them yeah I think if it is
everything we've got creating ideas all
the way through to delivering software
other people just think of the
engineering piece to get software out
the door but it's really used in all of
those places so it's one of those
co-opted terms but it didn't seem to
help it helps some teams some
organizations but things Cana can it
didn't work out well for many people
because you had a CEO who heard about
this DevOps thing and says to people
let's let's do DevOps and then it's just
supposed to magically magically happen
made my favorite one for that was we
must do unit tests I was in an
organization in the US and the the I had
an argument with the lead developer
about what unit tests meant and she was
absolutely adamant that unit tests meant
pressing f5 and Visual Studio and
clicking through the web app that's a
unit test but the reason that meant that
was because it was very difficult
engineering ways to implement unit tests
for them management wanted unit tests
there for redefine what the thing is so
you can see that you're doing it yeah
that happens a lot with all of these
terms scrum very often as well there's
an interesting report that came out a
few years ago are the case report from
the Standish group in Boston
I can't give you the actual report
because it costs loads and loads of
money but I do get a copy through from
the org which is kind of nice but some
interesting things came out of that
report one was that large teams get much
more benefits from moving to agile than
small teams I thought that was fairly
interesting because most people believe
or the colloquial belief is that idles
great for small groups
people but when you get lots and lots of
people together no you need project
management and you PMA and all of those
things it's not true these guys actually
found an inverse relationship between
volume and PMA which I also thought was
very interesting you're less likely to
deliver value that way customers are
happier if you don't deliver everything
they ask for that's kind of a slap in
the face isn't it because we want to
deliver them everything they asked for
but the reality is that customers are
happiest if you deliver what they need
just know not everything they asked for
three years ago when you when they came
up with the idea for the project so
that's that was pretty interesting and
it it's clear that waterfall doesn't
scale it doesn't scale to large teams
depending on what large teams means for
you large teams for Richard here means
80 teams working on one product in what
twelve locations in nine different
countries and that's a large team but
when they say large teams they actually
mean more than 50 if you get more than
50 people working on one product you sit
in their large category so that's the
six hundred percent potential
improvement and something fairly
interesting that to us I think if you're
a developer conference this will be
fairly obvious to you that skill skilled
teams are more than 200 percent more
likely to succeed than unskilled teams I
have attended no-brainer for us but it's
quite a revelation for for management
especially when you think about
Taylorism and traditional management
where you know you're all replaceable
cogs and if we you know we burn our
developers we can just get more
developers it doesn't actually work that
way we know that but it's kind of a
relative revelation so I want to cover a
few things I want to talk about why
other scaling frameworks have failed
most scaling frameworks deliver in some
cases and don't deliver in other cases
so kind of why why why is that was the
rationale behind that and then I want I
want to be able to use scrum to scale
scrum because we know scrum works scrum
does work if you go and look at
organizations who are implementing scrum
well they are doing well
delivering software on the 1:1 team
basis so how do we take that benefit and
scale it up a little bit more and then I
want to talk about some complementary
practices that you need around both
teams and work that are kind of critical
to that discussion at scale so they're
very specific to scale you can use them
on the small scale as well but they're
very specific to scale and then just you
know I run through of what types of
Nexus can I go together and what does it
provide us so why haven't they failed
well there's this little thing called
culture that we have in organizations
and every organization has a different
culture and you can I I had this
conversation with somebody it was
actually agile in Africa and we were
talking about that you can't change
culture culture is a shadow of the way
you do things in your organization so
you don't change culture if you try and
tackle culture you're always going to
fail change the way you do things and
culture will follow that's what you
focus on so I've got a little thing for
you here so let's say I have this access
of people orientated on the last all the
way over to company orientated on the
right think about where your company
might sit on that line is your company
more corporate or is it more people you
know far on the Left might be Netflix
and maybe Spotify probably sit over
there far on the right most banks not
all banks but most banks sit far on the
right you thought about where you are
okay
what about if I draw this access
innovation at the bottom all the way
through to kind of reality orientated
we're dealing with what is happening
just now versus thinking about what's
going to happen in the future at the
bottom where does your organization sit
do you do more R&amp;amp;D in thinking about the
future or on a day to day basis do you
spend more time well potentially
fighting fires and but working in the in
in the know you thought about where you
said cool okay so if I put those two
together we actually came up with this
interesting model that's called the
Snyder model I don't really care about
the model I'm using it for illustrative
purposes but we have four quadrants and
the top rate is we succeed by getting
and keeping control that is the belief
in that top right hand quadrant so
that's about are their power
predictability all of those things boil
down to this control world and you're
never at a hundred percent control but
you're you may fit somewhere in that in
that in that section if you if you
thought you were actuality and
impersonal in your organization at the
bottom right we've got we succeeded by
being the best and a lot of
organizations that that's their mantra
and that's about craftsmanship and
professionalism and achieving as
individuals
that's competence we are competent of
what we do now you're never going to be
a hundred percent in any of these
categories but you get the idea we
succeed by working together that's the
collaborative but partnership in people
and our last one is we succeed by
growing people who fulfill our vision
somebody like Netflix is down here they
don't they don't think about anything
other than their people in order to grow
that vision and it's about creativity
dedication having faith in your people
that they will do the right thing and do
those things so where did you guys sit
on this graph was it here a couple
people going yet well you think about
yes I'm in control I'm thinking about
that exact spot that exact percentage of
competence control collaboration and
cultivation I bet you were somewhere
else on that picture you might have been
all the way up in the top right in
control yeah or you may have had a
little bit more control and less
collaboration in your organization you
might have been all the way over in
collaboration my point is that every
single company is different
every company culture is different and
nobody nor two companies are in the same
place does that make sense
so if you're going to go on a journey
and change where are you going to go are
you going to go here is that where your
company wants to go they want to move
towards collaboration and are you going
to get there in a straight line no it's
never going to happen you're never going
to get there in a straight line that's
unicorns and rainbows and fuzzy things
and even having an idea of where you're
going to go we want to get to that exact
spot is irrational as well you're not
going to get there what's going to
happen is you're going to figure out
what you're going to do next to get
towards your goal or where you would
like to get to you'll take a step
reassess where you are and figure out
your next step so you end up with more
of our meandering journey and you end up
where you end up you might not end up
where you expect to end up does that
make sense for everybody yeah can it
make sense because everything's
different we know our people are
different we know all of those things
are different so what we'd like to do is
have some kind of framework instead of
having a methodology that defines how we
should do everything I don't know if
there any safe talks that the the
conference I don't think so but if
you've looked at the safe diagram it's
this massive diagram that has a job for
everybody that's not what we want to do
that might be what you end up with at
the end of your journey because that's
what your organization and that's what
your culture wants okay but I don't want
to force you to use particular practices
you need to choose which practices are
best to you for you but something is
very important and I'm going to be very
adamant about this if you don't have to
scale don't heal
is a very expensive prospect hugely
expensive unless you have to do it don't
because would you expect if I add two
teams I get twice as much work done
twice as much value delivered to my
product what about three or four or five
teams am I going to get five times as
much value delivered in my product with
five teams as with one I think you'll
find it's not really a linear
progression if you actually tried to do
it and you know you can end up more the
point of diminishing returns and in some
organizations they end up having a worse
effect of adding more teams because
things get too complicated you end up in
chaos so we're delivering less so before
you scale there's three things that you
want to make sure that you do before you
scale whatever process you pick whatever
framework you pick do it well so I would
say do scrum well be able to follow the
rules understand why they're all there
and follow them okay step two enhance
your team's focus on both people and
engineering practices that they need to
be awesome we're going to need all of
those things we're going to need
automation we're going to need a
leadership these are both just as
important on our teams and the third
step is have some kind of guiding values
for your organization so that we don't
do the wrong thing these are the scrum
values they were added to the scrum
guide last year July 2016 they were
implied in the scrum guide but they
weren't physically in it and they
decided to add them and they're in the
second paragraph now just to make sure
that everybody knows they're there so we
take those three things mechanical scrum
we're following the rules technical
excellence in doing our job and figuring
out how to do it well and values and
principles and we put them together and
we can see we're professional scrum
teams
rather than just amateur scrum teams or
Cowboys or whatever it is that that that
you have right now and most teams that
in most organizations that I go into are
not professional teams the end up
setting in that amateur category but I
would caveat that to say that I don't go
into organizations that are doing
awesome because they don't generally
call me yeah so I have a very jaded look
at what organizations are doing and
something that you should have highly
recommended read is Jeff's book twice
the features and half the time he talks
about what it takes to take a team and
deliver more value you know I meant that
team two into a high-performing team
that can deliver lots of value because
the reality is that the only foundation
for scale is professional teams you
can't scale with amateurs if you take
five amateur teams and put them together
you're just going to get a bigger mass
than you had to start with with one team
that make sense for everybody
cool so just to reiterate one product
many teams is what Nexus is focusing on
solving that's this thing that is the
augmentation to scrum that enshrines the
basic framework that we need for many
teams working together
okay so Nexus 10 likes to call it an
actual skeleton around scrum I like my
it's a inherited inherits from scrum and
adds some extra methods and properties
but then I'm an engineer and he's the
the scrum Lord as it were and there's
two things that are really important in
this world of net of Nexus One is
backlog and the other is dependencies
you're going to have dependencies
between teams that's
just reality we can't get away from that
we want to minimize those dependencies
as much as possible and in order to do
that and to have it transparent and open
Nexus introduces some new rules new
events and new artifacts everybody here
familiar with scrum anybody here you're
all familiar with scrum awesome so you
will know that every role is there to
provide accountability every event is
there to provide empiricism and if the
artifact is there to provide
transparency that's why they're there
that's why I'm missing out on one of
them is kind of bad because you lose one
of those things and we want empiricism
so we're keep changing direction we want
transparency so we know what's going on
so we can change direction and we want
accountability so somebody takes
ownership of that thing yeah but we need
to add a little bit to it so this is the
next though is that yet this is the
nexus diagram which kinda looks like a
scrum diagram it should because it is
still scrum we've just added some extra
things to enshrine the communication
lines and the things that has to happen
in order to deliver software at scale
because we're still building one
incremented version of our product one
integrated increment so at the end of
every iteration we have one version of
our software not nine if we get nine
teams because that doesn't work we've
still get more things to do there's more
work there so there are things that
we're forced to do for example
refinement is no longer optional some
some teams can get if you're working on
our reasonably straightforward products
that everybody really understands you
might be able to get away without doing
refinement but if you get nine teams
working on one product refinement is no
longer optional when we do our sprint
planning we might have teams across
multiple time zones so they're not all
happening at the same time that's just
reality hopefully each of those teams
are co-located to the members of a team
are co-located but we have teams spread
across time zones so we maybe need
a group of people to get together before
those events happen and discuss
dependencies and figure out you know
what we can and can't do in this in this
next iteration because things are
dependent on each other and then they
need to take that information back to
the teams so I think of these little
Nexus boxes which actually appear all
over the place as a team of teams
they're representatives of the
development teams that get together
figure out those dependencies and take
that information back to the team for
their sprint planning meeting and then
we have this idea of a nexus sprint
backlog rather than just a sprint
backlog because well we've got nine
teams and we want to see all the work
underway not just one team's work so
each team should be able to see their
own work but we need to be able to see
everything that's going on in our Nexus
and we are talking about three to nine
teams just like performance tends to
tail off after nine people on a single
scrum team same reason same reasoning
behind it for the communication lines on
multiple teams working together you can
have multiple Nexus our necks I our
Nexus is working together depending on
which dictionary you use what the plural
is for that there's a lot of things
going on there but there are only a few
extra pieces so we have a Nexus
integration team to provide an
additional level of accountability we
need somebody a group of people
accountable for integrating the software
accountable for making sure that all of
the scrum teams think about integration
because we forget yeah and it gets the
end of this whole we didn't we didn't
talk to this other team that's doing
something in the same area and there
we've got a bunch of conflicts maybe we
should have thought about that earlier
who's there to make sure that those
discussions happen that people think
about that that's the Nexus integration
team so we talked about thanks to sprint
planning we've got a nexus daily scrum
because if we're trying to figure out
what happened in the last 24 hours maybe
some of that is dependency problems
maybe builds were failing our unit test
for failing because two teams weren't
talking to each other so maybe we need a
quick nexus integration meeting before
individual scrum teams take that
information back to the scrum teams we
only have one sprint review and it's
been renamed from Sprint review to Nexus
sprint review because it's one event
reviewing one piece of software you're
still reviewing one piece of software
it's not 9 different pieces of software
we've got the retrospective refinement
is added as an actual event because we
need that moment of inspection and
adaption and in artifacts for
transparency we've got the goal a nexus
goal because we all need to be going in
the same direction we can't be going if
we're all working on different things
where are our discussions relevant
that's why you have a sprint goal inside
of a scrum team because if you don't
have a sprint goal and you just take
five random things off your backlog to
go work on your teams are working on
different things why would they need to
talk to each other they're not even
working in the same space whereas if we
have a goal and select things from the
backlog to achieve that goal then we're
all focused on delivering inside of the
same space so when we talk to each other
is relevant we can share ideas same at
the Nexus level let's maintain some of
that at that level as well yeah
so I want to add some some complementary
practices because there's common there's
common problems that everybody has when
they start scaling and we need some
complementary practices so if you
download the Nexus guide and I read the
Nexus cabe the complementary practices
will not be in the Nexus Gate just like
user stories are not in the scrum gate
that's a complementary practice you can
choose to do that or choose to do
something else that's okay so the first
problem is building effective teams
we've got one team in our organization
we need to scale up to five teams
because we've got to deliver more value
in our products than we can currently
deliver so how do we do that there's two
main practices that I think work pretty
well the first one is you put one team
together you make them awesome and then
you split them end up with two teams
build up the numbers so as you go you
maybe start with three people four five
six when you get to nine you add the
tenth person maybe we can split that
into two teams of five and then those
teams start getting bigger
split them rule split growth splits
that's that's one way to do it this has
been pretty effective in the past you
kind of lose your high-performing team
every time you split and they have to
work together to make that happen again
but it can be quite effective
another model I've seen is an internship
model so you have a team of people who
are very good coaches a group of people
who are just good at that sort of thing
and you have them on a team and then you
cycle people through that team to learn
what's going on and then they spin up
spin up their new team the new team as
they come out that makes sense cool
those are two potential practices there
may be many many more that you have
discovered online or you've tried
yourself to do whatever works
complementary practices the other thing
that's super important to think about
and
is going to be key to being successful
at scaling is not getting everything
happening at once he does get off at the
end to get up you've got three things
you've got teams work and architecture
of your application they need to be
aligned if they're not aligned you're
going to have problems so another key
practice is being able to adjust those
things if those three things aren't
aligned you're going to get friction and
it's going to be hard to deliver working
software the architecture of your
application the work that you've got to
do so your your backlog breakdown as
well as the composition of the teams
don't be afraid to reorganize the teams
in order to match up to the architecture
does that make sense
yeah it's pretty difficult so once we
get into our backlog we then have one of
our biggest problems is by clogged
dependency management there are all
sorts of techniques I can't get that to
go any faster it's a bit slow you get
too many things happening and everything
has to happen in the right sequence if
it doesn't happen in the right sequence
you're going to stumble yeah and you got
to go and fix it if we can find out
those dependencies earlier then we don't
have those stumbles and it shouldn't be
that difficult to do we just have to sit
down get in a room figure it out figure
out what those dependencies are before
you start so identifying those
dependencies and dealing with them you
may have crossed team dependencies you
may have component teams where you've
got a database team a middle tier team
and a front-end team you're going to
have a lot of dependencies pretty much
everything of value is going to require
work from all of those three teams so
figure out how to break those things
down and decompose those backlog items
for those things I would suggest
reconfiguring into feature teams might
be a better idea
yeah but minimize dependencies as much
as you can identify them early because
there's all types of dependencies you
may have dependencies between people you
give us one person that's the only
person that can do a particular
particular job you may have domain
dependencies
I know particularly I've get some
customers are here and they have
particular domain specific stuff all
over the place
that makes it difficult you may have
technology dependencies software may
have third party software that you
depend on you might depend on a third
party company or somebody else to do
something it's pretty difficult I
already mentioned feature teams feature
teams are by far and away the best way
to remove dependencies if you've got a
full stack feature team that can deliver
you can give them a piece of value
something your customers want and they
can deliver it full stack in your
application then that they don't have
any dependencies outside of their team
the team can work together to figure
that out
can you think what the next problem
might be actually creating integrated
software hugely hugely difficult because
what happens when you go to try and
merge yeah you end up with a mess if
you've not organized it beforehand I
have customers that have branches that
exist for two years and then they try
and merge them back into the trunk and
it's like what are you doing it's not
going to work I know they haven't been
pulling the changes through so it's just
a big mess so we have this idea in
excess of an integration team now an
integration team is not a dedicated team
in this in Nexus world ideally it's not
a dedicated team I have seen that I've
have seen that work but ideally it's
representatives from the teams they are
the people in your organization who are
the DevOps coaches just coaches in
general engineering experts maybe
they're TDD experts or
creating CA pay planes they work
normally on the teams that they work on
but they get together to discuss things
resolve dependencies figure out what we
need to do across all of the teams to be
able to resolve those dependencies so
it's coordination raising awareness
ensuring integration happens that make
sense because if you have a dedicated
team why would the development teams
care to solve any of those problems
because it's their problem I've a very
specific customer they have a dedicated
build team and the build team solves all
of the problems so all the developers
are like yeah we'll check in whatever
crap we like and if it feels they'll fix
it yeah you want to try and avoid trying
to avoid that you know who you are so
have this integration team and they
generally operate as working in the team
now sometimes messes happen sometimes
there's a fire and we have to go deal
with that fire whether it's the build
fails or the some kind of severe
priority one bug in production that
we've got to specifically organize our
own solving so maybe in those
circumstances they pull out of the teams
get together form a team in order to
solve that problem and then they go back
to their teams it's not their permanent
mode of operation it's temporary to go
solve some problems and hopefully when
they go back to their teams they bring
up those issues that each team's
retrospective and the teams can figure
out how to change your application to
not have those problems happen again or
change your process just like you would
expect a scrum team to do cool
a lot about teams and people and things
working together we also need to cover a
little bit the work because we've got to
get the work in order in order to be
able to deliver so one of the biggest
problems is usually having a backlog at
all you'd be surprised a number of
organizations I go into where they have
ten teams working on one product and
they don't really have a backlog and the
teams just make up whatever they like to
go do you'd be surprised
so we need some practices around
figuring out what that backlog is where
it comes from what to do and we've got
an extra event to try and handle some of
that but some interesting practices that
you might want to use I don't know if
anybody's use impact mapping let me hear
used impact mapping nope so pretty
useful way to figure out what it is that
you need to do you can kind of you can
actually work from either side of this
this graph you can either start with
your goal and then figure out what your
deliverables are or you can start from a
deliverable I know what I want at the
end so what might it might go be the
deliverables my favorite one is rob a
bank you want lots of money so you could
go rob a bank that would work may not be
the most optimal solution but it might
work yeah bank of mom and dad as well so
impact marketing can be fairly useful
more common is story mapping has any use
story mapping yep yep few people's your
story mapping is about facilitating
breaking down your your your backlog
into something that you can understand
to adds an extra dimension to your
backlog so you can see where things lie
how we might break things down and that
brings us to a very interesting thing
that in the scrum world we tend to say
don't
use tools you're better with stickies in
a wall because that tactile feel of
working with cards helps people interact
and feel more ownership of the things in
the backlog and that's true for one team
you get two teams working together it's
probably still true as long as they're
collocated but once you get to five or
in pictures kcat teams working together
on one product you're going to need a
tool it's no longer good enough to have
stickies on a wall because that would be
a big wall now if you get 80 teams
working on one product so you might also
need to think about levels of
abstraction as well we might think about
we have business objectives epics that
break down into features that break down
into backlog items because people in
your organization aren't going to
necessarily be able to understand the
amount of work that's involved for 10
teams in PBIS maybe your product owner
doesn't even care at that level because
there's too much going on maybe they are
focusing on features I care about the
features that are delivering you guys
the team figure out what what things you
need to go do to achieve those features
and they're kind of bigger yeah so
breaking that backlog down so you don't
have something that's too big because
it's just not going to fit it's going to
derail the process so in order to
maintain that backlog and break
everything down as much as humanly
possible we have this new event called
the nexus refinement refinement was
always part of scrum it was just kind of
you can do it whenever you like it's up
to you you get 10% of the team's time
you figure it out now it's you have to
have an event because if you get 10
teams with a pretty sure 10 teams costs
quite a lot of money you don't want them
sitting around doing nothing or doing
the wrong thing
because of additional things we need to
do at our refinement session we need to
not only look at what's in the backlog
breaking it down into nice size things
so that we can actually set them in a
single iteration that would be nice
having them with enough information for
the development team to be able to take
them into the iteration and deliver them
PUF would also be nice but we probably
need to refine those backlog items from
a dependency perspective are we making
sure that we're not trying to do
something in sprint one that depends on
something that we're going to deliver in
sprint three because that would trip us
up so having some way to manage your
dependencies and have making sure that
you know what you're dependent upon so
for example in sprint one the driver
team number two is dependent is a
dependency of six we want to make sure
all those arrows are pointing from right
to left so pointing from left to right
you've got it the wrong way around you
might have external dependencies you
have to make sure that you remember to
take care of having some way to identify
those things it's super important yeah
cool so we have this set of teams
working together and we have a number of
events that have to happen that are
slightly different in Nexus and the
reason are slightly different is just
because we've get more things going on
more things happening so we have this
idea of a nexus sprint planning which is
a lot bigger event because there's lots
lots of people if you've got nine teams
maybe in more than one country maybe
you've got two teams in India maybe you
get two teams in the UK and you get two
teams in the US you've got a timezone
problem you're not going to get
everybody in the same room
well that would cost a lot of money you
could do that as well it cost a lot of
money so what are you going to do what
we're going to have our group of people
get together and that doesn't see
integration team it says Nexus and the
reason it says Nexus
it's that idea of it's a team of teams
so the right people for this particular
sprint should be the ones that attend so
it might not be the same people every
sprint but you want the right people but
we don't want to tell you who those
right people are yeah you guys need to
figure that out that's part of the the
practice this is the minimal we need we
know that a group of people have to get
together and discuss dependencies before
the sprint planning meetings need to
make sure that that that that happens
and then we go through a much bigger oh
I hit that twice a much bigger
interative cycle I know this is a
complicated diagram but we discuss our
Nexus dependencies as an access level
feed that into the scrum team sprint
planning meeting and maybe during that
sprint planning meeting they identify
another dependency and it has to go back
to that group to then feed information
into another team so you have to kind of
go throw in that cycle and maybe that
takes a large period of time maybe
that's 48 hours because you've got teams
across the world maybe you can do it in
much less if you've got everybody in the
one location but if it's across multiple
time zones you're going to have to you
know you do your event in the US then
you do not be the other way around you
do your event in India then you do your
event in the UK so you do your event in
the US the US guys say the problem that
one of the Indian teams has to deal with
you have to feed that back and they have
to have another get-together to figure
that out so it could take a longer
period of time that's just what we have
to deal with yeah and we end up with a
bunch of sprint backlogs our nexus
sprint backlog which is everything and a
bunch of sprint goals because each team
is going to have their own goal we have
a nexus goal that everybody is going in
the same direction then each team will
have a goal that goes to achieving the
Nexus goal since like a lot of work
doesn't it
but these are the things that we have to
do in order to make multiple teams
working together a success we're just
defining yes you should do these things
don't forget this list of stuff that you
have to do there are probably going to
be other things you need to do but at
least remember to do these things so we
have that goal to help us all we're in
same direction ah I've seen this sprint
planning take many different facets I've
seen people do it individually teams go
off and they just all do them
individually and then they get together
over there and again I've seen this
model which is you actually get
everybody in a room and have video
conferencing software to talk to the
remote teams who are meeting at the same
time because maybe the time zones aren't
that bad I would say you'd be pretty
lucky in the modern world if you can do
this because you got everybody in one
location customer I'm working with it
the moment in in Denver has most of
their teams in one location in Denver
they have one team in arrow somewhere
else in the US and one team in India so
most of their teams can get in at the
same time and then you've got that
integration team in the middle that gets
together the the board that I showed you
earlier with the dependencies keep it
updated people a big room collaborative
room where everybody is working together
to figure out what those things are and
they end up with a backlog idiot what
are we going to do in this situation so
what they end up with is the nexus
sprint backlog which is everything
you're going to do your entire plan so
it's quite all it's going to be quite a
lot of work if you get nine teams
and in that nexus sprint backlog we do
need to understand dependencies as well
because we may have things that crop up
during the iteration hopefully you don't
have cross team dependencies inside of
your sprint that came kind of difficult
but you might may just be reality here's
the amount of work we've got to do and
we have to figure out what those things
are so your your scrum board looks a
little bit more complicated so hopefully
you have a digital tool maybe if you get
three teams you can figure out how to do
it on a whiteboard but if you get more
than that you're it's going to be a lot
more difficult a lot more difficult I
think I'm good
we have our daily scrum as well we need
to have the right people get together at
the beginning of that to again feedback
for things that happen during the last
24 hours or probably 48 if we've get
teams all over the world make sure we
take into account those things that are
happening in other teams that are
important that affect us if integration
is difficult that's going to be a
problem so we need to share that
knowledge and then my my favorite one is
the sprint review because most people
believe that they should have separate
sprint reviews well we've got 10 teams
so we should have 10 different reviews
and they're all reviewing their own
thing but where's where's the single
working piece of software that you can
choose to ship at the end of that may
not be there you can make sure that that
thing is there which is why in the Nexus
guide it talks about a single review at
the end now that doesn't mean you get
everybody together although you can have
you ever tried to get 20 30 teams
together for a single review anybody
done that kind of fun one of the best
ways to do that is the idea of the
science fair idea that they have in the
have in the US or even like we have like
we have today at the conference if you
go down into the I don't know what they
call that bit in the middle of the pit
that's that way the pit
you'll be able to choose which vendors
you go talk to you can go and see
slumbers here you can go and see
Kongsberg you can go and see tax control
and def Express you just walk up to the
booth and what have you got to show me
that works for reviews as well because
the purpose of a review is to get
feedback that's its purpose you might or
might not do a demo but if you have like
a little stand for your team and
stakeholders are walking through the
room and they can go where they care so
you get feedback from people who
actually care about the things that
you're building another way to do that
is not to do a demo tell just do
feedback but then how do people see what
you've been working on well maybe you
create little videos of what you've been
working on in the sprint and ship that
out before the end of the Sprint so all
of the stakeholders can watch the videos
they care about that's what Microsoft do
the V STS visual studio team services
team have about 70 teams working on
their one product and each of those 70
teams at the end of the iteration
creates a little video and an email goes
out with here's all of the videos that
all of the teams have been working on
plus they're kind of probably their
sprint goal as well and stakeholders
aren't going to read watch them all
because that would kind of suck would be
a lot of time but it only short but if I
care about this topic and I care about
that topic and I care about this other
topic I can go watch those videos and
then type them up a bunch of feedback
and send it to them so they get that
feedback because that's the important
thing
so our Kaizen moment for our product
remember retrospective but again it's
more complicated
we've get problems that one team might
have encountered that another team has
solved we've get problems that the
integration team might have encountered
that everybody needs to think about so
how do we make sure that everybody has
that information and then once we've had
a retrospective maybe there's lots of
interesting solutions to those problems
that we need to
to pull together and figure out what
we're going to do at the Nexus level it
the entire group of people working
together so then we can have two little
events in between again it's probably 48
hours because we get teams across the
world and we want to maintain some kind
of maybe a board that shows across all
of our teams what we are planning to do
what we've decided so that we can
maintain a single place to do that now
maybe you need a tool for that if you're
across multiple locations but having
some kind of board is probably a good
idea and then we get to an interesting
topic then I believe anybody heard in
scrum that we have one product owner
okay what happens if you've got 600
people working on a product can that one
product owner really understand
everything that's going on in the
backlog so I want to introduce a little
a little caveat hopefully you can get
away with one product owner you have you
as the product owner have 10% of the
team's time if you have 10 teams then
you get 10% of 10 teams time so maybe
that's good enough or maybe it's still
far too complicated maybe you need
multiple product owners and that's
something that again the STS team do
each team has a product owner or a
product owner has one or more teams or
put it that way so source control might
have a product owner and he has two
teams we're kind of tracking might have
a product owner and they have two one
team or two teams yeah and then that
product owner rolls up to a an uber
product owner which yeah
so you may have a chief product owner
sounds a little bit weird I don't like
that model but it is a complementary
practice it's not one I would encourage
unless you're absolutely massive so the
good thing to do because you've got
levels of a fusion between the chief
product owner and the development teams
the more levels of a fusion you have the
less likely you are to get the right
message through that's the whole a the
telephone given then the message changes
as it goes so there's a couple of other
complementary practices that I do want
to mention one is AV testing get EB
testing into your product have some way
to do that that's an engineering problem
to go solve if you're an engineer in the
room you should be able to figure that
out and have somewhere you know we may
not know what what feature to build we
don't know what feature to build or we
may have a choice should we build it
this way or that way maybe you have to
build both and let the users decide
which one do you prefer
something that if you look at M if you
use Google and you're logged in you'll
find it in the names of some of the
buttons change on a fairly regular basis
and they also move around at the top of
the screen and they're doing that to
gather data and we'll if we put this
here did more people click it okay well
if we put that there
the more people click it or the less
people click it and they figure out
Amazon do it all the time as well so
really important for them because
they're more consumer orientated but
even for business-to-business if you
have users using your product and they
can't find the options that they need
they're not going to click them so how
do you know where to put stuff and how
to do that maybe testing live monitors
ah one feature that I actually I
actually hate this practice when
products do it to me and that's the fake
door practice I hate it you know when
you go into a product and you click a
button then it says coming soon it's
called a fake door they're potentially
recording how many people click that
button so that the product owner can see
whether it's worth investing in that
part of the product
whoo yeah I'd like that feature click
click click but from a user's
perspective click coming soon aah
I thought it had that feature yeah
frustrates me about doing things like
user voice I know many people are moving
towards using user voice to glean much
more insight into what their customers
want Microsoft have it for a lot of
their products they use user voice
visual studio user voice calm I know
many of my customers are using it as
well having some kind of build
automation is obviously going to be
fairly important that's how you provide
that quick feedback get stuff out and
figure out what they're using so oh I
hate it when that happens one of the key
things that I think again people forget
is about testing and automation but not
just unit testing unit testing is easy
to automate that's all within the
control of the developer but automated
acceptance testing is also of paramount
importance because the number of tests
that you have are going to multiply
sprint run sprints each sprint you get
more tests do you have time to run them
all do you have time to run your full
regression because if you don't you're
going to miss something as things change
over time so it's potentially going to
be false in the product so if you
automate everything then you can get to
that place of having having everything
there so one last thing and I know it's
close to some of my customers heart
which is internal open source if you've
got a large organization with lots of
different products being built
don't let everybody create their own
logging framework because then you've
just got a million logging frameworks
that maybe don't fit the need have some
way to have an internal open source idea
where even if what use open source if
you can if you're creating stuff
internally internal
open-source is really important to share
knowledge even within your organization
don't keep everybody's code secret from
each other be able to see what everybody
else is working on use some of the
capabilities that they are building and
so that you're not ending up with too
much of the same thing going on so are
there any questions because everything
was totally clear yes ah
so I would say if you get two people in
the team why bother sit next to each
other build some software that's it so
can you do scrum can use for sure you
can use come in one person use scrum but
I don't think it's worth it's just like
when if you get two teams can't you just
get them to sit next to each other and
talk to each other just when you get to
more that you need that extra overhead
but yeah so get to people don't bother
I'll give my recommendation for sure
anybody else yes
so the question was on a daily basis how
does the integration team work
especially if they're distributed so
because they're they're just 15 members
on particular scrum teams yeah and
they're they're a member of a
development team so they have their day
job they have their daily scrum but
potentially they have to help that team
and other teams figure out how to make
good high-quality integrated product so
they're probably have more expertise in
build and integration and coaching so
they're helping people as well but on a
daily basis I would expect them to be
working in their teams and looking at
that level as almost like a community of
practice across the all the teams in the
Nexus and then get together to discuss
things as needed so just as needed I
don't want to be specific and say all
they have to meet at this time and they
have to meet at that time everywhere
where you see the Nexus on the diagram
you that could be the Nexus integration
team yeah anywhere where it says maxis
it could be the Nexus integration teams
that are the group of people that meet
but they might not be the right people
for that point intact or for that
problem to solve so it's okay for it to
be somebody else I don't know if I
totally answered your question but it's
up to you yes
it's come of comes yep yep so you you're
using scrum of scrums
scrum of scrums which is all the scrum
masters get together and discuss the
problems and I have seen that work I've
also seen it not work it I find it you
need a lot of discipline and
highly-skilled scrum masters who are
into all of the different pcs in order
to facilitate that now when it says
Nexus it might be the scrum masters that
get together this is whoever is relevant
to that discussion is the ones that turn
up that makes it's like open space rules
yep
I'd try and minimize that stack as you
think that the they've got our hierarchy
of product owners so that probably get a
lot of teams working on the one product
seven teams yeah so again I would try
and minimize that level of fusion the
more levels you have between the ideas
and the people doing the work the less
likely they are to be the same thing but
if it's working for you and you're
producing working software that's fully
integrated in shippable and a regular
cadence then you're doing the right
thing yeah I wouldn't say that you're
doing something wrong unless you're
unable to ship working software which is
most of the customers that call me so
that helps and if any other you had a
question yes eighty yep so yes so the
question was how did you handle
retrospectives if you've got our 80
teams working on one product yes they
would all do their individual
retrospectives Nexus focuses very
specifically on three to nine teams
because above name you've you know how'd
you get representatives from 80 teams in
in a room so I probably break those 80
teams down into a number of Nexus and
each Nexus has those meetings and then
you probably there's a whole bunch of
stuff that I didn't talk about around
Nexus plus plus which is you've got many
Nexus working together and it's the same
idea or just take it one level up so
representatives from each of the Nexus
would get together at the next level up
the next level up to spread that spread
that knowledge so it just becomes more
complicated with with 80 teams for sure
yeah it's not no it's not easy each team
has their own retrospective Nexus meets
before and after so input and then take
the output and maybe do something with
it at the Nexus level
any other questions yet not so that's a
very good question I don't care what
they're doing inside of the teams as
long as they can professionally and
consistently create working software of
the required quality level at the end of
each sprint yeah because the reality is
that we're going to be on some sort of
cadence we have to have working software
at some point in time so even if you say
you're doing Kanban as a team you still
got that deliverable at the same time as
everybody else
now does everybody have to be on the
same cadence not necessarily ideally yes
but you can't have one team on a
three-week cadence and another team on a
two-week cadence that's not going to
work for you yeah because when do you
actually have working software where
everything's integrated but if you have
a four-week cadence and you have some
people on two-week and some people on
one week that's going to that's going to
work because it's going to the mass
gonna work if that makes sense
yeah so if you do have any questions
feel free to contact me on any of the
methods you like up there
and thank you very much for coming thank
