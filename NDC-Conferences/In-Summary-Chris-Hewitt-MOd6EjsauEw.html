functions
this is sort of up to the minute that
your functions what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do a demo and you're not gonna see
a lot of code but I'm gonna put the code
up so the real interest is I could
interest you in this and then if you
like it go and find the code afterwards
and there's some kind of cool stuff if
that's what you want to do but what you
need for this is you need Visual Studio
2017 15.3 which is the one that was
released this week so that's pretty new
and the Visual Studio 2017 tools for
your functions which are now part of the
Azure development tools workload in the
product so you just select as your
development tools and where you're going
okay as well as that you're gonna need
you need a subscription to Azure and
what I'm using here is I've got a
storage I've got a blob store I've got a
function app a search service and a
couple of cognitive services everything
is free in small doses except for the
storage which is cheap so you still need
a subscription but doesn't necessarily
cost you much to do this if you actually
have a look at the new get packages that
we're going to be using in this example
you can see really what as your search
sorry as your functions are it's web
jobs all the way down so that's really
quite telling the cool thing about this
is that the the source code for all the
usual functions stuff and all the
extensions that that you're going to be
able to use and the kit that lets you
build your own extensions is available
on github so you can go get the source
code see what it does debug things that
go wrong or build your own and if I
don't have time I will try and put the
slide up when I finish the demo if you
want the code the only thing you really
have to remember is end in tears
TI ers okay alright and now on to a demo
so what I've got here is into this
back to here okay what we've got here is
a project that includes a module
function and there's your function
project and it's got a couple of
functions in it three actually we're
only going to look at two of them the
first time we're going to look at is
text summarization and it's based on the
when you when you install that the
workload for as your you get the ability
to add as your functions of various
types okay this is based off the blob
trigger template now one thing to notice
is that before with these your functions
you needed a function JSON we don't need
one of those anymore so there's no
function dot JSON that is actually
derived in these modern times from these
attributes so it's the attributes that
derive everything not JSON the blob
trigger that says that we're gonna look
at a in this particular storage account
which is going to be set up in your
function app and here it's actually set
up in local settings so that's where
we're going to go to so we're going to
go to that storage account and we're
going to look at this file spec defines
what are the things that are going to
trigger this function there's a blob
trigger function and it just says into
this anything in this container give me
the name in the extension what you can
also do is you can put filters before
and after that file spec but the after
filters haven't checked it this week but
last week they weren't working so what
I've done just in the meantime the
suffix filters basically is I put an if
statement that does what a suffix filter
would do what this does is it operates
on the documents that are in summarize
documents in this container there's one
document already there hopefully it's
not too old because time it's got to do
with logs it actually knows to trigger
these blob blob trigger from the logs in
the blob in the blob store so if it
doesn't work I'll upload another one and
what we can do now is run this only one
of these functions is working with this
second function I hope is actually not
built okay
I'm only building one of the functions
also I have the this function app is
turned off because otherwise it would
have just processed those files so let's
run it and see what it does
hopefully it does something and so now
the function actually runs locally so
we've got we've got this talling it
actually runs the functions locally they
can access all the triggers to all the
things out there it's found that
document it's we don't really care about
the images go ahead and tell it to do
anything with them and it's created a
summary of it so if we go back and
refresh this you can see that we've made
a summary okay it's good we got that the
top phrases that we found and it plus
ten sentences picked out using an
algorithm that is okay but could be
smarter right this documents not
necessarily easily amenable to this kind
of summarization but you know the codes
there so you can see it and you can
improve it if you need to what I've got
in this in the second container is a
scanned PDF so if we open that I could
work them to it locally but nevermind
you can see that it there's no actual
text in it it's just that it's just an
image in a PDF file and what we're going
to do now is turn on the second function
they stop this we can have more we'd
have any number of functions in a
function app that we like or one or you
know it's really this is really just the
function app is really just how you
deploy it so you know I I can publish
this to a particular place I can have
many of them or one with many functions
in it so let's have a look at the
indexing function it's pretty much the
same again it's a blob trigger it gets
triggered off documents in that
container the other one by the way also
output to a blob so they've bought in it
was triggered by a blob and also output
a blob it's kind of useful
this one just finds a blob and then it's
going to do interesting things with it
it's going to get the pages out of it
it's going to OCR the pages if it needs
to it's going to get the key phrases and
then it's going to stick each page into
as your search so let's run this one
so now we're running two functions it's
found that blob vision API I'm calling
you over my phone yeah yeah wasn't that
slow okay so it's done now what we can
do is we can go into the into the as
your search instance and we can go into
search Explorer and find hopefully that
document can search for Jabberwock and
their index okay so it's found its there
we've got the key phrases and we've also
got the OCR text out of that document so
that's pretty I mean that's pretty
boring what you can just to blow my own
trumpet here's an example of you know
it's what at your functions don't solve
all your problems then you know you
don't build applications and as your
functions they're just useful building
blocks for doing other things so this is
an application that uses Microsoft flow
which causes your functions that uses
cognitive services and machine learning
it uses as your search uses sequel is
your and it's got a web api on the front
of it and it lets you do kind of really
clever things with these documents okay
that's all I really need to say about it
so yeah those your functions there if
you if you get the latest 17.3 they've
changed so it's like version two of a
dual functions they're easier to use the
tooling is all included with Visual
Studio
it all works really nice and again I
won't bother to project that this code
you can find it at github end in tears
in summary why would you want to well
maybe not for this stuff because this
stuff you can just generate right I'm
just showing you things that can
generate what's interesting maybe is the
code that's sitting in there that does
interesting things with PDF files with
is your search with text analytics and
with the vision API okay out
and by the way we're not doing we're not
doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
