talk about agile some people actually
claim that agile is dead what's my
opinion you'll see during the talk we
also will be talking about expectations
and how we can meet those expectations
and how sometimes we miss communicate or
misuse the word agile in our word who I
am my name is karima rafes and I'll be
your host today as I said agile
management anti-patterns
so first of all we can actually even
like think if something like agile
management actually exists when I was
preparing to this talk I was like
googling and finding you know really
interesting certificates even like in
agile agile management even from like
institutions that usually are really
preaching kind of waterful approach they
suddenly having certifications in agile
which sounds a bit old then you just
open the book start reading rethink
about this agile thing and just
considering oh we have deadlines we have
timelines we have projects plan hood
which actually looks like Gantt chart
okay interesting so that's why we'll
just a bit like go a bit deeper and try
to figure it out if actually agile is a
thing if the stuff that we call agile
actually means anything because the true
trouble with this beautiful world is
that it's fashionable because it's
fashionable we just use it everywhere
it's a bit like you know in technology
micro services everywhere containers
everywhere the same is with trying to
run our run our projects weekly are
everyone is agile right if you are not
agile our customers are concerned
because you are not you know up to date
with the newest trends and probably we
are done know our job and another
question is if we actually need to be
agile in order to deliver value to our
customers and how we can actually manage
it okay that's it for the like brief
introduction who I am so I'm kasha
said you before I have Twitter how many
of you guys use Twitter okay a few of
you so feel free to tweet feel free to
follow me I'm part of the agile in
Europe community and probably it will be
like listening to the stub you can like
maybe dubbed in actually even like Adele
I was Corgan either back home of the
meet-up called agile in Europe
enthusiast and also asked organizer of
conference udderly in Europe what else
I'm also working not only on the
conference like usual job and I'm a
consultant so during this talk you'll
hear it depends really frequently why
because also I would like to give you a
bit of a context because context is the
king everything beautifully works in
theory in practice sometimes it simply
fails because context don't match and
there is no gold rule that we can just
follow and apply in our company and it
will be just working and a bit about my
background I started working internal IT
department then I switched to the
software house then I switched again and
was working for the software vendor then
switched again and now I'm working in a
consulting company so I had like a
really broad perspective how our IT
industry is working I also was helping
with few startups trying to figured out
how to make requirements on all those
weird stuff connected with you know
magical scope working so I have kind of
broad perspective and during this I will
try to actually present those
perspective to you so as we actually
started talking at the beginning how
about this I think is it like good or
bad
so this is like screen and I won't put
it on the under during the my talk from
the really good TED talk about
synthesizing happiness so basically this
is the tower that says that even if we
are thrown to the jail and after 20 year
we are released and someone asked us you
know how it was
person probably say okay it was the best
time of my life and you think oh my god
you were in jail and probably by mistake
and how come
kind of similar thing is happening with
agile we were working working in some
manner than someone just tell us okay we
need to be agile
we'll just rename our processes and then
everyone is really happy even though we
still have magical word process and even
before I move forward how many of you
knows agile manifesto okay
and there's anyone willing to say it
loud okay okay so that will move to this
as well but there is like one kind of
thing that agile as a philosophy says
that we actually shouldn't be that much
focus on the processes but we will go to
this part as well so companies try to
force to be agile even if it's not suit
now you can ask okay how come that agile
can not suit to certain companies simply
because of external constraints that
companies has for instance finest
institutions frequently I really really
have they obliged to basically produce
project plans budgets and other stuff
because of registration and because of
security reasons and sometimes having
flexible scope and approach like okay
let's plan it like two weeks ahead it
simply cannot work there due to external
constraints there are some companies
that basically are really big and have
troubles with scaling and they try use a
jille they use something similar to
agile but then it ends up again if in
having something that actually looks
like baby waterfall with small
iterations but still we have huge Gantt
chart with dependencies and releases and
again if we have really huge complicated
project and we have dependencies and we
know that our module is too talked with
module X that and Y and we need to
produce API in certain order in order to
actually connect those it creates
dependencies right so it reduces our
flexibility we'll talk about
okay and now let's see okay can we
actually connect like this traditional
approach to like project management in
like PMI cells or prince2 sense with
other principles some people think we
can
so just take camp chart and say that we
are working in agile maybe rename
schuster and then beautifully we have
agile project management as a thing and
we can have certificates in that as well
now the question is okay how how this
can help us probably sometimes if we
have this improve our processes a bit it
helps but usually it just creates
additional overhead everyone are
frustrated because now we are working in
agile so instead of having only project
manager we also have scrum master scrum
master is getting miserable because
project manager actually doesn't listen
to him and says oh now you know I know
that you have those story points but I
as a project manager I need deadlines so
you know I just took them put them to
the spreadsheet and to hear your or your
deadlines carry on carry on with your
work sometimes if you are lucky project
manager and scrum master is one person
and then he is forced by external evil
powers to produce the deadlines and then
suddenly you have commitments that
shouldn't be in that manner produced in
agile because the whole terror is we are
flexible we are delivering value we are
talking with our customers and our
customers know that if we change scope
it's because you know environment around
this changing that we want to do our
best to deliver through good working
software to customers unfortunately in
that this approach with just renaming
stuff who are doing our old beautiful
waterfall with actually lying to
ourselves that we have agile so just to
sum up this part I want to say that
agile is a kind of philosophy there is
no ready recipe and you know some people
say ok
scram equals agile not necessarily you
can have scrum framework and you can try
really really hard but if you need
company are people who really focused on
like waterfall matter of working you'll
just rename your processes some things
in scrum are really really valuable like
retrospectives if you are you know if
you're on the point that you can
actually complain and improve then you
have at least some value added but in
some companies believe me you have only
the stand-ups and iterations that's it
maybe you have planning because someone
you need to give us the estimate that
you can produce the deadlines right so
planning is important other than that
it's getting tricky okay I ask you about
agile manifesto so let's let's go
through this process of voters so that's
usually in our company someone decides
to have agile and what they're saying
okay if we have it we'll just change our
waterfall to scram
everything will magically works right we
just renamed the way that we are working
we maybe if we are lucky someone will
employ agile coach if you are not lucky
someone just gives us a book and say
okay just read the scrum book everything
will be fine
is it fine in the end well depends of
the people sometimes if we have good
people and we can like adjust and you
are small we can be good but what will
happen if we are in the big company that
we have actually troubles with
communications so interactions and
individual is just you know we are
somewhere small in the bottom of the
hierarchy then we suddenly have a like
beautiful process and scrum instead of
having like you know it's certainly it
helps I don't want to criticize it
because it's like the first step but
sometimes it's the first and last again
people even don't try to like move
forward from it and what we have we have
product we have process
and guess what you know also the most
frequent stuff when people want to
improve is okay let's change the tool
because it's not the our problem it's
the tool problem right whatever is
happening at fault of the Tauri now JIRA
is not flexible enough version one it's
not flexible enough let's turn back to
the beautiful access spreadsheet because
in Excel everything worked and you can
easier do the project plan you know
switch to calculate story points to
deadlines right so sometimes our
approach is actually reversal from
spreadsheet we are just buying the to
Unthank now we are agile because we have
JIRA agile or now we are agile because
we bought version one it's expensive so
basically it means that we invest in our
people and should everyone should be
happy
that's first step sometimes if it leads
to other studies good but if we just
stop over here it starts to be again
tricky because instead of improving
situation we are just accepting what we
have and building tools on top of it in
actually building software for our
customers sometimes we actually do the
same thing we just take existing process
without thinking and developing the
ended in the tool and then you are
surprised that it's not working so
similar similar and things unfortunately
another thing is documentation and I'm
not saying that documentation is not
important because especially if we have
really old tool and then suddenly we
need to make change we just start
thinking okay what it was actually doing
this module right do you anyone actually
remembers but the trouble is that one
hour after writing the commentation is
like outdated so what we can do well I
would advise instead of having like pile
of documentation trying to make it like
visual and trying to have automated
tests this is the obvious thing that I
assume that everyone knows right now if
not there is a plenty of talk even here
about automatic tests but this is
something that gives us
predictability if we add something we
don't break another thing sometimes you
also are cheating but let's say that
it's easier than reading through 1,000
pages of documentation again in
corporate world to basically convince
people to actually use instead of
comprehensive documentation or diagrams
or anything else tests to check if
everything working and basically have
their tests written in a manner that
business people can read it so for
instance in cucumber or other framework
like that it's kind of hard because it's
something that looks really technical
even it was approachable next thing
collaboration that's actually my
favorite because we think that in our
collaboration and talking with customers
so easy right but then we just end up
with let's say having like Google Docs
or stretch sheets or share points that
we don't reach or even the worst case
scenario we have like development team
we have product owner maybe like bunch
of bees in between product owner and
development team then we have
salesperson then we have marketing
person and then we have the poor
customer in the end and we have this
whole chain of people that basically are
talking with customer but not necessary
developers some people prefer that
because not everyone feels comfortable
talking but what does basically means
that as a development team not
necessarily we understand what our
customer how the person works how the
business works and how we make it why we
can make it better and the whole idea
around agile actually was that we as an
industry start to understand the
business and can propose solutions that
merge business and technology approach
again it's not easy you will have like
really huge product but during my talk
later on in the second part I will try
to answer this particular thing and
basically help for this because I really
strongly believe that if we are
understand what we were doing we are
just doing it better
again responding to change over
following the plan I think that's you
know all those guns things that I told
you why it's actually dangerous because
some people say okay we need planning
just because it's easier to have a
vision I have nothing against vision
it's really important but having
detailed plan reduce flexibility
so if we have banking up right with the
queue for five years ahead and then
suddenly Apple introduced fingerprint
logging and our competitors from
startups and kind of finance the kind of
apps introduced nice feature of
fingerprint log into our app and to give
our like give us really secure and easy
access to our money we will switch
personally I switched my bank because
the new one had fingerprint and I'll
still don't have even though it is like
two years old right now
so customers are doing things like that
and especially if our products are not
outstanding usually in the business
spectrum it's really hard to innovate
that's why we have like uber our B&amp;amp;B
Spotify and although other things like
that that actually brings technology
into landscape and make ordinary
business outstanding so that's why
having plans few years ahead won't work
we are not allowing ourselves enough
flexibility to react of the stuff that
happening on the market we don't allow
ourselves to innovate okay quickly like
wrapping up this part why actually you
know companies having troubles with
introducing agile first of all this kind
of thinking if we buy at all will be
fine because we suddenly are becoming
more flexible and more our dough then we
struggle to basically see bigger picture
because we have this two years backlog
ahead and we just don't see how our
environment around is changing and how
technology influences our business then
we have this chain I was talking about
and we have troubles because everyone
communicates via proxies so we also lose
the ability of seeing and being able to
propose any new changes again we
sometimes also fail in the terms that we
just try to do ever figured was if we
have like small baby steps it's just
easier again because people don't like
changes in IT we are you know here
listening about great innovative stuff
during the room you know hold the
conference I attend few business
conferences they are listening about
similar stuff but basically there is
like no bridge because we are focusing
our industries stuff like agile supposed
to be a bridge but it's actually not and
a lot of people just from business side
are just not aware not because they
don't want to listen or basically they
are stubborn it's like the content it's
not somehow getting there so after the
stock I just encouraged top of your
business people maybe show their YouTube
videos and encourage them to actually
learn because that's beneficial for two
sides okay so what are other common
things right now we'll just talk through
the examples how companies are trying to
introduce changes and basically how we
can make it happen because sometimes we
are just doing the first step right
because we had like usual waterfall and
we thought okay we already want to have
our job we know how agile looks like so
it should be simple alright instead of
having this beautiful
steps over here we just wrap it wrap it
and basically it will be like working
perfectly so let's start from iterations
because it's easy right let's just give
our scope like in business requirements
document in like like you know do like
discovery face then it's design and
everything you know mock-ups and stuff
and then let's are all you know work in
agile our development team and what we
suddenly discover that here we don't
have feet
Loup maybe if we were happy actually
test is like done parallel to
development sometimes actually we are
like developing then we have sprint of
testing then we were developing sprint
of testing but it is the kind of the
first step and then basically we are
start calling it agile because we have
iterations right we probably have scrum
maybe in the process we have like
retrospectives in the end we have
obviously stand-ups
I'm totally certain that we have like
user stories and backlog so we have all
the artifacts that makes us kind of
agile so what this actually is in
practice if you see the important thing
so time to market it's still long and
people at this point just forget that
making it iterative there was like
several in the software development
lifecycle approaches there was like
several ideas one of them was like
iterative model which basically has like
this kind of time to market so we were
doing iterations but not necessarily
checking the results and deploying
earlier not necessarily agile and
iterations are not necessarily agile as
well why because we don't have a
flexibility we are not testing our ideas
we are not really flexible because if
our design and discovery was over here
then making any changes in interactive
manner it's difficult and sometimes we
even not think about making any changes
to be honest so again comparing the two
all the things connected with having
those iteration is to take test our
ideas and having shorter time to market
there are companies that are really
aggressive in terms of time to market
very aggressive why say let's deploy
after ire
now you can't test ideas if you have the
development team working for a year and
then you start thinking about deploying
it's a bit too late if you are really
scared because there are big companies
that are scared of putting the products
that are not perfect to the market maybe
we can have bigger group somewhere else
our trusted customers and
we can actually deploy it and see how
it's working why does this also
important factor in one of the companies
I worked in and when I got employed I
was told okay we were doing brand-new
product it will be great just join our
team we are starting from scratch I
arrived it was five years old software
with no customer and was still under
development and it wasn't small project
it was at that time written by for
development teams we had the support of
like full one tester team testers team
and obviously we were working Nigel the
trouble was gold plating we haven't been
testing our ideas but our product owners
were not happy and they were like
constantly who are doing the same
functionality even without testing it to
the customers so that was the trouble we
couldn't finish because we weren't
actually validating our ideas and quite
dangerous because we are wasting money
if were big company maybe we can't
afford this but if we were small which
simply can't
maybe that's why small companies are
having like easier in order to basically
approach this because they have to
because otherwise they won't survive so
as I said feedback at this person from
this point is like really really hard to
get another thing is okay how plan this
thing right because if you have
iterations and if we're trying to be
flexible it's really hard to plan and
what we basically are used to have it's
a growth map and Road no commitments
right because if we put anything in a
line like any idea as an evasion there
will be someone in our company that put
dates on it and then especially if we
are working like system systems that are
like heavily distributed or we have like
api's or other basically things and we
plan to like have new brilliant APN to
communicate with our product and we just
put it down somewhere in the paper in a
linear manner someone will sell it to
the customer and then
we'll expect to have it delivered so
this is another thing I will talk about
how to make it like easier in order to
still have a vision but not necessary in
a linear manner in a minute
next thing is size of a backlog again
sometimes when I join companies what
what I'm given like a single person
responsible for a product saying okay
this is our 1523 user stories deal with
it
guess what it's too many and if you have
that size of a backlog instead of one
person you need an army and I'm not
against product people I'm a product
person but if we try to be good at
communicating and good at delivering our
products and we have basically this in
our backlog we have no clue what is
there even if you have army because we
need to communicate and we have really a
lot of waste why because it just imagine
everything is detailed everything was
estimated every you know single
acceptance criteria is written down and
then suddenly you know some Apple gives
this you know fingerprint thingie and
it's all our plans connected with
logging is destroyed right because our
customers I don't know why instead of
typing password date does want have like
fingerprint disappointing but basically
this is what's happening with the
requirements during the time they just
lose the value so having them really
detailed
it's just waste we'll talk about it
because what this actually happens right
there is kind of feature gluttony driven
by our users I had this talk about this
particular topic here on the conference
so if you haven't seen it recommend the
video so what is happening in the Reg
reality if we are starting developing
our products there are a few points when
our users are you know here they can't
actually use the application but it's
basically good enough for having tests
and tests some assumption there is a
point that they are actually see the
value added and this is the point one if
we have market
you can say Oh actually you can sell it
because someone see that their business
process and the key value that the
business user can would like to do it's
delivered so they it's helping right
it's helping our user there is also a
point where the user users actually have
everything they should have in order to
do their work but it doesn't mean that
they will stop asking they will ask for
more more more and more features why
because once they see that their life
can be simplified they would like to
continue this path and not necessarily
they understand about stuff like modules
are like splitting the application for
two because maybe instead of having one
huge heavy monster we can have two
modules or three modules they see their
world in a way that it's basically you
know it's my work and I would like to
have it done in one application right I
don't want to switch because it's easier
for me to have it at one so we get the
requirements to add like most small one
feature to our application and then
suddenly from small features that
initially okay one it's fine
we have like loads of things that we
added and we just lose the bigger
picture and that was actually dangerous
because then instead of having like you
know clear view of what our app is doing
we have something like that one of my
favorite example was okay maybe a before
ask anyone from Microsoft in this room
no hands okay basically it
they have really I really like Microsoft
Outlook it's like good for emails
definitely better than some other
products maybe I should I won't give the
names but then the Microsoft also had
some time ago tool called Microsoft Lync
it was a communicator I think right now
is replaced by Skype but still some
companies are using Lync and there was
an idea about showing the calendar in
link nice to have I would
in terms of the features so what this
basically dead to outlook itself once
you are putting the emitting invite
instead of you know taking like few
milliseconds added used to be it took
like few seconds why because it was
synchronizing with link and this was the
idea that maybe it's like nice to have
to Furyk a few people but what had
happened the core functionality of
Outlook was actually interrupted because
what people are doing
there are scheduling meetings in Outlook
they are sending emails and this is what
they want to do not necessarily you know
having the synchronization happening so
this was the kind of thing that
basically interrupts really heavily the
core business process of our application
without adding huge value to the
customers and I'm certain that someone
asked them to do it because the idea of
you know seeing your meetings in link
it's good right but it's not crucial
so sometimes we need to ask ourselves is
the things that we are asked are really
worth implementing again this is you
know one of the things that sometimes
happens so basically we ask what our
what is missing right and we have this
kind of cycle so sometimes we need to
basically validate and what is happening
our partners from product side usually
put all those things to backlog because
there are simply terrified to say to the
customer or to the users or to anyone
who requests if it just sorry we want to
do it so we put it to the backlog which
sometimes write the data requirement and
sometimes we forget so if we really need
to do it keep it separate so have a
working queue backlog and maybe parking
lot and the name it parking lot because
otherwise we just we are just lost again
easy to use if we have lots of features
are not really this is sometimes also
one of the requirements if we just put a
lot of things into our backlog and the
area by the way it's not easy to use
and requirements itself and basically
there are clarity it's also another
question right because if we have this
complexity and we just add adds to our
backlog more more and more items the
quality actually decreases and this is
this this is actually really user story
ourselves and why not just write login
probably it would be even better but
people you know just try to first
yourselves to the fit to the key mass
and to the structure and basically force
everyone to use it okay I just need to
be mindful of time we have still a bit
that's good so schemas itself can help
us to basically build understanding but
the whole idea about this it's basically
driving some value so if you see
something like that and ask yourself if
it's giving a value and the answer is no
get rid of it if you can't use the
schema and it doesn't help you just
write login because maybe it's more
meaningful and it's like lastly reading
and you just can easier to manage your
tickets because you see the idea here is
basically presenting the business value
as well but and I out combat in this
it's just not visible okay another
fingers are we done with our user
stories and every basically how to
assess if we are working in this like
steps manner if you are like deliver the
value or not and maybe we actually
didn't deliver anything you know if we
don't have feedback loop it's really
hard to have that definition of the
unlike straight few people are laughing
I think experience from real life yes
yes yes so why it's happening this is
usually you know we are as a development
team are working testing team is working
and then we have the business and demos
that sometimes don't happen Inc no one
is validating and we have like a lot of
troubles with actually like signing off
or saying oh yeah we just delivered our
backlog item and we are
happy with it especially in the
environment that when we don't have we
can't deploy we just can't have like
continuous delivery and just deploy to
the customer and if the customer is
actually adding a does it means that
it's not done so then we have like a lot
of things that are pending and then
suddenly in the end after a year of
development someone look at it and say
oh actually I didn't mean that and
you're in big trouble again why it's
happening because the projects are big
and because we are not willing to have
the smaller steps why because we are
also terrified so if we will be having
the conversation with like business
people how we can actually tackle this I
don't advise to pull the statistics
there's a report done by Standish Group
this one is from 2012 but I think that
the last year they in 2015 they did
similar research and outcomes was really
really similar
what is basically presenting big
projects over here small projects over
here by small I mean one team by big one
I mean several people 1 million plus
budget taking few years so what's the
trouble with this basically by failure
we deliver we don't deliver to the
production at all by this blue thing so
by changes we change the scope we change
the budget we change the timeline we
change one of these three I will change
everything but in the end someone is
using it green everything between time
and scope it can happen as you can see
there are like this is the prefer
miracles or that the statistic is lying
who knows but what happens if we have
smaller projects it's basically easier
to succeed why because our scope is
smaller so we can understand it in the
big vision which is also probably not
you know people think that it's really
well defined but in practice we just
figured out that we have few roadblocks
that we haven't thought about before and
some people say oh no no big projects
are all you know all like you know
constructions of the roads and
buildings but guess what constructions
of the road sometimes are delayed as
well I'm from Poland and our road
constructions never ever finished in
time never ever finished with in time
and budgets so when someone's talks at
18 dusters should you know follow the
path of the you know constructions of
the road I think that difference it
follows the Polish way I'm not saying
that's the best yeah my change I mean we
change the scope we change the budget or
we change the timeline so one of the
three changes are all of them this if
you are like interested in details the
sandwich group breaks it down to smaller
bits but usually when you start
conversation with people who are don't
want to listen about having small baby
steps and actually testing the ideas in
the market
this helps to understand that this is
risk and business people understand risk
this it's like reducing risk to like 4%
is you know relatively small still we
can fail actually what basically though
says we're not really willing to accept
our failure even if our ideas are
terrible we just go with them and with
big projects we just carry four years
with them in smaller ones we can still
have some changes and maybe if they're
our ideas really bad we can just kill it
really really quickly so actually we can
like pretend that we even didn't have
this idea so it's like more smoother in
that perspective again you know
statistically me and my dog we have
three legs so just be mindful that in
your context of your company maybe your
big projects is working brilliantly and
this is just you know you are into ten
percent right you are in this miracle
but there is a plenty of places that it
actually doesn't work okay before we
just go to the recipes like really
quickly wrapping up this is good first
step but please don't stop there unless
you really can't go anywhere else
because of the constraints of the
companies and again if you can't just
admit okay instead of trying to pretend
let's figure out how we can improve
of our process instead of forcing scram
and instead of forcing scrum practices
because maybe stand-ups are not working
for us maybe actually having a backlog
it's not working for us and it would be
easier to have a BRD with like nice
diagrams and stated what we need to do
within this our five years project plan
so those are the things that we need to
be mindful about if we have the product
roadmaps also on commitment it's not
having good good level flexibility for
ourselves then we have growing backlog
and then we have the troubles because
users always will want war it's just the
thing and the quality of the user
stories itself is basically challenging
okay and you can ask okay is it
basically any hope that from this huge
process we just go to this one so one of
the things that i'm usually proposing is
starting from vision and having a
roadmap in a manner that's not linear
why because everyone then is like happy
that there are ideas captured it's high
lever so it's not detailed so we are not
wasting time and we have we can have
something which is like product tree we
can use mind map if we are a distributed
team if we are not we can use it in like
all the sticky notes what basically is
doing really quickly this is the current
time box whatever it is it could be two
weeks if we are working in a sprints it
could be a sprint if you are working in
Kanban and we decided at our time of
these three months it could be three
months whatever it is we are just taking
those ideas and trying to figure out
them and those all are basically future
also they are structured in a modular
manner those branches are kind of
modules and because when we show it to
the business and when we talk with the
business in this manner they see the
branches are not merging like normally
right so it's really not allowing to
have dependencies and as we know if you
have a lot of dependencies between
modules it's really hard to maintain and
then if we want to split two modules to
two separate applications and we have
dependencies it's just another
complexity to manage but this is not the
end those are their ideas and some of
them maybe are not the best one so we
need to assess how to have the best
ideas actually developed at least
mentally because if you are like
agreeing that okay we have like huge
timeline and we have lot of requirements
let try to assess at least briefly if
the idea is good or not we are taking
the Leafs
all the ideas which are not yet the tank
detailed we are checking against ROI and
we are checking about against one
feature that we consider as the key if
you are well if we having for instance
booking an ting for
Airlines and we want to retrieve price
really quickly because our customers are
not willing to wait because if they wait
they will go to another booking engine
this performance is the key so adding
the feature that actually stole us down
and at least we think that will it will
slow us down it's actually not really
good so we try to assess this once we
assess that because what we have MVP can
be like for products that we already
have and we are just want to add them on
top of them can be used as well for the
new products one important thing is use
the common sense because maybe somewhere
here it's like security requirement and
if we don't do it we are screwed so just
assess if maybe you know our greediness
it's like you know not taking the
important factor into consideration
because maybe it's really really really
important if you are interested into
details how to make it working the talk
called a feature cottony actually talks
in detail manner about the product tree
and how to go with really huge number of
ideas to smaller number and how to
detail them in a manner that actually is
meaningful because this is like the
first step of reducing the number of
things that we want and we are actually
delivering and it's been easier to test
our assumption of based on this okay
what are the other things that I would
like to briefly talk about because I see
that I
fifteen minutes and I guess that we need
to also sometimes for questions well we
are asked about estimates so some of us
have like beautiful crystal ball and can
estimate things really accurately
personally I haven't seen good estimates
there are teams who are like during work
getting more and more accurate but then
suddenly we have the roadblock Knesset
of Technology or maybe requirement
change or simply dependencies from the
other up and we come deliver even though
in theory we could develop develop in a
certain pace but we need to integrate
with system a B and C and they didn't
deliver the API so even though we are
ready to consume it we have no chance
because they are weren't ready and we
can't forecast stuff like that so
basically what is happening when we are
asked for the estimate and basically
we're having the project plans right so
again we have the magical spreadsheets
with translating whatever we give even
if there is a t-shirt sizes you know
t-shirt sizes also can be mocked up to
the numbers whatever we were giving it
basically translated is it wrong or bad
again if we just try to communicate that
okay we are giving this numbers and we
know that this basically it's kind of
you know math even proves it it's just
guessing it's just rough idea and maybe
not be even like connected and I'm just
giving you because you know you as a
business need to have some
predictability then maybe it's fine but
what we are failing to communicate that
actually it's not a steam at its gas and
instead of giving the predictability to
their business we are just giving this
gas and they really honestly believe us
they'll believe that this is the time we
believe that this is the time and then
something happens and everyone is
frustrated and I know that in the
corporate environment sometimes or
actually really frequently
it's not possible to live without
deadlines it's just how the world works
we have this can try to communicate okay
let's add a buffer because it's not we
can't predict everything so please
remember about this some people say that
if we're asked for estimates we should
quit our jobs I'm not that brave
I would say that you know it depends as
a consultant right we can at least try
to make it work and make everyone aware
that this is actually really tricky part
not because we don't know what we are
doing because we know the technology we
know requirements for for example but
because external dependencies as well
that we can't forecast and we can't be
basically taking this all in the
consideration another kind of sad thing
you remember I probably remember at the
beginning you know this example of
development in bas pm's POS marketing
people says people who are working as
sellers stylus itself maybe are not too
bad but we basically frequently fail in
cooperating because we don't know each
other goals and because what marketing
person has a different goal the
development team right we are working on
some the same company so it should be
that we have the same goal right we are
selling the same application we want our
customers happy but for instance
development teams sometimes its measured
by the number of backs which has like
nothing in common with their measurement
that the sales guys are basically
responsible from because they are
measured for instance how many customers
are convinced to buy our product which
actually doesn't match right we want to
deliver quality and value obviously they
want to deliver quality and value as
well but because we are measured in so
different manner we can't communicate
right it's really hard sometimes
marketing people don't understand why we
want to validate our ideas with the
customers because it means that they
need to show the and ready application
to the customer and have a lot of
questions why the
the error just happened on the screen
and from their perspective if they want
to sell this it's not professional to
sharing something that contains errors
right so in one hand we have our carving
for having short feedback loop and
showing our tool in progress to the
customers to just validate the ideas and
maybe discover those back backs and the
other hand with the marketing for people
who would like to have this you know
beautiful Porsche to sell instead of
something that throws errors constantly
right so those kind of things also if we
sit together and actually say okay what
are our goals and agree that we have
actually one common goal but we are
measured in different manner help us to
do stuff that may work for both of sides
so for instance maybe we can as a
development team have like demo instance
that is really well tested and doesn't
contain the bugs or basically it's nice
and smooth because it's demos also have
uploaded the sample data so if we need
to you know show it to the customers
it's already pre set up so person from
marketing don't have to worry about it
because what sometimes is happening is
like okay we are developing the tool but
data not our not our responsibility
configuration delivered and it's been
really hard to convince someone from the
other side of your silo that basically
it's actually working because what they
see they see empty tool not configured
with that data that you can't click so
how I can even show it to the customer
the best way would be like you know
convincing someone from marketing
actually to take technology person with
them again why it's not easy just
imagine we have this bunch of people and
one person one one customer so we have
like I don't know 15 people from the our
vendor company and one customer
customers will be scared and they were
seen oh my goodness I'm paying for all
those people so that's why sometimes we
don't
we are not so involved in the selling
process at the beginning and sometimes
we are not involved in the talking with
with the conversation of the customers
because we as
business just don't want to scare Biber
numbers there the customers and this is
actually frequent problem in the
companies okay one of the last questions
shall we scale our journal nuts probably
you can guess my my opinion about that
but I will let you think about it in
your own on your own time and basically
figured out the answer and try what I
would like what's the message basically
over here let's try make something that
actually shows the organization if it's
agile fine if it's something that brings
some steps from agile that's fine as
well
really in order to deliver value we
don't have to be like 100% pure agile
probably it's not really fashionable
what I'm saying right now but if we mix
a bit and try to improve ourselves it
will help us again if we have
constraints in our organization is not
agile because we have this band you know
a bunch of people who are not really
willing to work in agile manner also may
be adapting few small steps will just
help us in our cooperation and
convincing them to maybe slightly change
or if not then at least we are like
mindful of okay those are our
constraints we are not fully flexible so
we can also communicate our business
sorry guys because you are not flexible
we also can't be done much flexible just
take it into consideration because what
again is sometimes happening if we are
like working agile and very super
flexible and on the other hand we have
project plan with scope and someone
asked us for changing the scope we are
changing it and we are delivering and
the timelines is growing then it's our
fault because we have scope creep and we
didn't like you know manage it properly
so we need to decide do we want to be
flexible or do we believe in scope creep
those are like two things that are not
really matching and sometimes if we
don't communicate it clearly we are just
accused from this kind of things it's
really that corporate thing hopefully
too
after the study we'll have the idea how
to fight it a bit okay
so quickly let's wrap up if you want to
be agile and we just buy the tool and
implements quarum it doesn't mean that
we are agile agile is a philosophy if we
want to bring a bit of predictability to
our business and a bit of the executi
for ourselves
let's have automated tests that can be
read by the business people so cucumber
for instance or any other friend
framework that allows this again because
if we have tool that will grow older in
a time then it's also easier to remember
what it was all about again try to talk
if you can't talk basically at least
assess with your Silas's what are their
goals in order to see the bigger picture
as well because if we don't see bigger
pictures is really hard hard to deliver
anything so what was this all about
basically try to find the root cause of
the problems not necessary symptoms
fixing tools fixing processes it just
basically trying to figure out the
symptoms not necessarily root cause root
causes silos this is the reason why we
have troubles root cause is not
communicating root cause it's having
different goals root causes sometimes as
well having the basically ridiculous
project plans but this is driven from
this kind of nice cooperation that we
are having in the companies and actually
it's really really hard to break them
because this is how the work works okay
then another thing Excel driven
management so if we're giving the
numbers or t-shirt sizes we need to be
prepared that someone will put it to the
excel and produce the deadlines that
lives if they were doing it it's also
not because there are that much Ariel no
they want predictability so that's why
we need to try to convince them instead
of having this chunk the project chunk
the product to smaller bits have smaller
time to market have feedback loop and we
if we need to fail just fell after first
two weeks or first month not
or not after five years of development
so this is what we should be mindful of
if we have first step for the iterations
is like good progress but let's try to
figure it out how we actually can amend
it in the manner that we don't have like
project plans with guesstimates and just
be mindful of that users always always
always would want more and it's also not
easy to incorporate within within those
or things if we have silos and don't
understand each other and even don't try
to understand again basically success of
our product or our project not
necessarily depends on the methodology
the current method if you are agile you
will succeed unfortunately no you can be
really flexible you can have all the
artifacts of agile and not really
following the philosophy because the
communication is failing because
basically you are more focused on the
like for instance contracts and signing
off than actually delivering value to
the customers you can be more focused on
having like I don't know written
documentation rather than actual product
there is so many things that actually
can fail even though you have the scrum
even though you have the iterations even
though you have retrospective so
remember about actually thinking like in
the bigger idea of the product itself
how to deliver it not necessarily about
the methodology because this you can
figure it out you can tweak it you can
adapt it and you can make it working so
thank you for your attention this is in
a nutshell communication in the project
do you have any questions we have like
two minutes left if now then thank you
oh okay there's one yeah
could you repeat please a bit louder
because it's hard to hear yeah yeah so
first of all requirements I need to say
because if you have fixed price for
certain requirements it's really hard to
do this basically decide what the
customers really wants and what we were
actually having in this manner usually
it's like okay just write down this up
front maybe design it up from them it's
fixed price we should deliver this and
that's done and dusted but then we have
sudden roadblocks that we haven't
thought about again it could be
dependencies it will be like whatever or
it will be simply change of mind of the
customer again this is this just ends up
to the like validating ideas really
frequently we just start developing
software without even like thinking
about prototype by prototype I mean
mock-up on paper or mock-up in the tool
that actually doesn't look like software
to actually even see if it's making
sense or not again fixed price usually I
see in the kind of big products when the
companies are not certain about okay I
wanted this but I want to be secure that
I won't pay more for delivering my
business needs so I will force the
vendor to put it on the you know fixed
price so I'm fortunately uncertainty
usually it's the reason why it's really
hard to have fixed price if we have
existing software already and we are
having like change requests it's easier
if we have again an existing software
and we are adding features and there and
we are working in well-established
business that it's not influenced by the
environment around again might be it's
possible
probably you know the thing is the
context around us the business how it's
changing the innovation that is
happening around the world not only in
our technology space but also in all
other industries it's also really hard
to forecast and what's sometimes
happening that someone requests
something for the fixed price and then
something happens and we just discovered
that actually it's not the thing that we
need so yeah yes
yeah you can do it that way but you know
usually so my approach to basically
breaking down their budgets and stuff is
okay let's have three months time box
whatever we deliver within three and
three months it's just delivered we are
working and cooperating really closely
with business business is actually
committed to see and assess the features
that we are delivering to see if we are
going in good direction or but sometimes
it's really hard but then after three
months if you are happy and we deployed
our POC dadada
our end customers so our end users then
we can continue investment for another
three months doing the same manner I'm
currently working an environment that we
are just given the idea and the
businesses okay this is the idea this is
what we need just figured out the way
the end goal is for instance to
calculate X Y and that how you will do
it what is the technology what is the
user journey you are the experts you had
the UX people you had the resource just
do your research make it and then will
assess if it's actually good idea or not
I would recommend this way of
cooperating because it gives a lot of
flexibility but also it requires a lot
of awareness of the technology team
because the technology team that is
working on it's also really they had
really good expertise in the business
domain and it's not always possible
again because of the corporate
constraints that they are there so yeah
but okay so thank you for your attention
