without the advent of social networking
smartphones banks airplanes oil
platforms and cute cat videos and yet we
hardly ever look at the creatures that
make all of this possible
this is an ordinary IT office it's their
natural habitat for developers but today
it's empty that's because they have all
migrated here to a conference for
developers only it's called the MDC
every year thousands of developers from
all over the world flock to this
breeding ground to hatch out new ideas
their ability to immediately assimilate
massive amounts of data is the reason
they control almost everything in the
bubble the NDC's rich ecosystem is
enchanting the advanced food supply is
necessary for sustaining the developers
cranial activity over these three
important days although a friendly
species developers often lock horns in a
coding battle this is how developers
find the Alpha developer of the herd the
NDC is also a place for developers to
interact with each other the different
species gathered at this conference are
entertained by normal human beings in
the evening
to build friendships for future
collaborations after three days the
developers have gained knowledge and
made important alliances but after a
short period in hibernation they will
migrate to the next big event not far
away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
