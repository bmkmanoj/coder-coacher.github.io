to the last session and so my name is
wish wish
work in the commercial software
engineering team at Microsoft as a
developer Technical Evangelist you know
spreading the good word about stuff we
do everywhere so and as part of it you
know I've been spending I spent probably
last one year focusing on you know how
to build BOTS and work with a bunch of
customers around across Australia New
Zealand as well and one thing that that
we've learnt a lot is you know there's a
certain motion around everyone wanting a
bot but outside of that what we also
notice it is that whenever we work with
customers and whenever we go talk to
them you know they they have ideas about
building stuff because the company down
the road is building a bot so I want to
build a board as well but not
necessarily doesn't solve the problems
that they're effectively trying to solve
so a very interesting classic case that
we see with any emerging technology
right and as we sort of move forward you
know this session is designed to us you
know spend more spending more time
towards UX spending more time towards
you know how to implement boss they're a
lot more engaging that lasts longer in
terms of the conversation span that or a
session span as well and how can we kind
of build these interactive experiences
that sort of help the users get a better
experience out of it as opposed to just
being an exchange of text messages so
how many of you have attended a bot
session already in this conference okay
not many that's good
and so this session again it's it's not
an introduction do the framework or -
you know what we're doing in this space
it's more of a hey we've worked with a
bunch of customers in the last one year
so let's spend some time discussing what
are some best practices how can we
improve on our experiences and and
hopefully you can take some of this back
and think about the way you design BOTS
today and whenever I kick off a session
I always sort of bring it back to this
slide where we talk about how the world
around us is sort of changing
specifically if you want to understand
the computers we've been very much
focused around how the digital world
works it's been quite binary where
either we're using a calendar
application or we're not either we are
busy if you go on your Skype account or
we're not busy and everything becomes
very binary in that sense whereas
as humans we sort of live in this analog
world we were trying to make decisions
based on the environments around us and
if you think about it we've been using
computers for very long in a very very I
guess prescribed way if you think about
it you know started back with
command-line and I still use it I love
using command-line and it's awesome but
one thing that people notice a lot is
how you know things change right when we
are learning something when we are
dealing with come online it has to be
extremely specific what you want to
achieve out of it it has to be very very
prescribed to the language that it's
sort of you know giving giving us and at
the same time if you you know end up
doing something random which all of us
have been in that space you know you
sort of end up making disasters
hopefully some of you sort of sauce
heard some of the stories from last
night as well which was pretty cool and
and we fast-forward it off too you know
menus and people loved menus a lot
because the best part with menus is that
you get this extra hidden real estate
where you have so many different options
and people loved options a lot so much
so that they added an extra layer of
options and that wasn't it so we added
one more layer of options because having
options for options that were already
options in the menu is so cool and and
if you move forward and think about
websites and how we're designing them
today as well you know it's it's amazing
because every website has their own sort
of design guideline based upon you know
how the users interact what they want to
showcase etc etc and it all makes sense
but we've got menus there as well and
we've got options in those menus and if
that was enough you scroll down and you
get a whole bunch of options as well I
work for Microsoft and we've got a bunch
of web assets and and this is just one
of them if you look at the other one the
previous bot frame of website what was
interesting is that I have to relearn
how that website interacts with their
users as well because the UI or the UX
over there is completely different and
we see that same pattern with apps today
as well so you know if you think about
apps on any platform and the way they're
designed and the way they sort of people
interact with them the only consistent
thing that I see across those apps is
probably the hamburger menu which is the
most popular thing on app app
development but what is also cool in
that space is if I am a you know
top app developer or if I've got my app
in the top 10 15 20 charts then I get to
choose my own design guideline I can
build whatever I want if I'm using an
Android phone today I'm using it because
I love the operating system and I want
to use the design guidelines that it
comes with I love the design that they
sort of have on the vanilla platform and
that's why I'm using that whereas if we
compare that with how you know Apple
designs it and some people love that
those phones and that's why they go
towards that platform but if you think
about the apps the experiences are
evolving so rapidly that every app has
its own experience at the end of the day
and so what's happened as you know as a
consequence of that is that my friend
sort of bill talks about it really well
where he says you know it usually
becomes the way we interact with
computers is the way they prescribe us
to interact with them whereas we want to
kind of move into a state where we want
the computers to understand contextually
the environment around us and the way
it's possible is because everyone's
talking about data everyone's talking
about how data is being infused
everywhere you've got sensors so you
your bot would know or someone in your
computer would know that hey this is the
temperature outside so this is what
should if you should be prepared to it
etc etc so all that stuff is happening
and you're getting lot more contextual
information we tried it once with this
as well and was really successful for it
was supposed to do and you know our
favorite to ever but we move forward
right and we think about the way we
interact with computers or the way we
use computers to interact with people
around us is changing as well so how
many of you in the audience have at
least two of these apps installed on
your phone okay everyone how many of you
got four of them how many is anyone got
all of them installed one person there
we go there's always one person is what
all of them installed and it's amazing
because that sort of explains the kind
of shift in in communication we're
having today where all these
conversational canvasses are
conversational channels allowing us to
have you know better interactions more
persistent interactions with sort of
people around us and what is interesting
is that it's all of them can become very
extremely sort of thriving platforms and
Veitch hat is a classic example of that
where even though we might think that
it's geographically sort of very you
know heavy in one part of the world but
it's globally available and the best
part is it's got about 800 million users
and about 10 million businesses on top
so it's crazy how 10 million businesses
operate on top of a messaging platform
and if you think about it you know with
some of the other apps that are more
sort of you know globally accessible you
think about whatsapp it has about a
billion users again they don't have an
API it's a peer-to-peer architecture so
it's different but Messenger has 1.2
billion users and that gives us an
opportunity sort of really think about
the way we're designing applications to
reach to those 1.2 billion users by just
making something available easily and
it's not just about that right we're
entering this new form factors where
mouse and keyboard not a thing anymore
you've got voice you've got you've got
speech and you've got sort of sound to
interact with so you need to sort of
think about the way we are delving into
building applications for all these
platforms across you know all the way
from communication or conversational
canvasses all the way up to you know
these new VRA are sort of form factors
as well and if you take it a step
forward right the way we see
conversations being a platform is is
with people being at the heart and
center of it where digital assistants
sort of help you transact or carry out
conversations along with you or do tasks
for you on behalf of you where you can
maybe have your payment information your
address your location everything else
you know fully shared with your personal
assistants like Siri Cortana Google now
and and they're doing that today but if
you think about BOTS they sort of end up
becoming a new way of carrying out
conversations where you are able to sort
of have UI becoming the new language you
know so human so human language becomes
a new UI and and effectively BOTS become
the new apps where you're now able to
kind of use digital assistance as a
means of really conversing between your
applications and so forth and the best
part is on top of that you're able to
also infuse intelligence wherever is
needed so it can be transactional but it
doesn't have to always be
so you know I guess in summary both sort
of become new apps where digital digital
assistants become the new you know
browsers if you will and and
intelligence is sort of infuse across
all of them but that sort of brings us
to where you know we're moving ahead
with with BOTS as a concept itself right
and in a very simple simple sort of you
know summary BOTS are effectively just
apps it's just a new way of you know
giving out experiences to your users and
that there is that's all there is to it
right some people think that BOTS are
all about AI some people think that you
know BOTS are all about NLP but but
here's the thing right if you're trying
to achieve something if it's even if
it's transactional you know you can BOTS
a great great way of delivering that
because what you achieve out of that is
that you're not able to you're able to
scale to all the platforms where users
already are and we see that a lot where
you know you're not trying to just be
artificially intelligent maybe it's just
transactional you want to book a session
with maybe your dentist right and you
can do it through the board as well you
can just say hey I'm available at this
time and if you think about the context
moving forward your Cortana would
already know your calendar so all you
have to say to your Cortana is hey can
you book me a session with my dentist
next week and that's all there will be
to it it's not just about having text
interfaces right you can have these
richer cards as well and we look into
some of those samples very soon and
again we're not here to solve the Turing
test so let's not only focus on NLP NLP
is a great way of branching out but you
know we need to think beyond that as
well and one example is shallow ice from
from that was launched in China so this
journey sort of began in May 2014 I
believe and what we did was we launched
a chat bot in China itself and till now
it's at about 40 million users in total
and an average conversational last
average conversation lasted about 23
exchanges which is I think 10 times
higher than the industry average and
learning from there we introduced that
same bot or a bot that was based on
similar principles off to in Japan as
well and renamed it Reena
which is the one in the middle
and when we release it in Japan I think
we reached about 20% of the population
and and if you think about it today
we've just not today but like this year
or itself we've announced so which was
which is now available in the US through
Facebook Messenger and and kik platforms
and what we've noticed there's about
170,000 people are having conversations
with it in in the US and some of the
conversations have even lost at an hour
about 7,000 people in the US have had
conversations with so that lasted more
than an hour so it's very interesting
that how you keep it extremely
transactional but you also think about
you know how deep your your network need
to be when you're sort of building these
conversational canvasses so it's really
interesting and one of the biggest
things that comes out of those
experiences is the fact that it's a
combination of both you know IQ and an
EQ so you need to be intelligent enough
but also be able to kind of understand
the context and be emotive towards that
experience one of the examples for that
would be for example if you think about
a shallow ice it's even featured in
televisions where you know the hosts are
asking questions and it's it's really an
interesting experience how how that's
that's been carried out and that brings
me to my next point around how we're
using natural language to kind of help
us on that journey again bots are not
just about natural language but it's
just a way of getting to that journey if
you think about the way we send messages
or emails today right it's just as maybe
a forum you know I go to my Outlook
click a new message new email and I can
give it the name of the person I want to
send that email to the text of it and
just press send
behind the scenes that send button looks
something like that where I'm just
waiting for the send click method
whenever it's it's triggered I collect
the text I collect the the contact and
just call the send message method and
which is no different to me saying that
as a conversation as well where I just
want to tell my boss that I'm doing an
awesome job and if I'm doing an awesome
job maybe I just want to call a send
message method which says you know the
contact name over there and the message
over there so that's that's all there is
to it and what we've done behind the
scenes
that if you think about that method
itself that basically reflects the
intent behind what you want to achieve
so send message in this case becomes the
intent the purpose of off whatever come
on do you want to set out so whenever I
say something if I just go back quickly
whenever I'm saying hey I want to tell
someone that I'm doing this I just
basically want to make a call to the
send message method and I'm when I'm
doing that I want to give some more
contextual information like the name of
the person and the text of that message
and we call them entities just because
that was the best name available at that
point in time but you can call them
parameters or variables or whatever else
so you've got that flexibility across
the board and if you think about it the
way you would interpret that that
message over there is basically the name
of the person going in that side and
you've got the text going on the other
side so that that's basically it so I'm
just making a call to a method but in
some cases you have to be aware that you
might just not have one or the other or
maybe sometimes you might not have both
of them and that's where conversations
become more relevant where you need to
be aware of these situations where you
could have multiple branches to the
single outcome that you're looking for
and that's what NLP is all about where
you're looking to get an outcome out of
it and they could be a thousand
different ways of getting to it and
that's that's the sort of mindset with
which we sort of try and build BOTS now
again we shouldn't be overdoing it if
you think about it it's not about
writing up a story and trying to you
know find out stuff from it or find out
actions from it but what you can do is
you can use some of the cognitive
services that we've got behind the
scenes where you can maybe you know sign
up to one of the language ones and in
our case it's called language
understanding intelligence service or
Lewis that allows you to kind of process
natural language and and derive actions
from it so let's have a quick look at
that and do a quick demo on what that
actually looks like so I'll just quickly
switch over to my screen here so this is
this is a Lewis interface again just a
basic dashboard if I scroll down I've
got a bit of a look into you know what
how's my model being used you know what
were the top
in tents what were their top entities
and so on and so forth
but I'll keep it extremely basic so what
we do is to begin with we go to off to
intense which help us understand you
know what are we trying to achieve in
the specific utterance and the way we do
that is perhaps giving it a few samples
in my case I've given it about eight
different samples and what you also
notice is that for example in this case
I've got contact as one of the variables
and I've got message as the other
variable and whenever I've got that I
can go back to entities and I can
configure that stuff there as well so
I've got an entity for contact I've got
an entity for a message and from that
point on I can go off and train my
application and test out how it works so
let's take the example from the slide
deck itself which says tell one that I
am great job let's send it off and what
happens is that hopefully if internet
doesn't fail on me
all right let's try one other way of
doing it
so once you publish your your model
itself you can then go off and just make
a REST API call and that's what I'll do
in this case so I'll just go off and
write up a query saying hey till one day
I am awesome and I'll press ENTER so
then it goes off makes a rest call and
from the rest call itself what she's
notice is that it's able to then find
out that the top-scoring intent in that
case was to send a message and and the
entities that it found was the message
and the contacts in my case the message
was that and the contact of the person
there was born and similarly I can play
with it I can change the names I can
change the text and the idea is that
Lois will be able to detect that and
over time learn different patterns
because I can have the same outcome but
I might have a thousand different ways
of asking it so that's effectively what
NLP is trying to achieve its able to
help you branch off at the same time
find contextually relevant information
for that point in time cool so that
that's a little bit around natural
language and how that works or all
together but here's the thing right your
bot is not a human so you don't need to
pretend or you don't need your bot to
pretend like it's a human so it's it's
completely okay to be extremely
transactional at the same time be able
to derive you know the exact outcomes
with the help of NLP and NLP also
doesn't doesn't solve all your problems
right so forth for that scenario we've
got addition of some UX elements as well
where you can think of buttons and cards
and how you can improve user experiences
using buttons and cards as well and and
one of the things we noticed there is
that we often look at how we can use
some of those additional features of the
framework provides us to play with it so
let's let's have a quick look at how
that looks like and I'll quickly jump
over to my demos again awesome
and let's was it whoops
okay cool so that's that's my bot over
there let's just go off and I've got my
terminal here so I'll just quickly set
up a job here I'll just say hey node fjs
just press Enter it should hopefully
fire up so I've basically got a node.js
bought here which which is designed
towards help test scenarios I covered a
bunch of this stuff and a bunch of code
behind the scenes in my session on
Monday evening so if you get a chance
have a look at the recording for it but
for now what I'll do is I'll quickly go
off and connect to the board and I'll
show you a couple of things in there now
what you notice here is let me see if I
can zoom in so what you notice here is
that as soon as a joint I get a welcome
message that's predominantly very
text-based right if you compare that to
something like that so I'm just sending
a command I've got a bit of a catch
there that I'm catching every time so if
you think about the experience with a
rich card that looks like that with an
image with a bit of a display and a few
buttons it sort of really improved the
way you sort of are interacting with it
but because now if I'm using the bot for
the first time this is a really good way
of sort of getting on border to the
system itself and at the same time I can
carry out my tasks if I want to and and
what's what's good there is that
supposed to work but I wouldn't I
wouldn't want to debug it at this time
I think but anyway if I want to submit
her to get I could have just easily done
that but in this case the experience
didn't work but what is also interesting
is that apart from just having an image
and going down this path I can also do
something like that and hopefully I'll
see a welcome message that also has a
video behind it as well so what's good
and this is that you have that same
video that's working within the same
context and that card can run on
messenger can run on you know teams can
run on scar it can run anywhere wherever
your users are and you're able to sort
of embed a video as well so it's about
enhancing the experience maybe you want
to tell them about what an XYZ services
you've got a very already prepared for
that and you can play it from this
context my favorite one is this one I
hope it works where you know you can
even include gifts as well if you want
so again it gives you full flexibility
in the way you want to build stuff again
it this one is just a gift that's just a
mp4 video that I've got a link to and
that's just a image so you have these
different experiences and the way you
build them as well it's important to
understand that you know you are
actually building an experience that
sort of reduces the friction to entry as
well because it's a lot more easier for
me to type you know five or ten words
maybe maximum but if it's anything more
than that to answer my mind or get to an
outcome then you're better off using
buttons because that way you can guide
the user to an experience as well q so
let's switch back and what we notice
with cards is that and a lot of you
might already be you know using cards
and seeing cards without sort of
realizing it a lot and if you if you
think about it
some of the card experiences that you
got get in facebook is quite popular as
well and it was sort of a bit of a
change in the way content creators were
making their content available as well
where you've got this video card which
sits on you know Facebook and it looks
like a certain way if you take that card
out and if you think about the edge
browser itself the the card over there
is is showing the same content but
delivering it in a different way so
effectively you're trying to give an
experienced
very native to that specific you know
canvas itself similarly if you take that
card forward and to you know Skype
you've got a very native experience
there as well so what we're trying to
see there is that we actually want a car
that can scale across all these
platforms without us having to do the
basic you know work around you know
really being very targeted towards each
of the platforms and what we've noticed
is for example if you look at the Open
Graph stuff that that Facebook has this
is how you configure your web pages to
look pretty on on Facebook's you know
canvas itself and and there are some
benefits right if you create these
templates and if these vendors and if
these you know platform creators sort of
have their templates the best thing is
that the host applications which in this
case is Facebook for example or Twitter
or Instagram or whatever else they can
tightly control the kind of content
that's being displayed and they can be
very specific to the way they deliver
that content as well and for users it's
very flexible because since the host
apps are controlling the the templates
you get a much more native experience
you expect an experience on Facebook and
that's what you receive with a specific
car that you see on there and similarly
if you think about the way you know
content creators have to sort of build
content it's easy enough for them to
just follow a sample you know and just
replicate it across all their assets
that they've got across the board but
there are of course some challenges
there as well where every template needs
to be extremely specifically designed
and it needs to be implement in a very
very specific way that's been designed
by the host application so you know
Facebook has their own way of displaying
that content twitter has their own and
other other applications as well have
their own way of doing it and and the
best and the worst part is that for
content authors themselves or content
creators themselves they are very much
limited as type of content types they
have access to right where you might
have access to a news card or a video
card or maybe nowadays with BOTS and
stuff you have receipt cards so you have
cards for you know flights and
departures and stuff as well
now one thing that we've noticed is that
if you think about it the easiest way to
solve that problem could have been just
using HTML but again with a
Emilie's well they're just a whole host
of problem that you sort of then you
know bring into play where if you bring
in HTML you think about do you really
need CSS or do you need to think about
you know how easy it is for a user to
customize it and what's the cost of sic
being secured at the same time you know
delivering an experience that that may
not be extremely useful for the user
towards the end of that experience so
it's really important to understand that
while having some benefits of you know
allowing html5 or HTML itself there are
a lot lot more costs or you know that
sort of diminished the kind of returns
that you might want to get out of it but
if only they could have been another way
as well to kind of improve that
experience and and so you know finding
that middle ground between having these
fixed templates and having these
canvases that are very very flexible
with HTML where you essentially don't
end up with any consistency so how can
we sort of merge though together
so let me just show you a couple of
quick demos and I'll explain what that
actually is after that let's switch over
I'll just wait for my computer to get
back awesome so what we've done is we've
got a little demo here that looks like
that so in this demo what you'll notice
is that there is a card which is quite
similar to the card that I showed you
previously in the previous demo as well
but in this case I can say hey where can
I go for scuba diving so in this case
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
show you some of the rich functionality
that you can potentially add into your
bought as well so in this case I'm just
simply sending in a query and off the
back of that I get a nice carousel of
different locations where we could
potentially go for scuba diving as well
and maybe I want to select the
adventureworks one I select that one and
as you notice I'm using those
interactive buttons but on top of that
what if you want to actually make that
experience a lot more you know unique
where you can actually click on any one
of those scenic locations maybe I'll
click on
the alkie Beach and from that point on
if you notice this card suddenly allows
me to input as well so I don't have to
type in always if I want I can type in
but maybe I could just use the
functionality that's provided out of the
box within those cards as well and if
you take it forward what if those cards
could potentially have a calendar in
them as well and again if you notice I
am still in a conversational state this
this website is not doing anything it's
just giving me a way of showing a web
chat control now again I can just select
a date hit next and then it goes off
asks me some more questions and I can
say hey this is what I want am i
allergic to anything maybe I'm allergic
to seafood I can go off hit next and as
you notice maybe I'm just filling a form
but in this way I can be a lot more it's
a lot more easier to give that
experience back I can give in my name I
can give in my email address and I can
give it a phone number as well and one
more thing that you'll notice is that
it'll do some validation as well off the
back of it so it knows that the number
is not valid so I need to complete that
field hit next and hopefully it grabs
that information and it gives me an
information card there as well and as
you notice I've got a rich card
underneath it as well which talks to me
about how the weather forecast looks
like so this is this is all around user
experience it's all about how can you
make it easier how can you reduce the
amount of times people tap on the screen
because that's effectively what we're
trying to achieve here again in some
cases for example if you think about you
know how many people are going with you
maybe in some in those cases you might
not need that you know flexibility
around tapping on to that card itself
and it might be easy just to type in
that number but for some other instances
where you for example have to select
your you know diet requirements and
stuff it becomes a lot more flexible in
those scenarios and and what we've
called them is adaptive cards because
they adapt to the sort of environment
they're around and and what we've done
is this is a fully open source project
that is scalable across a lot of
platforms we're working towards making
it available on a whole bunch of
platforms today it supports Skype on the
browser side it supports
it's about to support team very soon as
well we're trying to work on getting
support out for Android and iOS and
other platforms as well and what is
interesting is that you can do a whole
lot more with that so if you click on
you know for example set due date you
can have these you know show up flags as
well where maybe that that part of that
message was hidden but whenever you
click on them it sort of becomes
available and gives you a much more
easier experience to deal with another
one that I like quite a lot is the
flight update and since there's a flight
update one we've got a bit of a
visualizer as well where you can go in
and actually try out different things
and one of the things that we've done
with the design guideline itself is to
you know help you understand or help you
improve the way you display information
across those canvases and make it as
fiction free as possible so in my case
maybe I want to you know pick up on this
delayed sign over here and instead of
delayed I say hey maybe it's on time and
if it's on time I want to change my
color combination I'll just zoom in from
attention to maybe everything's good and
if I go good you'll notice that this
color goes green or maybe if I'm
following the pattern of the platform or
the host application I can go back and
maybe just call it accent and what
happens with accent is that just
defaults back to whatever the accent of
that specific platform is so maybe on
skype you know it's got blue because the
whole thing is blue over there
I can then enable a whole bunch of other
platforms as well off the back of it
right but for example today Facebook
doesn't support it we just convert that
into an image and render it on Facebook
Messenger so it's just as easy as that
you've got this very interesting way of
displaying information and you'll notice
that we've got the speak button at the
bottom as well because this platform is
driven you know which speech was driven
with speech from day one itself since
it's sort of inception so you've got a
whole lot of an interesting stuff here
there's a whole lot of documentation on
how these the schema works and how you
can play with it as well so I'll really
recommend you to have a bit of a play
with it and if you think about the
scenario that I was showing you before
with the
with the information around helpdesk
scenarios as well maybe when I complete
a task if I want to make a call to an
adaptive card template this is what it
looks like so I just say hey before
sending the message just make sure you
attach adaptive card to that message and
you call the create a card method and
from the create a card method I call a
file that looks like this it's just a
JSON file with a bit of a schema
information and a whole bunch of
information on how you want to display
that information display the text or
display the images and so on and so
forth
in my case you'll notice that I've got a
bunch of variables that I'm trying to
dynamically you know display as I render
that card from my bot itself and if I
show you one of the interesting toolings
that that we've been working on as well
as if you're using visual studio code
you could use one of the adaptive cards
visualizer directly from visual studio
code so if I just do ctrl shift we
control shift we a oops what's happened
there we go so there you go so you've
got a real-time kind of visualizer on
the side as well where while your sort
of you know developing whatever you're
trying to develop you can still say you
know whatever changes you want to make
to it so effectively it sort of is
updating in real time it gives you that
whole flexibility of changing your car
looking at how it is you know being
visualized without having to go between
different toolsets and stuff so it's
really really interesting how that stuff
is coming up cool so let's head back and
switch over to slides again anything
and so as I said earlier you know this
stuff is very very new and we've just
call it adaptive cards all of you can
just go to adaptive cards or IO it's an
open-source project and with it with an
idea of really delivering an experience
that is consistent across multiple
platforms in the way you expect them to
be so with the idea being that you kind
of write those templates once and you
get them to write once and and and as a
framework itself adaptive cards help you
adapt to each of the the platforms or
the hosted applications where your cars
are being hosted at so essentially it's
just a new way of exchanging information
which allows content creators to you
know probably just reuse a bunch of
stuff that they write once and make it
available everywhere and effectively you
know if you look at the slide that I had
before the demo itself you know it's
just trying to give you a much more
flexible canvas where you know the host
sort of maintains a very strong control
the host applications like Facebook and
Twitter
it still has a very strong control on
the way you render those cards but at
the same time as content creators it
gives us the flexibility of you know
creating content once again just
reiterating on those points as well but
one of the biggest parts of it is that
you know it's it's quite it's purely
declarative right so you don't have to
really worry about how you store them
how you render them and stuff because
everything's you know provided through
the framework and we maintain that stuff
behind the scenes so with adaptive cost
today through the bot framework itself
we support all those platforms and we
have more coming as well and we're
trying to partner up with more but
you'll also notice the same stuff coming
into Windows 10 as well with toast
notifications with the new timeline
features and stuff as well so you'll see
a lot of this adaptive card stuff being
quite ubiquitous across most of our
platforms and I believe we're working
with platforms like croak kick and and
GroupMe and stuff to actually make this
available soon and as I said if the
platform's don't supported today we just
render it as an image and make it
available on their platform so that was
a little bit so what we've sort of
talked about so far has been around you
know what why are we using BOTS why is
there a bit of a hyper on them but at
the same time look at
natural language helps us branch out to
specific scenarios that we're trying to
solve but at the same time we look into
how adaptive cars are helping us render
information that makes it a lot more
easier to you know consume as consumers
and create as creators but at the same
time for host applications to have a
consistent method of displaying that as
well and let's talk a little bit about
the way you know the framework and
tooling sort of came into being as well
has anyone used the bot framework before
in this room just a quick show of hands
okay all right okay five six seven
people cool and and essentially what you
were looking to do is write whenever
you're thinking about building a bot you
don't really care how the comms happen
between the user or the messaging
platform itself if you've got a bot you
know you're hosting it somewhere you've
got an end point to it and once you have
an end point you're just looking to
communicate back and forth between the
messaging platform itself if you take
our helpdesk scenario into being itself
you've got a bunch of dialogues that are
sort of being exchanged between the bot
and the user so what you really care
about is the exchange between that sort
of specific domain you don't really care
how messenger is is you know serving up
their users because that is something
from message and to handle but for you
to handle or for you to managers about
the communication between the bot and
the platform itself and so the way you
kind of think about it is for example if
I'm aboard I'm maybe starting off with a
greeting to begin with from that point
on I think about getting a response from
the user that helped me branch down to a
specific you know dialogue and we've
seen that through Lois which allows us
to extract the intent and the entities
to get first of all understand where we
want to be and second of all get some
context around the information that
we're looking to get out of it and once
we receive that information you know it
might be incomplete as I said before and
that's where NLP sort of starts to kick
in where you either grab all the
entities I grab some of them that that
are required but you're looking for some
more information to get a bit more
context around it as well so then you
ask for a response which then leads you
to actually extract you know for example
in this case was priority
and by just saying you know ASAP as one
of the keywords Louis was able to assign
a high priority to that support ticket
and if you move it forward you know you
can use things like sentiment analysis
on top as well which was not possible
before because you just didn't have
enough context you don't have enough
data to sort of derive you know
sentiment out of the conversation that a
user was having with your applications
before and what and how we sort of you
know really componentize them is by this
construct of dialogues where effectively
you have this larger bot or this larger
dialogue which has a bunch of sub
dialogues underneath it and that
architecture helps you scale out a
different you know methods and different
scenarios across across the
functionality of the system itself and
so if you think about it you know you
need a toolkit that can help you deliver
some of those results right we've got
Lewis which helps us with a bit of
branching but if you need a bit of a
toolkit that can actually understand or
give you the basic framework to create
you know conversational applications and
if you think about it you know each of
the messaging platforms will have their
own panes but the consistency over there
would be your bought and your user
towards the end and to sort of remove
the frictions from these different
platforms trying to you know engage with
your bot we've got the connector server
sitting in Azure as well which allows
you to kind of have direct communication
between you know as a bot developer all
I really care about is the way I'd build
my board the way I handle conversations
and the way the users respond so in that
case what we've done is we've build this
connector service that sort of takes
that burden away from managing those
different interfaces between web
services and again if you want you can
host them wherever you want you can add
some persistence to it and you can do a
whole bunch of stuff but what is
interesting is that we're looking in a
bit of a shift around the way we develop
software as well or the way we develop
app or deliver apps where all of the
stuff that that'd be right for BOTS is
you know if you think about it the
context that I had in a few of my demos
earlier as well where I was you know
demoing the scuba-dive bought for
example it wasn't really maintaining a
state at all for that session you might
maintain some
date in terms of preferences location
you know some contextual information but
you don't maintain a session state
anymore because dialogues essentially
are serialized so that way you don't
really care about what the stack was if
you stop at dialogue number four or step
number four you start from there on
whenever the user responds back so you
don't really have to care about those
things because the frame works there to
handle that for you and this slide kind
of just depicts or reinforces on you
know the way we think about developing
BOTS because at the end of the day
you're just building a bot which is a
web service it's got an end point to it
it's using a couple of SDKs in our case
we call it the bot builder SDK which is
again fully open source we support node
and and and c-sharp today but there's a
lot of community work happening across
multiple languages and since the
framework is you know gives you enough
of a surface to plug in different things
as well you can again being a web
service you can plug in whatever API is
you want whatever databases you want
whatever cognitive services you want and
stuff so it gives you that whole
flexibility across multiple dimensions
when you're building your bot itself
speech is a big part of it so whenever
you're building a bot think about how
you can integrate speech you know
Cortana or Alexa is a very very
interesting you know shift towards
delivering those experiences as well and
it's good to be able to prepare for
those different form factors of
delivering experiences and I guess if
you if you think about the way I've
talked about different scenarios and the
way I've shown you my demos as well it's
been quite similar to the way we are
developing apps today or the way we are
developing websites today we're in this
case for our apps in the past there used
to be a screen but today we've got
dialogues so maybe you start at the root
which used to be the main screen but now
you are probably trying to go into a
very specific dialogue that delivers a
very specific result from a different
dialogue similar to the way we've been
delivering web experiences or app
experiences so it's it's it's all quite
similar it's just about just giving a
different dimension to the way you're
developing applications and as I said
before you know everything is handled by
the framework in terms of maintaining a
stack because the way you know you
serialize your classes everything else
sort of just starts from the point where
it's stopped before so it becomes a lot
more easier but again you need to handle
some of the complexities as well around
the way you design those experiences
without making it you know without
having too much mortality between them
as well because those things can become
complex if you start branching down to
multiple dialogues you have to sort of
become smarter in the way you design
them the most common pattern that I see
is for example if the domain gets too
big or if the canvas gets too big you
start you know developing sub BOTS as
well so you have a plethora of BOTS
across all of your systems and you have
this big parent bot that can talk to all
these children bots and you have a very
smooth handover as well in that so
really really interesting I guess
frameworks in there but again one thing
that I notice a lot is people say hey
why do we need buttons when we're trying
to have a conversation right but think
about it this way when someone just
enters a bot conversation and they don't
know what to do
they just type in hey or say hi or just
start the greeting and if you don't give
them a goodies experience at that point
in time it's really hard to retain them
because again I only know what I know
about that bot which is just the name
probably so you need to think about not
just onboarding customers but retaining
them as well so onboarding for example
can be handled by having a guided
conversation where you can start with
higher level categories then go down to
subcategories and stuff just like an app
but maybe a power user might come back
with a specific you know thing that
they're looking to achieve out of the
bot at that point in time so more often
than not people either forget the latter
or the former but the important thing
notice that both of them are important
because that's how you deliver an
experience that helps users guide to the
place they probably want to be and they
don't know how to get there and again
one more thing to reinforce is that try
and not to you know over complicate
things as well again if you look at any
of the conversational canvases that I've
showed so far a lot of them are not
encrypted they don't have encrypted
end-to-end chat so that means you
probably wouldn't want to have passwords
you know being talked over the phone or
being
Sharyn in a text conversation similarly
you don't want to be playing a game if
you think about it right it's just not
the best way to handle conversations you
know a controller might be a better way
of doing it and again in my talk on on
Monday I covered a bunch of those
scenarios where potentially if you've
got simple FAQ stuff or if you want to
just test out the waters and see if a
bot would be a right fit for whatever
scenario you have in mind
Q&amp;amp;A maker is a great starting point for
it
you can extend that knowledgebase
scenarios by using some database
technologies and some search
technologies because more often than not
what we end up when we're talking to
customers is that maybe they're trying
to build something to solve a problem
that's not resolved by a bot because at
the end of the day boss just an app
right
they sometimes some customers think that
perhaps having a bot will improve their
search systems which is not the case
right you need to sort of really
abstract those systems out and think
about them separately functionality
being different to the way you deliver
those experiences so important to
understand that back-channel is very
exciting where you could introduce your
bots in mobile apps as well so a classic
example could be if you're an insurance
company if you're a bank if you're if
you're a bank itself you can perhaps use
your existing app you know investments
and perhaps introduce a personal
assistant or a concierge service there
as well while maintaining a secured
canvas there itself without having to
you know expose that information through
messenger or through other other mediums
as well again the most popular one is
you know if you're in helpdesk scenarios
if you're in customer service scenarios
the most popular one is how do you hand
off to a human again a bunch of stuff is
already there there's a lot of open
source code as well I've uploaded a
bunch of code to my github as well so
I'll share a link to that later on but
in summary I guess what I wanted to sort
of cover off is is that whatever I've
talked about so far today a lot of that
stuff is available through some of our
new documentation especially the new
design documentation again everything
that sort of we've covered so far you
know a lot of that stuff is
part of the documentation so if you're
thinking about you know building
applications that are perhaps
interacting with user in a certain way
or if you want to debate between the way
you give a welcome message you know how
do you interact with dialogues and stuff
a whole lot of good information is
available there but at the end of the
day right if you're thinking about
building BOTS there are a couple of
different changes that you might have to
bring to the way you're delivering apps
today where you know everything is
probably becoming a lot more stateless
in terms of maintaining State for the
session or for that conversation stack a
lot of that stuff has been taken away
it's it's sort of now part of the
framework to handle that for you and if
you want to store any contextual
information you persist it outside of of
the bot itself again it's just a web
service right so if you think about
scalability in fact if you think about
just anything if you think about you
know CIC D pipelines whatever else it's
just a web service so you handle it just
the way you handle it today and as I
said earlier you could use some of the
cognitive services like Lewis or you
know speed services or knowledge
services to actually infuse intelligence
into your conversations as well but you
know at the end of the day we're not
here to sort of solve all the problem of
the world all the problems of the world
right humans will still be complex you
know random perhaps sometimes illogical
as well so you have to cater to all
those scenarios when you're building
something but that's the whole fun of it
again extremely early days right I've
shown a couple of scenarios already in
the demo so far where you baby you we
were using natural language we were
using dialogues we were trying to really
understand the relationship between
users and the bot and and the framework
and the platform and so on at the same
time if you think about channels right
those messaging platforms are just
available everywhere and and since again
early days we're still figuring it out
not a lot of BOTS out there are actually
that effective so it's just about having
fun and building with really really cool
stuff so I've uploaded all my demos and
and I'll upload my slides from today as
well on to github as well so
feel free to you know have a look at it
it's got all the code from all my demos
as well so if you just want to download
them play with them
it's it's a good space to be and again
if you've got any questions I think
we've got the next ten minutes or so to
answer them as well but again thanks for
coming last session of the conference I
appreciate your time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
