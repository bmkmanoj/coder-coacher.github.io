Sunday afternoon
what was your mood were you like it
really happy loving my Sunday this is
awesome absolutely awesome or were you
more like my make a see on his 7230
seventh day of work just going oh it's a
Sunday afternoon which means it's Monday
tomorrow oh not cool Casey was clearly
suffering from a case of smun days the
moment when Sunday stops feeling like a
Sunday and the anxiety of a Monday kicks
in I am here to help you not have
Monday's they suck your workplace might
look like a Dilbert cartoon you might
have a pointy head boss you might have
the finance troll you might have a deal
but you might be doing it yourself
workplaces can suck and I can swear in
this because my son's not here now why
do they suck why do we feel like
understand.i afternoon now there was a
really interesting study done by Gallup
they're a global research firm and they
surveyed a hundred and forty countries
for their 2013 state of the global
workplace report and they came up with
some really interesting stats they were
able to divide employees into three
different areas the first were happy
employees these guys were engaged they
loved what they did they contributed
positively to their company but they
only represented 13% of the total
workforce so that's
1 right the rest of you not very happy
the second group these are the people
the case sees of the world
hi got to work because it's what I did
yesterday
it's what I'm doing today it's what I'll
do tomorrow it's you know sure you do it
because you have to represented 63% of
total global employees so the majority
of us and but the even scarier part were
these guys the not engaged employees 24
percent of employees were deemed to be
not engaged now they outnumber happy
people by two to one imagine the damage
that these guys could cause in your
organization these people are so unhappy
that they will undermine what the happy
people are doing now there are some
really interesting examples when I was
researching for this and you know you
google unhappy employees there's some
really bizarre stories that come up one
of them was he worked for a UK grocery
store called Asda and he was so unhappy
that he would play cricket with the
merchandise this is the in a grocery
store he slashed his colleagues coats
and furniture in the staff breakout room
he picked up store produce and in this
case it was a raw chicken picked it up
off the shelf opened it licked it put it
back on and put it back on the shelf
there's also footage of him stomping on
produce on shelves now it sounds gross I
don't know why I'd want to lick a raw
chicken but the worst part about it
wasn't the fact that someone lived
abroad chicken it was that they didn't
find out about it and she until two
years after he left so disgruntled
employees can do some incredible damage
now I was one of these unhappy people I
wasn't a stomping chicken like
I didn't do anything to sabotage my
company but I was unhappy my heart rate
on a Sunday afternoon was not exactly
relaxed I wasn't exactly oh you know
skip being on my way to work on a Monday
morning I was grumpy cat and my husband
can attest to this and it's kind of good
that he's not in the audience because
he'd be like yeah she was and so what I
wanted to do was share a little story
with you it's something that is very
close to my heart workplace happiness I
worked for a company for well I've been
in corporate property for nearly 20
years
and I worked for the one company for
about 12 years
loved what I did initially I had great
promotions I was the director I was
doing really well but over time I
started to see things change and they
started well my first aha moment was
when I saw fake flowers in fake water at
reception I didn't even know he could
get fake water but you can and that was
when it really hit home that they're
putting profits before people who puts
bloody fake flowers in fake water at
reception what message is that sending
to employees and to clients and it was
just an aha moment for me the culture
just wasn't right anymore
my second aha moment came when I got a
new role within that company and I had a
pointy head boss now this guy was a
fabulous technical person it's great at
what he did but he was a pretty horrid
people manager he was a
passive-aggressive micro manager who did
not know how to get the best out of
employees now that's not to say that all
managers are bad people they just don't
know how to manage employees they
how to get the best out of their
employees there's something called the
Peter Principle management theory and
it's where the people are promoted based
on their ability to do their current job
not the job that they're going to be
promoted to now when they're promoted to
that job that might include managing
people there might be crap at managing
people so we end up having people
promoted into jobs that they can't do
and they're essentially rising to the
level of their incompetence so I decided
to do something about it and you know I
actually I'll tell you another story
before that it was my aha moment arrived
when my boss apologized for being a dick
and that was two days after he had a go
at me for absolutely no reason and I'm
like you know what it's too late you you
can't you can't come back from being a
dick you shouldn't have done it in the
first place there are constructive ways
of discussing things I'm the kind of
person who needs constructive feedback I
don't have a thick skin and he just
didn't understand that so when he
apologized for being a dick people would
say well yeah he apologized like yeah
but he should have said it in the first
place
because I felt so demotivated so
uninspired and I was Casey so it started
affecting my health my family in my
relationship and so when it saw my local
GP and she prescribed me stress leave
and Valium now when is it okay for you
to need drugs to get through your
workday it's just not cool
this was my aha moment and I made a
solemn promise to myself that I would do
something about it before I finished the
bottle
thank God I did now I am giving away
free stuff in this seminar this season's
isn't some of it sorry
and to that point as a parent what kind
of legacy was I leaving for my kids you
know that mummy needs drugs to be able
to go to work and it wasn't just about
it wasn't about thriving it was about
surviving and I couldn't just hang in
there baby I left I had to and I'm now
on a journey to bring workplace
happiness out of the clouds and into
reality that's my job now I'm an
aspiring chief happiness officer I'm
absolutely passionate about what I do
and I really hope today that you're able
to take away some some tools and tips
that will help you be more inspired at
work so why should we care we should
care because happy workers are 31% more
productive and three times more creative
now most of my talk is focused on
employees but are there any managers of
people a few message directly for you
guys put workplace happiness on the
agenda 31% increase in your team's
productivity if they are happy it's a
given you don't need to do much so to
that end what if I got when you go grab
yourselves some free stuff that's out
there as a reminder to those managers in
particular so how do we do it it's not
just a case of putting a fishbowl on
your desk and going oh nothing creative
now nothing or putting in one of these
and going oh aren't we so fun was such a
fun company we care about our employees
she doesn't she she doesn't look happy
like here this is fun it's great
could try that these guys my favorite
Don the spandex let's go for a
conference ride yeah if that floats you
vote that's absolutely fine but what we
need to do is think outside the box now
we live in a world where it's acceptable
for work to interrupt our personal time
but we're not as comfortable when
personal time interrupts work just let
that sink in for a moment because the
impact that that has is profound it's
stopping you from doing the things that
make you happy they give you positivity
boosts throughout the day now
our minds have limited mental bandwidth
you know there's only so much that we
can cram into our brain and for many
women out there as soon as you have kids
that diminishes baby brain just gets you
but when we feel to that everything is
too hectic our mood sours and our
performance slumps and in this day and
age it is the quality of your thinking
that matters it's not who stays the
longest in the office it's the output
and that's the shift that we need to
have now quality thinking is directly
tied to energy levels so it's really
important that we do take time out
because this is an interruption culture
now I know someone who is absolutely
brilliant at taking time out he works
extremely hard but understands the
importance of chilling out now these are
not my legs but does anyone know whose
they are it would be my husband Troy's
see it's the only time I can get him
back now the first survival tactic that
we'll go through is to invest in your
own well-being and the first step in
doing this is to listen to your body
consider what our bodies are originally
and to do hunting-gathering running
around think of what we do now we spend
most of our time sitting in front of the
computer and you've probably heard that
the saying sitting is the new smoking
and things like that sitting is not good
for us for prolonged periods we need to
restore the balance how do we do that we
do that by stepping outside now we know
that exercise is good for us exercise
can be better than prescription
medication than antidepressants all it
takes is two three minutes prints and
you can boost your memory by 20% that's
not bad
30 minutes on a treadmill can improve
your performance for a full two hours
afterwards now it's easier said than
done to go out and get exercise because
we also are very busy go and have a
walking meeting do something different
the crux here is to make sure that
you're doing what works for you
so to replenish productivity step
outside just like Troy it's very good at
doing now sound is a surprising
influencer of creativity it's there was
a study that was done that showed that
background noise can actually improve
our focus because we're trying to filter
it out and we're actively trying to
filter it out but it does improve our
focus it can help our concentration so
if we're sitting in a cafe we can
actually and have that ambient
background noise we can actually be more
productive just the way our brain is
wired now I wrote this presentation and
a number of other presentations to Carl
Franklin's music to code by it's anyone
heard of that I love it because it's
just great instrumental but I also think
of it as a good reminder to stop every
now and then so the tracks are about 20
to 30 minutes long so when it finishes
it's a signal to me to get up step
outside go for a walk do something
because
is the new smoking now it's 214 on a
Thursday afternoon you're stifling a
yawn you automatically reach for a
coffee
but there's something better out there
that doesn't have the addictive
qualities of coffee it improves your
memory improves creativity improves
performance and improves your mood any
idea what it might be and for those who
saw my talk yesterday don't cheat water
it's an idea green tea valium no it's
having in that although you might want
to find somewhere more comfortable than
this guy but a 20 to 30 minute rest
recharges our batteries and it enables
us just to relax to absorb what we've
taken and to just chill out
it's called consolidating and it's
becoming more acceptable which is
fabulous because I like my Nana naps
I've got two kids I love mine M&amp;amp;Ms and
just a 20 30 minute nap is all you need
and there are sleep pods that companies
are now starting to introduce and even
access to local spas so that they can
employees can go and have a lie down so
the next time your manager says I need
something done right now it's it's due
at the end of the day you can say yep
just a moment I'm just going to go have
a nap first so there's no need to keep
drugging your body which is essentially
what we're doing with caffeine we're
using a stimulant to try to keep us
going use a natural stimulant and take a
nap and finally how many of us check our
phones after leaving work or all
someone's pointing you've been dogged in
now why don't we do this we're feeling
it helps us feel important it helps us
feel productive it helps us feel that we
need it but it comes at a cost
because it breeds it's perpetual sense
of stress this perpetual sense of
urgency and when we can't fully log off
we can't fully recover so how can we be
expected to perform at our peak all the
time if we don't allow ourselves to
switch off now there are some companies
that recognize the benefit of this and
have introduced blackout policies so
after 6 or 7 o'clock at night you are
not able to send emails one companies
even introduced an incentive where they
give employees seven and a half thousand
dollars per year to go on a family
holiday on the proviso that they don't
do any work that wouldn't be bad at all
it's an idea for plural son so the CEO
actually says we will be a better
company if employees disconnect now I am
trying to practice what I preach so it's
not the most flattering photo but that
was me in June I spoke at my very first
international conference it was NDC in
Oslo I was shitting myself and I needed
to this is me two hours before my speech
I gave this this particular presentation
it's a really nice massage chair but it
helped me to disconnect now the second
element is to do random acts of kindness
this is really close to my heart because
kindness is contagious and research
shows that when we kind it creates a
ripple effect to three degrees of
separation so to your friends friends
friends and how much nicer would the
workplace be and life in general if we
were all a little nicer to each other I
love that so how can we do that here's
some ideas
handwritten thank-you notes something
that I do for my clients that I
absolutely love and I'll tell you a
little story
actually I but the night before I came
here I flew down here from the Gold
Coast I received a letter we don't get
letters very often these days and inside
it's a very nice card and a note now it
wasn't handwritten because this person
said their handwriting sucks so he typed
it two pages now I don't know this
person
I've only conversed with him on Twitter
and so is my husband but this was a
thank you no thanking my husband and I
for the work that we do and he said in
this that he's been trying to find his
our home omens and they came when his
wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer
late last year so to hear things like
finding your heart and making sure that
you're happy in what you do at work was
something that really resonated with him
and I was sitting on the stairs in my
house at 9:30 at night the kids were
asleep and I was bawling because I was
so touched he said Kylie I need like
this because of what you promote so
that's the power of handwriting thank
you notes because it's stuff I'm going
to frame that and put that in my office
at home so that when I'm having a down
day I can read that and it just lifts me
so that was just a little personal thing
you can write a welcome message on a
whiteboard
when you leave your when you leave a
meeting room why don't you leave a nice
little message for the next people to
come in pay it forward coffee although I
had an interesting incident where I was
having a really bad day and I like doing
around a mexicanos because it makes me
feel good which is kind of the wrong
karma I should be doing it because it's
good for someone else now I went to a
bakery and I was buying a loaf of bread
there was a gel
next to me and I said oh I'll buy your
life of bread for you you know I think
of it as a random act of kindness just
pay it forward and he goes I'm kind to
everyone okay all right so I can
backfire if you've got the wrong
intentions it was purely to make me feel
good so that was a lesson learned you
can bring in some morning tea for the
team I wouldn't mind having that
how about acknowledged great work you
can send a note to maybe someone's
manager a handwritten note to someone's
manager saying hey this person's done a
great job and you can keep a gratitude
Journal now before you poopoo this the
science behind it that shows that this
works if you keep a handwritten because
you retain you retain the information
longer if you handwrite it if you keep a
gratitude Journal for two weeks
studies show that you are more satisfied
with life you are happier you are more
productive you are less stressed and you
actually get less illness people
reported having less headaches so keep a
gratitude journal now as a random act of
kindness today in the room I have
planted some sneaky cards so have a look
on the side for those people who can I
have a bad back so there's only so far I
could I could stick things but have a
look on the side and see look there's
one hey you found the other one so these
you know bit sneaky they called sneaky
cards and there's a red random act of
kindness for you and these sneaky cards
are actually quite funny because it's
like an interactive global scavenger
hunt that it's there to inspire
creativity and fun so there's all sorts
of cards in there and it can be things
like you know do or pay it forward
coffee and when you do that you can scan
it and you can see who else has done
that in the
and you can actually track all these
random acts of kindness it's actually
quite cool so you've checked on do you
see well done the third element is
connecting with you colleagues now hands
up who has the best mate at work one two
someone's not sure right three so not
very many people the people that have
their hands in the air
are up to 50 percent happier at work
than the rest of us are you guys mates
right you've got an interesting
workplace so when we work with people
that we like or that we connect with
we're more productive and we're happier
because a we feel like that person has
got our back so we're less stressed B
you can have bad sure and get someone in
the head mmm have fun and do what you
guys do and we don't want to let down
our mates so when we do have friends at
work we are happier and more productive
now I did mention it boosts up by 50%
and there's a case study because even
you know as I mentioned I bring
workplace happiness out of the clouds
because it's not this Airy fairy thing
there is science to it MIT did a study
of IBM of 2,600 employees to understand
the power of social interaction and they
did it for a whole year so it's a really
big study that they did and what MIT
were doing where they were using
algorithms and formulas to identify and
analyze the size of employees address
books the number of contacts that they
had now they found that the more
socially connected the employee was the
better they performed and they were able
to monetize it for every additional
social contact that an employee had it
generated 948 dollars in extra revenue
that's not bad not a bad return is it so
this is the power
social connections you can monetize it
so the next time you're around them
water cooler and your boss says get back
to work you can say no I'm making an
extra nine hundred and forty eight
dollars for the company but friendships
don't emerge when we're buried in code
or in spreadsheets they emerge in the
times between work
so before meetings or after meetings or
around the coffee machine or photocopier
and what I'd like you to consider as
well is yes it takes time to develop
these relationships but it's really
important and really valuable Google and
Facebook understand the importance of
these social interactions because they
encourage something called the bump
factor may be very careful how I say
that the bump factor and what they try
and do is encourage people to have these
informal connections so they will
strategically place coffee machines in
particular parts of the office and
generally they're less coffee machines
so you get more people using them and
have this interaction so that they can
encourage creative thinking spark ideas
the CEO isn't the CEO is just or she's
just another person grabbing a coffee
they're more approachable the number one
reason why people leave their job is
because of their boss yeah I know that
first and now there's something called
the the vertical couple and the
relationship that you have with your
boss will be the most important
relationship that you have in the office
because these people directly influence
your productivity and they also
influence the amount of time that you
stay at the job if you don't like your
boss you're not going to stay in your
job for very long now Gallup once again
fabulous research firm found that US
companies lose three hundred and sixty
billion dollars per annum in lost
productivity because of poor
relationship between employee and
manager
is 360 billion dollars in lost
productivity because employees and
managers don't talk don't get along the
managers are a pointy head boss or they
don't understand how their employees are
motivated so advice for you going out
into the real world after this consider
consider the relationship that you have
with your manager if it's not a good one
see if you can take them out for a
coffee or write the map handwritten
thank-you note if they do something nice
now the best net leaders know that but
pointy-head bosses don't the next
element is to use it use your strengths
because whenever we use our strengths we
experience a burst of positivity how do
you feel when you're doing your work do
you feel good I'm seeing some nods and
I'm seeing some and I'm seeing a bit in
the middle
every time we use our strengths as we
see here we experience a burst of
positivity but it's important for us to
focus on our strengths on improving our
strengths rather than trying to work on
our weaknesses there's more evidence to
suggest that you will get greater
benefit from improving your strengths
than focusing on weaknesses so
particularly for those who are in
training and the manager might say oh
this person's really crap at
communication well what are they what
are they good at focus on that you'll
get a much better return now I had to
take stock of this when preparing for
this talk because clearly I am NOT an IT
person I am a soft skills person and it
can be quite daunting coming in and
because I don't know how you guys are
going to react I don't know
if no one's going to turn up I'm not
gonna know if I'm gonna fall off the
stage there's all sorts of things that
could go wrong but I chose to focus on
the reasons why the
we'll go well and it's a power of
positivity I've done it so much research
I've practiced and I'm passionate about
what I do and by focusing on the reasons
why things will succeed it makes the
potentials diminish the potential issues
diminish now you need to remind yourself
of the skills that you have and that was
what I was doing today and in my very
first international talk but so many of
our talents go untapped or we don't even
know what they are but there is help out
there there are some really good books
one of them is once again by Gallup I'm
not sponsored by Gallup strengths finder
2.0 this was also available online as an
online assessment search inside yourself
which is a Google book written by
Google's former jolly good fellow that
is a actual job title and what color's
your parachute that's an oldie but a
goodie and the new edition has just been
released so there's some handy tools
that can help you uncover your strengths
if you're not sure what they are I'd
like to try a little experiment with you
I think you guys will be up for it let's
give it a go right when I count to three
I'd like you to close your eyes and sing
in your head
I made the mistake once of not pointing
that out row row row your boat when you
get to the end start again
keep going until I say stop
three two one go
and open your eyes well done guys how
long do you think that experiment lasted
yell out some seconds 2 minutes 1 minute
50 seconds 40 seconds someone came in
now each person experiences the reality
of time differently those who thought
that it was a complete waste of time and
hate row row row your boat probably
thought that it went longer than it
actually did it went for 55 seconds the
people that enjoyed it the opportunity
just to relax would have thought that it
went longer because time floats short it
could be consigned flies when you're
having fun doesn't consider this in the
context of work now we have all like
doing this in matings haven't we they
just some of them absolutely suck now
you may have decided in the first 30
seconds of that meeting that you do not
need to be there or that the objective
of the meeting is not going to be met or
that it's crap or that you it's just not
gonna happen you might just go I really
don't need to be here so for the next
hour or two that you are in that meeting
it will feel like the longest and most
unproductive and unmotivated you're
sitting there just going oh it's
ridiculous that happens so often so one
of the tools that you can do is to see
that time as a chance to learn put on
some rose-colored glasses and have a
think about what you can learn from the
meeting that you're in now it might be
that you
don't like the color blue that they've
used in their PowerPoint presentation it
might be that you know the socks he's
socks don't match so mental note you
look like an idiot food sucks so much it
might be that you would choose to handle
the discussion in a different way or you
would have answered that question more
constructively anything anything that
you can learn during that time because
that time if you see it as a gift it
become it doesn't become a demotivating
waste of your time so it all comes down
to adopting a positive mindset there's
something called the lazada line which
very clever psychologist called Marshall
asada developed now he did for many
decades mathematical modeling and
research on the power of positivity and
the impact and correlation between
positive and negative interactions and
he found that for every tree that it
made that little let me try again he
found that three you needed three
positive experiences to fend off the
effect of one negative one three
positive to one negative four below that
line called the lazada line and that's
when your performance of your team will
suffer ideally you would like six to one
ratio so you want six positive
interactions for every one negative
interaction to get the best performance
out of your team now we all know that I
was the proverbial frog failing to jump
out of the slowly heating water let's
have a think about what we need at work
in order to thrive and there's a really
clever guy called Dan pink you guys
might have heard fume is anyone familiar
with his book Drive couple he talks
about the it's the surprising truth
about what motivates us and there are
three elements that he discusses the
first
being purpose can you see the impact
that your role has to the company or to
the greater community mastery can you
play to your strengths and we know that
when we are able to play to our
strengths we experience a burst of
positivity autonomy do you have control
over your work how you work when you
work where you work what work you do but
I believe there's a fourth element there
and it's play does your work inspire
your passion you know when you're in the
zone and nothing will distract you and
time flies that is one of the most
important things that you can you can
have in the office because it's the
difference between feeling like that
under Sunday afternoon or feeling like
that and we're all here on this earth
for a short period of time relatively
speaking passion leads to high
performance and it triggers inspiration
in others so you do not want to be this
guy he's clearly having a really shitty
day he's just making his job harder the
poor bloke so what can we do about it we
can feel your passion are you working
for the love of the work itself let's
let that sink in a bit
working for the love of work itself is
twice as motivating as having purpose so
you can have the best purpose you can be
solving world hunger you can be on this
amazing trajectory but if it doesn't
fuel your passion
you're not going to get the best out of
yourself now how can we do this Google
have tried tried being the operative
word with their 20% time so 20% of the
time at Google is meant to be put
towards a passion project that you are
passionate about about a project of your
choice now I've also heard
one hundred and twenty percent time
because I really don't give you the time
in the five days a week to do that but
you can start small you can start with
ten percent time to do something do a
project that you're passionate about and
the for the managers out there lead by
example if you're passionate about a
project set some time aside during the
week tell your staff I'm setting this
time aside so I can work on this
particular project that really brings so
much passion and will bring purpose
mastery and autonomy as well there's
also something called FedEx days where
you can have 24 hours to deliver a
project so there are all different ways
that you can introduce and fuel your
passion now the next element around this
is why you work determines how well you
work now let me get to the bottom of
this so do you work because you want the
money do you work because you have to do
you work because it's just kind of what
you do
do you work because you did it yesterday
just gonna do it tomorrow just on that
wheel now what impact you think that the
reasons why you work has on your job and
your life if you're working for the love
of the work itself you would not be
having smun days you wouldn't be having
that so it's like when you're in the
zone and what we want to do is boost
your aha moments the aha moment for the
gentleman who sent me the handwritten
card was when his wife got cervical
cancer that was time for him to take
stock for me it was being prescribed
valium yeah that don't necessarily have
to be bad things that happen to you to
have in our harmone but I'd like you to
be mindful so are there certain times of
the day when these are hard moments
happen certain places certain people
that you're with
now when Beethoven was stuck creatively
here's to plays violin Albert Einstein
used to go for our long walks and what
do you Helen was anyone in my lightning
talk yesterday at least you don't know
the answer to this anyway
Woody Allen used to take really long
showers lots of them it's a nice image
for you sorry about that
but so the message here is to find what
works for you in boosting your aha
moments every one is different so when
were you last in the zone and I was
talking to someone just before this
since she mentioned that she had an aha
moment when she turned thirty 31 she was
looking out the window up on the Gold
Coast and she's going is this my life am
I happy with my life and she ended up
getting an amazing opportunity for a job
down in Sydney and completely changed
her life that was her our ha moment and
thank you for sharing that to the person
in the room Paden we're trying to get
her back to the Gold Coast it worked out
well for her in the end so if it means
then that your work space now looks like
this all that that floats your boat
there's all sorts of help that you can
get Troy maybe your next scrum is now
the new stand-up meeting that is what
your next team meeting might look like
it is guaranteed to reduce meeting times
by 79 percent and increase your core
strength by 95 percent guaranteed you
would not be having those really boring
meetings anymore is that the only issue
that you have
really awesome doesn't matter so the
next element is fake it till you make it
and think you're wondering what on earth
is she gonna do now
trust me sit back and watch
I get goosebumps every time I watch that
and it's really interesting to see
people laughing I could see your
shoulders laughing it's great and you
smiled you cracked a smile I love it
so what these gorgeous clip shows excuse
me thank you is that happiness is
contagious we mimic people's body
language so when we see people laughing
we smile giggle well laugh with so the
happier everyone is around you the
happier that you will actually become
conversely if you surround yourself with
grumpy people all the time guess what
happens Kaycee ordeal but not happy so
the happy we are at work the more
positivity we transmit to our colleagues
and that can actually tip the balance of
a team and even a company now faking it
can emotionally change those around you
so if you don't feel like smiling give
it a go fake it till you make it alright
there's actually neurons in your brain
that know when you're smiling and they
don't know if you're faking it or not
they will actually make you happy if you
smile so smiling tricks your brain fake
it till you make it if that's something
that you want to take away this session
here now the change starts with you and
don't underestimate the importance of
your own behavior because we all know
about the butterfly effect a single flap
of butterfly's wings can cause a
hurricane in the other side of the world
and I know it's this old adage but be
the change you wish to see as a leader
in particular people will mimic your
behavior
if you send emails that 11 o'clock at
night and expect a response is that the
kind of behavior you want to be
encouraging bearing in mind what you've
heard today
about importance of switching off so
they can make me work in a little box
but I can't crush my spirit so take some
risks work out what works for you set
some time aside to go and have a nap set
some time aside for you focus work set
time aside to go for a walking meeting
introduce new scrum the new stand-up
meeting do what you need to do an
experiment with your own daily routine
and that takes excuse me Australian
isn't but it takes balls to do that you
guys can do it and the final element is
to take control now I've only presented
this this seminar once and so please
forgive me if I'm a bit rusty but as a
result of the first session that I did
people started sending me these you know
hey cupcakes in from my team how well
since that another person here I made a
co-worker smile because I gave her one
of your stress Falls that she didn't
seem herself seemed to cheer her up no
end and I've just given away one of the
free stuff things well and Niall said
you know he's taken a 20-minute nap and
it means he's dick for tomorrow sales
meeting is done already now I would love
to hear from you Twitter handle Kylie M
hunt I would love to know what works for
you some things will work some things
why don't tell me the good the bad and
the ugly
because then I'm able to share that with
everyone now if we don't do something we
will end up like Dilbert doing nothing
is not an option if you want to become
like Milton absolutely fine don't flow

quick recap number one invest in your
own well-being how are you going to

Troyes legs

nice number three
connect with your colleagues remember
50% happier and think of the
relationship that you have with your
manager that is key
number four play to your strengths so

weaknesses you will get a much better
return on investment of your time number

useless meetings as a chance to learn
put on some rose-colored glasses
number six fuel your passion why do you
do what you do if you don't like what
you do do something about it number

what those our moments are have a plank
meeting number eight fake it to you make
it smile even if you don't want to
number nine the change starts with you
be the change you wish to see it is true
though and number ten taking control
think about muffins you know the people
who want a photo and share it with me I
would love to know what works and what
doesn't work
as I've mentioned so are you going to be
this guy or that guy three questions for
you how are you going to eliminates
Mondays
what are your hard moments recognize
them when they come
and finally what will you do at work
differently on Monday today's Friday
isn't it yes so it is a call to action
now so that you remember I'm going to
give away some free stuff there are
there's more information on my blog at
Kylie hunt comm there's 52 random acts
of kindness ideas for the workplace

excuse there's also some reference
material related to this particular
topic to this presentation so if you'd
like any further information head over
to Kylee hunt comm there are some
Pluralsight free trial passes outside
you may only have one if you put in a
green card I need all the help I can get
and finally out there as well as some
heart-shaped stress balls now what I've
done before is I've trained them at
people but I've actually hit people in
the head so I'm not going to throw them
at you too so I really hope that things
like that will help remind you that you
don't need to be a Dilbert and that you
don't need to suffer from smun days so
