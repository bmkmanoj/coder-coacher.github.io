to New York and the Madame Tussaud and
they had a VR experience where you
actually can become a Ghostbuster so
naturally I had to try it so we get
teamed up we are four people in our team
and we even get geared up so we get a
helmet with a VR headset in it and we
get the guns and we even get the proton
pack kind of cool if you're a fan so we
are sent into New York apartment complex
and it's full of ghosts we can open real
doors like physical doors in the virtual
reality because they are tracking us so
they can actually overlay the real world
with the virtual world we even get to go
on an elevator ride and it really feels
like a real elevator ride because
there's some vibration the floor and
this sound is so amazing I was sure we
were in an elevator we get to shoot
ghosts and at one time I naturally
missed a ghost and it flies through me
and my whole body starts to vibrate
because in the vest we have there's also
a vibration thingy going on so we go up
the elevator to a really high floor I
don't know it might be the top 4 and
stuff happens and there's an explosion
and it goes off the whole front of the
building leaving us on the ledge of a
new york apartment really high up and
you can feel the wind blowing at you and
they told us we need to go from this
house to another house on a small little
fire escape ledge thingy it's basically
just a plank on the floor and I'm just
tiny been afraid of heights so I was
like no I'm not going there because I
to see down on New York streets for
really high up so I cheated I actually
lifted my vices to be able to go over
and finish the game that's how good it
was but he'd also had some glitches
because the tracking wasn't spot on some
of the avatars they were kind of moving
funny at times and at one time I looked
over at my virtual colleague and which
was a real person but I saw a virtual
avatar and she had her gun in the real
world she hold it like this but in the
virtual world it went through her
stomach doesn't look that comfortable
and when she walked in through a doorway
what I saw what she was walking through
half of the door and half the wall and
she wasn't one of the ghosts and don't
get me wrong this material they have
it's amazing so if you get the chance to
try it you really should but what I'm
saying is that it could have been better
with just a few tweaks and we are living
in such exciting times we have new
technology popping up left and right
every day now which means we have new
ways of augmenting your app and that's
super fun but this also means new way of
interacting with your apps we have human
interaction and new types of controllers
and everything so this means that UX is
more important than ever because a bad
user experience in this world can
actually make your users physically ill
I will go through the differences in
augmented reality mixed reality and
virtual reality and I will scratch the
surface on where we can go wrong how to
fix it and give you a few pointers to
keep in mind when you're doing these
things
and although many things may vary
between the different platforms I still
think that there are things we can learn
from each and every platform my name is
Jessica angstrom I'm a Microsoft Windows
developer MVP and I run a start-up
together with my husband who's in the
audience and we do windows development
and lately we are doing like eighty
ninety percent of hololens so
holographic development and that's super
fun for us and it shows that this thing
is actually real it's going on now I do
most of the UX and UI stuff and Jimmy
does most of the development stuff as
well to do workshops and stuff like that
so there are a lot of types of realities
so what is reality one would think that
all these new realities are fairly new
right well they're not in the late 60s
Ivan Sutherland he made what is today
known as or widely known as the first
virtual reality and augmented reality
and head-mounted display system in the
60s that's like ages ago but the most
fun part is the name the contraption was
called the sword of Damocles so I kind
of fun so augmented reality has come and
gone a few times since then and the
pockemon go when when that came around
kind of made it mainstream how many of
you guys have tried pokémon go yeah
almost all of you I have a windows phone
so I haven't so augmented reality is
when you overlay or augment the real
world with digital stuff and you do so
through a screen so you can have your
iPad or your phone or whatever you see
the real world but you can't interact
with it another technique in the
area is called Pepper's Ghost and this
is actually from from the exhibition in
New York and this is kind of a fun
coincidence i think because it's called
Pepper's Ghost and he's showing a ghost
and my point is with showing this is
that this technique actually first
mentioned back in 1862 1862 that's how
long we have known about stuff like this
so that's kind of amazing that we are
still using these techniques in our
machines today and of course there are
much more advanced augmented reality
devices than that we have the battery
for instance this is aimed towards the
industrial world so it has hard Hamlet's
so it's basically a hardhat and it has a
ruggedized visors so it can withstand
the industry and they also announced at
CES just a few weeks ago that they will
do a lightweight version of it with the
smart glasses which also has the
ruggedized got so it actually can
withstand the wear and tear now virtual
reality is when you immerse yourself
into the digital world so we replace the
whole world with a digital one and the
first game stations if you will we saw
back in the 90s as a page and I love
this picture because you can see how
dangerous virtual reality was because
he's in this circular contraption but
that's not enough he's also strapped in
and what I really love about this
picture is that she actually thinks that
he can see what she was pointing at
there are a lot of competitors on this
VR market and it keeps growing and this
is just a few of them some of them have
external tracking so you have sensors
put up in
one way or another like the HTC vive and
the oculus rift yeah those are the
trackers so mixed reality this is when
you bring the virtual world into the
real world and you see the real world
with your own eyes so not through a
screen anymore and the digital objects
can actually interact with the real
world this is a game called young
conquer for the hololens and as you can
see he's actually jumping on the sofa a
zingy chair and onto the table because
he knows what's the table what's the
floor the walls everything like that in
this area we have the hollands and the
maida too but there's also many coming
on their way and these can be either
tethered or not now windows holographic
is the possibility to want to run
Windows app in the hololens and this is
being made available to use in the
virtual world so that means that you can
actually develop a uvp app for the
Windows platform and release it in your
favorite VR headset and this also goes
for the holographic apps on the hollow
lens and microsoft also announced that
they are collaborating with a lot of
these new vr headset manufacturers to
bring the inside out tracking the sort
of tracking that the hololens has to
keep track of the area is in to the VR
world so this means that we will have no
more bumping into chairs and running
into walls so that will be really
amazing when that comes so now we know
the difference how do we start well I
would say you need to start to identify
the experience
and here you need to think long and hard
on what kind of experience you want to
design I tried the NASA destination to
Mars on the hololens while back and you
go into a room and it's a dark room it
has black walls and black ceiling and
even black floors there are some white
scribbles all over the place so the
hololens knows where it is and NASA have
collected a lot of data from the Mars
rover and the orbiter to actually let
you go stand on a piece of Mars so you
can go and walk on Mars and you can go
around and you find a rock and you can
see information about that rock and even
bus Aldrin is there virtually to explain
stuff to you so really cool but a fully
immersive experience so I would say that
this is actually more suited for virtual
reality and this is what I mean when I
say that you should think about what
experience you want to make because this
doesn't take advantage of the mixed
reality as a platform it doesn't
interact with the real world it doesn't
know where my shares are there's nothing
on the walls etc so you need to think
about do you want to design a full world
or do you just want to overlay some
information on the phone for instance
then you need to identify the tip
because they're popping up so many new
devices in a really fast pace so it's
super important to actually identify the
type of tech you're going to run your
game or app on because there isn't one
VR experience or one augmented reality
experience so think about where you want
to be what tech is going to be used
because in the 2d world when we designed
for the
world we can develop one app we can
design one app and run it on all the
platforms with little or no harm I
wouldn't recommend it but the worst
thing that can happen is that i will
have an iphone button in Windows Phone I
won't die from it I won't get sick from
it but you can get sick from it if you
do that in the 3d world so the solution
you write and the hardware you run on
will have an effect on the user's
experience and can actually prevent
cyber sickness so now that you know what
cake you're going to use next up is to
identify the play area and I call it
play area but I don't mean just for
games there are a few different types of
areas and the experience differs a bit
so we have the stationary or almost
stationary where you either sit by the
desk or in the couch or actually you can
stand up as well but the point is you're
not moving around that much and then we
have the location-based room scale and
this is where you usually have a custom
rig set up and let's say a museum and
you can walk around in old-time castles
and things like that and look around and
you might have a real chair in the real
world but you overlay that with a
Thrones you can sit there and wave like
royal and then we have the more usual or
common way which is real scale and here
the user can walk freely within the
tract area like the HTC vive or the
oculus rift and the actual tracking area
will also differ but depending on what
tech you are developing for and the risk
i think has 15 x know the HTC vive has
about 15 by 15 feet and the oculus has
three different depending on how many
cameras you have so even if you're all
we want to release on the oculus rift
you also need to think about how many
cameras does the user have and when
developing for a tablet device you also
need to think about the restriction
because you have to make sure that
you're not yanking the cord out or like
I am sure I have done yank the actual
computer down to the floor and break it
and this also goes to augmented the
world or the mixed reality world as soon
as you're tethered you need to think
about that so don't make them run like
two meters forward if they don't have
the cord for it now if you're developing
for the hollow lens or the battery you
don't have any chord so the actual play
area doesn't matter that much anymore
and the hololens uses something called
world scale and it has sensors in the
headset that's constantly scanning the
room where's the roof where's the floor
where the wall where's the chair where's
the actual stain on the floor and things
like that to keep track of where they
place where you are and where the
holograms are being placed so now that
we have defined the actual play area how
does the user move in this defined area
well we have gamepad which is the
classical way moving in games right and
it works on most of the platforms and
then we have teleportation and this is a
common way to move longer distances in
your games like the HTC vive has a game
called the lab where you use your
controller to project a beam of sorts on
the floor and you can move around and
see okay I want to go there and then you
click and you teleport there and then we
have another technique which batman
arkham VR uses for on PlayStation VR
where you have symbols like this you
have a back in
roller on different places that will
take you to predefined areas so you
cannot choose freely but you go to the
predefined areas now both of these are
fairly easy to use but the one that the
lab uses although I like the precision
of it it takes some learning so make
sure you user actually knows how to use
it then we have physical movements and
this is where the user walks usually and
they can walk around freely so sometimes
it can be good to actually shorten the
distance within the game it looks long
further than it is so the user can walk
a couple of meters and all of a sudden
they work 10 meters in the game so they
don't have to walk a couple of miles
just to get to the next village so
decide if you want to use one of these
or a couple of them so now we know how
to move how do we interact with the
world with all these new mediums we have
new ways of interacting we have human
interaction and we have new types of
controllers sure there might not be
super new but if you compare it to 30
years of 2d interactions they're kind of
you so the most familiar one we already
talked about that controllers and the
gamepad for instance and then we have
this specialty controller so this one is
the hollow legs have a clicker and the
HTC wife have have their own special
controller and so does the oculus rift
and this one might look a little funny
but it's actually super slick it can
actually track your your hand really
good because if you use you will see
your virtual hand in the game and if
they can detect whether you have your
thumb on the trackpad or not and your
hand will actually move or if you have
your finger on the trigger or not super
sleek
some of these devices also are bluetooth
enabled which means you can use a
regular mouse or keyboard now this might
not be the best experience if you want
them to use a keyboard if during the
virtual world because you want to see
what you're writing so you can't take it
for granted either but if we go back to
the hololens the first time Jimmy tried
the hololens he came back almost out of
breath he was so excited I kid you not
and he was like mouse the mouse popped
out was it come down what did you get to
try because I wasn't so fortunately I
didn't try it like then so he told me
about an architectural demo he had he
had tried so they he stood by a computer
and there was this 3d program like
Sketchup or something and you had a
building and then decide him he had a
hologram and he was fitted with the
hololens so he used the mouse to
manipulate the the building's height and
the hologram correspond it to that
pretty cool but then they instructed
told him to take the mouse cursor and
put it on the very edge on the computer
and keep going so we did and the mouse
popped out so he could now see the mouse
cursor in the real world and manipulate
the actual hologram directly using the
mouse so this is apparently the best
thing since sliced bread so just you
know and this is actually you can see
the mouse cursor here
so my point is that some of users won't
use mouse and keyboard but some of them
will so if you make the experience to be
compatible with both you will have users
like Jimmy raving about your solutions
for years so that's good for the devices
that have hand tracking like the hollow
lands and Intel and even VR headset
there you will use gestures and the
whole amount has a couple of predefined
head headsets they have a couple of
predefined gestures like the air tab and
what happens when you air tap is a click
event and what happens then is
completely up to you and contextual some
games and apps have implemented their
own version of gestures like Superman's
life for instance now I do approve of
the superhero part of this even though
it is a DC character but think about how
the user will actually use that do you
want to stand like this and fly for two
hours in a row or is that a bit
strenuous so that's just a word of
caution when it comes to implementing
your own gestures I've been demoing the
hololens for quite a while now and
probably for around 2,000 people and
we've been using the predefined gestures
like the air tab seems very easy right
I've seen it all I've seen the angry
duck I've seen the pac-man I've seen
move every single finger but the one
you're supposed to I've seen grabbing in
the air I've seen swiping like in the
movies so my point is what's obvious for
you might not be that obvious for
everybody so think about that before you
implement your own stuff unless it
spider-man's web slinging gestures none
of them for it so case this is basically
where you look unless you have a I
tracking device it is actually where
your head is pointing so you have a line
in between your eyes like this so you're
basically pointing with your forehead
but it's a good idea not to execute on
every single move when it comes to gaze
because if you look around the room like
this and you will have menus popping up
like crazy and it gets even worse if you
actually have to sound attached to them
that will be kind of tiresome and also
in the beginning the users need to get
acquainted with all these new
interaction patterns so my point is here
that from a UX point of view it's better
to actually make sure that the user
actually wants to interact with that
specific item so an example could be
that when they look at a specific item
you pop up the choices on the side or
under it or something like that so when
they actually click on that one you know
that they really want to interact with
that and they're not just dragging their
eyes voice is another way of interacting
and that's really good because most of
the users already know how to talk so
that you don't have to teach them
anything so use that whenever it's
possible and suitable because it's
usually much more easy to say take a
picture then actually navigate through
the menus but it's also very important
to actually think about language design
but that's a whole other presentation so
i won't go into that and this is why
services like Alexa and Cortana and
theory is so popular and we get voice
integrated to so many devices today
the hollow man for instance has an array
of four microphones and that's because
they want to sort out whatever you're
saying from what your friends are saying
and the surroundings and I've tried that
in so many environments and it's working
really great so take advantage of that
with all these new cool ways of
interacting with a rvr and mr it might
be tempting to design something that
looks like it comes from makes a
minority report in star trek but this
might get tiresome if you're working for
like eight hours so I not saying that
you shouldn't use cool stuff like that
like using the force or the Superman but
I'm saying use its parsley and think
about how long they are actually going
to use it so now we know how the user
interacts with the world but how does
the world interact with the user being
that the user is in such an immersive
world it will be so much harder for you
to communicate with the users because
they are going around looking at all the
amazing stuff right so we have to work a
little harder to catch your contention
sometimes and we don't have text frames
like we used to if we're developing for
the web or the phone or something like
that so we don't we don't snap the
information the menus to the left and
the content in the middle and stuff like
that because our canvas is all of a
sudden 360 degrees we don't even know
which way they're going to face do we
well we could just anchor the stuff to
the users camera so it's always inside
even when they turn around but putting
stuff in people's faces like that it's
not that's pleasant especially when it
comes to like pointy stuff in games
and also it can actually obstruct the
rest of the world if you have like
massive amount of information going on
all of a sudden I don't see you anymore
and it can make the user cyber six so we
don't want to put all the information on
the screen constantly because it will
get cluttered very easy so unless you
are designing for iron man or the
information doesn't have to be shown all
the time use contextual menus and
actions the destination Mars demo I told
you about thus this beautifully because
if i look at something over here a rock
or something there will be a menu and if
I interact with that menu the context
change so I will have another set of
choices but I'm still over here now I've
seen examples of really beautiful menu
items or menus so I go over here and I
look at something and I want to interact
with it and they have this really sexy
animation things just swooshes out like
this super nice but if I want to use or
I want to interact with that item all of
a sudden I have no context to the object
I'm interacting with so you really have
to think about the relationship between
the contextual items and the nested
menus also if you have information that
you want to put a label or information
about an object in the 3d world put it
on the same z axis as the object you
want to label because you might want to
if you were like in let's say Google
Maps and you're walking around and we
have the hotel aloft here and behind it
you see part of the Excel and you want
to put MVC London over it you might want
to put it closer because otherwise you
can't read it
but it would make much more sense if you
actually attach it even if the left is
hindering you to read all the time so
same set axis so how on earth are we
getting the attention of the user well
there are few tricks we can use we can
use visual cues it could be glowing or
pulsating on the item we want to draw
attention to but make sure you don't
just do it once because if the user is
turned around it would have missed it so
you don't want things going and blink
all the time right but you could do in
the beginning it goes like that and then
it just has a tiny little glow around it
or something similar with VR mrm air we
also need to think more spatially like
this said X thing said axis I should say
because we have this completely
different canvas and one thing will be
more important than ever and that is
audio so if you have multiple objects
that can make a sound make sure you
attach the audio controller on the
actual items because the spatial audio
will help the user to find their way if
they're not seeing the object in their
field of view and many of these devices
uses gays like we talked about before
and this can also give us audio can also
give us help when it comes to making
more physical making the object more
physical in a sense and we do that with
haptic audio yeah I know you can't
really touch audio but if you give the
objects and surfaces a lifelike sound
they will almost become tactile to the
user is the character running on snow
are they running on grass is this hollow
or not is it made of metal or wood all
these things can actually also make it
clearer to the user what they can act on
can they lift this or not and things
like that and designing in a 2d world we
have learned lately that we should be
genuinely digital we shouldn't imitate
the real world but in the 3d world
that's exactly what we need to do so
this video is an example of why haptic
audio is a great idea you get the idea
so the same thing thing goes for audio
cues asked to visual cues we need to be
sure that the user actually knows that
something is going to happen or if they
can trigger something so let's say
you're playing a game and you're in the
middle of an antique shop and you're
about to send in a bad guy from behind
so how do you let the user know that
something is going to happen over here
well you could like let the mice a mouse
run over the counter and you can hear
his tiny little paws on on the
countertop and he's squeaking and all
that stuff but a good practice is to use
steps of three so first you have the
mouse run over the counter to just
acknowledge that something is happening
and then you do something else like you
have the mice a couple of mice running
over and then the user will know that
something is going to happen any second
now and if they still don't get it you
could have a whole horde of mice running
from the actual bad guy
you won't miss that so audio is really
important for the experience and it can
actually also help with the field of
view if we take hololens as an example
again you have about a printer size
field of view on arm length distance and
how do we contract that well there's a
game called fragments for the hollow
lens and this is one of my favorite
games on the hololens so we're in a
hollow call and I'm talking to my peers
and superiors and I see them in the
field of view but all of a sudden my
hair is sound over here and I turn
around and there's another lady so what
my brain is telling me is that I not
only seeing this one the world is
actually 360 now so that can help now VR
is sometimes as a joke called vomit
reality how many of you have actually
felt sick or had a headache from VR yeah
a little bit more than half of you so
this makes you X so much more important
because if you're a little bit of people
make you sick the fact is that we
haven't cracked the nut that is motion
sickness or cyber sickness i should say
we have some theories and we have some
solutions but this is still a fairly new
medium and we are writing the UX
guidelines today we are doing research
about this stuff today so it will get
better one of the we have three
prominent theories to cyber sickness and
one of them is poison theory which is
based on the theory that the
hallucinations we see in virtual reality
corresponds to poison and our body goes
into survival mode and wants to expel
whatever
corson you have left in your stomach we
have the postural instability theory
which is based on that the main goal of
the human body is to maintain postural
stability in all environments so
prolonged postural instability will
cause cyber sickness which well all the
quick changes in the environment in VR
is said to you give postural instability
and therefore also 17's the third theory
is sensory conflict theory and this is a
theory based on the conflict between two
key sensory systems the visual and the
vestibular I went a little bit too far
here we go so these sensory systems
provide information about the person's
orientation and perceived motion and the
mismatching these two so the vestibular
says to you that you're stationary but
the visual senses tells you that you're
moving hence the mismatch and possible
cyber sickness so we have to work around
this as much as we can what we do know
about cyber sickness is that there are a
lot of individual factors to cyber
signals so for instance children between
the age of 2 and 12 are more susceptible
to cyber sickness and when they grow
older that will actually rapidly
decrease women have a wider field of
view which makes us more susceptible to
flicker and therefore also cyber
sickness and there's been research that
says that female hormones can actually
also affect the susceptibility
underlying illnesses or hangovers flu
stuff like that will also increase the
susceptibility and even things like
posture or whether you are
standing or sitting can have an effect
stuff like latency and flicker also
induces cyber sickness so this is why
it's so important that you actually test
your solution on the machines that is
going to run it and not your monster
machine you're actually doing the
development on how is the user moving
around are they writing a train or a car
or are they sitting in the couch and not
moving a muscle not sure you can try to
be safe and let the player always be
stationary and everything comes to them
but that won't solve all the problems
and also what's the fun in that and
there isn't one magical solution that
will work for everybody what works for
me might not work for you and vice versa
so if you have the time and the budget
for it you could enable more than one
way to navigate and this will actually
make your app more compatible with even
more devices so that's a win-win
situation now we have avatars and bodies
because free roaming games are fantastic
but some people will get sick from it
and you can try to help them by giving
them a virtual body that will help a lot
if it's done right but if you have a
body that doesn't correspond with the
user's own body that can make things
even worse if it's badly rendered so you
have your feet under the actual floor
that's not good or if you're rendering
me and the virtual table go through my
virtual body not a pleasant not so
pleasant and the same thing goes for bat
tracking when your body is all of a
sudden moving like crazy and especially
things like if you're trying to
you get the user to look one way and you
are actually turning the camera for them
big no-no because if the user not is not
in control rather looking they will get
sick also some people prefer third
person view of the game or solution so
that can also help a bit but they'd want
to help at all of them if you put your
user on a vehicle or something that
moves especially on a curve or you have
unpredicted turns and stuff like that
they also can get sick a friend of mine
and his name is Max he is a professional
game developer and he got together with
a few friends and made a game called
hashtag archery and at one point in the
game you are on top of a moving truck
and what they notice is when the truck
turned the horizon turned as well which
it would in the real world right but
people got so sick from it so what they
did do was locked the rotation of the
tracking space so it's basically like
standing in the middle of an articulated
bus or an accordion bus if you will and
that helped a lot and a lot of thing
when it comes to driving or moving if
the user is not driving the car but they
are a passenger and actually even if
they are driving it you can show the
road ahead of them because that will
give your brain a heads up that a turn
is coming so that can actually help with
cyber sickness and actually that works
in real life as well if you see the road
you will tend to get less motion sick
but you can also use transportation like
transporters or or blink to move the
user unless the urine is actually part
of the story
and since there are so many individual
factors that can affect your experience
and we are taking away so much of the
interface from the users face so to say
we need to put a little bit more time
and effort to user research and testing
and testing should never ever be skipped
when it comes to augmented reality and
mixed reality and especially not when it
comes to virtual reality testing should
preferably be done really early and
often and it's also best to test it out
on the audience you are trying to reach
so it's not you that's doing the testing
or your friend who does we are all the
time it's actually better to have your
grandmother try it out she would be the
perfect subject I think and keep testing
often there are a couple of you tips
that you can use to make things a little
bit more comfortable for the user some
things will be really new to to the
users because they haven't used things
like this before so East in the user to
the experience don't just put them smack
in an immersive world where did they
don't know what is going on it's better
to use solutions like oculus rift have
the solution they have a virtual lobby
of sorts and then you have to click on
something to actually load the game
tutorials on how to are also a really
great way to let the user know how they
can interact and it's often a necessity
but don't just show them the titular one
make sure they can actually go back and
start it again or if their friend is
trying it out and so on if you are
moving on an elevator and you can see
out or if you're on a balloon ride or
something like that it's a good idea to
actually have something like a still
focal point the UK
focus on while in motion because that
will also take away some of the motion
sickness it's also a very good idea to
let the user know when they are coming
too close to the furniture or the wall
because in augmented reality and mixed
reality we get this for free but in
virtual reality we don't so it's up to
us to actually help the user know where
they are and this can also help them
feel more immersed in the world if they
don't have to think about where the wall
wears it for well before they know where
that is so we talked about the field of
view in mixed reality so contract that
by making the items smaller so they
actually fit in the field of view or
place the items further in the
environment so that's a trick and also
your brain is fantastic because again if
we take the hololens as an example I
don't even notice that I'm restricted to
the field of view and it anymore because
I will automatically backed away a
little bit if the hologram doesn't fit
in the field of view and when you use it
for a while you start to move more
naturally because in the beginning
you're more like a robot like this so
that will also help and the spatial
audio smoothing should also be your best
friend especially when it comes to
things like gays and gays cursors
because if we wouldn't have if we didn't
have smoothing in our headset well our
head-mounted displays things would get
really jittery so if you're using the
raw data to do your own cursors or gaze
it can really be jittery so be careful
of that and use smoothing and when you
are ready to take the user out of
virtual reality fade to black don't just
pull the cord so to speak because that
will be
much pleasant to be faded out to the
real world so where are all these
techniques headed we have so many cool
devices already today and we have so
many cool sensors available to us that
we could incorporate to the next
generation we can measure whether your
palms are sweaty enough and how sweaty
they are we can measure your your pulse
we can measure the differences in your
voice and things like that even
vibration vests and temperature change
all the IOT spaces and also I tracking
this means that the game characters
actually can look you in the eye which
kind of gives me the creeps so are you
trying to cheat on let's say the
personal training experience you are
using are you doing enough situps they
will know are you putting the experience
too high up so I actually have to cheat
is the horror game scary enough or
should we crank it up a bit so to sum
things up identify the experience the
tech and the play area and think about
interaction both from you to the world
and the world to you try to make it as
comfortable as possible for the user so
they don't get sick and if there is one
thing if you want to take one thing away
from this presentation it's testing
because you can't take all the boxes in
making the perfect game but if you test
it enough you can come pretty damn close
