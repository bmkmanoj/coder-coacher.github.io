really glad that you're all here today
you always have that little bit of a
nervous feeling as a speak of it oh my
gosh nobody's going to come to my talk
but it really when it's something that's
not quite techie and it's very tacky
conference so thank you all for being
here and before we have started can I
just get a hands of anyone who has
something that they want to achieve and
you know right great and who sets goals
for themselves and then periodically
takes them off okay a few of you so a
few years ago I discovered a love for
running and I found myself setting lots
and lots of goals and things that I
wanted to achieve in my running but I
didn't quite know how to go about
achieving them until i realized that i
actually had the knowledge all along and
it came from the work that i did in my
tech life so and that came from all the
agile processes that i was using in the
projects that I worked on so the top
that I'm going to do today is all about
how we can go about achieving goals and
by using agile and the agile principles
but we're going to use running as a
metaphor because I love funny and in
particular i really love marathon
running so here's a couple of photos of
me being really silly and just up into
two thumbs and I'm a little bit marathon
obsessed i have now run five of them
since october 2015 as well as countless
other races and i'm currently in pursuit
of my grand goal which is to run 26.2 x
26.2 miles so a marathon by the time
that I'm 2642 because I figured it was a
nice number and we may as well try when
I'm not running I work as a software
engineer at founders factory and they
are an accelerator and an incubator with
the ambitious goal of launching 60 new
companies within five years so you can
imagine that we
a lot of prototypes and we throw away a
lot of color code in the process of
doing that and prior to that I've been
lucky enough to work in a number of
different environments I worked at an
agency I worked in a consultancy and at
a big corporate and now in a startup
world and at all those places I've
worked on many many different projects
and all of them have been run using
agile in some form or another as you can
imagine it the big corporate agile was
maybe more of a waterfall methodology
but they called it agile and it sort of
sort of went along and whereas it
sounded factory we very much use the
Lean Startup methodology to get our
projects and to build these new
companies and i really like clean
because it takes agile is concept and
boiled it down right to its core ideas
which is the cycle of build measure and
learn it's about constantly measuring
what you've done and then evaluating and
learning from what you've done
previously to improve in the next build
cycle so each time you repeat this cycle
it's an iteration and you move
incrementally forwards towards a final
product so every time you learn you from
your measurements of your previous build
you're saying oh this didn't quite work
right so let's change what we've done or
even move in a new direction so that the
final product that you're going to
create is successful the official
definition of agile is a method of
project management characterized by the
division of tasks into short phases of
work and frequent reassessment and
adaptation of plans so it's a cycle of
incrementing adapting and moving
forwards the other definition and the
very clear one very obvious one is about
agility so the ability to move quickly
and easily and then also really ties
nicely into our running metaphor here so
we're going to talk about run measure
learn as a
to build to measure learn and now while
I'm going to talk about this in terms of
marathon running you can be applied to
any goal that you want to achieve right
because we're looking at the principles
of agile and seeing and finding those
golden nuggets from these processes that
you yourself probably know from your
day-to-day work to help you achieve the
goals you want to soda guide our
discussion we're going to be using ten
principles of agile as outlined by Kelly
waters back in 2007 so Kelly waters has
now written a book and runs the all
about agile blog and she wrote these ten
principles of agile i've kind of
reordered them a little to fit in with
this metaphor and and interestingly
enough on the initial blog process she
wrote back in 2007 with the ten
principles of agile the top comment was
oh don't worry if nobody's looking at
your blog it takes a little time to get
into these things and this is now the
number one hit if you google principles
of agile and she's written the book a
lot can happen in ten years these are
not the 12 principles from the agile
manifesto because I find that the agile
manifesto gives you a set of rules
whereas Kelly has extracted from them
some ideas and the concepts behind them
so we're going to use those to move
forward so number one capture requires
or in other words make a plan any
project that you start can be seen as a
crazy goal right it's not a crazy enough
goal then you weren't you motivated to
try and achieve that thing if it's too
easy then you're just like oh I could I
could do that that's fine and you're not
going to go out and seek to and
endeavour to actually complete it and if
it's just too big a goal then it seems
completely intangible and like you can't
even make the first steps towards it
because it's just enormous and you're at
that point in time not equipped to get
there
so I needs to be a crazy goal crazy
enough not to crazy and it needs to be
pine boxed if we don't have a time limit
on a goal then we dragged out and
dragged out and say ah yeah I was meant
to do that thing let's just push it back
a little bit and then we'll push it back
again now getting yourself a time frame
you're saying actually I need to achieve
this by this certain date again if that
time frame is too short then you won't
realistically be able to achieve it if
it's too long that's basically the same
as not having a time frame in the first
place so when you start on your project
you've got your goal you need to decide
what's going to be included in order to
make it a success these requirements and
you can start finding them by taking
some learnings about from past projects
or from your current situation in order
to evaluate and figure out where you are
now before you can move forward and
decide what needs to be done so for
instance our project is to run a
marathon and your current situation your
current learnings are that you never run
a marathon before at the moment maybe
you run two to three times a week and
the farthest you've ever run is 10k and
you did want to participate in a Santa
fun run and you thought it was really
awesome because you got to wear that run
around a center so from that you can now
pull out some requirements some high
level objectives of what you need to
achieve by the answer your time frame so
this would be things like to run more
regularly every week to build up your
long run to add in strength training and
stretching to improve your nutrition to
participate in events it all links quite
nicely with that evaluation of where you
are currently from this list of
requirements you can then go about
drilling down and figuring out exactly
how to achieve those things
so in running this comes in the form of
a training plan and you can find them
online there's so many of them out there
for beginners intermediate for advanced
runners they might be 12 16 20 weeks
long no matter where you are right now
there is somewhere out there the right
training plan to get you to your goal
and that training plan is essentially
your back look right each run in each
strength training section each time you
need to stretch is a task that needs to
be completed and you can stare at that
training log and let's say six months
long right that's a lot of running to do
and if you're at week one week two and
you're staring at this whole list of
activities you are going to have to do
over the next six months I can be really
daunting so principle number to create
small incremental releases and iterate
take it week-by-week and constantly
reflect so i mentioned that i am trying
to now run this crazy number of
marathons and that is something that I'm
not equipped to train myself for is I
don't have the knowledge of what's going
to happen if I'm trying to run one
marathon two weeks after I've done
another one so when I came up with the
challenge one of the first things that I
did was to go out and hire a coach his
name is Justin and he essentially works
as my product owner he is in charge of
my backlog of my training plan and the
way that he works that we figured out
together was it he writes into a Google
spreadsheet every week exactly the runs
that I need to do just for that week
we've discussed the high level goals and
high-level requirements in order so that
I can hit the times and achieve the
marathon's that i want to but the actual
nitty-gritty of that Backlund he is in
charge of every week on a monday I can
go into my google spreadsheet and see
what I need to do and only focus on that
week and not need to worry about what's
coming
future and there's a similar to scrums
and scrum spreads right where either
maybe it's every week or two weeks or
four weeks whatever the team decides on
you set up the tasks that need to be
done the features that you want to
complete in that time period and only
focus on achieving those at the end of
that sprint you then come back and you
reflect and it just gives you the
ability to again not worry about what's
coming three five six weeks down the
line so this is very much for being
about the build of the run phase so far
we also need to talk about measuring and
learning so when we want to measure how
a project is doing you often might use a
tool such as zero in this you list out
all the tasks that need to be done and
incrementally move them through the
process and it gives you nice metrics
such as team velocity or if you're also
tracking the hours that it takes to
complete a task and get some really nice
data and break down for that for running
most people now will run with a garmin
SmartWatch or their smartphone hooked up
to straw or something so that you can
get all your details about pace and
distance even heart rate sometimes so
that concrete data about what you've
just done but it's more than just that
right running isn't just the numbers
it's also how you feel maybe you ran
fast you felt awful right and you can't
see that in the numbers so one thing
that I like to do is I write by hand at
the end of every day in a training log
about how I felt about that run if it
was just awful if it was brilliant it
was freezing cold if I ran with friends
they listen to music all that
information and that becomes another way
of measuring how that run went so then
when it comes to the learning part of
our cycle we can take all that
information both how we feel and the
solid metrics and statistics that we
have to influence how we're going to
approach the next week
next sprints of work in a software
project this comes in the form of a
retrospective your entire team will sit
down in a room and discuss with each
other how they felt about that previous
sprint the work that they achieved and
have a look at the data and metrics to
say oh yeah well okay maybe we need to
do a little bit less or a little bit
more mix a velocity was great and then
from that can put together that next
week in running you can do exactly the
same thing right from looking how fast
un has slowly when house fire you in you
can take out those learnings and extract
things particularly using that training
log to add extra information for you for
instance if you went to the party last
night and had a really great time and
drags maybe a few too many bees and then
you try to go for a run this morning
well maybe your run wasn't great and
that gives you a bit of an idea that you
shouldn't do one or the other for me I
chose not to go to the party that I'm
guessing most people would probably go
the other way around the things I've on
to number three requirements evolve but
the time scale is fixed adapt to your
circumstances so let's look at this
battle of this training plan we have
this is essentially the ideal product
that you could create need could release
if you had all the money and the best
tech resources in the world and
absolutely nothing went wrong as we all
know projects are never perfect they
never go exactly how you want them to
problems always crop up it might be that
in the first week of working on this
project you implemented a library and
now a few months down the road you've
discovered that it really doesn't
integrate with the payment gateway that
you need to do so you're going to have
to go back swap it out and that will
impact all the other work you need to do
so you flex your requirements and you
shuffle things around you cut some
things out so the things that need to be
done can get done exactly the same thing
applies when it comes to running right
for instance I have a friend whose
currently visiting
in London and my run this morning was
with her we went for a nice little jog
around Hyde Park but I was meant to
actually have a rest day today I wasn't
meant to go running so instead of saying
I know sorry we can't meet up yesterday
I didn't do a hard session as was in my
plan and I did a bit of an easier one so
that I could also go running today and I
wouldn't get myself injured the biggest
rookie error that you should do is to
follow a training plan or a backlog to
the absolute dot I once tried this to do
this back in 2015 I had this goal of
running a 10k in under 45 minutes and
you know I thought I really could do
this and I found a training plan it was
an advanced 10-kilometer training plan
that went for 12 weeks and I stuck to it
religiously every single run that it
said to do I did it I hated it so much I
was not an advantage runner at that
stage and it was entirely too much for
my body to handle I got completely
injured to the point where I had to sit
at work and make my colleagues bring me
coffee and lunch because I couldn't
stand up admittedly I still makes them
bring me coffee and lunch but that's
because I'm lazy and not because I can't
set up in the end I did end up running
this 10k but I did it much worse than I
possibly could have and I was in so much
pain while doing it that it was entirely
pointless and if I had listened to my
body and listen to my brain and
everything and not just thought that I
was a failure if I didn't speak to the
absolute PE of this training plan
probably all would have gone a lot
better principle number four complete
each feature before moving on to the
next so let's talk about features there
aren't really any clear features in
running it's not like working on a
project where say you're building a
website you know you have to build a
navigation you have to build a header
you have to put some content in and it
all becomes really nicely packaged
sections of it or maybe a goal is to
write a book and in that case every
chapter is essentially a feature
it's not the same in running you could
just go out and run a marathon tomorrow
if you really want it to it would
probably be utterly awful you feel
but you could essentially do it so what
are these features well we mentioned
that it's something that needs to be
completed so let's say it's something
that needs to be completed in order to
achieve success and in running that
comes in the form of a long run around
your incidents you need to build up your
long run and teach your body how what
it's like to actually run for so that
come race day you can achieve that goal
and then the other part of it so
complete each feature before moving on
to the next is the complete part what is
complete or in software this principle
means that each feature needs to be done
done as opposed to just done right so it
has to be styled has to have tests
written has to be accepted by a product
owner your can't just say oh yeah I read
the code it's perfect go without having
done those things it's not complete so
in running it's about completing each
one of those long runs and really
getting to the end of it no matter what
happens in the midway sometimes you just
do not want to keep running perfect
example of this for me was when I was
training for that very first marathon i
did in melbourne and i had a training
plan where Iran 34 kilometers 36
kilometers 38 comments and that was it
that was the last three longest runs I
had to do 34k went fine in the 36 kato
at 15 kilometers in I was sitting at the
side of the road crying my eyes out
because I just did not want to go any
further even worse this was on a highway
so there was just cars coming past the
entire time and sort of looking at me
going oh my gosh what is this crazy
person doing then I get it and I push
through and I got to the end of the run
and I learnt so much more from that run
from having completed that and
being able to say you know what no
matter how badly things go I have that
ability to push through and I can keep
going and the next week when I went and
did 38k it went brilliantly so you need
to complete each incremental step up in
that long run in order before you move
on to the next one so that your body can
learn what that's like and you can take
it away those lessons but what if you
miss one I mean occasionally need you
just sort of sleep in or something crops
up just requirement these evolving of
the requirements and adapting to our
circumstances well then you just need to
again adapt and flex your requirements
and change your core feature long runs
slightly so it might mean that if you
did 20 kilometers one week and then 27
kilometers was meant to be the next one
in you mr. 24 in the middle instead of
running that 27 kilometres next week you
do 25 then 28 and then 30 and you slowly
get back on track to where you need to
be so you bloat some features or you
take a little bit away and sort of move
things around so that all nicely fits in
and you can still achieve your timeline
the result is your minimum achievable
product so whatever you have whatever
you release the race that you run on
race day is a thing that you are able to
do with the training that you put into
it and that doesn't mean that your
training has to be perfect it just means
that you need to prioritize some core
features versus the nice to haves and
that will make you more likely to
succeed principle number five test early
and test often and integrate testing
into the project life cycle so this
comes into our measure part of the build
measure learn cycle when we create
software and we write test why because
we need to know that the code we've
written works as we expect it to and so
that we can identify any issues freely
early on
we need to try out different inputs and
make sure that all of them work we need
to verify that if something to change
over here it's not going to affect the
rest of the system we need to have
confidence in what we've created and we
need to be able to prove that it works
we do exactly the same thing with
running running in a marathon event is
very very different to if you were just
to go out and run 42.2 kilometers or
26.2 miles by yourself maybe there's all
these people that if it's amazingness
fear there's this great camaraderie
there's also fierce competition even if
it's just with the guy dressed up as a
toilet because believe me you do not
want to be overtaken by the toilet if
everything ruling one bucket and even
better you often get medals so bling and
t-shirts at the end of it what more
could you want right if it wasn't for
this one fun run event back in Sydney
which is my hometown I don't think I'd
be running it's called the city2surf and
its 80,000 people is one of the biggest
fun runs in the world and you get people
who do this all walks of life all shapes
and sizes and they had from people who
can run it in like 45 minutes to the
people who take three hours it's 14 min
kilometers long I should mention this so
it's not a marathon distance it's a lot
shorter than that and it means that
everyone gets involved in everyone's to
try and probably if you live in sydney
at some point you have run the city
deserve and I did this as in 20 end of
2013 I had sort of been running on and
ask not very seriously but I set the
city2surf as my goal I didn't know yet
about how to apply these principles so
my training went out the plan and out
the door and I sort of went oh well I
might as well just do it and we'll see
how it goes and it went better than I
expected not because of my running but
because I got this incredible vibe from
all the people around
and mainly realize that running is
actually fun it's not just a slug it's
not just a way to lose weight actually
something super exciting because
everybody's there on this mission to get
to the end together and lining up there
on that start line you've got this
adrenaline right you feel nervous
because this is your goal and now you
have to perform right so how do you know
that it's going to go well unless you've
tested it so the best way to test is to
try a fun run before you actually go
into your life now fun arms are great
for a number of reasons firstly if
you've never known that distance before
it becomes a great interim goal towards
your full marathon for instance right so
again you can apply this to any sort of
goal that you might have if what you're
trying to achieve seems too long and
maybe too big and six months is a bit
too far away put an interim goal in the
middle and work towards that and take it
as incremental steps towards that end if
you have run this distance before it
becomes a brilliant way of measuring say
that the event that you're signing up
for is a half marathon and you've done a
half bath under four last time you ran
it it took you two hours and 20 minutes
this time is only taking you two hours
and 10 minutes that's a ten-minute gap
that you have created for yourself
through your training it gives you
confidence that what you're doing is
working and the third thing is that you
get to test out race conditions because
as I mentioned it's very different to
run an event as it is to run by yourself
particularly if they're serving cups and
you have to like try and learn how to
run and drink out of Cup at the same
time and it basically just goes all over
your face and you get like two sips of
water don't run all your runs on your
own and then show up on the day at the
mouth on to just become completely
overwhelmed by all the people and the
conditions and even though you put in
the training and it's been quite a bit
of training it just all goes to
because four kilometers in somebody
elbows you in the side and you can't
deal with that and you might end up
crying yeah and it just takes you by
surprise and you can't get over it you
can't get back into your group it's like
if you build a website and push it into
production without having done all the
right test and then discover that it
actually crushes if more than a hundred
people try and access it at one time or
that you've written a form and with a
slightly different input into it or a
slightly different electrolyte drink in
a race then the system bugs out and you
spend five minutes at the side of the
road vomiting instead just early test
often and integrate those tests into
your private life number six apply the
8020 roll this can we use really nicely
in order to learn and improve and impact
that next cycle so you've probably heard
of the 8020 rule as otherwise known as
the Pareto principle or the law of the
vital few or the principle of fact of
sparsity which is all kind of fancy ways
to say that you in a lot of
circumstances will get eighty percent of
the value from only twenty percent of
the effort that you put in it was named
after Pareto it wasn't discovered by him
that it was named after Pareto because
he had done some early research and
found that eighty percent of the land in
Italy was owned by twenty percent of the
population and then he later then also
looked at some peas and he found that
twenty percent of the pea pods held
eighty percent of the peace in our
software we can see this because it's
that the majority of your users will get
a large amount of value from only a
small number of functions I like to
think about this in terms of a DSLR
camera for instance there are so many
people who will go out and buy a DSLR
and then put it on auto and just
right they won't use all the other
functions there to try and get the right
photo because they are getting eighty
percent of the value from only twenty
percent of the effort so how can we use
this to achieve our goals because
sometimes we don't know where that
twenty percent is and that's where the
learning comes in right from learning
and reflecting so in running when we
talk about eighty twenty we mean eighty
percent easy and twenty percent harder
so eighty percent of your run should be
easy in order to build your endurance
and then twenty percent a sort of medium
for hard in order to build your over
capacity and it's those two things in
conjunction that will drive you forwards
to achieve marathon success so in your
learning and reflecting you need to go
back over your measurements and figure
out okay am I may be doing too much a
little bit too hard can I put in a
little bit more easy runs and have a few
less hard because it's quite likely that
that twenty percent of effort is all you
need in order to get eighty percent of
the value so now let's talk about some
external people a cooperative approach
from all stakeholders is a sexual number
seven we need to have our stakeholders
on the same page and feel actively
involved in what we're doing in software
you have a team that is building the
project it might be your engineers the
designers product owner some quality
assurance engineers as well whereas for
running it's really just you assuming
your goal maybe you've got a coach or a
product owner and there with you right
but that's that's still the concept of
the team there are the people building
the project the stakeholders then are
the external people who are not building
a project but they still care about its
success so it's your anyone in the
business who has some sort of interest
in
project succeeding I mean running that's
your support network your friends it's
your family it's the people around you
who care about your success and
ultimately going to help you move
forward and drive your success right
they are going to hold you accountable
the best example of where you can see
this is at any time during one of these
events it's look at the sidelines all
right see the people who are cheering I
don't know if anyone's ever gone to the
London Marathon and seen just looks a
number of people at the side of the road
willing everyone there to get to the
finish it's it's amazing barrel with
stakeholders and they care in the
success of those people for me my
biggest stakeholder is my boyfriend sigh
he's absolutely incredible he comes
along to most of my races and stands
there and follows me around to various
points and cheers at Dublin marathon he
was even principle lipstick a player
because I decided I wanted to wear
orange lipstick but it kept coming off
so every time I saw him he had to put
more lipstick on right and that was his
piece of ensuring my success right he
was a stakeholder in that and he needed
to be involved in that to drive it
forward because I knew that every time I
saw him that was another milestone that
was another bit moving forward and
getting to the end and if your
stakeholders aren't on board with you
then it's quite likely that if you're
going off I really need to go over a run
and people like oh yeah yeah okay it
doesn't really matter and you're not
going to go out and you're not going to
achieve that goal people around you need
to be supporting you and moving you
forward and be just as much invested in
you achieving your goals as you are this
brings us on to number eight the team of
the empowered to make decisions you need
to make the decisions that are right for
you so stakeholders are great motivators
but they can't tell you how to get to
your goal right they are not the ones
building the project you are going to
have to do that for yourself in a
software scenario
the team needs to be involved in
prioritization in estimation and in
making decisions about how to build that
product your reason for choosing your
goal and your journey to get there is
going to be different to anyone even if
they have the same goal as you right
where your stuffing is going to be
different and how you are going to fit
that in with the rest of your life will
change for instance if you are summoning
who works really long hours and you can
only commit to say running on the
weekends and maybe once late at night
that's what's going to work for you and
you need to be empowered and understand
that that's the decision you have made
and nobody else can tell you how to go
about achieving that and to tell you to
do it differently because you need to
know what's right for you one of the
things that I decided to do this year in
order to achieve my goals is to give up
alcohol I now know your longer drink and
it's sometimes really depressing but
it's the decision that I made for myself
and every time that someone comes up to
me and says oh come on just come for one
beer I have to be empowered and say
actually no I don't want that beer
thanks I will have a glass of water I'll
still come with you but you have to be
empowered to note that the decisions
that are right for you because the
getting there is on you you have to
build that product for yourself
principle number nine user involvement
is imperative get people involved in
software the priority number one numero
uno is to get users involved right
because whatever your building is going
to be customer facing in some way shape
or form right but running is an
individual pursuit it's just you
achieving that goal and it's a pursuit
that you could do entirely by yourself
if you really wanted to the thing about
running with other people is that it's a
brilliant motivator
because they become involved in your
journey and just like you would observe
user behavior right to figure out where
things could change and what you could
improve meeting other runners and
getting involved in the community can
show you the tips and tricks that they
use in order to achieve their goals
there goes might be the same as yours
maybe they're different but you can
always take out little nuggets of
information from them in order to
improve your own j'en right so you can
use these to help you succeed it might
be that somebody did this one session
that you never thought of like maybe it
was a pyramid session where you run
longer and longer and then shorter and
shorter or faster and they have said you
know what try this it really worked for
me because I push myself and then I
pulled back a bit and I found that I
felt really great at the end of it you
know oh that's interesting and take it
away and move on or maybe it's something
completely different for instance I
learnt one of my favorite tricks which
is to put vaseline on your feet to stop
blisters from someone else and from
learning from them and getting myself
involved in speaking to people about the
issues i was having it helped me to
solve one of the issues that i was
having and runners are more than helpful
to share their knowledge and expertise
one of the first things I did when I
signed up for my first marathon was to
join a running group it's called NRG
sack in Sydney and it's got an amazing
mix of people from people who are just
trying to run their very first 5k the
people who are running 240 kilometres
right that's crazy but the from meeting
all these different people it made my
own goal seem not as terrifying as it
possibly could have been if this power
of others and having people involved in
getting yourself involved in that
community and that doesn't even have to
be in person another great source of
inspiration and meeting these people is
on Instagram right it's my go-to source
for running motivation and to find
support from others and to share
my journey I also use it as a great way
of having a log of runs that I've done
so I can look back and say oh yeah I
remember you know six months ago I
really couldn't do this thing and now
I've achieved it I wasn't able to run 15
kilometres and now I've just gone in
numb 20 wow that's an amazing step up
and gives you confidence in yourself
when I first moved to learn in exactly a
year ago today I beforehand went and
followed a whole bunch of runners on
Instagram so I could involve myself with
that community without even being here
already so that I knew the right people
and I could get those tips and those
hints from them and then come here and
feel like I was involved in everything
number ten deliver products frequently
don't stop there a company will never
run one project and then give up that is
unless they're a start-up and maybe
they've run out of money but even in
that case the founder is probably going
to go on and move on to another company
or another project instead it will take
the learnings from a project that it's
done to start another one maybe it's an
improvement a new iteration on what's
already been released or maybe it's
something completely different you
continue moving and you frequently
deliver products so why stop running if
you've gone out and you've run your
marathon congratulations that's awesome
don't stop there you've put that
training behind it and maybe learnt that
actually it was really too long so try
something shorter or if it wasn't long
enough go and run an ultra and or maybe
the learnings that you had was okay the
running bit was good but in my training
I actually really enjoyed the cross
training part and trying some different
things in that case move in a new
direction and try a triathlon or if you
absolutely hated it and you never want
to touch another pair of running shoes
ever again
take up knitting and set yourself a goal
there all right I'm sure you'd be able
to find a way to apply the same agile
principles to help you achieve that one
too so that's all that I have to say for
today and as i mentioned i'm trying to
run 26.2 marathons by the time I'm 46.2
and if you want any information about
that you can go to 26 now songs calm in
the process of doing so I'm raising
money for charity so there's a nice big
button there if you want to donate and
give me a few pounds and I'm also going
to try and set a guinness book of world
records at london marathon so there will
be updates on all of that to come please
follow me on twitter or if you want to
check out my instagram with lots of
running photos that you can find rizal
and does anyone have any questions yes
yes yes so you probably incrementally
also gather those requirements right it
might be at the beginning me to sit down
and you've got your high-level
requirements you said generally I know
that this is something I need to do this
is something else you can do a lot of
research into that and then just taking
each one of those and breaking them down
into parts right and and yeah as I said
incrementally continue working on that
so maybe you don't know all of the
things that you have to do right now but
you say okay in three months time once
you've taken those learnings from what
you've done already you will realize
actually there's another bit and there's
another bit and that might impact your
time scale a little which is not ideal
and but that's when we come to
prioritization and figure out exactly
what you need to do and what exactly
don't know what the requirements and you
think there really is a great area and
then maybe your time scale needs to be a
little bit longer so you can allow for
those sorts of flexibilities in there
well
anyone else all right well thank you
very much enjoy lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
