printed agenda it says that John stead
I'm actually chose dead so if you were
hoping that it was really bad
misspelling of John Keats name
sorry to disappoint ya say today we're
going to be talking about something
called the blood paradox and looking at
frameworks beyond Microsoft now I know
the title can be like a little bit
provocative it might seem very very
anti-marxist based but if I wanted to
make fun of Microsoft there are easier
ways to do that I could some now I
talked about something else but I don't
want to do that I want to talk about
frameworks so the reason I want to do
this I think is because was sent so long
talking or in my entire career I spent
some time talking about this thing and
it doesn't exist so there's no such
things as silver bullet I've got to that
in school college university and
throughout my entire development career
I've always said there's no such thing
as a silver bullet so it makes me wonder
where my mouse is why we see things like
we see things like this over and over
again I kind of spotted a trend pretty
early on and it's the same old same old
and by the way it's just an hour of
recruiting us from now on
so have fun guys but there was a pattern
I supported pretty quickly where we're
talking about NBC entity framework
sequel server and a few differences here
and there there's the same sack in every
single company and it left me feeling
like this because there is no reason
that we spend you know all of our time
saying there's no silver bullet and then
using the same tools over and over again
just click on sparks with our IDE is
that bite I think it is and then I kind
of get a little bit reading did some
researching and I found this thing and
it's not an illegal move in a crack on
petition could that be cheating
suppressing any cricket fans out there
good guy lost but what I did find is
this thing called the blub paradox
that's the secret weapon so to put some
kind of background to this this guy
called Paul Graham coined the term I
guess when he was working in the mid 90s
he had an idea for a online store on my
marketplace making that sell things now
as a disclaimer in the mid nineties when
he was doing this I was four or five
so the landscapes are a little bit
different now and it's hard for me to
actually say this is exactly what it was
like during the time but um when they
were doing this this one I still called
via web there wasn't anything else
around like it they were the first
they're kind to the market which kind of
gave them a unique chance to really get
this right and kind of beat all of their
competitors to bicycle if you have the
idea so they had no idea what tooling
was best to use at this point they had
nothing to work on so they end up using
Lisp now the reason I use lists is
because this guy called Eric Raymond's
basically said if you wanna be a good
programmer use Lisp you know if you will
learn how to get into code Python Java
great if you want to administrate your
your servers maybe a bit of Perl or some
CGI scripts if you're only a really
really good programmer use
okay fairness so you may be thinking
what I mean I'm not Alyssa pelipper I've
never done any less of my entire life
which I think you can't oaks I've got
the brackets mismatched or not so yeah
I'm not a list guy but the reason
they've had Lisp is it gave them access
advantage so they launched their store
called via web and then after some time
they had a few competitors because
people thought oh we can make some money
out of here so they're their versions
are very unless them and other people
are using Java and Tyson and whatever
else was around at the time but as these
competitors kind of showed off and
surfaced they they had new features that
the own thought of and they think a
little bit differently that customers
liked so to keep relevant via web also
actually those features they were able
to turn it around very very quickly the
reason for that is because list has a
feature in it well you have to be a good
programmer to use this anyway but it's
got a feature or has a feature where you
can do macros in it and at the time
that's quite a unique thing I guess and
that made that allows them to turn
around new features very very quickly
and they were either a step ahead of
their contestants when they arrived or
they will right behind them with a
really quick turnaround and you just
can't compete with that so they're being
specialist market you make more money
basically and by staying kind of able to
develop and iterate quickly and release
quickly you're gonna continue to be
successful they got to the point there I
think there's late 90s early 2000s yeah
who brought the alert and for a large
chunk of time its most profitable part
of Yahoo now I don't know if there are
any proper parts of Yahoo but they had
they did good basically and it was
because they're kept which they may have
had a good team around them and they
identified the tool that works for them
so that's all well and good
they weren't with lists it worked really
well they beat their competitors market
and also relevant but how do you
identify what tool you should use how do
you know what's good for you in your
problems and what we're going to do is
we're going to take like a little bit
the side step and we're gonna talk about
languages and frameworks in parallel I
guess so
the languages that aren't very powerful
and you know are really really obvious
to you so an example for that would be
if you compare C sharp 7 to C sharp 1
now obviously it expects the top 7 to be
more powerful because it has you know
1517 years of iterations and it's
improved it becomes a little bit more
difficult when you consider say C sharp
comparing it to elixir or C sharp and
Lisp or even C sharp could go but you
can't you can't draw parallels there you
can say ok my application I need to
leverage the net generics really really
heavily to be effective
don't use go use C sharp because it's
quite good of generics or another
language so you can kind of draw powers
and pick out what's best for you by
looking down all of the tech you know
and saying right I'm at the top now
everything else is below me not worth
using so that's great for the stuff you
know the problem comes to the stuff you
don't know so a look at they mean is
that this big shout out F sharps that
has been on Twitter and online for ages
another co-op that you may look at some
F sharp syntax and think the hell is
going on here that's really confusing
and it's hard to follow and hard to read
but actually it is strange it is weird
and it is doing things you don't
understand it's solving problems in a
different way so by learning you know
how F sharp works you may think actually
the pattern matching stuff in F sharp is
much more powerful than pattern matching
than C sharp maybe I can use this you
won't know that until you actually learn
otherwise going to look up and think
were what's going on here
so you may be at the top of the stack
you know and saying this is the best
tool for the job here but there's a lot
out that you don't know it's important
to kind of be aware that you don't know
everything and there are always
alternatives there are of course
exceptions to the rule some languages
and some frameworks I made just to mess
with you don't waste too much time
learning them for real business problems
so obvious reasons
and I think you can say the same about
frameworks too so a framework isn't very
powerful or very good that you've used
before you can identify it pretty
quickly and say no this isn't going to
be what I need it's not good enough I
don't want to use it but if you look at
a framework that is new to you it may be
strange weird and do things you don't
understand now the caveat here being
with a language it does things you don't
understand it's a different syntax
I'd expect using this framework to be
quite simple and quite easy to get up
and running otherwise I'd be skeptical
of the US to start but it's ok just
because you don't know how it works it
doesn't mean it's not very good
it could be more powerful than what you
already know and I would identify as a
blood programmer so I don't know
everything in fact I know very little I
would say but that's well yeah so I'm
going to quote directly from program now
in his blog place where he mentions the
blood paradox say by induction the only
programmers to see all differences in
power between the various languages or
in frameworks in our case are those who
understand the most powerful one so this
is why I list making a better program
which it's more powerful than Java and
Python etc you can't trust the opinions
of others because of the paradox they're
satisfied with the way the language or
framework they happen to use it dictates
the way they think about programs now
that is a really really killer quote as
far as I'm concerned and we see it why
it heavily people have really really
religious debates about their framework
of choice and what's better than this
because so what I know and I've used it
for 10 years while I use anything else
that's not a very good argument in fact
it's not open at all it's just stay in
your comfort zone and never learning
anything new which you should do I mean
even if you go and explore F sharp for a
little bit you may come back to C sharp
and write code in a little bit of a
different way because you prefer how
composition works of inheritance and
things like that there are values in
learning these things in the prime for
what you already know to same as our
values and learning new frameworks and
kind of using the patterns and
techniques that they use and applying it
to your current code - without having to
add everything so that in mind what I'd
like to do now is kind of go through a
standard tech stack and look at small
turn into some common
tools they used so we'll start with
databases just that disclaimer again the
stock images to get worse as the talk
goes on so so what I want to do more
than anything is talk about relational
databases so I could easily talk about
no sequel and Doc's from databases and
things like that but comparing those is
quite difficult I think they'll do you
think salutely different it's not a fair
comparison to make so on the relational
side of things list of course sequel
server everybody seems to be using it
and nothing else but there isn't as my
sequel there's Oracle if you want to go
down that route and there's Postgres too
and that there loads more these are this
kind of 504s picks out so sequel server
is pretty heavy it's Microsoft base it
runs on Windows maybe less coming to
Linux when that's gonna be production
ready I'm not hundred percent sure
Oracle in fact in fact my first job I
was porting Oracle forms I think it was
logic written in sequel not supporting
that to be in c-sharp and Silverlight
black job was mental yeah that's mainly
expense with Oracle my sequel as well
it's cross-platform if just ignore how
the file system works underneath if you
don't see some weird results but you can
do some pretty cool things that I mean
look at what Facebook is with my sequel
they got up and running pretty quickly
using a my sequel database and they did
some pretty cool things and then they've
kind of pulled right in and done some
absolutely incredible things with craft
databases and things like that but you
know Facebook's a huge company and of
course Postgres so what I'd like to do
is kind of take Postgres in sequel
server forward together and we'll
compare them talk about Postgres a
little bit more detail and see how we
think about that so should you use
sequel server or should you use Postgres
did anybody in the room use Postgres
quick shorthand ok cool quick quite a
few people good
so the one thing I will say is unsee
sequel is anti sequel it doesn't matter
if it's Postgres or sequel server
you probably got enough the skills
already to translate and learn how to
kind of query and write tables things
like that pretty pretty quickly there's
not a huge barrier to entry so anti
sequel is just this standard set of
language there okay it doesn't matter
you know this this will run on sequel
server or a run on place cress and it's
gonna be fine
so cross-platform so sequel server is
coming cross-platform
to Linux at least anyway but it's not
quite there yet though I have pulled
down a docker image weird sequel server
in and run up my market quite cool
actually but it's not quite there yet
phosphorus is and containerization and
we have our first hit to the point of
the day as well by the way there's a
prize if you have a count how many hits
points or are through this slide prize
at the end for you so penalisation so
again traditionally sequel server
couldn't be containerized
now it can sit cross-platform Linux
windows containers everything one thing
I will say is you kind of often see that
people say oh yeah don't fit your
database until contain that's a bad idea
that's before we had volumes can we have
volumes now it's much it it's much safer
it's okay you're not gonna lose your
data unless you don't have a volume I
guess it's also really really good fee
for kind of local development tea so
instead of clearing down your database
with loads of native scripts I can kill
a docking it in and bring it back up and
I'm fresh again it's really handy so
going into more detail and Postgres it
is cross-platform it just works you
don't need to worry about it too much if
you happy on Linux or OSX or Mac OS or
whatever it's fine if you own these
windows cool it's got some javascript in
there now you may be thinking why on
earth is a language that was designed in
ten days that runs in a browser in my
database we'll go into that but you'd be
right to be skeptical you can store JSON
objects
so I think in sequel server 2005
introduced the XML kind of column type
and you can use XPath to query the XML
inside your sequel I've worked on a
system where I had to do that I left
quite quickly actually but that's crazy
and now I think in six over 2014 maybe
16 you have tape Jason of columns in
there too it's quite cool a key value
store as well so I get this print moves
thinking well we talk about relational
databases what is the key value still
has to or that we'll get to and then
building on top of it as well so the
platform that post-class gives us what
else could we make the state of this do
for us so jumping into it we'll talk
about the JavaScript stuff because that
is the craziest thing out of all of this
I'd say so
it uses the v8 JavaScript engine which
is what chromium users so POV 8 is
procedural language v8 specific language
JavaScript so you can run JavaScript in
part of your queries in raised thinking
why on earth would I ever want to have
some JavaScript in my select segment or
if we consider that we have a case on
column type and we working with JSON
objects maybe our interests in the
particular field and you can use that in
your query maybe not I would question
what you're doing at that point you can
do it you can also have it in your
indexes so Postgres has this really
really neat feature called functional
indexes so with a functional index you
can when you insert things you can do
things like convert case and then when
you query it it'll already be then in
function index so you can do things with
JavaScript immune function indexes to so
again if you've got a JSON column type
and you want to maybe index on on that
somehow have a function index to do some
magic with JavaScript and it's just
going to work that we click to read from
T again be careful with it it is it is a
browser technology in your database I
would use it liberally and I would make
sure that it's actually sub in front of
my need
and we have to look at the key value
store a little bit so in all honesty
it's not a relational database at this
point we're talking like Redis reacts
territory and maybe you should use those
but there are cases where having
features like a key value store built
into your database is quite useful so
for example requests the company I work
for at the minute a lot of our
deployments are on print and we don't
control the hardware that goes to we
don't control infrastructure they
already have all we know is we can have
a Postgres database and somewhere to run
our c-sharp code so all I know so if I
want to use a key value store then maybe
I can leverage Postgres and do something
pretty cool as that and save an extra
infrastructure dependency they may be
thinking okay open up saying picking the
right tool for the job
but sometimes properties and stuff the
WIMP and you've got what's there let's
use it sometimes it isn't and yeah if
you don't know what a key value stores
it was the key and a value little bit
like a dictionary I guess and they're
indexed which means they're really
really quick to read from I don't have
exact performance stats on how compares
like Redis and react and things like
that but it's clicked for you from so if
you do need the key value store and you
stuck with your options and how many
kind of Excel with structured
dependencies you can have maybe Postgres
can help you out
okay and then this is thing called
Martin so this is building on top of
Postgres and what we can do with it
so you can use Postgres as a document
database with Martin you can use it as
an identity with Martin now we're really
really out of relational territory
territory but again it's good to know
about there are uses you can have for it
so you'll be saying okay again if I
phone an event store what's wrong with
the get vengeful Craig Young's events or
an events or things like that and the
answer is there's nothing wrong with
them they're great alternatives but
again if you're constrained by what
dependencies you can bring in Postgres
offers quite a lot of the Box this with
Martin on top which is just a c-sharp
library so still placed underneath and
we have our second hipster point so post
classes adopted so using Martin it's a
c-sharp library it sits on top of your
code and still when we post got some
neat gonna get some code and we're going
to kind of see this code quite often so
if you ever use Raven before it looks
very very similar to this so we just
have a user object we store it in our
you know database and it's done and
underneath that's going to be converted
into a JSON blob of some kind and use
some of the JavaScript stuff that we saw
in the indexes really effectively to
make this work quite nicely I mean
there's nothing magic going on there it
is dr. Esau and it's how you'd expect it
to look and then as an event store as
well it's the same sort of thing we have
some events and we save them now if
you've ever done events or think this
isn't how it actually looks but it's a
good example it's not actually a good
example because everybody knows that
Frodo and Sam set up from Hobbiton not
Frodo and Mary and picnics spelt wrong
as well terrible trouble but it shows
the events kind of being added to a
stream you can append them start the
stream of events things like that and
again it just works you have your
streams in your database of your
eventually database underneath it's
probably still just JavaScript in the
composer to help you out so yeah it's
pretty cool but as far as
spaces go they're not the most
interesting thing in the world let's
move on to something a little bit more
interesting and clutching at straws a
bit here I think with data access so to
talk about data access we obviously have
to talk about entity framework a little
bit with finally getting to some
Microsoft technology again we're getting
closer to code but we can also be using
an hibernate simple data system where
there is something mock Rendell wrote
and it uses dynamic method chaining and
does some magical sequel I don't think
it's still being maintained it's quite a
cool way of doing things I think that'll
at least say that that's pretty cool
but it exists of course dapper as well
so again we're going to talk about
entity framework and dapper in a little
bit more detail and I don't know much
about n hibernate though it's pretty
crazy and simple data is worth knowing
about but not on a huge great beater and
of course f-sharp typewriters
so if you're an f-sharp lamp you can
point point your code at a database that
will figure out all the types of urine
we'll just do some magic it's pretty
cool it's quite nice actually but I am
NOT a very good F sharp developer so I
won't talk about too much a hips or two
so let's look for OC framework and we
kind of have to mention that it's linked
it's just the code that you expecting or
else and I'm sure most people use
actually framework know what it looks
like so they want you showing you that
but what we do need to talk about is
these loading I have wasted so much time
trying to figure out how lazy loading
works an empty framework and why my code
isn't working properly
i it just is ridiculous how how that
works but it's a feature I guess that
causes hours and hours of debugging
headaches but it's a feature okay
fairness
and the thing that kind of puts in for
entity framework is you have no idea
what it's doing to your database has
anybody ever had a DBA come in and
scream at them because you've just run
the worst thing ever on their production
database and you have no idea why
that's because entity framework
connected this horrible horrible sequel
ignored or your indexes every - every
time sorry okay so you don't have
control over over your sequel and it can
it can ignore your DBA is quite easily
that's bad keep your DBS happy to rid of
the DBAs let's do a tennis and then
grind your server to a whole new reason
shipping drunk okay so talking about - I
guess it's quick it's really quick so to
kind of put some context on this it's
what Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange
uses underneath to talk to their
database and it's written by the guys at
Stack Overflow though so yeah it's quick
and it will scale quite nicely and it
works with a range of databases
including sequel Lite Server Oracle my
sequel Postgres etc etc and the reason
for that is it's just extension methods
on the system dri DB connection thing so
they're just actual exception assisted
ups so the connection stuff is still
hung up I got net I guess and now the
reason I like Rafa it's not just as
quick that's quite nice you can control
your sequel completely so you write the
sequel basically you know what's
happening in your database which keeps
your DBA Safi you don't buy them beer
and said you can just write decent
sequel code so if if your DBA comes up
and screams at you ask you'd be using
data its public's you've screwed up its
justified maybe I mean if they were just
try to scream anybody but you get the
point sequence to Hitler okay
so what does duffer actually look like
them so it's query an object out again
standard sequel as a string connects
using an IDE connector using a sequel
connection which is IDB connection and a
query async person part this is where we
get to the dapple and so this is what
gaffer is and we're kind of expecting
our sequel so we're selecting IDs first
and last name from the users table these
are ideas 15 is parametrized as well so
protected against sequin Junction cool
and then we kind of getting a collection
back out and then taking one out of it
okay and it's asynchronous if you want
or there are synchronous overloads and
again if we want it to update or insert
date or maybe delete it's the same thing
with the difference being we execute and
self query on it's the only difference
really now the other thing I often get
against dapper and full entity framework
is what if I want to change the database
underneath what if I want to go from
sequel server to Postgres and I'm not
using anti sequel something have to go
rewrite all of my queries first off if
you're changing the database provider
good do go rewrite all of your queries
because you're changing it for a reason
and they do operate differently so the
way indexes work in Postgres are very
different how they work in sequel server
I want you to feel the pain of every
line you're changing because you
probably don't need to do it for one and
two if you are doing it think about what
you're doing don't blindly hope it still
works they're different systems
underneath the other thing I hear about
is well I don't like having secret in my
co-op code so were you talking to an
external service you have to speak their
language if you talk to a web service
you deal with HTTP status codes you deal
with Jason and or XML responses that's
not a c-sharp you're having to deal with
a communicating to something outside of
your system speak its language it's okay
and if you if your ugliness then I then
I have kind of sequel all over my
codebase I have no idea what's going on
maybe don't maybe organize your code
better as an idea so the others against
it I don't really give them it's okay
it's fine and it's quick - when you've
got control everybody wins
so again data access is it is what it is
you're querying a database and it's kind
of again not too interesting let's look
at the real fun stuff yeah web so this
is kind of where I really want to get
into things and you know how hard it is
to find a good stock image reflection
websites and stuff so let's talk about
web frameworks more tick more
specifically say everybody knows that
this one everybody saw that a few people
have said of Nancy FX or Nancy anybody
used Nancy before cool so a few people
awesome
how about suave any suave users cool so
suave is like an F sharp thing so I want
to get rid of that for a second because
it's 2017 so let's talk about eighty Don
at core instead so now let's talk about
the new stuff or in modern days that's
what we're going to do we're going to
dive into that a little bit I'm going to
look at more code and compare all three
of these a little bit more detail I
don't want to talk about the dotnet core
tooling because that's a whole other
talk so yeah let's talk about asp.net
cool now the first thing I will say
about this well the first thing I will
say about this is compared to Nancy
suave it basically every other piece of
text I mention finding code that I can
take from their documentation and show
off was really difficult I found lots of
screenshots of Visual Studio I found
lots of screenshots of postman
I didn't find any code that's a little
bit worrying in my queen I found some
eventually and and then I write my own
because I didn't like it so a controller
an SEO decor looks like this and it's
fairly simple we have an index method
and we return 200 with hello the first
thing that strikes me about this is how
do I know the route for that after that
I have to set up my routes externally
and use some convention based magic and
this will be running on localhost /
hello because hellos in the controller
name which is a bit strange and then if
I do just - that's index pretty slash
detail to get to the details method and
if I want an explicit route or to use
the delete HTTP verb I'm using
attributes now that's okay that's fine
you can be up and running really really
quickly with it and it's nothing wrong
with it I don't say don't use it just as
written by Microsoft that's a ridiculous
item but it is a little bit confusing
when you get to the routing side of
things and how it's actually working I
was trying to explain this to a junior
developer who's never done any web
development before last trying to
explain well the details message is part
of the URL and it's kind of a hard
concept to get your head around but in
an i/o language where you're using
convention based magic on the methods
and things like that but once you learn
it you can be pretty productive with it
and get up running quite quickly and
that's okay so I guess the bit missing
here is all the other stuff in asp.net
course so the middleware side of things
the hosting side of things that's that's
quite pluggable it's quite a nice
framework so there's no point talking
about that I mean they'll be shared with
Nancy for example but as a controller
goes and actually handling your web code
that's what it's going to look like
something like that with potentially
more happening rather than just
returning hello and why not but most
people know what asp.net MVC controller
looks like anyway so stuck lots of suave
so for those who don't know swathe is an
F sharp library so going to get little
bit functional for that and it looked a
little bit like this so unlike unlike
nineteen unlike AC Donette NBC this is
my entire application this is everything
I need and I can run this and it will
fire up a web server and we can see
quite easily that it's using explicit
routes and this would cost of operators
in there which you have to worry about
that's okay
but we can read it quite easily except
we're saying okay if we've got a get
chooser of these paths hello or goodbye
and then return okay and hello get or
goodbye get there's quite explicit see
what's going on and again if it's a post
operation we do the same thing except
hello post and goodbye post and again
it's really easy to explain especially
to a junior developer there's no magic
going on okay there's a custom operator
and a couple of key words like to choose
you might not know what they mean but
it's really easy to see that we have
this route and we we do this thing so in
this example it's just returning hello
get or get by get a string and that may
look a little simple to something fact
but the thing is all you're going to do
is call out to a different function to
your logical or any way you want to move
away from the website of things when you
get to your domain logic so it's fine
use it move away from it it's okay and
again like I said this is an entire
application that's running in what 13
lines of code if and that's a web server
with routing quite explicit responses
it's fine you got to worry about what
the custom operators mean it's fairly
obvious and that is live in a nutshell
again I'm not the world's best F sharp
developer or even very good at it at all
so I don't wanna go into too much detail
that it's a pretty cool alternative and
you kind of see how we build up roots
here actually maybe I can be more
productive in this way of thinking and
at least Anansie a little bit so I do
have to plug Nancy because I really like
it some of the other biases so if we
talk about the blog program I'm saying
anything it's how you use anything
different I'm doing that Nancy now
disclaimer but it gets out of your way
it lets you do do you think how you want
to do things so what I mean by that is
it doesn't force you down any particular
route so if you don't use MVC which is a
person by the way you don't have to you
can use however you want it's also
really really nice test with
so with your unit test you can hook into
Nancy have a browser object and kind of
simulate going down some roots
next what your routing isn't broken and
that's out of the box it works really
nicely so what you may want to do is
simulate your routes and go all the way
down across every layer of your code and
mock out the database part you've got
some really quick unit tests are you
testing most of your logic I'd still be
an advocate for running footings Gration
test and turn tests because the web
stuff is quite weird but it's good to
know about and it runs on bet not net
core now I really have to plug this
because this is something that I'm
really proud to say the company I work
for funded full-time development on
Nancy to port its dotnet pool we paid
open-source developers to get this
working
I wish their whole fruits Thanks I wish
there were more people about people out
there we were really really invested in
it to the point that we we can't decided
we're running on motto at the minute
we're hitting a few issues with sex
volts here and there it's causing us
headaches
don't let core is a thing what do we
need to eat up and running on it so we
paid on the full time to work on it for
a few months I don't know I don't know
how long and yeah it means we're
cross-platform
with less seg faults and Linux land
which is great so yeah
BQ communications as a shout out they're
really good company cool so moving on a
bit more of Nancy stuff it's got
pipeline hooks so you can do things
before request after request you can
expect that in those frameworks that's
got up and content negotiation again
you've got that in asp.net MVC and
things like that too but the way it
works in Nancy is that I kind of prefer
it a little bit and we'll see a code
governor in a second and dive into that
a little bit more it's highly highly
configurable so it comes packaged with a
IOC container
it was doing this wave for Microsoft did
it and as we got that core it's not a
new idea
if you don't like it you can swap it out
for your own if you don't like the
serialize or 'yes' you can swap it out
if you don't like anything about it you
can swap it out it's quite easy to get
into and as a really really helpful
community so it's active on github
issues PRS responding to but the slack
the fact team is quite handy too so not
only did my company that I worked for
currently pay for its reporting a call
I also got my job through posting the
slack team saying anybody know of any
cool jobs turns out yet they do now I've
got there so it's a really really ask
community and you might get employed
like who knows so let's look at some
code a little bit and see how it
compares to suave and see how it
prepares to asp.net call MVC API thing
and this is I have the equivalent of a
controller in MVC lamp it's a module one
thing you will notice is the roots are a
little bit more explicit kind of like
suave so unlike unlike a SDI on NBC
we're not gonna have to go to slash
hello slash to get hello get we can just
go straight to the root of our up
because that's what the root is we can
put a root on the module saying okay I
want it to start with this before I
start responding to things so we could
have a base kind of base constructor
call to add a prefix to the to the URI
but in this instance we don't need to
and you'll see we're just calling
methods to register our roots we're
calling a get method handle get requests
we're calling a put method to register
put request and again when you're
explaining this to somebody who has no
idea how any web frameworks work it's
quite explicit it's quite easy and it's
kind of like an oo passion as well
you're setting up everything this module
needs in the constructor you're not
letting some magic happen and there is a
bit of magic phantom you actually get
it's working but when you read it it's
quite clear it's quite explicit
and you also know is the in the update
method at the bottom we're returning a
dynamic type plus because Nancy is base
on Sinatra which is a ruby framework and
Ruby's awfully very dynamic so there's
some dynamic stuff in that but that's
okay cuz it means we can return a status
code of no content when we're just
processing data we can return an object
and I'll get translated to a States code
of 200 and it will be serialized using
where the accept header is content
negotiation is kicking in and handling
that for us we can return views if we
want it's okay it's fine it just works
one other thing to mention I guess is
the route constraints so on the second
get method we have an ID parameter in
there and we're saying like it has to be
of type int so if we do slash 45 we will
get hello I'm a number and then 45 back
if you do slash Joe you'll get a 404
it's not rich the group so we've got
constraints in there
we've got parameters in there that we
can pick up and use and it just works so
to me it's clear what's happening there
that it was in a stick on NBC but I am
incredibly biased so it's good to know
that it's good to know that I could do
things a little bit differently and that
you may you may kind of want to change
this a little bit and make it look more
like NBC sure do it extend it build on
top of it it's fine use that use the
lessons you learn from elsewhere and
kind of build something that works for
you and solves your problems what kind
of is all I want to say on the web stuff
why do you only talk about a little bit
more detail or the different net
languages so I really really struggled
to find a programming language stock
image for this so I went for normal ones
instead because apparently sucking just
a hard to find hiding here so this is
what lunches in dotnet now everybody
knows c-sharp right is there anybody in
here who doesn't write in C sharp or it
never has written in C sharp
yeah nobody everybody has our F sharp
because as soon as you say C shots
better you'll have a hundred people tell
you you're wrong and visual basic as
well it is part of dotnet this let's
bring it back because Visual Basic is
worth talking about so F sharps really
really good pattern matching C sharps
good taking the good features from F
sharp but Visual Basic has some features
that C sharp and F sharp might not have
to so prior to C sharp six exception
filters were not a thing in C sharp they
were in visual basic and exception
filters can be quite powerful so that's
really handy to know that visual basic
does have features that your language
might not so don't like off just occurs
visual basic it might actually help
yourself your problems may be so I kind
of what I've done is I've written a
little kind of knotty apps and I want to
compare how that looks across a few
different languages so C sharp being the
obvious one because everybody knows C
shots or startles up so all I'm doing is
I'm creating a new person objects and
we're the first thing with Johanna
Larsen instead and know what you're
thinking
are you using constructor and it's not
to inject dependencies you know you
don't have to use object synthesizers
constructors are a thing guys let's use
them I'm formatting that name basing
string interpolation and then I'm
printing out to the console really
really simple
except it's not there's more code here's
what the personal check looks like so I
really struggled to get this into one
slide success so much code but yeah
scarlet a chocolate there's nothing
fancy going on there okay and it just
works is quite easy to read and there's
a lot of it for what it's doing I think
but there's nothing fancy about that
everybody knows see well I presume
it but you know c-sharp and you're
seeing that okay that's really really
simple code I'm not really interested in
it
but let's compare how that looks in
f-sharp now again I'm not a great
f-sharp editor but this is what I was
able to write together it's four lines
of code and it's doing the same thing so
creating a record type
we're having our function to format the
name with creating a person object and
then we're typing it through and it does
the same thing and this one's by the way
it sends C governs the only difference
being is I run this as an f-sharp script
so I cheat it a little bit if I wanted
to make this add an entry point I think
it's an extra line maybe two lines to
tell the compiler where to start and
that's it so the difference is key
differences here I think is you can see
type inference working quite well with
f-sharp it removes a lot of the fluff I
look at the name somewhere on c-sharp
string into a patient's will be a little
bit nicer I don't get there's a better
way of doing an f-sharp that probably is
and some of the function names may not
be as nice to read but it's doing the
same code it's it's do it's saving that
same output and it's four lines of code
compared to however new answer code that
is so much I can fit on one slide so
again I'm not an f-sharp develop that I
do write C sharp full-time but by
learning some kind of functional things
in F sharp
I've actually supported myself writing C
sharp very very differently now
now you may just think I use a different
language then but actually now I like to
shop I like got net but the way I'm kind
of composing my methods and c-sharp and
the way I'm using I'm using thunks more
and stuff like that it's because I've
done stuff in other languages and it
makes more sense but I can't commit to
doing it full-time because I have a 15
word code base written c-sharp
I can't just convert that to F sharp and
have all the nice features I want but by
learning it I'm doing things differently
that's useful so how does that look in
Visual Basic
yeah I don't know I don't know I have
never written one a visual basic though
I got off the visual basic job once even
though I said I'm not a visual basic
developer that was quite nice
I said no so yeah I don't want to
publish your basics I don't know it and
at this point you may be saying okay
hold up I start off by saying let's find
the best tool for the job list worked
really well for via Web because they
were able to have a competitive
advantage of the language features that
gave you so why have I just spent the
past 45 minutes or so talking just about
dotnet and just felt kind of databases
to be use of dotnet and you'd be right
to ask that question
it's not net always the right tool know
the answer is neck okay so I like got
now I'm not a skating kind of leaving it
I'm going to try something new but
there's a lot out there and in the world
of Micra services maybe we can start
looking at things like go or node elixir
use Alexis liqueurs really good Haskell
closure elm hack lang it's anybody use
hacks by the way no the tightest on top
of the XP yeah
not maybe not HP on that one but but
there are some really good alternatives
out there and in a world where we're
moving more and more to micro services
who says that all of your code has to be
written the same language using the same
database on everything one of your
services pick the language that works
best for you and it does the job that
you need not because it's what you're
comfortable in step out of your comfort
zone and you'll see there's a lot more
out there and this is just a sprinkle
there's not there's not a huge amount on
this slide there thousands of
alternatives out there go check some of
them out worst-case scenario you go back
to c-sharp you go back to dotnet you go
back to empty framework with a different
view on how things are working a
different approach the problems were
trying to solve so I guess the message
here is understand when you're looking
up at things yes and a little bit weird
confusing and the world a touch that
and on some when you're looking down and
say okay I'm undressing confident this
is the best of like the using right now
if you're a JavaScript developer be
careful because that changes daily you
won't get anything done but more
importantly understand when you should
be looking up and when not to bother
make sure you're still delivering value
to your business was improving the way
you solve your problems otherwise will
stagnate you'll learn all of these cool
technologies but deliver nothing that's
bad
don't do that and on that I'd like to
say thank you very much I enjoy said I'm
going to be around at the party base
pretty well let's come chat to me and
ask me why I want to use semi hits
technologies feel free to come say nice
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
