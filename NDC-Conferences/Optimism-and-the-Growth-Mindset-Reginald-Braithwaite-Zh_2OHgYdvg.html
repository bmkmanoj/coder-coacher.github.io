talk about tourism in Iceland actually
the talk is about my own personal
experience with some things that I've
struggled with some ways that I've made
some personal growth I'm sharing those
things with you does not mean that I
have a theory of everything or I know
what things might work for you or not
but my hope is that in sharing some of
what I've learned in my travels you
yourself may be inspired to do some
similar research or make some similar
personal growth or perhaps check off
whatever it is that it's worked for me
and say that doesn't work for me now I
don't need to read the book I'll go do
something else but this is just a very
personal talk it's I'm going to share
with you some stuff which is has
actually been researched by people who
actually do controlled studies and so on
but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a
guarantee that anything in there is
going to be the right thing for you it
could just be that this is a chance for
us to just spend an hour getting to know
each other getting to know me a little
bit better I'm going to talk about the
concept of optimism and conversely its
opposite pessimism I'm going to describe
for you one framework for measuring
actually objectively measuring whether
people are generally optimistic or
pessimistic I'll talk about some
research that has been done
which can change people's optimism and
pessimism and some connections between
that and other things in their life such
as their productivity with work or what
they recount just their happiness which
of course is a separate concept from
optimism I'm also going to talk about
another framework called mindsets which
many of you may have heard of as well
and I'm going to talk about how these
two frameworks fit together
and I think that's an hour so let's get
started a number of years ago I was in a
very low point in my life I was in a
very dark place as it happens I came
upon a book I read the book it spoke to
me I followed some of the instructions
in the book it changed my life
that of course is not a guarantee that
it's going to change anybody else's life
and it's also not a guarantee that had I
read that book a year earlier or a year
later that it would have changed my life
a lot of things are like this the seed
has to fall upon fertile ground and then
the rain has to come to use a metaphor
so there's a lot of things that went
together into making that work for me
but what I'm sharing this with you I
hope that you'll hear enough to be able
to judge for yourself whether this is
something you want to learn about and do
a little bit more research into it and
of course I am just one person giving my
impressions of how things were so what I
would say to you is if what I say sounds
intriguing follow-up if what I say
doesn't sound intriguing save yourself
well that one guy didn't think much of
it but maybe I should follow off anyway
the book is learned optimism and it was
written by a dr. Martin Seligman based
on his research and he did a lot of
research and actual research as opposed
to hey I wrote a book based on my
theories of life or my personal
experiences and I really want to
emphasize this question of research
because research is not the same thing
as intuition research involves measuring
that is the scientific method you make a
conjecture you come up with the
experiment to which you do not know the
answer yet and then you conduct the
experiment and the experiment may
falsify your theory of everything in
which case you have to crumple it up and
start over again or make changes or if
it does verify it you say to yourself
well I haven't disproved it yet that's
how science works and a lot of things
that have
do with personal motivation or personal
development do not follow this model
they follow the model of I thought of
something cool I'm really good at
setting on stage and giving TED talk
type things like I'm doing now so I will
just share it with people and I will
sell people a book and that's not what
dr. Martin Seligman does and dr.
Sullivan's theory that he came up with
is that people's behavior is very
largely driven by the way they explain
the world to themselves this was called
explanatory theory he has a little
corner of explanatory theory it's a
larger theory if anyone has ever
suffered from depression and does
cognitive behavioral therapy one of the
things you do is write down what you
think happened to you and why and then
you dispute it with yourself and you
write down a new explanation for things
that happen to you and so on this
there's a large body of work into
explanatory theory and he had one little
corner of it and the way we explain
things to each other is very very very
it's prevalent in everything we do for
example if at the end of my talk one or
two people who applauded and a bunch of
other people don't and then people walk
out I might say to myself my talk was no
good no applause or I might say to
myself well you know people did applaud
that talk when I gave it in North
America but not in Norway perhaps no
reason people are just a little bit more
reserved about sharing what they think I
don't actually know which of those two
things might or might not be true but
there's a general thing where we make a
little explanation to ourselves and you
can sort of see how your character or
your mood might influence the way you
explain things to yourself and then
there's a feedback loop and you're
constantly telling yourself these little
stories about why things happen to you
that affects your character in your mood
this much is well-established what dr.
Seligman did is he went into more detail
about those and tried to connect it to
these two things he called optimism and
pessimism
he made two claims about our
explanations the first is that our
explanations have specific patterns that
we can identify in an objective way and
if we identify the patterns we can
predict the way people will behave from
the patterns that they that are present
in the explanations they give for things
that happen to them in their life so
this is an objective process he and from
that he said uh-huh so I okayed a test
and the test will come out with an
objective thing like a number and the
number will go from let us say I don't
think that's exactly how it is but from
plus 10 to minus 10 and if it's all the
way at plus 10 I'll call them a raving
optimist and if it's all there all the
way at minus 10 I'll call them a raving
pessimist and people in the middle will
be balanced or whatever normal
distribution I'm not sure of all the
exact details of the things in the math
but he claimed that he could write this
test and then there would be a way to
objectively measure people's behavior
and their moods and he would be able to
link them together so that by giving
somebody the test it would be predictive
and that of course is a falsifiable
theory because what you can do is after
you've assembled this test you can go
and give it to a whole bunch of other
people you've never met before
and then measure their behavior and you
can do it in this design a double-blind
way so that the people who are measuring
the behavior don't know the the test
scores of the people and the people take
the test score don't know about the
behavior and then if you match them up
and there is the correspondence that the
theory predicts well then you haven't
falsified the theory but if there isn't
the correspondence then you know that
the theory is no good and that is the
scientific method and that's what he did
his second claim is way more interesting
is of course if somebody came to me and
said I have an infallible way of
determining whether or not you're going
to be happy for the rest of your life
and they stopped right there and said do
you want to take the test
I'd be horrified I'd say no don't come
near me with that this kind of knowledge
of the future with no ability to change
it is terrible it would be what have you
told me that I was going to be only
going to be happy for 50% of the rest of
my days that's been every day saying is
this one of my few precious happy days
or not you know I read I'd be I would
just warp my own personal mind the
second claim is the one that matters to
me because his claim was that by doing
specific things you could change your
score the game the score is not actually
from -10 to +10 but let's say if you are
a 3 you can become a 5 if you're a minus
2 you can become a zero if you're a
minus 5 you can become a minus 3 he
claimed that would specifically with
specific might call it therapy or
practices you can move your score and
then when you move the score it it still
has the predicted behavior so it changes
your moods and behaviors afterwards it's
not just that you can change the score
without changing your moods and behavior
you can change your mood moods and
behavior in the score essentially is
predicting that that change and again
this is something that can be tested and
he tested it and he claims I was not
looking over solar so I'll often say he
claims he claims that he has the
evidence to show this is the case now as
I said the second claim is the one that
is so important to me the first claim is
what I would call the Cassandra thing
you might know that disaster is coming
but you're powerless to do it to me
that's a nightmare I have these helpless
nightmares every once in a while you
know something's going to happen but
there's nothing you can do about it
that's terrible
however when you have something you can
do about it then it's really important
to be able to diagnose and to be able to
go and look at it and find out what's
going on
because then you can make change in the
world so
I mentioned that his work is based on
explanatory theory these explanations we
make for ourselves and I give you a
little example what would I take it if
there wasn't a lot of applause at a talk
and this is all over the place so here's
an example in 2009 I was registering for
a conference called Ruby Fringe in
Toronto now at the time I've written a
gem for Ruby called and and and there's
a person there someone I respected very
much from the tech community in Toronto
walked up and said to me you're reg
Braithwaite I felt good about that I
don't know how you feel about it but if
you go to a conference if someone says
hey I know hi I've heard of you
that's a nice feeling what came next was
you wrote that and and gem this for me
goes good to better they've heard of me
and my work and then he said I don't
like it I work with a company called
page or Duty and one of our core values
is candid kindness I'm going to say this
person is wired candid now how did I
explain that to myself this is the core
of Seligman's theory and is end of
quarter the first first of his claims in
his model there are three independent
and fairly binary properties or axes for
every explanation you make fruit for
yourself the first thing you do in your
brain implicitly or explicitly is you
decide whether this thing is a personal
or impersonal effect or action
for example when I got this feedback
about the and an Jam did I say to myself
oh my and and Jim that thing I wrote or
did I say to myself that dude his
opinion his perspective his experience
his particular requirements are in
writing code his coding style his
language of choice where did I come back
to my documentation the examples I gave
for why it's good my theories about it
option monad my choices this is about me
or is it about the universe somebody
else something else
so the first possibility personal some
people like and then because I something
something something and the second
possibility and personal some people
dislike and then because they something
something and that axis is in fact a
very core thing and this runs through
I'm sure every conversation you ever
have involving feedback it runs through
anything you will ever read or be
trained about or come up with yourself
involving managing people giving
feedback training people being a parent
being a child of a parent what things
are about you and what things are not
about you good or bad so dr. Seligman
figured he can measure that and you can
even simple there are different ways to
get to test this kind of thing and
measure whether people tend to explain
things for themselves in a personal way
or tend to explain things to themselves
in an impersonal way and he found some
very interesting results but before we
get to that I mentioned that there are
three axes the second AXI is specific
versus general remember the end end
person I've been talking about it for
the last five minutes and you're very
sharp and intelligent audience when she
gave me that feedback did I say hmm he
doesn't like and and did I say he
doesn't like my code
did I say he doesn't like me
did I say he's a grouch he doesn't like
anything did I say this guy has an issue
with taking monadic patterns from actual
real functional programming languages
and trying to jam them into non point
functional programming languages you can
when making up explanations be
incredibly specific or be very broad in
general and once again it's really easy
to tell the difference this happens to
me well not all the time but from time
to time how can you like this blog post
or I could say the exact same thing if a
blog posts of mine are sorry say a
completely different thing for the exact
same event a blog post of mine reaches
the front page of hacker news look at
that they're validating my experience as
a programmer that's much more general
isn't it then they like this post or I
happen to have posted it at the exact
right time of day when it can reach the
front page and so dr. Seligman noticed
not only are there two different ways to
measure explanations personal and
personal specific general but that they
tend to be a little orthogonal some
explanations are personal and specific
impersonal and specific personal general
and so on and that was very interesting
but there's still the third axes to look
at the third axis or third axis of the
three axes is temporal time
that feedback that I got or perhaps a
red card and we talked some time or
perhaps a star on github was it yeah
remember that time I got some feedback
was it oh yeah that day I did get a star
on github for one of my projects or is
it yeah over my career I have got some
people who don't like my stuff is it you
know in 35 years a lot of people have
liked my work things can be very sort of
specific in time right now right here or
they can be very general over a long arc
and when measuring dr. Seligman noticed
that this was a third axes that could be
measured now I have given this talk
before I try not to give it very much
because it's actually kind of personal
for me and I get kind of wound up and
I've written about it and I often get
feedback from people saying Old Kent
isn't everything kind of just specific
general and not necessarily when dealing
with humans you know we have specific
programs and sometimes it might matter
even though in a certain abstract sense
they're all specific general specific
verse about you or specific in general
about the effect or specific in general
about time but in actual fact when he
measured the three axes separately he
got better results that if you just
tried to blump it all together and
that's how humans are we're kind of
messy and we're not entirely sure why
things started this way but he found it
very important to measure these three
things so in this third area I might
explain a successful project like this
our work made this project a success and
I might explain it like this this was
just one highlight out of an ongoing
I hope this is the case out of an
ongoing arc of success in pager duty
which itself is on an ongoing
arca success and what he found was being
able to measure how people explain
things with time was very important and
very interesting and he calls this
temporary versus permanent which of your
explanations describes something that's
happening right now and which of your
explanations describe something that's
kind of a permanent ongoing forever now
truthfully none of these things are
right or wrong answers I did that one
time get some feedback which is also
part of an ongoing art of receiving
feedback from people about code that I
write it's really just about the way we
perceive these things there's no right
or wrong answer but there is
significance to how we give these
answers and there are ways that we can
change these answers and change our life
so to recap our behavior and our moods
are driven by the way in which we
explain things to each other I haven't
explained that but it is dr. Seligman
his discovery was that by measuring
three related but nevertheless he
separated them things he could predict
people's performance their moods their
happiness
the three things are first whether they
tended to explain things in a personal
or impersonal way second whether they
explained the things has been very
specific or a very general in effect and
the third whether they explain them in a
very temporary way whether they explain
them as part of a permanent ongoing
phenomenon
now let me tell you a little bit about
my experience you might want to ask
yourself as I recount this this this
anecdote how do you explain things to
yourself do you tend to explain things
to yourself in a personal or impersonal
way again there's no right answer take
personal I know people who are always
going on about stuff that happens and
it's their fault I also can buy millions
of books and say in order to succeed in
life you must take responsibility for
everything what's the answer
hmm now I told you at the very beginning
that I came upon this book at a low
point in my life so I will tell you how
I explained things to myself at the time
when I received a little piece of candid
feedback like that and in general yours
I don't like it I took it personally my
work me my job my choices I thought this
was evidence of a general flaw with my
approach to software development
programming life as a whole
and I thought to myself this was part of
my personality it's part of who I am my
identity I thought this this was part of
something that was a permanent facet of
my life were permanent part of my life
my explanations for things like
criticism were personal were general and
were permanent but a funny thing in my
life things sometimes went well for me
too even though I was in a low point in
my life at that exact same conference I
gave a talk about a book called
Ruby dot rewrite dot Ruby which was
about essentially macros in Ruby which
at the time was not a very popular
concept and it never became very popular
concept and everyone basically thought
it was way too complicated and John
control JavaScript came along and now we
love things like babel and polyfills and
all sorts of things like that which
essentially are macros we compile one
kind of java script into another so
either i was really behind the curve
with Lisp or ahead of the curve with
javascript who knows but people liked my
talk even though it wasn't very
practical and when I got that kind of
feedback I tended to explain it to
myself as yeah my clothes are a good
idea that's impersonal right
I tended to say yeah that talk was let's
talk worth though temporary and specific
that talk that one time just to talk not
my general ability as a speaker or
writer or as a programmer or curious
person about possibilities just just
that one thing can you see the asymmetry
there I had two completely separate ways
of explaining things to myself depending
upon whether they were positive or
negative in my life sometimes those of
us in tech like to think of ourselves as
being super logical that is
what we can be inconsistent we can be
illogical we think we can sell ourselves
on things we just know bigger words with
which to give ourselves this
book gave me a bit of a mirror to look
at my own inconsistency I always
explained bad things to myself as being
about me as being really general as
being forever this is like a big load to
carry with every bad thing in your life
is this big and the good things I turned
into little pebbles almost like stones
in my shoe you know really specific just
at one time and not even about me almost
like you know it stuck to me the bottom
of my foot as I was walking down the
road and the sooner or later would just
get scraped off it's not logical but it
is who I was and I know you do not have
to be a genius to answer this question
correctly do you think dr. Seligman
measured me as being an optimist or a
pessimist uh-huh
it's not rocket science
pessimists are people who have this
negative asymmetry in the way they
explain things to make themselves it's
not about being more of a realist it's
not about always really being negative
it's not even about whether more
negative things happen to your life it's
about the way in which you explain them
to yourself if you tend to explain
things to yourself in an asymmetrical
way you are being pessimistic if you do
it all the time
you're being permanently pessimistic
however I'm here to tell you that
because of dr. Seligman ii claim it does
not have to be that way now being
pessimistic in dr. Seligman sturms is
not necessarily a bad thing I'm not here
to say it's hey you should you should
you should get a doctor look at that for
you I'm here to show you some tools if
you want to make some changes but
there's reasons why people who are
pessimistic continue to survive and
sometimes five it's not necessarily a
bad thing however in my life it was and
I was very interested in the second
claim could I make different choices
what if I went the other way would you
be surprised to find out that people
with the other asymmetry exist
anytime something good happens to them
it's about them it's just one example of
this very general good thing about them
and it's the thing that's always been
with them and you know what probably
always will
that's how optimists explained good
things for themselves and what about the
bad things because they do come along
well it's not about them it was just
that once time and it's just you know
one specific thing it's not you know the
whole part of their life they all return
the bad things into pebbles and the big
good things into boulders now again I'm
not giving a value judgment that
optimists are better
on average his research shows that
optimists are happier on average his
research shows that optimists are more
productive these are things you may or
may not wish to seek in your life but in
terms of our values as human beings
that's not what it's about
but then again our values of human
beings really isn't about the way we
explain things to each other they're
about the changes we make in the world
the way we treat each other these terms
pessimists optimists are tools just like
a microscope or glucose monitor for
learning things about ourselves so that
we can if we choose make change that
works now his book was called learned
optimism because it was about being able
to learn to be more optimistic I have to
tell you that when I read the book I
literally cried it was like oh my god
that's totally me I see it what should I
do the book described cognitive
behavioral therapy or CBT which was
basically when things happen to you
writing them down in the diary writing
down your explanation as opposed to
implicitly floating around in your head
and then rewriting it in the optimistic
form and looking at it and asking
yourself are both of these valid it's
not about brainwashing yourself into an
optimistic form but just recognising hey
I could explain this in either of two
ways and after a while of death
flexibility your mind naturally starts
to drift towards a more balanced or
possibly optimistic form at just the act
of being explicit now this should not be
a huge amazing revelation for anyone
because we do this all in time with
things like code we might not notice the
way we named variables unless maybe we
submit a pull request and somebody says
hey this could be clearer and then then
we start thinking about our variable
names and the rest of them automatically
start getting clearer just because we're
suddenly thinking about our variable
names the act of making something
explicit and understanding what the
mechanism is often helps us to change by
itself provided is come
with consistent practice over and over
again so what I can tell you is if after
hearing this talk you're interested in
enough to go out and get the book
learned optimism you'll find exercises
in there and you need to do them I
cannot teach you how to do the exercises
here in the room nor will I try I'm not
a psychologist but he is however there
may be some value and you're being
curious about that but again it's not
about knowing the theory it's actually
about the exercises software is the same
way isn't it I gave a talk earlier about
the command pattern and it's all very
great you may say okay now I know the
command pattern but it's only when you
go out and actually start writing things
with the pattern that you begin to get a
feel for it and then you begin to start
noticing opportunities for it elsewhere
in your code and so on our brains work
this way we have to practice we have to
do it's not enough just to hear it
intellectually we have to sort of live
it for a little while so what we have
and what I've shared with you in this
brief time is a theory about optimism
versus pessimism a way of measuring
optimism and pessimism and a way of
making changes which haven't gone into
it for in in a lot of detail but they
exist in there in the book based on
being sort of conscious and aware of it
and and practicing explicitly by writing
down new explanations and his research
so that people who did that got more
optimistic and other positive things
followed from them which to me is great
because that basic premise is that
pessimism itself is temporary if you
want it to be and I can tell you from my
N equals one anok data as we call it or
an ik datum that my unhappiness was in
fact temporary when I followed this path
I got better I got healthier my mood
improved in an important way
and that's the conclusion and that was
learned optimism now
what I've just given you is a slightly
condensed version of a talk I've given a
number of times but it's not the only
explanation for how people are
successful and productive in their life
I know a number of successful people and
one thing I've noticed about about them
is that they often describe other people
in general in permanent and personal
ways people will say so-and-so is so
smart so-and-so is very intelligent
so-and-so knows everything you need to
know about elixir so-and-so is always at
the forefront of technology and so on
now let's say oh cool how about you and
then they're like and no actually I did
this and I did this and I did this they
sound kind of pessimistic to me not
saying well there's got to be something
because you are as successful as
so-and-so people like your talks as much
your your blog posts make it onto the
front page of hacker news or reddit or
wherever that matters to them and then
they'll give a different explanation
they'll just say no actually to tell you
the truth I just work harder than most
smart people I just write every day one
woman that I respect incredibly deeply
and if you're Google I'm sure you'll be
able to catch the name however I have
not asked her for permission to quote
her so I'm not going to mention her name
right now but she actually gives an
entire talk or just sit where the where
the title is a single word grit and
that's what she attributes her success
to this seems very different and almost
at odds with the optimism model
and in addition to that thing that I've
observed after I first started writing
about learned optimism in a blog post
and and I put it in one of my books
tracker news one day discovered the
speaker notes for an earlier version of
this talk that just talked about learned
optimism and people started talking
about a different area and said no knurl
earned optimism as Johnson's been
completely discredited by this other
theory and people would sometimes
Komachi me say well yeah but there's
this other theory and the other theory
is called mindsets
and it was developed by Stanford
University psychologist called dr. Carol
Dweck and she liked dr. Seligman did a
lot of research into what made adults
successful and also did a lot of work
with children and subtracting children
over long periods of time and you've
probably heard anecdotally either
directly about mindsets or you've heard
a story which came out of her book which
is become sort of a totem for her work
and her approach and that is that if you
tell a child that they're smart they'll
end up failing the developer kind of
imposter syndrome you're trying to make
them feel permanently positive about a
general attribute of theirs that is
personal but it actually kind of
backfires and they become afraid to take
chances they become afraid to be exposed
as not as smart as it seems they develop
impostor syndrome and a lot of people
who read that said learned optimism
sounds like you're trying to do the
exact thing that dr. Carol Dweck's has
done research into that says doesn't
work what's up with that now her
research was not about optimist versus
pessimist she talked about fixing growth
mindsets as she called them and the
fixed mindset is all about permanent
personal characteristics people with a
fixed mindset set think that they're
smart or they're not smart they think
that they're athletic or they're not
athletic
people with a growth mindset believe
that almost everything of importance is
a skill that can be learned or is a
characteristic that can be grown and
that there are specific methods and ways
and things that happen to grow it there
may be genetic or whatever limitations
at age 55 if I haven't done to
basketball yet I'm unlikely to do it in
the next 15 years or so but on the whole
even if there may not be a guarantee
that I can learn how to dunk a
basketball people with a growth mindset
believe that if I practice jumping
I can certainly jump higher a year from
now that I can jump today they believe
that everything is a skill that can be
trained and improved now I'll just say
her book mindsets is amazing and just
like I said with learned optimism if
what you hear is intriguing buy your
book or read it or buy it and read it
buy five copies and get far away to your
friends and family if what I say doesn't
sound great maybe explain it as being
about me and temporary and specific and
go get her book anyway now this fixed
mindset is one that has a dark side if
you have a fixed mindset about being
smart what's the value of reading if you
think that you're smart or not smart why
are you even in this room what is there
you could possibly gain it's fixed
you're smart and so there is a dark side
to that and she focused on that in her
work and the flip side of that the
growth mindset is one that believes
everything is skilled and therefore is
enabled I mean it doesn't mean that you
won't actually go out and train you have
to you have to find the tools you have
to learn what they are you might come
here if you have a growth mindset and
say hey maybe reg has some experience
you can share with me that I could use
to improve my whatever that's a growth
mindset right there
and as I said earlier the anecdote that
sticks with most people because it has
such emotional appeal is about children
because she'd actually done work with
children I think this is very important
and she said that you know children are
soft brain and the way in which we
talked to them and the model we give
them in the way we explain things to
them about themselves affects their
moods and so on and has predictive power
for how successful they will be decades
later based on how we raise them or
treat them as small children I know this
to be true by the way
the most heartbreaking example to me is
racism we can argue about whether you
should say racist things to me about
black people or whatever I'm done I'm 55
I am somewhat certain things I can learn
things I can grow I might even learn
things from a racist person about myself
or people from where I come from and so
on but when you say racist things to
small children you are teaching them
that there's nothing they can do that
even if they become president the United
States the moment they're out of office
everyone will undo everything they did
because they're black and nothing they
does matters
that's a terrible burden to put on small
children and it does in fact affect
their view of the world and you see the
reverse this is people of privilege
believe that they can do anything to get
away with anything because they were
taught that well they were born wealthy
or they were born into nobility or
something and actually they don't turn
out to be great people even when you
tell them super positive things about
themselves the fixed mindset is very
damaging to children when put in that
way so
she did the research and it certainly
speaks to me in my experience as a
parent and as a former child in some
ways still current child that we want to
avoid this with children but as much as
that may be disastrous what happens if
we teach them the opposite the growth
mindset what happens if we praise them
not for who they are but for what they
did to earn our praise in other words
excellent I say you're so smart
sort of thing that I love the ideas
you're incorporated into that essay the
work you pay you work you did
researching this really paid off Thomas
my son's name is Thomas or my daughter
she asked me to read to her about
Cantor's in calculus of the infinities
at night nine years old I could say to
her such a smart kid that you like
infinities I could say fabulous twice of
a book for us to read together this is
so interesting all right these little
choices we make we can do them with a
growth mindset and what are we telling
them the things you do matter to the
world the choices you make matter and
you're capable of making good choices
and hey here's a permanent idea if
you're capable of making good choices at
age nine that's not going to go away
you'll still be making good choices at
19 29 and 39 49 and if you come back to
me in four years I might say 59 they
will hear that they just grew and they
can continue to grow light Seligman she
discovered that mindsets can change and
like Seligman the way in which mindsets
changed that she validated through a
research was through cognitive
behavioral therapy writing down
explanations for yourself and then
writing a different explanation based on
growth and then saying yourself I'll use
both
very similar types of exercises again
don't just take what I said and think ha
I know everything there is to know about
changing my mindset please read the
original material but what both research
is discovered is that you can change
your mindset or your the way you
explained things to yourself
both discover that there are ways of
measuring the way we behave and then
making predictions from it both discover
that our brains are plastic we have the
ability to change to improve it is true
with technical subjects as it is with
personal things like I like our mood so
everything is both a blessing and a
curse the blessing is all this
reinforcement of the idea that we're
plastic and we can improve the curse is
that the two appeared to conflict what's
the deal with that can you be optimistic
by explaining things in terms of your
personal permanence in general things or
is that the fixed mindset what's up with
that so
getting back to kids mostly because I'm
a parent and parents apparently love to
talk about kids there's a permanent
thing that I don't think will change I
give it I give it let's say my son gets
an A in drama I mean the good drama not
Twitter drama and I could explain it as
his dramatic personality I could explain
it as the work he did in this character
is there some way I could explain it
that fits both models if there is then
both models might work or is it that
these are completely disjunctive and one
of them's wrong we just haven't done the
research to figure out which one well I
certainly could say something like this
you know you've gotten A's and Drama
before and every time it's because of
the work you put into your characters
and the enthusiasm you brought to it
that's fantastic keep it up I can say
you know you can clearly see how well
you've done with this and that if you
continue to bring your enthusiasm to the
subject and to do the hard work of
researching your characters and so on
you will continue to be successful you
can give people a sense of personal
responsibility for good things in their
life a sense of in general generality to
it it's about enthusiasm and hard work
and permanence you've been doing this
it's been working keep going I have
every confidence that you will continue
to be successful when you continue to do
the things that we see make this work
those explanations actually fit both of
the models
did you get an A because you studied did
you get an A because when you study your
grades improve did you get an A because
let's generalize it when you study you
learn and the grades reflect your
learning your growth as a human being
when we give feedback that's personal
general and permanent but also reflects
an arc of making personal choices and
art of skills and that are grown through
practice and through personal investment
we actually create the growth mindset
dr. Carol Dweck talks about and the
optimistic mindset that dr. Seligman
talks about there isn't an either/or
both of these are different ways of
looking at some underlying process that
we humans don't really understand that
well yet and if any of you are motivated
to go and do research in this area
please I beg you apply your enthusiasm
go and learn there's so much more that
could help humanity in great ways in
this area I believe now I have not done
the research I am sharing with you an
opinion I'm not even going to race it by
calling it a theory or a conjecture
because I'm not about to go out and test
these things but I believe it is
possible to construct explanations both
for ourselves that we tell herself and
for other people when we give feedback
at work or to our friends to our family
or children
that emphasized agency choice skills
that can grow but are also about being
personal in positive areas about being
general enthusiasm research and so on
are not just about theory or math or
infinity and that emphasize a lifelong
arc of growth and the opposite we can
explain that the bad things are none of
those
and this is the feedback that I try to
live at paid your duty with my
colleagues I try to emphasize personal
choices people make I try to generalize
the results of those choices when
they're positive
remember learned optimism not all the
time just the positive ones I try to
talk about things in terms of this is an
event on an ongoing arc for example I'm
not going to tell you that your lives
are all going to improve because of this
talk I don't actually even believe
that's true
but what I do believe is you chose to
come to this talk because you are
interested in the way your own brains
and moods work you are interested in
making positive change in your life and
whether this talk itself does something
or not I don't know but I do know that
you're likely to continue to do this as
you've probably done this before and I
have every confidence that if you
continue to be curious about yourselves
and if you continue to say I'm going to
invest my time that you are going to
achieve some growth you are going to go
to a good place in your life
I give this I give this all the time hey
the things you learned I can see them
coming through your code keep going
that's the most common thing I tell
people I don't say you're great I say
keep doing what you do when you do it to
do so well keep it up mind you not
everything is positive not everything
works out well those are the fun ones to
talk about but from learned optimism we
want the asymmetry when things aren't
going well we learned optimism model
asks us to consider whether these things
are personal or whether they're really
impersonal we learned optimism model
asks us to think whether this is some
general bad thing or whether it's just a
very specific thing and the learned
optimism model asked us to consider is
this thing part of an ongoing bad thing
that has been happening and will
continue to happen until I'm dead or is
it just this one time and when we talk
to ourselves or give feedback to others
we can de-emphasize the personal nature
we can make the events specific and we
can emphasize the temporary nature of
this particular effect
you know reg in the country that doesn't
give a about baseball a baseball
jersey isn't necessarily the best choice
but it's just what you are onstage don't
don't give it a lot of thought just be
curious about that the next time you're
choosing what to wear if you think about
it that feedback also emphasizes the
fact that you can make a different
choice at the next talk it gives some
positive things going forward but it
doesn't sort of emphasize the fixed
permanent nature of bad things in your
life I actually don't think this jersey
is bad but what do I know so
when explaining things to ourselves or
to other people again we can be
conscious about the way in which we do
it we can
we know that when giving people feedback
for performance improvement in the
careers or in their lives you do have to
give them specific things to do in
specific feedback otherwise they can't
improve kaija Duty we emphasize part of
the methodology is after a major
incident you have to have a post mortem
there's no good being completely
wishy-washy well in general this is
happening you have to be specific this
should happen and this shouldn't happen
but we can cast the positive things as
being specific items that are part of a
larger pattern and we can take the
negative things and just talk about the
specific item it's not a compromise on
reality it's just the way in which we
frame reality sometimes we have to give
some feedback there's both positive and
negative we can start like this
something very specific very very very
temporary this blog post lacks a
narrative we can then smoothly shift
gears into the positive and permanent
again these things become natural when
you practice
we can learn to give feedback that fits
the learned optimism model for negative
things and fits both the learned
optimism and growth model for positive
things both separately or together in
one conversation with ourselves and with
others the two models really can fit and
so when someone says I'm not smart but
I've got grit I say this grit is what
gives you the motivation to do all these
great things and get these great results
keep going love what you do keep doing
it do more of it
explore more ways to take this grit and
make the world a better place it's not a
repudiation in fact it's a reinforcement
of what I learned I believe about being
successful about being happy about
seeing the world in a positive and
welcoming play way
so
this experience that I went through and
still go through to this moment is very
personal and normally I wouldn't think
of this as being a great talk for a
software conference but culturally I've
noticed that as an industry we often
have a fixed mindset anytime you read
about what we're looking for smart
people you're listening to people who
have the fixed mindset not the growth
mindset right and there's a lot of that
going around the negative feedback is
almost always permanent Oh
someone's always a bozo not so-and-so
said of Beau's delicious thing or red
you know that particular thing you said
doesn't I'm sorry it doesn't work but
reg is a bozo that's like that's the
fixed mindset right there and so I do
think this is important to share in a
technical context because I do think
it's a prevalent issue in our industry
however I'm not a one-man crusade on
this I've noticed that things get better
when people who care about it share and
in my lifetime I've seen things get
better in my lifetime I've seen more
people complain about bad feedback and
bad choices why because more people are
aware I see that positive I see that in
a positive way we hear about it more
because people have stopped putting up
with the and that's fantastic
that's how we changed change comes from
people's protest and say that's a stupid
thing to say in a code review
so-and-so's a bozo stop it stop it
that's fantastic as an industry we are
getting better
not fast enough but all of you who are
doing something about this keep doing
what you do when you do what you do so
well our industry is getting better and
can get a lot better and that's why I'm
talking about it so wrapping up here
with a nice picture of I think it's
called hearta and in Reykjavik there are
the two models the learned optimism
model which I spent the most time
talking about because that was my
strongest personal experience and the
growth mindset model by dr. Seligman and
dr. Dweck respectively or I should say
dr. Feldman and wek I believe both of
them have powerful things to tell us and
both of them have a model about how we
can improve and change I believe both of
them provide us with a model for
communicating with others and working
with others whether they be our
colleagues or our friends or feedback
for me about my talk I believe that this
is more than just a personal thing that
it affects larger groups teams companies
the culture of an entire industry I
believe I've seen our industry on a
positive arc and that if we continue to
do the kinds of things that have been
working so far and step it up things
will get better faster and that's why I
came here to talk to you today thank you
