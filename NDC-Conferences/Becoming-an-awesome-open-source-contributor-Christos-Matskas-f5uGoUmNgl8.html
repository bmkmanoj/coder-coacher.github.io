there so I know what the challenge is to
be in here stuck listening to us but a
promise I'll make I'll make it worth
your time so my name is chris i'll spare
you the rest of the introductions i work
for microsoft and yes i'm really
passionate about open source lots of
people working on myself these days are
passionate about open source and the
purpose of this talk is actually to get
you up to speed on what you need to do
to get started with open source so how
many of you do open source here how many
of you would like to do open source but
you have no idea how to get started oh
well somebody had start somewhere so
that was me okay so the things that will
cover today is what do you need to know
why you care why you should care about
open source what you need to know when
you get started with open source and if
you're already a maintainer maybe over
project maybe how we can make you an
even better maintainer okay so let's get
started why should he care about open
source first thing your friends will
think that you're a hacker right when I
when I thought about and so it was all
about Linux kernels and things like that
and I never thought in my 12 years of a
developer that I'll be able to
contribute to open source so it's very
cool people you'll think that you're
doing crazy stuff even you're all you're
doing is just contributing to
documentation for example yeah that
still counts as open source I'll tell
you that and second thing you're going
to get some really good relationships
out there you're going to make some new
friends and you're going to build your
network it's going to help you going
forward with finding answers to problems
that you might not have had before so my
experience throughout open-source I
gotten closer to some of the people are
actually speaking here today and I met
them through open source third one you
actually going to become a better
developer well hopefully if you get a
feedback back from moshi new developers
so the idea is that you start
contributing and you get some feedback
when you send pull requests and you look
into how other people write code and you
get the lessons for that and you bring
them into your own environment so you
become a better developer also if you
are a maintainer of a project you're
probably going to get feedback from the
community when they use your software
and
that will force you into working with
that community and becoming better and
lastly which was myself as a way of
getting into open source you get free
stuff yes lots of companies out there
that will give you free software because
you're doing open source so I companies
like resharper JetBrains Red Gate will
also give yourselves a marine used to
give you almost two grands worth of free
software just because you contribute to
open source so if you can prove yourself
and you can prove that you have a and
open source out there they will gladly
send you free software your way and
there isn't for that is obviously if
you're using it on your spare time
you're going to use it in your 95 day by
day job so they benefit you benefit so
that's awesome open source obviously is
a community and it's a concept so first
of all we work together in the community
space do you make software for everyone
to use out there in fact I don't he can
start a project in any language these
days without using some kind of an open
source component that can be your ID
that can be some of your libraries but
the idea is that we built on the
shoulders of giants right that's that's
the whole point I don't have to go and
reinvent angular because I want to use a
framework for the web somebody else has
already done it and we have
contributions out there for me
personally as a like open source because
also gives you the freedom to fix stuff
so it was a product that you were using
a close source project that somebody
else is at least then if you find a bag
they have to wait for their next
upcoming release which can be in six
months down the line with open source
you can grab the source code you can fix
it at your own pace and then you can
either contribute back or carry on with
your tasks so that's the whole idea it
makes us moving faster faster as a
community and as developers now how do
you get started I think I could convince
to you for the selfish and self
decisions about how to contribute so how
do you get study you've never done it
before everyone is talking about it so
where do I go there are lots of sites
out there that will allow you to do that
github is that go-to place now for all
the open source stuff and there's a lot
of software and a lot of websites like
up for grabs or my first PR or first
timers only that I'll actually share
some of the links later on but the idea
is that we now have places they can go
as the first time
go and find easy tasks to get started
some of the tasks are also marked as
intermediate or advanced or beginner so
it's easy to go and grab something that
might be easy and that him to be
software it doesn't have to be cold it
can in fact be documentation these days
I contribute a lot by just writing
documentation and contributing stuff
because that helps other people and
working in fact my contribution to the
ahp neck or started shows up nicely on
my github II was just fixing a sentence
in one of the documentation and yet that
shows up in my github people passing
scenery another thing I forgot is that
you might improve your employability as
an open-source contributor because
sometimes if you contribute to projects
that a lot of people use that becomes
your testimony of your quality as a
developer right so if you are
contributing a lot of code then it might
be easier for your employer to go and
look into your github repo and realize
that you're doing some serious work over
there it's not just that so anyway other
things that you can do you go to those
websites you find the repo you find the
project that you're passionate about or
you really really hate like you have to
use it every single day and it's crap so
you go right we can fix it we can find
where software our or can do it better
ourselves so find the project that
you're passionate about find a project
that's also active if something has
stopped being contributed to five years
ago there's no point of view doing it
now and then obviously find a project
that you agree with it their license
because we do know that are different
open-source licenses out there so
sometimes GPL over MIT people do have
preferences about these things so we
found the project next thing you need to
do is reach out to the maintainer and
say I would like to fix this i have
found a bug or have an issue or feature
that would like to add in but it's out
start the communication channel because
you need to make sure that you don't
spend two weeks writing software that
the maintainer may already have in there
in the backlog or they may have already
fixed for you so make it public crazy an
issue if you find a bug please attach
some documentation and say i'm going to
start working with that and lastly i
learn how to use gate because that's one
of the prereqs for a working with open
source and whether we like it or not
this is a de facto language now for
working with repositories and repose and
poor requests and so on so
nine basic commands and then this should
take use of it all the way your early
going to go outside the portal in
command so they call them but anyway get
finer repo and start contributing it can
be anything documentation it can be a
graphic design it can be a website at
the side meet or it can be fixing a game
tester adding interest you don't have to
contribute to the core code so that's
that's how you can get started i started
with documentation moved into code and
then back in the documentation so it can
be anything if you are already
contributing to officers you probably
know that you need a contributing md so
that's a file actually explains how to
do other people how to contribute so if
you are approaching a project for the
first time make sure you read the
instructions please do not change the
coding styles for the repo because i can
be detrimental for your pull request
follow the instructions find what
software you need to install and reach
out again communicate if you get stuck
reach out again and ask questions most
of the community is very welcoming and
open and they will help you and support
you through the way but please follow
the guidelines if there are no
guidelines reach out and find out about
them because i know some people like dr.
no documentation or comments the code
some people don't like them some people
like tabs or over spaces you don't want
to go into that fight again so please
stick with the guidelines now if you are
a maintainer again please put some
guidelines out there don't expect people
to come and contribute without you
telling them what the expectations are
and then push back the poor request
that's an important side of things if
you have an open source project as well
make sure that you put a license because
companies won't be able to use your code
even if it's awesome code only because
you don't have a license so an MIT
license or another open source license
that makes your software for consumption
otherwise even if it's in the public
domain it does minute open source I it's
open but not open source and not for
consumption other things please be
welcoming to the community a lot of us
had start from nothing and my first boo
request was to the new Gator Post story
in the documentation and Jeff was really
kind in accepting my request and guiding
me through the process at the 12 a.m. at
night my time was like blurry eyes
trying to do my best to request I had no
idea what I meant but the idea is that
he helped me along the way and if it
wasn't for Jeff I wouldn't be here today
so
try to be welcoming people have
questions I know it takes time of you
for you to contribute but please be
welcoming and help out as much as you
can and I know things sometimes go bad I
know that sometimes circumstances in our
life changing change and if you are a
maintainer and you find that you know
you had kids or you move to another
country or usually comes a shift change
please put a banner out there saying
this is a project I used to work if
anybody wants to take over please reach
out to me otherwise I will not be
maintaining that so that lets other
people know that you have done something
that's changing your life and when
things go really bad we do have code of
contacts these days unfortunately that
we need to attach to our open source
just to let people know how to behave
some surprisingly enough when you do
open source you find that that people
have that kind of false entitlement into
your code and it will demand crazy
things from you and for you so unless
they're paying for your time please
don't feel pressure to do anything for
them but otherwise I hope that some of
you will join us in the open source
community you'll set inspired about
contributing to projects that you're
passionate about and if you have any
questions then feel free to reach out to
me or anybody else in here because most
of us are doing open source thank you
very much for listening guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
