of fun so it's the end of the day of the
first day of NDC and i'm sure you've
gotten your head filled with different
ideas and new technologies that you
can't wait to try but I'm actually kind
of glad they put me at the end of the
day not so happy they put me at the
second talk of my first day but it's all
about having fun and now and my goal is
that on Monday when you go back to work
or maybe saturday and sunday if you
write on the weekend write code on the
weekends you will think about code
differently but I'm going to make an
assumption which I'm actually going to
confirm right now how many of you r dot
net developers okay um pretty much
everyone NR you see sharp developers set
a fair statement most everyone a couple
of shaking their hands like this would
you consider yourself full-stack c-sharp
developers meaning that you know some
tea sequel you know a bunch of C sharp
and you have to know some javascript is
that a fair statement not as many hands
okay this talk is really designed for
those people who raise their hand when
they said they're c-sharp developers I'm
they possibly full-stack one last
question before you start how many work
in an organization that do test-driven
development TDD ok 30 a lot of people
are doing this if you can't see you're
supposed to be doing test-driven
development but it's not maybe working
out the way you want ultimately my goal
is to allow you to perhaps work in a
test driven development shop but write
code a little bit differently and my
goal is like I said to think about code
differently to make you more productive
and more effective on Monday that's my
primary goal so immediate impact and
what you're doing but because it's the
end of the day and we're having fun and
we're going to start with a story so I
don't know if this manage your
expectations but I'm going to give you a
story for about 20 minutes about the
wright brothers actually more about
Wilbur Wright and then we're going to
jump over and I'm going to do a whole
bunch of code i'm going to do live code
without a net in front of NDC i might be
crazy but that's what we're going to do
so just me
your expectations and its first time
I've ever used a clicker like this so
I'm very excited so here's the story in
May of 1899 this guy Wilbur Wright was
in dayton ohio and he sat down at his
desk in that house and wrote that letter
to the Smithsonian Institution now at
the time the Smithsonian Institution was
the place for scientific knowledge in
the United States of America one of the
repositories in the world in fact and in
the letter it's a great letter it's
short you should read it if you have a
chance he said I'm interested in
heavier-than-air flight I'm not a crank
I've know the past people who've tried
so far I'm aware of what's going on can
you just please send me all the
information what struck me most about
that letter was this line I'll do it my
part-time true story about three years
earlier this guy Samuel Langley who
ironically wasn't charged the
Smithsonian that Wilbur had written to
he was the most prominent scientist the
United States because he was in charge
of the Smithsonian where he was
prominent and he was interested in
heavier-than-air flight too so three
years before Wilbur even thought about
getting information about having their
in-flight he went ahead and created a
half size model an MVP if it were of
heavier-than-air flight that thing and
this is actually this photograph was
taken by Alexander Graham Bell a friend
of Langley Langley had hi friends and up
friends in high places and so the guy
who invented the telephone good friend
goes on on his rowboat takes a picture
of that half size model and that thing
flew for two minutes world record and
lying like that said this is great I
flew something for two minutes all I
need to do is making a little bit bigger
one feature add make the engine a little
bit stronger to carry the extra weight
second feature add and I can put a human
on it ship it so Langley said ok I can
do that but I need a little bit of money
so he calls up his buddy well maybe he
talked to his buddy anyone ever that is
Roosevelt that's right I don't candy
anymore uh oh I'll hit you up later
that's Teddy Roosevelt at the time he
was the secretary of the Navy and Teddy
Roosevelt this time was very interested
in war and you know bombing our enemies
in the United States and and Langley
said you give me some cash I'll make
sure you have a military weapon that no
one else in the world can have seriously
and and Roosevelt said that's a cool
idea I'll give you 50 grand or he got
the ward harm to give him 50 grand took
a couple years ago and 50 grand annual
if you index that too and oh my gosh
you're right that is love if you index
that to inflation it's really not that
much it's like 22 23 million dollars but
at the time that was the largest amount
of money the United States government
had given to any scientific endeavor so
it was huge and the press thinking is a
boondoggle for heavier than flight air
flight which is going against the laws
of Newton no one should be doing it okay
so now we have Langley three-hour head
start 50 grand in the bank he actually
had 20 more he could pull up bill on in
1903 in December Langley had the first
chance he spent the time built his
little bit bigger a little bit stronger
engine and I don't know if you can tell
by this picture but it's already sort of
pointing down and yeah and the reasoning
washed over waters because it's he was
kept crashing and if it hit the ground
like Earth it would break apart so the
water was better anyway it was going
down completely wipes out a couple days
maybe a week later he tries again this
time he goes up and then goes down and
then he couldn't convince the guy who
was flying it to go anymore ah meanwhile
about two weeks later in Kitty Hawk
North Carolina Wilbur and his brother
Orville launched the fort's four times
first heavier-than-air flight controlled
it in flight the first one was about a
minute after that they just kept going
and going and going so my question is
why did the Wright brothers succeed part
time no money and Langley a lot of head
start a lot of money almost there he had
a half size model working why didn't he
succeed and to that I wanted to go to
this guy he's a guy named Jeff
Sutherland
and 70 years later after the Wright
brothers flew he was actually flying jet
air cranked airplanes which is kind of
amazing you think about what within 30
within 70 years we're on the moon and
we're flying jet aircraft aircraft so
but that's not why we know when we know
him because he and along a bunch of
other as friends all middle-aged white
guys went to snow snow bird and wrote
the agile manifesto and i'm sure i'm
hoping that most of you are familiar
with the agile manifesto test-driven
development right TDD some of your ways
in your hands and these people uncle
bob's up there and and andy hot and all
those guys they had sort of different
specialties and sutherland now he's down
there in the middle bottom he was a
scrum guy with a couple other people and
he wrote this book called scrum doing
twice the work in half the time i read
that book right after i read david
mccullough on the Wright brothers book
and I said you the parallels between
these two books is so crazy there's so
much there that I want to look at it and
then I thought in the interesting thing
is the Sutherland is talking about scrum
about of organizing teams outside of
software development like building
airplanes it has directly application to
software development but not just in
teams but about the way we write our
code I hope to prove that to you it's a
bit of a leap kind of an ambitious talk
but that's what I'm going to try to
prove to you so let's start with the
easy stuff oh yeah so he's our moderator
Sutherland verse Langley versus right so
sunland says number one you need a small
team so Langley gets his money the first
thing he does oh yeah I'm by the way
Langley I'm gonna put this up there
often he was almost there he had the MVP
to feature adds boom he's shipping
Langley actually hired some of the best
people in the world at the time to work
on his project at the time the team
probably grew max to 20 I couldn't quite
tell I didn't go that deep into
Langley's day to day and it himself is
20 too big or too small I don't know I
do know that Langley was steeped in the
industrial revolution and every comment
or quote about him as a manager is
basically he's a horrible human being
like if you work for him you had to take
two steps behind him as he walked down
the hall Kuip stuff and I don't think
that's a typical I don't mean to like
this historical revision on the guy but
that's the way he sort of approached his
group and he said look half sized model
just make it bigger bigger engine get it
working and they said sure boss we got
that Wilbur on the other hand in total
at any point in time two and a half
maybe three people you know his brother
Orville and you also a guy named Charlie
Taylor who actually built the engine for
him and that's it Wilbur was much more
hands-on working working working very
small team and and that's so someone's
telling you that you needed a small team
probably that's one reason why it was
just a couple of small motivated
individuals working extremely hard but
the other thing that's really
interesting me is that southern one
tells you you should do one thing at a
time only think about that when you're
writing code Langley oh and at the time
at the time the most the most prominent
person who is doing ideas about
heavier-than-air flight or human powered
flight or gliding as it were this guy
his name is Otto Lilienthal they would
make a glider and they'd fly a couple
feet off the ground then they make a
little bit bigger cried at glider and
fly it a couple more feet off the ground
and you can see a picture the church
steeple right there he got about to
about 50 feet off the ground before he
crashed and died and that's not a
typical of what the glider folks were
doing most people before the Wright
brothers were bigger and bigger bigger
then they finally get up high enough
look I'm flying boom so Langley said ok
so here's the problem I need to get up
in the air and I have to do it often I
have to be up in the air a lot so I can
first and so I can figure out this
control thing right because you can't
really replicate on the ground so what
do I need I need a big engine to put on
my half size model and so that's what he
spent a majority this time doing Wilbur
on the other hand said you know what
that's not the problem a bigger engine
what you really need is to figure out
the gliding the control in flight
because there's always a breeze and
breezes are free it's open source and so
if you can figure out how to control
yourself in flight a bigger and bigger
than Leventhal you're done then we can
just throw a smaller motor on it and get
it going Wilbur has a famous quote I
don't know if you're familiar that he
said you know there's two ways to learn
about a
riding a horse either sit on the fence
and watch or you get on the horse and
sometimes get bucked off so his idea was
I need to be on the horse as often as
possible I don't mean money for an
engine to keep me up there so I'm going
to use the breeze I'm gonna figure out
the balance first Langley knew about the
balance problem he had no way of
controlling the airplane but he's like I
need to get up there with that engine
before I can start worrying about
control if Langley decided to work on
the control thing first maybe he would
have actually won but it was that sort
of i don't know if it's by chance but it
was a rational decision that actually
wound up wrong so maybe i also have to
be lucky at times to incremental small
changes anyone want to guess what this
is what are they number of races
releases that's exactly right yawn that
is the number of times they tried to do
anything after they got the money and
they started and there's two things I
want to point out I don't have laser
pointer so the I'll do it on the screen
here the first is right here so Wilbur
and Orville go out to Kitty Hawk North
Carolina October of 1900 and they build
their first slider and it works pretty
well they saying okay we got it they go
back home to day in they build a bigger
and better they go to Kittyhawk 1901
they do it through july in august or
August in September and things didn't
work out as well as I wanted they got
kind of ticked actually so they went
back and they said all these tables that
those glider people were giving us those
mathematical calculations they're all
wrong so then they went back and they
they basically spent the entire time
still building a better glider redoing
the calculations in a wind tunnel that
no one else had thought of doing before
so then they went out to Kitty Hawk and
then how about those small changes they
then had the ability to once they redid
the they did it correctly basically they
did 250 flights I think around that
number in one month because they go up
and they wouldn't crash so they could
just immediately make a little bit more
change a little bit more change finally
getting their balance in flight and once
they did that they're like I can release
I can release early i can release often
you know what we're ready to throw a
motor on it and fly and that's what they
did Langley half size model three times
half size model a couple more times
let's ship it and you we are
you know what happened there uh let's
get rid of the laser pointer and keep
moving yeah he was almost ready
challenge everything Langley he was
almost done half-size MVP ready to go
just two features away and as I said
earlier they crash in 1901 they were
kind of ticked off about it so the
Orville's biggest contribution to the
project well there's actually two first
was building this wind tunnel and doing
all the experiments with Wilbur the
second thing is he proposed the vertical
tail but in any event Langley wasn't
challenging anything he just needed a
bigger motor and a bigger glider these
guys got kind of ticked because it
wasn't working as expected and then
evolved the design well I don't have to
say it again they were almost done and
there's the Wright brothers every year
they went back with a bigger model they
challenged in 1901 before they got to
1902 and they were getting new in 1903
they were going to succeed the last one
and this is where we're going to go to
in our language discussion Langley was
supposed to be doing this full time and
it's kind of ironic because Wilbur
Wright said he was doing that only part
time but Langley hasn't charged the
institution and every six months or so
we had to go somewhere to you know
expose the world to American scientific
knowledge so in that period when they
were racing Langley versus the Wright
brothers lying Lee went to Europe once
on a tour he went to the Caribbean once
and he also went to Tahiti once nice
work if you can get it meanwhile we'll
we're in orrville they um they basically
gave over their bicycle shop to their
sister and Charlie Taylor and they
worked on that all the time they could
so they removed all the noise from their
life they didn't have parties like
Langley is doing so I think you know
that sort of says something so what does
this have to do with writing software
well you can see a couple years later
after Kitty Hawk the Wright brothers
were in their airplane they're flying a
couple hundred feet off the ground
that's a very famous photo of Wilbur
flying by the Statue of Liberty during a
big celebration in New York City and
Langley not getting his third attempt
let me ask you this when you write
software when you write software are you
doing one thing at a time when you're
writing software are you evolving the
design are you making small change
etc and etc this last one is important
particularly for you c-sharp full-stack
test-driven development folks i'm going
to show you now what repple driven
development will do and i'm going to do
some live coding I know some of you are
like already on the edge of seats like
some of you go to the stock-car races to
watch the crashes and so I get that but
I think instead of me just sort of
talking about it and showing pre-built
slides I'm actually going to show you
how it happened so and it's a whole lot
of fun so the first thing I'm going to
do is recognize that Microsoft it build
about a month ago said ok all you full
stack developers you better know the UI
and you already know your MVC over here
with your JavaScript you already know
you already know WPF and your windows
forms and you already know your xamarin
we're going to throw another UI
framework at you and has no visual and
components all oh I have to get out of
visual F sharp and go to other languages
and yes that feels good and what you
have to learn something about bots so
people familiar with bots it's like the
new wave a couple people are raising
their hands it's the new way of
interacting and the point of bots are
that you have a conversation back and
forth either an SMS or in slack or oh
it's not flipping know why it's not
flipping i minimized it all right well
screw it i'll close it how are we doing
now
Thank no all right going all right here
we go sorry thank you young anyway so
here we are and I wanted to do and so
when they introduce this at Build last
month they did a stock inter leiser
program in a bot and curiously are
coincidentally about six years ago when
I when they started rolled out afshar
and the first video I saw they were
doing stocky analysis to it so I'm like
okay so I guess everyone has to do it so
what I'm going to do is you know bots
are just another the UI framework so you
could have a stocky analyzer MVC or a
xamarin 1 or a 0 s and Android or
whatever but we'll just do a bot and
i'll show you in action it's easier for
me just to show you then explain it but
as this template fires up you might look
a lot like a c-sharp asp.net Web API to
project because that's what it is
there's a single controller and in it
there's other stuff in front of the bot
framework there's a single method called
post yes it's a post and you can see
what they have their boilerplate code
you get the length of the message in the
knee return the length of that message
back they also have this really cool
thing called the bots emulator so if I
come over here and hit run i'll let that
spin on up it's basically just spitting
up a website in the back yeah see it's
localhost 3978 and I'm going to come
over here let me know when we're done
and I'll say something like hello world
and i'm going to send it to the bots and
the bots going to say okay it talks in
json you sent 11 characters all right
that's what you get out of the box so
now you're thinking yourself okay that's
kind of interesting but what do I need
to do to take this bot and give it
really smarts good smart maybe tell me
what the stock price is in is is right
now we're better yet tell me what the
stock price is going to be tomorrow
maybe I'll trade on it oh and by the way
if you guys had implement this and you
guys start making money please let PD
and do you see you have some money back
please they'd appreciate it so here we
go so I'm going to add a new project I'm
going to go to visual F sharp and grab a
library
and it's a stocky analyzer
and I'm also going to get my cheat sheet
actually I'll do it like this one second
please I had that open I must have
closed it by mistake this isn't get and
we are in rebel driven development all
right good I just have some references
and whatnot that we can afferents so
here we are in f-sharp which has a rebel
out of the box I know C sharp has a
ripple we'll talk about that in a couple
minutes but for now we're going to stay
with F harp so the first thing I'm going
to do is delete all the boilerplate all
six lines of code three of which your
comments and and now I'm ready to write
in my script you can see up here at the
top is where I execute the code once i
execute it gets sent down to the bottom
part if you're not familiar with rebel
at all it's very much like the sequel
server management studio the query
analyzer will you type select star from
customer at the top and the bottom you
get your results data or we conceptually
okay once you see the first one I think
you'll be fine if it's still a little
bit fuzzy so what I'm going to do is
bring in some packages that I've already
added references to let me do one more
thing and change the framework down to
46 yep and I'll wait patiently while
changes that and I'm going to change the
target for three all right so this adds
I'm going to just make sure we're
working and we are so I'm adding some
references i'm going to F sharp data
okay and so where I want to get my stock
information just like a control Z that
just like everyone else in the world I
go to yahoo because it's free for now
until they're purchased and so if you
open up this uri on finance yahoo you
can see i have historical data of stock
prices the date the open the high the
clothes and everything else in the
adjusted clothes and notices in
descending so the most recent date
yesterday is there and looking back at
the code oh sorry looking back the URI
you can see it's right there I just
picked Microsoft for no apparent reason
other than I know Microsoft has data in
there so what I want to do
is I want to do this
uh okay sensitive please
all right let's see if I resolve thank
you and then you know i'm going to copy
this over just so you don't have to see
me hyung pic too much through it but i'm
going to go ahead and get the stock info
here and so in f-sharp this is not a
talk about the f-sharp language there's
plenty of those out there but in general
terms on the the type is the context
those you in turn who've done entity
framework you already know what i'm
talking about it sort of does the data
definition of whatever data source
you're at in this case it's a csv file
and then here is now give me an instance
of it notice the URI is the same that'll
be changing soon but now now that I run
this down here I can do something I can
see the data coming down like so I mean
pop that open you can see that we have
rows of data and there a sequence kind
of like your list in c-sharp if you want
to think of it that way and then you see
the the daytime and the open and close
and everything like that so I just want
the rows of the data that's all I really
care about now I got the stock data and
these rows of data and I want the most
recent one I think so i'm going to do
something like this I'll say stock info
okay so I need the I'm going to map and
I want the function of a stock info I
want the adjusted close and then you
know what I only want the latest one so
I'll do seek head pretty straightforward
right if I run this like this I run this
like this and I look in the output you
can see that $52 and nine cents is the
most recent close and I should really
make that a float
yeah ok so I'm done I now have a way of
I've gone out to some data and I use the
type provider sort of made things life
easy for me and I've sort of figure out
okay I've used a high order function
called map and I've gotten the adjusted
clothes for all these things only and
then I've gone ahead and gotten the
first one which is july set a june
seventh and i change it into a float I'm
ready now to put this into production so
what I want to do is I'm going to come
over here and i'll call this stock
provider and because i'm a good dotnet
citizen i'm going to call my type the
same thing as my class of file name
which is very common in c-sharp not so
much in FG arp but anyway and so this is
going to become my managed extent
assembly and so a first thing i want to
do is say get latest stock price and I
need a parameter right the ticker and I
don't want to return a function i don't
want return a string what i want to do
is come over to my script and say yeah
this works pretty well like this and oh
yes i also need to type there at the top
will take your that in a second i'm
going to come over here like this like
so i have a second type up here and then
i had to open f sharp data mm-hmm oh one
more thing please
recent
oh my goodness Jamie Dixon excuse me for
one second nothing to see here really I
thought they had this project all set up
ready to go and so this will be one
second while I navigate through some
directories I'm sorry about this all
right there we go okay okay so so I have
this and you're thinking okay this is
great we should ship it but in fact what
happens if someone passes in something
other than Microsoft like that any
guesses well it went quickly I should
really just pin the FSI but you can see
I'm getting a not found right and it's
actually a type system net web exception
so what I really need to do because I
can't control user input from my bottom
just like any other web page i need to
do a try for now and then do a with a
system dot web exception and i'm going
to return negative 1 point 0 so if I see
a negative 1 point 0 I know it's a
failure everything else I'm going to get
a stock price so I've now done my happy
path and I've done one at least one
common exception I can build this
now you're thinking well I'm doing
custom and development and even though
i'm going out to yahoo i should be using
a mocking framework this is an
integration bear with me there's i'm
just doing this to show how we can add
in unit tests and and how it all works
sort of together i'm going to grab the
tests i'm going to bring this in i'm
going to add a reference guys doing well
and then going to go over here I'll grab
tujhe to I'm sorry I need to go to my
projects and oh I already made a
reference look at me i'm going to go
over here to the test and i'm going to
grab one unit test it's actually an
integration test we get this but it'll
demonstrate what I need to show which is
I'm just going to bring two unit tests
in our first unit test mom says okay get
me the most recent price control Z
control period let's get come on resolve
this mm-hmm
I'm already analysed in it so I just
need the using statement visual studio
is not moving as fast as me let's try
this at the top let's try this right it
was chicken software docstoc analyzer
how you like Oh semicolon we good now
come on oh it's the wrong method name
thank you who said that is a yawn I said
get latest stock price it's actually get
rose recent stock price now we build it
why don't we like this now get most
recent price yeah it does so now if I
run this and I'm going to run the first
one you can tell I just said okay get me
the most recent price and make sure not
null is coming back the second one I'm
passing in garbage and expecting a
negative one back this is an integration
test it's not a unit test that's not
really the point the point is to show
you that how you can use your unit test
projects written in C sharp and access f
sharp assemblies and how you can move
your on your coat over from the repple
like that OOP do not like that it failed
oh good call thank you young thang
honest you showed up
alright let's build that
and now we come over here
and now we need to run tests and you can
see that now we'll get our negative one
back thank you young okay so you're
thinking okay that's kind of interesting
oh and then finally what I can do I can
go over here to my bot I can go to the
controller and now that I have some
decent unit tests i'm thinking okay
everything that looks covered what i'm
going to do is implement this i'm going
to ship it by putting this F sharp
coding and do like this right I go get
my new stock provider oh I have to add a
reference excuse me last time I should
do that I should have to do that
stocking analyzer the method name is
wrong as I remember oh no no I change
that that's right get most fearsome
price I'm going to go ahead and say
can't be found or it's going to say your
current price so I run this and then I'm
going to come here and i'll type in
Microsoft or IBM or whoever and sure
enough Oh can't be found msft okay 52
bucks my favorite stock Prince
particular price food oh and I should
also show you that if you pass in
garbage can't find it you're thinking
okay this is kind of an interesting
demonstration what does this have to do
the Wright brothers now let's get
serious with their coding and are
iterating our thoughts we want to know
not just what the stock is doing today
but we want to know what the stock is
doing tomorrow so that's going to take a
little bit more advanced thinking and we
want to do it very easily when you're
doing it quickly so let's do it like
this i'm going to come on down here i'm
going to add in some references
and I'm going to say ok I'm going to
load an f-sharp job charting and i'm
going to say ok mmm bring this down
thank you i'm going to take this stock
info first thing I'm going to do when I
do a chart let's do a basic line chart
how about I'm going to say ok I only
only need for the stock information I
only oh excuse me I want the date and I
want the adjusted close and then I'm
going to send this to a chart and i'll
even spell it right and i'll do it fast
i think it's a fast line chart yeah and
then i could do something like this and
so i can check out the stock symbol and
this is for microsoft but you can see ok
yeah it seems to be going up and maybe i
could throw a log at it and stuff like
that but that's just not good enough
when I when I see a line chart like that
I probably think well I probably want to
predict the future and I have these sort
of dates and maybe this is the best way
is just predicting the date what
happened yesterday might be a good
indication of what's going to happen
tomorrow why don't I throw a regression
at it so what I'm going to do and this
is the last time I'm adding in
references the last time you have to see
this notepad I'm going to come over here
and I'm going to bring in a package
called Accord which is a really
phenomenal a set of packages for doing
basic statistics as well as advanced
statistics so if you're a dotted shop
and you're thinking about getting into
analytics and machine learning and stuff
like that your first stop should
probably be a cord and what I'm going to
do I'm going to copy this in because in
the interest of time I'm going to go
ahead and make my x and y variables look
like this so my
how about like that ah yeah so and this
is just basically converting the dates
into an integer that i can use or a
float i can use and stick it into an
array and the y 2 and so now and come in
here and i can bring in a regression and
when i run this you can say that this
nice make this a little bit bigger that
my regression ran and that make this
slide this up a little bit my r square
which is what i use to a value whether a
regression is useful or not is point
seven eight we're going to remember that
number the root mean square error is six
dollars in either direction kind of a
wide range so i don't know if you want
to trade on it but my but really what we
want to know about is tomorrow so what
should we do well let's do this let's
ask the regression what tomorrow is
going to be so i'm going to copy this
over again spare you my typing and this
will tell you that tomorrow the stock
price is going to be 36 well wait a
minute that can't be right let's talk
with a 50 is it really going to drop
twenty dollars by tomorrow then I
realized well I'm just running a
regression on all these all these stock
tickers and basically I'm just thinking
that it's going to regress to the mean
yeah maybe 35 is the average but that's
what we want do we really think that the
price in 1992 is going to influence our
price tomorrow probably not so let's go
over here and we'll say hmmm what I
really need to do is take maybe the last
10 days let's see how good that is so
I'm going to run this again
and okay for the last ten days maybe I'm
getting a little bit closer notice my
root mean square error is 41 cents so
I'm getting a little bit closer my range
but my r square is five percent I don't
want to use this model what should I do
well well if tens not working how about
20 okay let's try it well there you go
are our squares up to 54 so it's
slightly better than a coin flip and
yeah tomorrow it's going to be $51 and
14 cents trade on it today so let's
assume that we talked to our boss and we
said okay that's good we're slightly
better than a coin flip well let's put
this in production you say sure boss I
got this i'm going to go over to my
compilable extend lee i'm going to build
another member I'm gonna get rid of the
repple now I'm gonna say member this dot
predict stock price and I'm going to add
a ticker and then I'm going to add a
target date something like that right so
it's the date that we're going to target
2 i'll use that try with again because
basically we're going to the same data
set but in here i'm going to get rid of
all this code go back to my rep or my
script i should say and I say okay
pretty much everything from here on down
is good I'm going to get this in here
tab it over now this is going to get rid
of this and yon you don't have to tell
me but yeah there's the ticker symbol oh
yeah now I need the Accord stuff coming
over to so let's go back into here and
we're going to go into here
one more thing then
now we're still running huh
and I'm going to go at the browse again
I know I actually have them all right
here one second a accord accord math and
the court statistics ok
so why don't you let me do that before
maybe I was too quick with a there we go
hit OK it doesn't oh it's the wrong path
thank you who said that I get you candy
second I'm sorry to do this to you then
and ok and then want to browse a couple
more the cord math accord so we just
need the Accord that statistics
it add hit OK do and get out of here
let's go over here all right we're
building so now we have oh this is going
to one more we need a system data now
system data should be in the gac so that
should be of course it's not right there
I'll just go up the assemblies in the
framework at stake there I'm sorry guys
I did actually have this all prepared
and now i'm fat fingering up getting ok
alright so here we go so now we build
yay we can dude references so now we're
predicting oh and there's one more thing
instead of tomorrow being the date that
I just sort of threw in there I'm going
to get rid of this new daytime and
pulling in the target date and we have
to give the compiler a little bit of
help so this is in system date time
there we go
uh
float array 0 and then this is also
coming out as an array so I have to
change that to seek head build it go
over to my tests I want one more test
right here where I just want to check
okay do I get the next date
and run the test
yeah so in running green so so you can
see how I've moved from the repple and
then I've moved it over to my compiled
assembly and then finally I also can if
you're so inclined and I have 10-15
minutes left I can then obviously have
the bot tell you oh I might as well
can't just finish it like that we can
have the bot tell you what the current
price is and what the date is going to
be so I come down here to reply message
I'll get rid of this control V that run
that
I come over here and then so Microsoft
now is currently 52 bucks and I think
it's going to go up 73 cents tomorrow
the Sun regression to the mean after the
last 20 days of data gone back and forth
sort of figured it out pushed into
production this is an example a trivial
example with a little bit of live coding
because I wanted to show you how it
actually sort of works I apologize for
the references but how you can sort of
work that dynamic of working the repple
until you finally figure out your happy
path and let's contrast that now to with
how you would think about I'm going to
fire a PowerPoint again we'll see if
that fire is over for me shift f5 am I
going to get it yeah so southern one
tells you when you and we want to apply
to code that we need to fail fast and
early and those are some examples of
Alexander Graham Bell's idea about how
to do heavier than human flight none of
them worked but if you're in a test
driven development shop at EDD shop what
do they tell you to do first if its
existing code you have to extract it in
her face if it's new code maybe you
don't need to do that you create the
interface then you go and build your
unit test class then you build your test
method then you build your code over
there and you go back and forth back and
forth and maybe you're using some tools
like n crunch and other things to sort
of speed you on your way but that's your
iterative development and compared to
the way you would write code and just
ship it and hopefully QA would find it
or ship it and hope that your customers
don't find it or if they find it this is
faster you're failing fast and earlier
because your QA or your trusted and
development is finding things faster but
is it the fastest way with your current
toolbox and also someone tells you the
really important thing about scrum is
that you need to stop context switching
one thing at a time only what do they
tell you what estrin development you're
in your test you're in your code you're
in your tester in your code they
actually use the example of tennis like
it's a good thing meanwhile your brain
is flipping back and forth between the
two so is that really what you need to
do the answer is now if you just stay in
your rep will until you get your happy
pass and you're unhappy passing in the
throw them over your unit tests you have
a way of working on only your problem at
one
before you need to go over to your new
tests now why do you need your unit test
oh and the next thing is that Sutherland
says is working too hard makes more work
what percentage is the correct
percentage for a code coverage what's
the right number anyone no no no one's
answering yet someone's gonna any number
a hundred percent do your property
getters and setters need to have unit
tests no well we're not at one hundred
percent anymore 42 let me ask you this
does 1+1 really need to be tested like
are you really concerned that the ad
symbol is not going to somehow work for
you and all these things that are in
there I want to show you one example of
working hard here is some code here's a
data structure right does any of that
need to be unit tested yes or no I heard
a bunch of people saying no okay what
about that do i do build unit tests to
make sure that my min length is greater
than to do those need unit tests people
are saying now there too hmm all right
customer adjuster here we go here we
have we're passing in so we have to do
our argument validation because we're
all good c sharp folks and we have to
make sure that we're not having nose
coming in and I'm assign it to a local
variable and then I'm incrementing its
property of number of orders does that
need to be unit tested some people are
saying yes some people are saying no
okay what about this one analyzer again
the customer comes in so I do in null
check and then I check to see what city
they're in and if they're in a certain
city I go ahead and give them a coupon
if not otherwise some kind of business
II logic does that need to be unit
tested everyone's saying yes and then
okay so for the last one does that need
to be unit tested some people are saying
yes like plus two is important okay this
is what I think I think you need a test
on that no ref because you're in c-sharp
and you might have no ref and it's good
to know and I think everyone agrees that
you should definitely use the coupon one
and so you i'm using mock but you
definitely need to mock out to do that
so that's my code coverage is
ten percent if I was in a shop that said
you need to have eighty percent code
coverage what's that remaining seventy
percent it's just working hard for no
apparent reason and I'm sure as
professional software developers you've
been in that situation where you're just
sort of churning out this code because
some project manager thought it was a
good idea to have seventy to eighty
percent code coverage some people are
shaking their heads so someone is
telling you knock that all off and so
this is what I'll tell you rappelled
approving development it doesn't solve
you you still have to have a
conversation about the right level of
code coverage but you don't have to go
through the mechanism of creating these
tests and going back and forth because
you're just pretty much doing the
important business logic in your rep ol
before you should send it on over and
anish if Phi this so why do you need
unit tests well you do it because you
have to make sure you're right you want
to make sure your change proof right so
if someone else in the code base changes
some things in the the code under test
and your unit tests are throwing red you
know you've got a problem and the
serendipitous effect actually when a lot
of dotnet developers started doing unit
tests if you remember back then was you
know it's really hard to unit test void
so people started writing in a more
functional style just because they need
to start working about return value so
they can start doing unit testing and
that sort of forces it's here so what
the cost though is that you do have a
lot of code in a lot of noise and that
context switching is occurring and
suddenly telling you that's not really
what's gonna that's not what the
important things is that's not why you
should be coding so why do you use the
repple well you can be correcting the
Red Bull and you can have those force
those testable methods but it doesn't
really protect against change the repple
code in my mind is a lot like those
architectural diagrams I mean you still
need to do architectural diagrams in the
beginning anyone who's doing agile will
tell you that but you just don't spend a
lot of time doing the beat off the big
design up front you do a little bit of
change and then you go ahead and you
write your code because the code is the
important thing right the code is the
reality that's the Canon everything else
is sort of noise when you have these
when you're doing in the repple that's
almost like a step above or the step
next logical step from your
architectural diagrams because you now
have sort of proved out the IDN code
which you can shift over and what you do
with those scripts should you keep them
some do you might want to throw them out
because once it's in production once
it's in compiled you need that
protection protection against change and
the repple won't give it to you so you
need to sort of think about using both
your repple as proving out your ideas as
fast and as early as possible moving
over to your unit tests and leaving your
unit tests there as a way of change
proof in your code just an idea so there
I am there's another way of looking I
know I do great graphics you're in your
rebel you throw your unit test and your
your your code under test and then as
you iterate you stay with your unit your
code under test now if you want to think
about a new idea you certainly go back
to the repple and you can add a
reference to that compile assembly and
keep working on it and then bring it
back the last thing that he talks about
and this is my only slide where I talk
about the language per se is that
Sutherland thinks it's really important
that you remove the noise in the clutter
and if your C sharp developers you
really think it's important that you
have intention revealing names right
that's like line one in Uncle Bob's
clean code book etc etc and most of you
I would argue probably have reach our /
installed and you use it in fact you
think visual studio is a plug-in to
resharper why do you need it and also
when I did that file new did you see how
many files were created why do I need
all that stuff and and is there anything
underneath that I really should know or
should I just stay with it as magic I
don't have the exam I have an example i
want to show you real quick but my
answer to that is this you need to
listen to really smart individuals who
have worked down this path before about
why you need to learn f sharp on the
first is yan qui who is actually right
here in our audience he doesn't talk on
an effective coding habits in fact he
gave it two nights ago if you haven't
seen it in your C sharp dev you need it
you owe it yourself to go and watch that
talk because you're going to not an
agreement about ninety-five percent of
the time and you will start seeing
yourself wait a minute there is a
different way to write code a more
effective way I will now be faster and
more effective the other thing is
remember I was returning that negative
one
because I wasn't doing structured
exception handling that's not the way to
do it there's a guy named Scott Valen
who's also another awesome person that
you should follow in his blog I've sharp
for fun and profit he talked about
railroad oriented programming and i want
to show you we're going on that second
one one more solution in visual studio
and it's called a the proper and
improper way now I'm not doing Scott
justice by any stretch and I'm not
showing you a solution but I want to
show you the problem or an idea so if
we're going to ship this code and we're
going to put it in production we here's
a data structure do I need xml code
comments on everything do you know but
it's publicly facing c-sharp will tell
you have to framework design guidelines
you absolutely do well so maybe Anita
maybe you don't but what about
structured exception handling we all
know for you know Abramson chawala right
we need a single exception based on our
namespace so in this case it's called
customer processor and it's an exception
in here it's from exception and then I
have other exceptions and in this one
I'm inserting some data to a database
and then I'm also notifying some people
via email so i need that insert customer
exception because i want to insulate it
in case i switch from sequel to oracle
blah blah blah i want to throw a sequel
exception or a sequel client exception
and there's a notification so when i do
it improperly with no xml code comments
and no anything else i go to the config
file and then i go ahead and insert that
that customer that came in i do some
validation and i do some stuff going in
i still think this is pretty verbose but
there's 77 lines of code to do it
correctly to do it correctly you do your
argument and validation of course then
you start doing your tries your tries
your catches your catches your tries let
me know when you stop and we can stop
and you can actually see the working
code what line was it there's only three
all that noise is in your way and you
absolutely need it which is why you need
to look at railroad oriented programming
because Scott makes a phenomenal case
about taking that clutter and all that
noise you need it it's not going away
out of your head while you're trying to
solve
problem and then sort of adding in it at
the end so I would strongly encourage
you or I encourage you to yeah let me I
put that one up again do do do de de I
strongly encourage you to check out both
those blog posts yo yo yo it to yourself
and with that I think we're getting
close to the end I put all this code on
github and I know sort of blew through
and I didn't really give repla driven
development like all the different
iterations you can do justice but an
interest of time and also watching me
code it might be painful for you but go
ahead and if you want you can hit me up
on Twitter or on email and I'm happy to
discuss it with you and I encourage you
to come to the functional our brian is
it next tomorrow at one so after launch
every day come on down i'll be there
jaan will be there evelina and all the
f-sharp oh group of the air and we'll
work through your domain specific
problems if you're interested in it and
we can try to help you along on monday
when you start writing code again do a
file new F sharp project open up the
repple and see if you can solve your
problem doing that and then lift it over
you might be surprised on how effective
you really are and with that thank you
all and let's go get some dinner i think
is it that late at night yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
