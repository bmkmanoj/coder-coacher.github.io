talk I this is my first time in London
I'm having a great time
fish and chips here are wonderful and if
anyone has any recs for beef wellington
please let me know if you got the
hook-up because I would love to try and
I'm really intrigued so my name is
Jasmine Greenaway
I am a cloud developer advocate at
Microsoft and pretty much my job entails
using writing speaking and coding to
show you how to use Microsoft Azure in
interesting ways for fun and profit and
also just to get you excited about the
cloud in general so part of my journey
to Microsoft came from some teaching
experience I'm currently an adjunct
professor also an advocate LaGuardia
Community College in New York City where
I teach beginning front and back-end web
development in spring to about the end
of summer pull out to about and just
split up into two sessions and I teach
about 20 to 25 young young adults how to
to use the web and how in the building
blocks and we start from how the
internet works all the way down to how
to play around with JavaScript and
jQuery we have a lot of fun it's a
really enriching experience and I've
learned a lot and I used that that
learning experience and teaching
experience that I that I used there in
my in my daily life as a Microsoft
employee and as a cloud developer
advocate so I also just thought I'd this
gift teaching a shot and it was this
opportunity the opportunity came up and
I was feeling pretty confident and I'd
already done a few mentorships and
volunteer and a few thought hackathons
and you know I was right thought I was
ready and one of the most intriguing
things about the position is that I had
the freedom of freedom of making the
schedule and the syllabus so as long as
it fit within the learning outcomes and
expectations I could do whatever I want
I could get creative but also practical
with the way that the students could
learn
and that's when that first twinge of an
apostille changer came in what do I know
about teaching how do you know if you're
expert enough to teach the basics of
your profession but I had signed the
contract and there's no getting out of
it and so instead of thinking about my
qualifications as a teacher I thought
about my experience as a developer and a
student and I said and first first way I
thought about myself as a developer I
said what would I say to junior Jasmine
today and what would be the things that
she would have wanted to know at the
beginning of her career so here is
junior Jasmine these slides are not work
make sure this is working I have to
press this here so this is junior
Jasmine just make sure this works okay
so so senior Jasmine I am this is me
probably like my last year of college
and when the first things I did when I
graduate is I bought myself a car I had
a very old Toyota Camry was like I think
late 80s and it was you know it's on its
last leg and I got very had a very
fortunate experience where I was able to
work part-time as an intern toward the
end of my college career and I actually
got hired full-time as a full-time
employee when I when I graduated so when
I got when I could finally say I worked
full-time I gotta go I went and got car
and so during this time you know you're
starting to really be an adult you're
realizing that being adult it includes a
lot of paperwork and you're you know
you're I'm also trying to figure out you
know what what how Karla her car
financing works and just in general and
it's what I'm getting at is I just had a
lot of questions about a lot of things
including as a junior was new dev and
today I would tell myself not to get
anxious and nervous about asking all of
these questions because a while ago a
manager said to me once if you're not
asking questions you're not doing your
job and I took that to heart because in
order to do
you have to understand and learn what
you're doing and having an environment
where any questions were welcome where
there were no silly or bad questions can
bring you to deeper granular questions
and answers and you can start with the
house and the house can evolve into the
whys and you compiled the answers from
your house and you're wise and you can
start experimenting and creating your
what F's and then creating your own
answers I also thought a lot of I
thought I also thought a lot of my job
would be a lot of remembering code
syntax and algorithms and that it was
more about what I know than how I apply
it but eventually I became one of those
people who have like multiple tabs open
on their on their computer so I'll just
leave that then I think we we've all
been there we know how that goes
so then I thought about my academic
academic career what would have been
college Jasmine's ideal learning
experience so in this picture here this
is I think my second year of college I
was in this club called the dance dance
revelution Club if you're not familiar
with the game it is a you take a foam
foam pad and it has at four hours on the
house like north south east west and you
kind of step on it to like this is like
this is like the to the music and so
that wasn't you can find me playing DDR
on a Friday nights and so I was in this
club and we had a parade at the campus
and we had the theme was secret agents
and so these you know so we're dressed
up a secret agents and if you notice my
you kind of can't see my tie because
it's duct tape we were all like
engineers so we were like we were gonna
I didn't have a tie so we were just like
trying to figure out like how do we do
it like duct tape solves a lot of
problems including when you need a tie
so that was me and so the beginning of
the year started with the hunt for cheap
textbooks and if you ever seen and have
you ever seen
but do you have like huge it is the do
you really do they really expect you to
read these 400 pages and with the three
months that you're going to be there
and especially when you have 400 page
textbooks in three other classes like
seriously so most of my classes didn't
get through all the material some
classes I didn't even open the book and
some classes I would maybe open the book
or and use it as reference for difficult
homework questions so in the way that
would pretty pretty much go is that I
would have to go all the way back to
index and you know search for the topic
for the thing that I was I was you know
doing homework for and then you know
while I'm splitting the pages back to
back to that topic praying and hoping
that it has has clues for me to finish
my homework and I got really
overwhelming in a really frustrating so
on topic of homework the main question
that a lot of my classmates would ask
each other is did you get the homework
did you understand
did you know do you know how to start
can you help me and I was sometimes you
get that sinking feeling when you when
you realize that they don't get it as
well as much as you do
and so you so we'd attend class and we
take notes we be there and we compare
notes and we try to figure it out and
sometimes they miss be at a loss and I
just it always just seems strange that
when you know we come to these classes
to learn how to also do mean I'll learn
but also you know get this the
information to learn how to do the
homework if you would assume that when
you have you're working on subject
matter that you know was related to the
lesson that it would make sense and it
would you know it be second nature to
work through it because homework at the
end is just what you feel familiar it
should it should be evaluation of how
well we understand when we just learned
and should be an extension of the lesson
finally busy work does nobody good where
attending class to learn no one likes
their time being wasted and I'd rather
much be playing DDR than doing busy work
and in today's society time is my
and time and this is especially true if
you're a student in the US for college
is very pricey
so I started to feel a little better
once I realized I had a lot to say and
ideas that I wanted to try and I wanted
to have the experience just by teaching
the my teaching experience just go along
my or my my passion and my experience
with my experience in as a student and
in my career go a long way and that the
teaching experience would come a time
yet I feared that my students would
suffer from how long that time will pass
until I got it
until until I just felt like I was a
great instructor but as I started to
teach I realized that my excitement and
my passion suppress those fears and that
the students were too busy figuring out
the building blocks of the web well I
was figuring out how to be an effective
instructor so with that I got started on
syllabus so for anybody who might not be
familiar with syllabus is it's a
document that you that that's usually
passed down the beginning of a course to
outline teaching expectations or
learning accusation student
responsibility any general course
information and let those students know
what they'll be working on and what what
the takeaways will be from the course at
the end of the semester so there were
three things that I wanted to students
to take away from reading the syllabus
first class was interactive we would
code together and they would be they be
graded for par cetacean participation in
class from time to time I would give
them assignments to do in class based on
what they learned and it really wasn't
about what they got it right it was
about the effort is about seeing them
try and the way I would do this is
pretty much it would be it would usually
be some buggy code and I'd be like and I
would say fix it let's let's fix it
together and let's figure it out
and and you know and that was in as long
as someone who was trying and giving it
a shot they would get a passing grade
second they need to know that the only
thing that had to be afraid about this
class fraid of about this class is to be
honest was not is not being honest with
themselves about what they needed to
succeed in the class I wanted to know
that learning anything new is difficult
but we had internet yet other classmates
and they had me to ask questions and
there were no tests so that kind of I'm
sure that was a little bit of relief for
them as well and finally I wanted them
to get excited about what they were
learning so we would have about a 30
minute break in the class so some
background the classes were about four
hours four hours a week which can be a
lot so we do getint we break in the
middle and you know around that time is
when they would start you know losing
energy you know we've ever been like at
a conference when you like you like now
you eat and you start getting like a
little get a little tired so that's you
know that's the same the same thing that
was having my students so what I would
do is I would make make that that
section right after break interesting so
what I would do is I would bring in and
a guest so somebody who was in the
industry and they would know how some
and they would be able to talk about are
what the word were what we were doing in
a lesson plan to and relate that to what
they're doing in real life in in their
careers or we would take a look at some
demos of some what the mother some other
programmers are doing so we had some fun
with WebGL we had some fun with Web
Audio css3 animations they really loved
that and also comparing browser
performance just things to get their
wheels turning and get them excited
about what was what else was to come so
on the topic of excitement knowing your
audience is key for any conference
speaker you generally want to know what
information and content they'll be
excited about and you can infer a lot of
the information based
the type of setting the type and the
setting of the conference and maybe any
past presentations and in the classroom
students are your audience and while it
could be argued that it's not your job
to keep interested it's shared goes a
long way so the solution that I came up
with was to strike up a conversation in
the beginning of class and so this would
be like 550 Maris while I was maybe
taking attendance or maybe putting some
documentation or a my lesson plan
together and this was just a chance to
get them to get a chance to get to know
the students better so it would pretty
much go like how was everybody's weekend
whatever in you know so these classes
are on Saturday so you know everyone's
already feeling pretty cranky so Jose
how was your weekend what's your weekend
plans what are you looking forward to we
also were big fans of video games of
anime as well so we would talk about
like you know so there's this really
popular anime attack on Titan coming out
or out and we would talk about do you
see the last episode what did you think
and we would just like just get just get
conversation going and you know game
right and and just have everybody know
who each other was and you know kind of
just just a little bit of an icebreaker
for the day and but also it was more
than just building a rapport and Trust I
desire to build out demos and examples
that be interested that they would be
interested and could relate to so I
discovered a familiarity I discovered a
familiar familiarity with their
mannerisms and their body language and
so it got to a point where he ever do
you have her many of you have an
acquaintance where you all might have
might see each other at conferences
every once a while or see each other
meetups every once a while and you don't
know very very well but you if you are
speaking speaking to them and you're in
a crowd and maybe someone but since the
conversation she says something strange
or maybe something just strange happen
strange happens around you and you kind
of give each other a strain
look like did you see that that was that
was really weird
so that's kind of where the students and
I ended up in terms of being able to
read their body language and seeing
seeing where they it was a really good
indicator to see where they were in the
lesson plan to see if they understood so
you know maybe someone like a furrowed
brow would mean that they don't
understand what I just said or maybe or
maybe they would just be losing interest
so I knew it was babies time to take a
10-minute break or and so I used I used
those cues so know when to slow down or
when to stop or sometimes we would just
alter the lesson for the day and kind of
just break things down even deeper so
that we all can get on the same track so
this is the example of the first
homework assignment and some background
I would also do the homework assignments
so that they had a baseline of like what
it should look like and you know and I
would obviate the code so that they
could just copy so this first example is
it is like the second week and they all
had you was make a pretty much like a
page just like of a generic recipe or
one of their favorite recipes and so I
would give them some example recipe
sites to look at and then I told them
I'm gonna evaluate you want a few things
I said I told them I want to know if you
know how to use a header do you know how
to put an image on a page and do you
know a difference between an unordered
list and the ordered list and notice
that we haven't even touched CSS HTML or
CSS or JavaScript which is very nation
very basic HTML we would just start from
HTML and build on build it build with
CSS make it look look nicer and then get
get use JavaScript to make it and look
interactive so it's never easy to listen
to somebody lecture you for hours
especially for hours it's not fun for a
lecturer either we've all been there
whether we've been tired or just not
interested we'll mentally dip in and out
of meetings talks lectures and dialogues
and so the students will get antsy
infinity about every 30 minutes or so
and so keeping them interested was
always a challenge but it's hard to
punish students for losing interests
because in the end they're only there
only punishing themselves when their
grades suffer in this case I found doing
live code examples held them accountable
and interested and the general format
would be introducing a new concept
exploring how it works
and then and we'd use just off-the-cuff
examples and usually it would be based
on something that we've all like we're
all like a fan of or we all air into so
for example in that last slide I showed
you we worked with food because we all
had a common love for food so and so
this is a special moment when the lesson
would pretty much turn into a discussion
and the question that would often be
asked was what if you do this other
thing what if you do two X Y or Z and my
answer would always be I don't know
let's find out so we all love a good
cliffhanger and so building on the
suspense would get our wheels turning so
even so basically even if I knew the
answer I would just say I don't know so
we could just explore together and with
that we would experiment by
hypothesizing possibilities and trying
and trying it out and it was really
great because you know sometimes a class
would be split on what like the expected
behavior would be sometimes you
sometimes a concession get a little
intense to be like you don't know what
you're talking about
no I don't know what I'm talking about
it got really intense at times but it
was but it was a really great way to get
the wheels turning and let them drive
for a bit and then also process the new
materials in a way that you know in
their own way it's just giving giving
the space to do that so let's take a
look at how I would actually do this so
this is gonna be a very very basic
example it's I'm going to speak as if
I'm speaking to a class you don't have
to answer it's just so so it'll kind of
look a little bit like I'm talking about
to myself and so what we're going to
learn today
is how to is how to add headings to a
page so me see if I can swap this here
alright so here we go just to let it
stay like this so we have so usually
when I when we get started on a new
lesson plan I'll usually give them like
a very a blank HTML page with all you
know with all the basic had are the
basic elements so they can just get
started and sometimes I would give them
HTML files with like some extra stuff in
there so that it kind of like can delete
stuff and like you know add stuff to
kind of figure out you know and play
play around play around with stuff cut
and kind of see how everything works
kind of like how we do when we see some
code or when we're first day on the job
and we're looking at code and we're you
know kind of poking at things and trying
to see how everything works and how
everything works together so this is so
this is this is like very just is like
very similar and what I would start off
with and so I'm gonna just get into
character here and right now we're gonna
simulate simulate a session so today
we're learning about headers and if you
ever use a word processor like Microsoft
Word or Google Docs the first thing will
you'll usually work on is the title and
the title usually is the biggest part of
oh sure I'm sorry yeah thank you no
worries
so the so the title of the page is
usually biggest the biggest biggest
sentence or biggest phrase on a page to
let you know that this is this is this
this this is what this this page or this
content is about but did you know that
you can also do that in HTML so let's
take a look how you do it we'll do that
and we'll do that with the header tag
and the header tag is really really
short
it's just h1
I'll type it in here and there we go and
now let's just put this is a heading and
I'm going to add some text below this so
that you can see the difference between
the two so it's looks like let's see
what this looks like on on on the
website so I'm gonna bring this over
here alright so when we refresh this we
can see that this this the heading is
the the title of the page and then this
and then the the other text is pretty
much just the regular rest of the page
the tech regular text of the page now
this is not supposed to be confused with
the title that is in the head element
because that is this that's the thing
that you see in the tab in the browser
so that in that right and remember last
week we talked about how that that area
of element element does you don't see
that the user doesn't see that on the
page so don't confuse it to this so a
heading a title could be are two
different things when it comes to HTML
okay so now what so now every once in a
while when you work on an essay you have
maybe a subsection that you want to
separate right so let's add so we'll
usually add like a subtitle right and
the so HTML actually has something very
similar we can call it and call it a
subheading and it's really easy to add
all you have to do is add h2 okay a sub
heading and we can see what that looks
like
great and we can see the difference
between the three the three lines of
text what if you have another one
what's that third one
I'll sleeve that typo there don't feel
like going back so so now we and now we
see that there's a difference between
all all three and including the fourth
one the fourth line of text but what if
what if we wanted to go up to 100 do you
think we go to 100 yeah let's find out
cuz I don't know let's figure it out so
I might see here a little bit and it's
gonna copy some code
so let's first experiment all the way i
need i'm just let pasted in here so i
think i think we can go up to 100
someone else could believe and someone
else in the and in the class believe
that we can go to 100 anybody think
anything different no well let's figure
it out so I'm going to save this I'm
gonna refresh oh and look what happens
so we see heading 4 5 6
but 7 &amp;amp; 8 looked just like the regular
their regular text that we had in the
bottom there so it looks like that only
goes up to 6 and so that's pretty much
how I would teach and you know and just
build build from something very small to
to very deep examples and so it was
really fun to see the students kind of
ask questions and get into it and get
and get interested so and at the end I
really didn't have any issues trying to
keep them engaged because a part of me
part of the grade was staying engaged
but but be also they actually were
following along with me so I'd be live
coding like I was before and they would
be following along and then he'd be
comparing and then we would pause and it
was and just like I was mentioning how
like I was able to read their bio
language I could we would pause and be
like cuz anybody understand and someone
would usually someone would be no
Verizon
they know and then we take a second and
we you know I'd go around class and
maybe students will help each other and
try to figure out what was broken and
yeah it was just really it was a good
time to like get to understand how you
know students code and how they use the
tools because that was another thing
that we had to learn was like how to
learn how to use you know a text editor
and learn a few like shortcuts copy and
pastes and things like that and yeah and
it was like a really just good time to
just to just get your Merce yourself
when let themselves Drive so at the end
of class all the code examples were
they're uploaded to an internal platform
and that for all the students could
access and it was important that
students felt like they could get back
on track if they fallen behind you know
every every once in a while you'll miss
a class and you know it sometimes is
hard to play catch-up and it's no secret
at least in the u.s. that college is
expensive as failing a class is
potentially a sunk cost and we I they I
believe that we all deserve a second
chance
sometimes and students who miss class
can review the notes an attempt to get
back on track and I would also be a
resource for them to ask for help if you
know they were needed to help they need
help catching up and I would not also
help them with the code I would help to
understand you know where they stand in
in the class like if they know if they
need to know where we're not needing the
drop or not I would just be honest with
them because you know no one wants to
waste their time and so on the top of
the examples it was important to keep
them relevant to the assignments and I
just think back on my experience I was
mentioning in college and how countless
times I would just be tearing my hair
out over the homework and just put my
bike my brand-new no so I get so
frustrated because I just felt lost and
you know like even just get you usually
the first question is easiest and
sometimes that was even tough and so
example notes were modeled after the
homework I would actually make the
homework assignment first and then I
build up a lecture after and it was just
not and these and these
examples were not just like a simple
copy and paste solution but they were
just buildable examples that would be
morph that can be morphed into homework
so the approach here was that everything
produced in class will be valuable
references and that nothing would go to
waste so it's very similar like if
you've ever worked on a project or you
know maybe push them coach a repo and
you're working on something else and
you're like and that line of code and
that last project was awesome I'm gonna
copy that and put it in and put it in my
put in my new project hey you know
you'll get you'll get github maybe maybe
you deleted the repo locally no pull it
down I'm able to just go to the raw file
and copy it in copy and paste it in so
that was the kind of the same the same
environment i one of the students to
kind of kind of embrace so it was always
puzzling to see assignments that
attempted to challenge or or trick
students outside their newfound comfort
zone in a subject they were just
learning a full-time student takes about
roughly 12 credits and based on the rule
that you should have two to three hours
or studies time outside of class that's
about 24 to 36 hours of time that you
spending on on the subject but add work
family extracurricular activities like
Church DDR Club all that other stuff
what time do you have to yourself every
day these students make a choice they
decide to come to class the aside to do
their homework and degree-seeking
students have a little bit less of a
limited choice in terms of the courses
they want to take because you have you
know outline of course do you take to
fill some degree requirement right and
so they you know you end up in classes
that you wouldn't normally sign up for
it but you're doing it to fill these
requirements and I had to be honest that
some of these students were going to be
in my class
and so I didn't want to force them to
meet to exceed their learning
expectations I laid out and what I'm
pretty much getting at is why couldn't a
challenge be a choice for them because
if you think about it meeting all
expectations expectations is an a
because the student has demonstrated
what they have learned per the
expectations line out in the syllabus we
don't make a syllabus
we'll make a B syllabus we don't make a
C syllabus so why can't why can't these
challenges just be a choice and just
give them give them the the roadmap they
need to succeed and leave it at that
so in my class achieving past an A was a
choice students could make and it was
extension of the homework so I would
tell them okay get started on homework
and here's your extra credit option and
it would be it would be just enhancing
the homework assignment so maybe that
first example I forget what I did in the
first the first homework assignment I
think it was probably adding a link I
was like figure out us do do a search do
an internet search and figure out if see
if you can add a link on here and add a
link to recipe that's very similar yours
and so it would have very very limited
hints and it would be and that but it
would just get there he was turning so
they could try and build on what they
already know and and of course like I
said they were instructed to prioritize
the main assignment first and it's came
in really handy because you know like a
lot of students they can be like to
procrastinate and will submit homework
late and things like that so I would
tell them in my syllabus I would say if
you're going to submit late do the extra
credit too and if you're going to submit
very late try submit a assignment and do
the extra credit because when they would
submit late they would get points off
throughout you know the for every week
they may submit late and if you can't do
either submit something that 59% is
better than a zero if you want to do
some creative creative finish the main
assignment requirements first because so
this was also
no example of just you know working on
time management because as a student
that was the time management is the
thing that we're all still learning as a
young adult so so the next slide here is
pretty much I I'm gonna actually go
through just some other things that I
learned here in the syllabus I think
were really great so I so in my syllabus
here I had a too long didn't read
version or TLDR and so I've you know
they list out just things that this they
need to just take away beyond time we
work on assignments in class
submit your on top your time set time
for the best grade possible ask
questions after you done an internet
search yes there are extra credit
opportunities raise your hand for help
save your work and then I gave them also
tools it called the section class pace
performance and tips because I wanted
them I just wanted them to get into I
didn't want to scare them I wanted to
let them know that this is hard and this
is going to be a challenging time for
them and but that it was going to be
okay and that all they had to do was
just was just listen come in code
comment code with me and just and be
engaged and and come with with a good
attitude so I'm gonna read I'm just
gonna read this section so this class
this class is cumulative every lesson is
built on previous lessons you'll have a
hard time catching back up if you fall
behind it's not impossible but difficult
you should be writing code at least
twice a week once in class and once
outside of class and this will help you
retain the information that you've just
learned here's some handy tips right
code more than twice a week copy of
examples but don't submit as yours this
is cheating you slack for questions and
getting to know your class so we had a
slack slack slack channel or a sock team
that we'd all like you know
and students could ask questions and
through that as well
pair program of the past week we also
learn how to pair program in class so
that student and students actually
started to make friendships that way and
like you know had like their favorite
kind of like person sitting next to in
the classroom which was really cool to
see if you're not going to be in class
make preparations prior so you can catch
up on what you missed don't freak out
shut down or disappear if you're feeling
lost ask for help assess yourself every
week did you understand the lesson that
week be honest and figure out what you
can do to get clarification on the
things you don't understand if you fall
behind and you feel that you'd followed
you heart fall fall behind please
contact me so we can assess a situation
find a resolution so yeah those are a
few things that I wanted to just convey
to the class and this the you know I
look back at the syllabus there's like
three pages long and you know this is
all they still like interest process for
me you know it's just like I'm only them
to us for one year and you know I've
I've learned a lot just from from
teaching I've been learning how others
learned and it's been a really fun time
and but anyway in the grueling weeks I
saw my students learn HTML CSS and
JavaScript
starting from not knowing how not
knowing basic like copy-paste shortcuts
to like being able to use git and I was
feeling and they were feeling pretty
comfortable and in the beginning they
had mentioned fears they had they got
word like this a lot of math is this
gonna be hard like what do I have to
remember is there gonna be quizzes
they're gonna be tests I'm like if you
read the syllabus you would know they
were the test but you know what can he
do and and and during the class they you
know they got excited they expressed
excitement we had really good deep
debates and conversations and at the end
they were proficient and I knew that
because at that point I really got to
know him well I saw him get frustrated I
saw him fall behind
I saw him stress out and I saw them can
with the lesson and I saw them also
catch up so before closing out if you're
interested in teaching and you don't
have opportunity in academia you there
are other things you can do such as
hackathons tutoring mentorships
volunteering your time at organizations
such as Co org girls who code black
crowes code you don't have to be in the
specific demographic do these things
also know that you can just you can
donate money there it's always there
always a great they're all great
organizations and and like I said you
can also mentor and if you ever find
yourself in a situation like this here's
a few tips for you build trust between
you and your students you can do this by
listening to them and showing them that
you're listening so for me I did this by
putting a dash of our personalities into
assignments in our in our in class
lessons second be yourself there as
nervous as you there are meaning someone
that barely know and working as
something that they have never probably
never seen before and with the setting
be and with the setting in the pan being
professional in mind just be authentic
and also there's also be an extension of
you know just just gaining and guarding
trust and finally adapt to your students
because in the end you're both learning
like I mentioned you're both learning
you're learning how others learn and
they're learning how to code which can
look overwhelming at first it's
overwhelming experience learning how
others learn and you know for others
like learning something completely new
and you know it's just two different
experiences going on and when I learned
this I never made and when I realized
this I started not making detailed
course schedules because I started to
realize that that that you know making
having a structured pace could kind of
inhibit their learning trust
practicality and flexibility flexibility
got my students to where they are now
and that's why I believe only two
students would fall what failed my
classes on average and I also believe
that's why I would get thank-you notes
in my like final projects and final
homework and then final and I would get
like LinkedIn inviting emails to saying
just thank you and it just felt really
good because I felt like I was doing
something right and I hope that that
something was teaching with empathy
thank you open the floor up for any Q&amp;amp;A
all right thank you for the talk a quick
question maybe you mentioned it but I've
got it what was the students age range
they were about from like 17 to about 20
we did have some older older and
returning students so some that had like
small families or had full-time jobs and
other responsibilities so about 20 to 25
would be cousins like the average okay
and I had a full chart and I'm sorry 18
to 25 I'm sorry 18 to 25 okay
I was curious well that definitely
happens more often with kids but maybe
is the same with students of 18 to 25
did you ever have a problem where people
would want instant gratification and
they would be confused and frustrated
because Hadding that we're showing them
this is not something they see on the
web they just want the fancy stuff and
for it to look pretty and colorful and
it can be frustrating even if you use
CSS mhm yes so what I would do so
oftentimes they would copy a bunch of
code that they'd saw and they'd seen
examples and they
in in their homework or you know
whatever they were working on and they
would get frustrated because like this
this is this is what I want mine to look
like in this example and you know we
would sometimes in for me I just would
just be open about it and I was like
okay let's sit down and see what's going
on let's go in so he put like a linter
in like you know the text editor and we
sit down and we kind of pick it apart
and say okay this looks like you might
have copied this halfway let's try and
finish this sent this is the statement
and we just kind of just take our time
and like try and figure it out and you
know one of the things and I was just
thinking and I go I would think just
about like my experience you know I mean
you know how when something wouldn't
work we would comment out like a block
of code and just like you know you
didn't and like uncomment one by one and
try and figure it out like try and
figure it out together so for them so
yeah they would get frustrated but you
know we would just take it step by step
you know just like one you see you have
to fix a bug you just comment stuff out
until you figure it out so as a person
who teaches people how to code on a
semi-regular basis I've always been told
that teaching the web is one of the
hardest things to do because of all the
missing moving pieces from HTML to CSS
to JavaScript what kind of tips would
you advise us to have when having all
those different pieces together in in
together and like one like lesson yeah
oh I would say start from start from the
basics start from the structure I think
I may I would give them a analogy I
would say kind of like a house you have
the foundation in foundations your HTML
and your your lights I think I said in
your license JavaScript like your
electricity me JavaScript and I and I
think CSS was like like the the interior
interior like the the leg trimmings like
the color of the house and things like
that
so it was yeah it was always important
to just like start from again start from
you know basics and even when you're
going down to like one technology so for
example when when it came to JavaScript
you know a lot of a lot of them got very
near
this is like this looks terrifying looks
that's really intimidating so what I
would you know we would start by we
started with just vanilla JavaScript and
that was like did you guys know then
there is a way that you can do this much
quicker so we that's how wait and then
we got to you into jQuery and then like
what why did we do all that I was like
you know it was like because I wanted
you all to know I wanted you all to
start from something very simple and
then work your way up and did you ever
teach a framework in the class at all
just jQuery uh you know at that point
when they got to JavaScript you know
that's when that's when like things
started getting a little bit more hectic
and so you know that was time when we
had to like slow down the pace a little
bit and so in the future I would
probably try you know something other
other that would also do jQuery but also
on something although maybe like angular
or something like that thank you
just this as you've told an umber of
glasses now what sorts of split are you
seeing with gender are you just saying
are they only men why do you see female
percentage I see now um it's definitely
I would say if I had to say a percentage
I would say maybe thirty percent women
which is which is I think is like great
it's a lot it was a lot more than I was
expecting so so I was really excited
about that
and specifically my my college I teach
at is I believe the demographics are
about seventy percent people of color so
it was a lot of a lot of like people
color my classes and it was really great
because like I just I just like saw
myself because like I like I mentioned
earlier that they were like students
that you know that were like big anime
and like video game fans and like that
was me that was me playing DDR and so it
was really it was really a great you
know till I kind of like connect that
way too
any other questions
when teaching when teaching the web
because of my generation or my age
teaching historical context and I think
that that's important but the young
people that I teach to insist that it's
not important mm-hmm and you're nodding
which is not helpful thank you for that
what do you think I think that it's good
in like small doses like it's like that
um you know we're I guess you a younger
age it's like that listicle age you know
you kind of give them like a few bullet
points and keep it moving and I think
and you just kind of pick out those
really interesting things and then and
keep moving and let them let them you
know kind of give them the tools that
they need to like delve into the history
if they want to on their own time you
know let them fall zero little Wikipedia
hole if they want to do that any other
questions thank you so much for your
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
