much for coming let's make a start so my
name is Chris Alexander and I'm a
software engineer for the McLaren racing
Formula One team which means that my job
on a day-to-day basis is to build
maintain and run custom software
applications for use by McLaren
exclusively within the formula 1
industry so today is my first time
presenting at NBC so thank you very much
for the warm welcome so far it'd be
really helpful to me if you were able to
provide feedback so there are feedback
cards on the way out alternatively if
you want to drop me an email or send me
a tweet with any comments then that'd be
really appreciated and hopefully that'll
help me improve ready for what I'd like
to be a next time um so what I'm going
to talk about today is under the heading
north 60 in the dotnet framework but
it's about how we go about developing
software for Formula One so I've got
some questions for you to begin with
actually so I have an idea about how
much you guys know about forming on
already so who's watched any formula one
all in the past whether it's just a few
bits on TV ok most of the audience
that's good whose class themselves as an
f1 fan someone who follows the sport or
16 more driver ok a fair few as well who
knows absolutely nothing about Formula
One ah kind of half a hand ok that's
cool so I don't have to go into a great
exclamation and what formula One is but
there are a couple things I'd like to
point out which and will will help kind
of frame what I'm going to talk about so
at the end of the day Formula One is a
sport it's a motorsport and all these
teams and drivers are competing to score
as many points as possible on Sunday
afternoon so they can get as good a
position in the championship at the end
of the season and then if the
championship which determines how much
prize money you get which then helps
with your budget for the next year and
so you can Gary carry on competing so at
the end of the day is a competitive
enterprise and we're all setting out to
do the best we possibly can to get the
best result on the track and to do as
well as we can so we can carry on racing
the next year now formula One is unlike
a lot of other sports in that there's an
extremely technical aspect to it as well
so maybe I think about this may be
sailing is another example where you've
got a combination of that athleticism
and competitive spirit and the technical
and engineering side of it
well I think fallen ones probably the
most extreme example of a sport where
there's a very strong technical and
engineering aspect to the competition
because you can take the best driver in
the world and if you put them in a
mediocre carbon they're not going to
they're not going to win races compared
to an average or half good driver in a
really really fast car so competing well
informally one is about that kind of
competitiveness and that athleticism but
it's also about the engineering side of
things and being able to deliver
fantastic car components great analysis
and perform as best you can when it
matters on the Sunday afternoon and
there's only those things combined which
then gets you great results so it's an
engineering discipline as well as a
sport in summary today is going to be a
very high level overview of what we do
in terms of software at McLaren so as
it's very engineering focus McLaren and
McLaren and Formula One it's a very
secretive industry in general we get we
tend not to tell people very much about
what we're doing behind the scenes which
is a very much contrast the kind of
marketing and the big show that you see
on sunday afternoon so it's not
typically I'm not typically let out to
tell you many things let's put it that
way and so today it's gonna be very high
level but hopefully it's still deliver
some really really useful insights to
people who maybe aren't involved in the
inner workings f1 on a day-to-day basis
so I hopefully there'll be a lot for you
to still find out about today in terms
of specifics of the topics I'm going to
start off by talking a little bit about
innovation now innovation isn't
necessarily something that's something
that we talked about very much in terms
of our software but it's very important
to mclaren in its history so hopefully
there by talking bit about some of the
innovations that we've introduced a
formula 1 over the years then you can
get a bit of a feel for the history of
McKeown and how we've got to where we
are today in terms of not just our
software engineering but our engineering
in general so then my next topic area is
called big data brackets air quotes and
it's got air quotes for very specific
reason and and I will explain why I
think the big data that we deal with
McLaren is different in a very important
way to the big data that you might deal
with on a day-to-day basis or software
engineers in other industries deal with
next up we'll talk a little bit about
how we as software engineer is actually
contribute to the show what we do on
race
weekends because we're not just nine to
five Monday to Friday engineers we also
work over the weekends on rotation to
help the team perform as best they can
at the circuit and so I'll also talk a
little bit about how we go about doing
that and what our role is throughout the
race weekend and then finally we're
going into a little bit more technical
detail and I'll talk about our software
development process and how we've kind
of evolved how we build software over
the years in order to accommodate the
extremely fast-paced and engineering
focused industry at formally one so
that's what I'm going to go through if
possible would it be would it be okay
for people to hold questions towards the
end or leave plenty of time to questions
so please feel free to them just a note
then for anything you might want to ask
and then ask at the end there we plenty
of time and the other thing I would say
about questions is that as i mentioned
we're all very secretive informal one so
if you do or something like kind of
stand there and smile and nod politely
and decline to answer or maybe give you
some answers that's vague or does your
question then please do understand and
it's for competitive reasons that I
can't dive always any of that
information so if you do hit on a
specific topic area or nerve not and I
do dodge that then please understand
then that's that's the reason why okay
so that's all the preamble over and done
with so I think it's probably time that
we get started by talking about
innovation and I put this this picture
up first because for me it really
typifies McLaren's approach to
innovation and specifically how it
permeates throughout the entire business
so this is a picture of what's called
the McLaren Technology campus which is a
series of buildings nestled in the
countryside just outside working and
sorry which is where we're all based on
the list we have the McLaren Technology
Center which is where racing is based
where we do all of our design work and a
lot of our manufacturing there's also
where McLaren applied technologies
another McLaren company is based and
this is where kind of our hub of our
operations is for the race team on the
right hand side direction you've got the
McLaren production center which is where
McLaren Automotive hands build all of
their road cars on a production line so
and sometimes it's not going to go there
and have a look at what they're doing on
a large scale because they're they're
producing some fantastic cards and which
will have a very brief look at in a
moment but the reason I want to show you
this and talk about innovation is
because innovation permeates through
everything
we do at McLaren so we innovate in our
software which opening hopefully you get
a good idea about that today and but
also in how we engineering different
materials and in fact how we're building
our buildings so this building was
designed by fostering partners the
renowned architects and I found out the
other day that the roof is flat because
when we were planning the building we
had to build it up to the level of the
trees and the surrounding areas so the
building is exactly 11 meters tall all
the way across it's got a flat roof but
of course flat roofs are difficult to
drain and if you're draining a roof that
size then you actually need quite a lot
of kind of piping to get the water off
the roof so when they were designing
building actually all the outlets for
the roof water actually have fins in
them to encourage the water to swirl
around the pipes going down that means
they can get much higher flow rate
through them so you need smaller pipes
to drain the same amount of water in the
same amount of time so for me that's
just one example of the innovation
actually goes into everything we didn't
plan including draining the water off
our roof for example and the sheer glass
screen you see running on the front
there along the boulevard but hung from
the roof and it's actually got wind
deflectors in it to stop it blowing in
the rig in the breeze and they didn't
think it'd be possible to actually build
that because they couldn't get the wind
deflectors strong enough and also light
enough so it wouldn't pull the roof down
at the same time so they got some of the
structural engineers from the f1 team in
and they came up with a new template for
them they could then manufacture out of
Steel which would then make those
load-bearing components in the glass
strong enough and light enough at the
same time so it wouldn't be called the
building up and also not tear it down so
for me this is really a really cool
example of just how innovation permeates
through everything we do I don't got
this really old picture and to tell you
a little bit about home McLaren started
so this is from 1952 and it's our
founder Bruce McLaren his racing in a
hill climb event in new zealand in a
1929 austin ulster but he and his dad
had done up for racing and Bruce really
started racing because his dad was into
it and he was in fact competing at this
event because his dad couldn't make it
and he pleaded with his dad say look I
know you've entered but please let me
race because because you can't make it
and his dad said you know what Bruce
fine he was just a teenager at the time
except you can race but take it easy
don't push too hard don't break the car
and don't hurt yourself so um so Bruce
did that he was quite good he took it
easy he didn't push too hard and despite
that he still managed to win the race
and that's where our competitive and
ultrafast spirit comes from I think from
Bruce in his teenage years starting off
racing and McLaren he had that natural
innate talent talent for speed and that
that's something that continues at
McLaren to today and and it was 1963 11
years after this pitch was taken that
he's signed to his own racing team so
that he could innovate in ways that he
couldn't as a driver for other teams and
he could build his own cars and then
race them afterwards as well so that's
really where the beginning of McLaren
was in that kind of racing spirit and
that need to innovate and build better
cars so that he could in fact actually
raced them himself another more
engineering innovation over the years at
McLaren was the introduction of carbon
fiber is a material in Formula One so
prior to nineteen eighty-one and where
we've manufactured this car here the mp4
one f1 cars were mostly constructed as
aluminium and so far as metals go
aluminium squat a good compromise it's
reasonably light and it's reasonably
strong as well but it does have some
downsides though it crumbles pretty
easily and also if you imagine you've
got kind of the four wheels of your car
then going over curb introduces twist
into your chassis which is really bad
performance and structural integrity and
that's something that aluminium
chasity's are really susceptible to so
in McLaren introduced this carbon fiber
chassis that you see here which is kind
of it kind of starts here and finishes
at the back of the engine here and
carbon fiber is a really good material
because it's ultra strong so long to
manufacture it correctly it's ultra
lightweight and it also introduced a
whole new level of safety in performing
one so those of you who follow us one
more regularly one of sin Fernando
Alonso's accident ins McLaren at the
beginning of last year we were all very
pleased to see that he just got out of
the car after what was quite frankly an
epic tion and was able to walk away and
that kind of that being possible today
is only because of the introduction of
carbon fibers and material inform the
one so as I said it's strong and it's
light but also think
use that really important safety aspects
for drivers as well so nowadays it's
ubiquitous so we use carbon fly ball
over our cars we use it in the chassis
every f1 team uses it we use it in the
in the aerodynamic part you can see
hanging off the front in the suspension
and but also we've transferred that
technology to other industries so that's
something that McLaren is really good at
so this is a picture of the five mts
which McLaren with motors builds one of
my favorite McLaren road cars not just
in looks also because it's only 144
thousand pounds so compared to some of
the other cars is much more reasonably
priced and I was going to say one day I
might get there but I still think a
hundred and forty-four thousand pounds
might be arranged for a car and but
what's really interesting about this is
that for 144 thousand pounds you do get
a fully carbon fiber chassis in your
road car and that's something that
mcLaren has taken from the from the
racing team and applied it's the
automotive industry and they're now
being able to really affordably produce
extremely safe extremely light in
extremely performant cars through the
use of this technology and that
technology transfer is a really
important part of what we do and we do
it with our software as well so all I
said we build our software predominately
for the racing team we do that's our
main focus but McLaren deploy
technologies takes that software and
applies it to other industries as well
so the software that I write today will
eventually be applied to the health care
industry and the chemical industry and
all kinds of the pharmaceuticals
industry and this software will be taken
by MIT in applied to all these different
areas so we're contributing to those as
well another little bit of technology
transfer so something that might be a
little bit more feasible and any bike
any floating sounds out here so yeah a
few so you might be am familiar with
specialized so McLaren applied
technologies took and the racing teams
carbon fiber expertise and applied it to
their shafi manufacturing process so
this is ness works McLaren and with a
fully carbon fiber chassis which
specialized weren't able to produce
before but by using the Clarins carbon
fiber expertise they're able to make
this entire bike chassis out of carbon
fiber and we've got one of these in the
office and you can go and have a play
with it I wouldn't recommend rolling
around but you can pick it up and you
can just literally pick that until I
bike up with one finger absolutely
incredibly light it's fantastic
and also on the carbon fiber can decide
mclaren deploy technologies worked with
the british winter olympics team on
Lizzie on or skeleton bobsleigh not just
on the carbon fiber side of things but
also applying aerodynamic techniques and
to the equipment and she was able to use
that equipment manufactured by applied
technologies in sochi winter olympics
and she went on to win gold with that so
another example of that kind of
technology will transfer and applying
that innovation that we come up with
every day in racing to other industries
so a couple more highlights for you of
things that happen inside mclaren this
is a picture of our simulator which is
very deep deep deep down in the heart of
the technology center in a very
difficult to get to place and this is a
really important piece of equipment for
us for two different reasons so first of
all it allows us to very quickly and
easily test out new parts of the car
without ever annex having to actually
manufacture them so say the engineers
come up with a new part we've got a new
engine data from honda or there's a new
aerodynamic component they will build a
computer model of that which dick then
gets loaded into the simulator and our
test drivers are able to take that out
for a spin for a few laps and able to
provide driver in the loop feedback to
the engineers as to whether that part
makes improvement in the areas that they
think it will and this is really
important for us because it means that
we vastly reduce our costs when
producing new parts so we can produce a
part in the wind sorry in the simulator
and test it without ever having to go to
the manufacturing and testing phase is
actually on the track because they're
extremely expensive activities
especially if it turns out that you've
just built a new gearbox in turns out it
doesn't really help you at all and so
that's a really important tool for us to
in order to reduce the cost and the time
to getting new parts out to the track
and making improvement on the car the
other advantage is and helping the
drivers get used to new circuits so in
2016 there was the gone free of Europe
in Azerbaijan for example that's the
first time that and there's been erased
there in fact we the first time on this
on the Friday morning that anybody
actually went out on circuit there
because they'd literally constructed the
entire track from scratch in the middle
of their city center just for that one
event so
our drivers having had a practice in the
simulator on an extremely accurate model
of that circuit we're able to go out on
the Friday morning and immediately start
delivering good lap times and helping us
to evaluate new parts on the car
immediately with good feedback so that's
a massive advantage for us provided by
the simulator and the final one of our
innovations here is the wind tunnel now
the wind tunnel we actually have on site
it's actually part of the structure of
the Technology Center building that I
showed you earlier and it was kind of
assembled two years prior to the rest
the building and the rest of the
building is sort of assembled around it
and it's great to have this kind of
resolve on site because it vastly
reduces the amount of expense you have
going backs and Fords and and it also
means it's really really quick for us to
iterate parts in there when we're
testing so engineer can come up with a
part design it out in the software have
it 3d printed tried in the wind tunnel
and then get the data back within
minutes from trying it in winter not
from designing it and they can get that
data back from wind tunnel in in in
their minutes and then very quickly
analyze whether that new part is going
to be any use force or not so one
interesting thing about this though is
that because it is part of the structure
of the building they had to actually
acoustically isolate it because it's
between the racing offices and the
cafeteria and you don't want three
hundred engineers trampling past at
five-to-one causing an upset in the
delicate instrumentation in the wind
tunnel so there are some caveats apply
to having having the wind on a part of
your building you have to do you have to
do some pretty sensitive isolation for
that to make sure you don't upset your
results but it is really useful for us
to be able to have that one site and get
those results really quickly so that was
really a whistle-stop tour of the some
of the innovations and mclaren
introduced in Formula One and some of
the some of the kind of kit that we have
available so the next thing I want to
talk about is data and more specifically
big data because i want to show you
first some roughs data volumes that
we're dealing with just give you a bit
of an idea so i can't tell you exactly
how much we're doing we're dealing with
but just give you a bit of a bit of
foundational idea in much in terms of
how much data are actually generating so
this chart shows roughly in hundreds of
gigabytes how much data we generated we
generated come
off the car for each race weekend in
2015 so it's a reasonably linear
progression but we're not growing a
crazy amount and then that that line on
top there is 2016 so again we're
generating more data last year than the
year before but we're still not growing
a massive rate now bearing in mind this
is raw data that's generated by the car
and we're downloading that off the car
and when it comes back into the garage
now the reason that we're not
exponentially growing this data volume
that we're generating and trust me the
engineers would love to they'd love to
collect loads more data but the reason
that we don't do that is because the
constraint of the industry and that is
that the performance of your car is a
function of how heavy it is and the more
data you want to record off the car the
more mass you have to add to the cart to
do that actual recording so say you want
to measure some new I don't know some
new suspension bit I don't know very
much about suspension as you might be
able to tell so you want to measure new
suspension bit what you're going to
actually have to do to be able to
measure that well you're gonna have to
put the actual sensor on the car so that
adds weight you have to worry up to the
battery so it has power for that adds
weight you have to worry up to the
computer on the car which adds weight so
in f1 will if you're in f1 terms when we
talk about adding a meter of warm wire
to the car then that's deemed as a
significant amount of weight that we're
adding and costing us performance so
that's the kinda thing we need to
consider and once you've reached a
certain amount of capacity on your
storage unit you then need add another
one to the car which is then another
load of weight which you have to add so
the reason that this the amount of
pieces that we're generating on the car
isn't spiking up massively through each
season is because we're constrained
there we can't just go ad adding sensors
willy-nilly to the car so that is where
we're caps this chart however in
contrast doesn't just doesn't show the
data generated by the car it generates
it shows all the data generated not on
the car so this is the result of things
like offline simulations that engineers
have run it's all the configuration
information that we store I don't think
it includes like video and other media
but it definitely includes things like
all of the configuration data all the
metadata and all the general bits and
pieces that engineers generate off the
car so in addition to the telemetry that
we
sive on the car now as you can see we're
still talking the hundreds of gigabytes
so it's actually not a massive amount of
data if you if you're talking to
Facebook or LinkedIn about how much log
data they're generating off their
service rigs and we're talking about
terabytes of data so we're still in
hundreds of gigabytes per race so it's
not an unmanageably large volume it's a
bit spiky and that's because of our use
case so some weeks they'll be
investigating different bit parts of the
car and some weeks so we might not have
any new parts so there might not be any
any really big investigations going on
but we're still growing the amount of
data we generating and the what's
interesting if I break this down very
quickly so the red line here is the how
much data the aerodynamics guys are
generating and the blue line is how much
literally the rest of the office is
generating and you can see that for all
but one race i think the arrow guys
generated way more data than the rest of
the office combined and that's you can
see why that would be given the
complexity of the nature of their
simulations but if they're modeling 3d
space for the load of data points in it
over time for an entire lap or an entire
race and it's very very easy to build up
a massive amount of data that you're
generating and storing there but as i
said again it's not it's not an ordinary
mandame of data it's not unmanageable is
it still hundreds of gigabytes but it's
not unmanageable so if our data isn't
big in terms of its size then why do I
say that we've got big data well the
answer to that question is data
complexity so there are a number of ways
that our data is extremely complex now
you might not necessarily think that
because you think well if you're just
reading sensors off the car then surely
it's just a stream of numbers you're
just dealing with just essentially
really big list of doubles right and at
the end of the day then yes you
essentially are dealing with really big
list of double that's what it boils down
to but there's some there's some aspects
of that data which does make it very
complex to deal with not explain the few
of them now so the first thing to
consider is the huge variety of sources
of data that we actually have so this is
an f1 car on a track and that dinner
generate a lot of data hundreds of
gigabytes as we've seen but it's only
one of a huge myriad of sources that
actually generates gates that we need to
analyze together so consider for example
the simulator that generates symmetry
data just like on the
on the car does on the track but it's
not constrained by only being able to
run when the FIA says we're allowed to
run on a track so we can run that
whenever we want almost within limits
and so that's generating telemetry data
as well we've got the wind tunnel which
have also shown you which shows which is
generating aerodynamic kalema tree data
which is as I said in 3d space over time
which is a huge data set there if you
also consider computational fluid
dynamics or cfd which is modeling the
aerodynamic parts on computers that's
generating massive amount of data and
you've got our simulations as well which
engineers are running on a near constant
basis so it turns out that's generating
vast amount of data and the engineers
need to be able to analyze that data
together they need to be able to
correlate CFD with the wind tunnel with
the track they need to be able to say
that yes when we're building a model in
CFD and we're running it in CFD and then
we build that part and put it in the
wind tunnel and then we run that part on
the track we're getting the same results
every time and they need to be able to
analyze that data together and it's only
when you add all of these disparate
sources of data together that you get
that layer of complexity of normalizing
without a 23 engineers can understand it
and analyze it together and that's where
the first of those bits of data
complexity comes from the other things
bear in mind is that a lot of the data
is completely meaningless without the
correct context so my favorite example
of this is thinking about tire
temperatures so at the very simplest
case if you want to look at the tire
temperatures of the car you're basically
loading up four parameters for lists of
doubles one for each tire as it goes
around the track so you're looking at
one lapse worth of data and you say okay
well I've got four channels with the
data and these are the four tire
temperatures that's fantastic and so
that's pretty easy journalize right you
just got four list of doubles but in
order to actually get any useful
information out of that whatsoever the
engineers need a whole myriad of
contextual information in order to check
that that data correlates or their
models so the first thing is you've got
four channels we got four tires which
ones which which one's the front left
tire which on the front right tire so
you need to figure that out for the
first thing you then also need all kinds
of information about the car itself so
a suitable which car was it but also
more complex information like which
suspension configuration is it running
in what ride heights are set what actual
parts in the suspension were there which
specific tire set was it that we were
running out of all the ones that
available to us at weekend what Todd
camp and was it what were they preheated
to before they went out on track and
what tire pressures are they set to what
rims were they attached to what was the
presentation angle of the tides so
that's just the debt the data about how
the car has the tires attached to them
then you will need to consider things
about the environment so what was the
air temperature at the time because that
will affect how the tires performing
what was the track temperature was it
raining what circuit was I at and all
these other things so where were the
corners so you need to take this vast
amount of metadata and compose it
together and you're eventually dealing
with 10 or 50 times as much data for the
context then you are just for the actual
telemetry to give you the tire
temperatures and you need all of that
data together in order to make sense of
it and make a meaningful comparison of
those tires between different runs and
in the even between different laps so
the complexity of the data is really
high due to that amount of metadata and
additional information you need in order
to understand what you're actually
looking at so when I say we've got big
data it's not necessarily a huge amount
of it although it's still quite a lot
but it's that complexity that makes it
much more difficult to work with and
it's only when you have all that data
together you can actually make any sense
out of it
so that's why we've got big data what we
actually do with it though so I've
talked a little bit already about our
acquisition phase which is attaching
sensors to the car logging them on the
car and and we also stream some of that
telemetry to the garage and will also
save from that service ed car so we
download it when the car comes back into
the garage at the end of a run
transmission is actually not always an
easy thing to do fortunately most of
this is managed force by McLaren applied
technologies as they do for all of the
teams on the grid but I've included a
picture here specifically of the belgian
grand prix for very good reason now
acquiring radio telemetry the Belgian
Grand Prix is always a little bit tricky
because it's in the middle of a forest
and trees don't happen to let radio
waves through them all that easily so
you end up with data holes and in the
cemetery there's also another good
example for the other aspect of data
transmission we have so the car itself
is recording data and streaming it back
to the garage you've got an engineer in
working in the office who wants to look
at that data so that you can help the
team at the track with a specific piece
of an artist that he's an expert in how
did you get that data from the middle of
a forest in Belgium to woken well it
turns out with a reasonably high level
of latency because you don't get great
connection out there and you also have
reasonably high latency to far-flung
corners of the world so Brazil Australia
China and Japan are typically examples
of high latency scenarios and that's
that can be a challenge when you're
trying to either a stream real-time
telemetry back or be copy what could be
tens of gigabytes worth of data back to
the factory for the engineer to analyze
as quickly as possible so we actually
had to build our our own data
transmission system for the simulation
results in order to cope with this kind
of scenario and so their engineers who
are at the factory and at the track can
run their own simulation set up their
own configurations and collaborate in
near real-time with the engineers on the
other side of the world potentially so
they can then work as effectively as
possible so there are actually some
quite big challenges in this area that
we have to deal with and not least of
which is the fact that
every week the half of the office this
appears to a different location in the
world so once you've got it working for
Belgium that's all well and good but the
next week you'll be in Italy three week
later you be announced by Iran and then
you'll be in Brazil so you have to have
that infrastructure to be able to deal
with that kind of situation my favorite
example of a problem with like this with
a couple of years ago when I was
covering the Monaco Grand Prix we had an
issue with the trackside infrastructure
so we have a rack of servers in the in
the back of the garage that travels
around the world and what we were doing
will set up every few minutes the
database server disappeared and then it
would come back again well where the
database server going so he got in touch
with the IT guy at the track and he did
quite a lot of dinging and about 20
minutes later he came back and said you
know I figured it out every time the
database went down a forklift truck it
just run over the caber in the back of
the paddock so I had to reroute the
cable over the top of the paddock girls
around the floor because forklift truck
kept running over and pulling out the
cable which was causing edges for it so
that kind of thing that we have to deal
with on a weekly basis to see whether
our infrastructure is going to hold up
so the final topic in that kind of flow
of the data once we've collected it
transmitted it and then we have this
export tree analysis phase now this is
interesting to talk about from a
software perspective because recently
there's been a really big and really
valid push towards building apps that do
one specific thing and do it really
really well and helped along the course
by mobile devices your iPhone your Chan
app you press the button and then it
actually turns up that's pretty much as
easy as it's going to get and and that's
great but we can't necessarily do that
all the time when we're developing
software for f1 engineers because a lot
of the work that they will do will be
exploratory so say you've just had so
it's just before qualifying on a
saturday afternoon at the australian
grand prix okay it's three o'clock is
morning in the UK and an engineer at the
circuit has just come up with an
entirely novel piece of investigation he
wants to do with your software you wants
to get it done before qualifying what
you don't want to have to do at that
time is right and deploy some software
that solves that specific problem for
him first of all because it's three
o'clock in the morning and that's never
a great time to be trying to write
enterprise software and second of all
because you're probably going to get it
done
so we have to build in from the
beginning a sufficient level of
flexibility in our core application so
that engineers can do that export
reanalysis themselves without having to
wait for us to build something new for
them so that actually introduces a
reasonably high level of complexity in
the software that we produce and when I
first started in McLaren I must admit
they showed me and the the way that you
choose which pieces of data you want
displayed and it took me about 20
minutes to figure out how it works
despite the fact is basically filtering
and then clicking a button because it's
just the inherent level of complexity in
choosing exactly which parameters you
want displayed and how you want them
displayed is something that the
engineers need sufficient flexibility to
be able to do in any which way they
happens fans via whatever time of day is
so some of our software isn't intuitive
but it does maintain that level of
usefulness to the engineers so that if
they do turn around and say I've just
come up with something brand-new and I
need to analyze it straightaway they're
able to use off way to do that now
without having to make too many
modifications to it so exploratory
analysis is a really important part of
watching the engineers do we have to
bear that in mind when we're developing
software for them so that they're
actually able to do their job without us
having to make massive modifications to
the code okay so that's a bit about our
big data big in terms of complexity but
not necessarily in terms of size so next
up I'd like to briefly walk through a
few of the things that we do as part of
a race weekend in order to help team so
this here is a picture of what we call
Mission Control it's a another another
room buried in the Technology Center
very difficult to get to and this is our
central nerve center if you like for
race operations in working so as you can
see we've got quite a lot of data
available to the engineers in there so
you've got the live TV feeds from the
circuit you've got things like our
circuit tracker so you can very easily
see where everyone is on the lap all the
data around lap times and so on you also
got things like the live telemetry feeds
coming back into Mission Control so if
you're working on to look at the data
lives and mission controls the place to
go because it's linked directly to the
track and you've also got the radio
panels here which allow you to interact
with the engineers at the circuit just
like that set next to you and in fact if
you're sat in Mission Control
you most likely will be interacting with
engineers sat next to you and the
circuit at the same time through your
headphones nearly like you're just sat
next to each other having a conversation
like you would be on the office in the
office on a normal day and that's a
really important part of the
collaboration that we do in order to
make sure that we can work effectively
over the weekend so for us a race
weekend doesn't really start on Friday
it starts much earlier than that so by
the time we get into the wedding's day
leading up to the race at that point
we'll have and done most of our
preparation work so that means having
the final builds all of the software
that we're going to use for the race
weekend ideally that all needs to be
built and also needs to be deployed and
not just to the factory the Technology
Center for the engineers there but also
to the track as well I mentioned earlier
sometimes it's a long way away and
sometimes the connections a bit slow and
sometimes you have a quite a lot of
software that needs to be deployed so
that's something that needs to be
thought about in advance the other thing
to bear in mind is that the engineers
will turn up and work for the most part
during the day in the time zone at the
track so that means if they're in Japan
know typically turn up at the circuit at
11pm midnight UK time to start their
working day so you need to have the
software deployed ready for them when
they turn up at the track to install the
latest version and then get working and
so you do need to think about that
sometimes and make sure that you're
fully prepared in advance that doesn't
mean some early mornings as I said so by
the time we get into Wednesday then we
look to be fully prepared and ready to
go and everything should ideally be set
up ready for the race weekend so on
Thursday there's no on track action so
to speak and there's a few little bits
and pieces that happen to the FIA but we
won't be running the car on the circuit
the surface is a really important day
for data collection and that's because
Thursdays when they're finishing off
assembling the cars ready for the week
race weekend and while they're doing
that assembly in the garage which is
what you can kind of see going on in the
background here while they're doing that
assembly they'll be testing specific
parts of the car they might be testing
the gearbox and what getting the
hydraulic system the clutch they might
test the engine they might do strain
tests on the suspension and I'll do
setup tests on the entire car and
data is really really important for the
engineers at the factory to be able to
start their correlation analysis check
the parts of working correctly and so
our software needs to be fully ready at
this point to be able to collect that
data distribute it as we discussed
earlier to the engineers at the track
and at the factory as well so that that
important engineering can happen so that
when we turn off on Friday we know
exactly how all of the parts are set up
and things are going to work correctly
when we get there and start going out on
the circuit so Thursday well there's not
much happening for viewers then there is
a lot happening for us and we need to be
need to be ready and working on that so
practice starts on Friday morning
90-minute session there's another 90
minute session on Friday afternoon and
there's a 60 minute session on Saturday
morning and I would admit that practice
sessions unless you're really really
into f1 aren't necessarily the most
riveting TV viewing ok they tend to be
lots of drivers going around moderately
slowly doing one or two laps and then
going back into the pits and then
forensic engineering on the car and then
another couple of laps afterwards but
for the team this is a really crucial
part of the weekend because during
practice we're allowed to run past we
wouldn't normally run as far as the race
weekend and it also means it gives us an
opportunity to test out new parts on the
car now what that means is that we're
likely going to be doing loads of very
important experiments this time which
means that telemetry that the car
generates is very very important to
engineers not just at the track we're at
the factory as well so our software
needs to be collecting that telemetry
analyzing it and distributing it to the
engineers as efficiently as possible
because we want to know as soon as the
car comes in and maybe even before that
a new part has worked or not so that we
can then advise the engineers at the
track whether they need to take it off
or put something different on or whether
they're going to leave it so practice
sessions are really really important for
our software to be able to determine
whether something is working and the
engineers need to run that analysis and
onto the track very quickly as to
whether we're going to take that
direction forward say whether that new
front wing is given us the amount of
downforce we we thought it would or
whether it need to be taken off we need
to try something else when you trim it
or modify it or something like that we
need to really tighten that feedback
loop so it's important our software is
working
as quickly and efficiently as possible
during that time to get that data
transferred so on the Saturday afternoon
is qualifying session which determines
your grid position for the Sunday race
and this is a very different mode of
operation both of the team for the car
and for our software so the rules of f1
mean that once you've finished once you
first go out sorry in qualifying you
can't make really any major
modifications to your car after that
point so during practice you're going to
be changing a lot of parts not to my
using the setup but once you go out and
qualifying for the rest of the weekend
you can't really make any big changes so
that switches the mode of operation for
our software from this analysis job
where we're looking at whether those
changes made affects the car to trying
to improve the performance of the car in
a very different way in qualifying
because you can't change the car the
biggest lap time improvement you're
going to find is by helping the driver
to drive a much faster lap so by
improving how they're driving the car
there the line they're taking the
steering wheel angle they're putting in
the throttle and brake timings all these
different things if you can help the
driver to improve his lap time that way
then you're going to get much bigger
gains when you can buy any of the other
tweaks you can make to the car so our
software switches focused towards
producing a specific chart so if you do
ever watch qualifying session you'll see
when the driver comes in after doing a
fast lap they're pushed back into the
garage then a screens taken that is
either a screen taking down and put in
front of them or an engineer turns
around and gives them a piece of paper
now the screen and the piece of paper
are just different ways of delivering
the same thing which is what we call an
overlay chart and that chart shows them
a comparison of the last lap that they
did their last fastest laps with another
lap so it could be a lap from earlier in
the day that they did it could be a lap
from practice or it could even be a lap
their teammate has just done as well and
that overlay comparison shows them data
that kind of looks like this this is
just some fudge data that looks a bit
like car speed but in addition to our
speed we show them their steering wheel
angle their braking acceleration inputs
when they changed gear whether they had
the DRS flap open and all kinds of other
different parameters that you get from
the car and we compare that with the
other lap so they can see
actually through this corner say stop
and watch say off and under gain time in
corner seven because he got on the
brakes a bit later but I gained her time
through turn eight because I took a
slightly different line and I turned in
slightly earlier so those are the kind
of pieces of information we're trying to
deliver to the driver in qualifying and
for us it is literally a race for us to
be able to produce that data that charts
and that analysis so that they can have
it as soon as they come back into the
garage because it can be as little as 30
seconds between them being pushed back
into the garage tires changed top up of
fuel and then they're off again and they
need to have had that data and learn and
learn what they need to before they go
out again so once the cars crosses the
start/finish line at the end of their
slap slap it's literally erased for us
because we have to download the live
telemetry from the car we have to import
it into our software and import the
other lap that the engineer has chosen
so maybe from the other driver we need
to do the comparison to see which one
was faster and then we need to compare
that data and show them which bits were
different we then need to send that to
the printer wait to the printer to print
out potentially and so that the engineer
ideally picks it up out of the printer
and turns and gives us the driver as
soon as it's back in the garage that's
the ideal youth that's the ideal case
for us and it's as little as 60 seconds
we have it some circuits to be able to
do that so we all love covering Austria
because it's such a short lap that by
the time they cross the start/finish
line we barely know what happened and
they've already back in the garage so
that's always a bit of an adventure
covering that one but that's the
challenge that we have to deal with in
order to improve the drivers performance
through qualifying as much as possible
and that's what our software does I live
again so I will briefly mention the race
although I won't go into too much detail
because in the race you can change even
less than you can in qualifying in the
race you can choose what time you wanna
have a pit stop what are you going to
put on and what front thing are you
going to change and that's basically all
you can change on the car so once you
get to that point you're about helping
the driver and managing any issues on
the car but there's not really that much
analysis work that you can do on top of
that other than by analyzing a large
team of celebrity coming in which is
handled by other software so for us the
race is just about helping the driver as
much as possible the engineers will
still look at those overlay comparisons
help them improve their driving if
necessary especially
it's a newer circuit but for us the real
meat of the Sunday starts after the cars
come back into the garage so most people
familiar with the term back-to-back
races so a back-to-back races where you
have a race on the sunday and then the
next race is the next weekend so you're
you're in one country on the sunday and
then you're expected to turn up and be
ready to go out for practice on the very
next friday five days later and so when
we have a back-to-back race all of the
kit in the garage has to be torn down
very quickly at the end of the race so
that means all of the server
infrastructure which happens to be
storing the data from the race it take
is basically unplugged and put in a in a
crate for four days and and we need to
make sure that we efficiently
synchronize that data back to the
factory so the engineers coming in on
monday morning are able to do their
analysis work without with it with the
latest and most correct data and so for
us it's a bit of a race once the car
comes back after the end of the race to
get that data off loads into the garage
and then it's quickly as possible back
to working so that that kit could be
switched off and ship to the next
circuit okay so that's an outline of
what we do throughout the race weekends
and so the final topic area to talk
about is a little bit more in depth and
it's about how we develop software and
essentially our software development
processes now we've been modifying our
development process extensively over the
past few years in order to be able to
deal with at what I described earlier
which is an extremely fast-paced extreme
the engineering focused industry and so
we've made a lot of adaptations it's
almost like you can even the visitors
starting with something like agile and
then basically on an almost weekly basis
saying all this bit isn't working for us
let's tweak it this isn't working for us
let's tweak it this this isn't working
next week it and we kind of ended up
with where we are today which is isn't
really any one specific methodology we
don't we don't adhere to one methodology
by the book what we do do is develop
software in a way that's suitable for
our industry and delivers the result
from the software when we need to for
each race weekend because there's one
thing about Formula One is that if your
father isn't ready you call
throw not Bernie and asked him to hold
the race on the Sunday afternoon it's
not going to happen it's going to it the
race is going to go ahead whether you're
ready or not whether your software
support you're not whether it's built or
not whether you're even finished writing
it or not so there is one thing that we
have to deal with which is these very
hard deadlines and I think we must move
at the speed of F 1 summarizes how there
are these hard deadlines and and if you
don't make it you don't get to make it
and it's just not going to happen it
things I'm going to wait for you can't
you can't phone up ops and say you know
we're not quite ready let's do it on
monday because the race is going to
happen anyway the other thing is the
pace of innovation in Formula One is so
high that we have two very rapidly and
frequently modify our software to be
able to deal with these constantly
evolving requirements engineers would
always come up with new pieces of
functionality they want new things they
want to do with the software and so we
need to be able to handle that and part
of that is about working in a natural
way and taking on these recommendations
part of that is about having an
extremely rigorous testing process to
make sure that we don't break other
features of the code when we're rapidly
iterating in another area for example I
talked earlier about the the chart that
we generate during qualifying having
help you if you break that and don't
realize until q1 on the Saturday
afternoon because then you really are in
trouble so we have to make sure that in
addition to moving quickly we're
balancing that with a sufficient level
of testing to make sure that we're not
deploying software that's going to cause
problems in important areas throughout
the rest of the code
another interesting aspect of the work
that we do is that we only produce
software for f1 in fact specifically we
only produce software in our team for
engineers on the same floor of the same
building of us and because it's a very
long room in the same room as us so some
of our software so almost most used
software has about 260 users if I stand
up at my desk I can see eighty percent
of them at any given time probably just
by turning around and seeing their heads
popping over the edge of the crowd our
least use software has maybe five users
but they haven't we the race engineers
so they're quite important so there's a
different challenge entirely and but all
of our customers in addition to being in
the same room of us as us are they're
all extremely highly trained very
switched on engineers so one example is
they often are specify problems to us in
the forms of why didn't you build me
this solution rather than explaining
what the actual problem is so that we
can then actually potentially build them
something that's more correct so often
they'll come up in this and say I'd like
you to build this where what we really
want them to say is I'm having this
problem and then we'll help them solve
that in the best possible way another
thing since I've started at McLaren a
few years ago now is that an my
engineering vocab early vocabulary has
expanded significantly they will happen
to talk to you in the terms that they
use on a day-to-day basis for the rest
of their engineering teams which means
that I now knows some very specific
aerodynamic terms and some very specific
systems engineering terms that I never
thought I'd need just just more to
understand them swinging three senses
together and explaining what they want
to actually happen so they will they
have a very specific domain knowledge
and it's not just there's not like one
formula 1 and domain dictionary if you
like there's one to aerodynamics there's
one for systems there's one for the
hydraulics guy there's one to the
gearbox guys there's one for race
engineering and they all have their own
different terminology they do overlap in
places they often don't contradict each
other they all have their own kind of
areas of expertise and when you when you
first start and they kind of say two
sentences you know stood there going I
have literally no idea what you're
talking about it is a bit of adventure
to then eventually learn or what they're
describing and what they're trying
explain to you so you can actually build
the right software for them so that's a
that's a really big challenge so another
challenge for us is support so most of
the time if you don't consider race
weekends most of the time support is
isn't the end of the world because if
there's a problem they'll inevitably
pick up their laptop walk over to your
desk put it down and say this isn't
working and that's reasonably easy to
deal with it I mean it's not ideal to be
interrupted but you know you can work on
it you can tinker around with their
machine see what the error messages and
so on and so forth but when you've got
the engineers who go to the track they
expect the same level of support for the
software if they're stood in the garage
in Azerbaijan as if they are sat at your
desk in working right next to you so
we've had to do a number of things to be
able to deal with this within our
software and within the way we work so
I've already mentioned that we have an
engineer on sight throughout race
weekends and that gets especially
interesting and testing when it tends to
be kind of 20 hour days so we try to do
that in shifts when we're in working for
that but we've also implemented some
functionality in our software in order
to help so that's the poor easier so our
goal at the end of the day with the
sport is to go back first time with the
right answer and in a timely way so when
someone says I've just tried to do this
and it hasn't worked we aim to go back
to the first time with either ideally a
solution it's not a workaround with
something that you can do instead
sometimes a I'm sorry this is broken let
me just check in a fix and get it to you
tomorrow and that's what we're aiming
for here and in order to facilitate that
we've actually integrated into our
software reporting functionality so that
instead of them doing what he's doing
the old days which is either send an
instant message send an email or it got
really bad yellows over the radio and
they now have a button in the software
which is basically obvious broke so I
just tried something it hasn't worked
and that gives us an opportunity to type
in very briefly what they were trying to
do and why it didn't work and then when
they send that our software captures a
vast amount of data and sends it up with
that report and send it to a straight
away so our help desk software and what
that means is that we are able to very
quickly
is problems and come up with the correct
solution so all the logs are shipped for
example straight away so we can view
those remotely all of the state of their
application running on their machine was
sent at the same time so we are very
quickly able to reproduce exactly what
they're done in fact we can we can have
exactly the same piece of data open that
they had open we can click exactly the
same button and ideally we produce and
fix the problem much more easily so
that's kind of the journey we've been
going on over the past few months it
also helped the engineer to at the track
in a situation like this because this is
a I think this is probably during
practice and but at this time who have
we got so we got the drivers got
Fernando and Jensen this is from last
year and you've got the Chief Engineers
and run over at the back here but before
engineers that you see here so you got
marking will for Fernando and you've got
Tom and angle for Jensen they were all
most likely be using our software at
that point in time to do critical
analysis ready to go out for the next
run so when you're in that situation you
need those guys to be able to get help
quickly and get the right help as soon
as possible unfortunately we've been
able to do that now so and over the past
few races were definitely in the past
and past few months have definitely been
able to help them much more efficiently
do those introductions was made for
software so we're not going spend too
long on this because I did promise you
sometimes questions I don't if there's
loads of people itching for questions
but I will just go through this briefly
so in terms of what we actually do on a
day-to-day basis some highlights of that
so one week sprints so we can't kept the
spring concept because it's useful for
us to kind of split up our time in that
way while doing one week it means that
we are able to rapidly take on board
issues from race weekends so we'll have
someone in over the weekend and then
they'll hand over to us on monday
morning the issues that came up and then
that would be the opportunity for us to
incorporate them into the work that
we're doing to the next week because if
you are on a back-to-back race you need
that software ready to go on wednesday
so if there was an issue over the
weekend that critically needs fixing to
the next race you better be looking at
that and nine o'clock on monday morning
and getting that fixed prepped and ready
for release for next week so we keep it
a one week because any shorten that
would be ridiculous and any longer than
that and we wouldn't be able to adapt
the to the issues that come up
frequently throughout the year
so we have a weekly ship room so if
you're not doing support on Friday
afternoon we take time out to have a
retrospective on the week and that isn't
really retrospective of what we did is
in what code we wrote or what bugs we
fixed and so on and so forth but really
it's also retrospective on our process
so I mentioned earlier how we rapidly
evolve our software development process
and the weekly retrospective ship rim is
an opportunity for us to do that we'll
look back and say well actually we
didn't realize until halfway through the
week that X needed doing and the reason
we missed that was because someone
reported it by email to a person why
rather than actually using the built-in
reporting system for example so that
will then lead to a change in process
about people reporting issues and which
will then help us to improve and because
we do that on a Friday afternoon and we
have one week sprints that can take
effects from the very next Monday
morning and we can cooperate that into
our process straight away so I'll talk
about about releases in a moment but
managing changes is something that comes
along with part of the one-week sprint
so as I mentioned bugs might come up on
a Sunday you need to start looking at
them on a Monday which is fair enough
but sometimes issues come up during a
sprint as well in fact reasonably
frequently as i mentioned the engineers
are constantly exploring and trying to
do new things to the software because
that's what their job is and so issues
can come up throughout the week as well
and maybe maybe problems that were had
over the weekend won't be reported until
the monday or tuesday when they land
back in the UK so in order to manage
that kind of change we always allocate
maybe half for a whole engineer week out
of the team in order to deal with those
issues that come up even if it's not
fixing more than it's at least properly
triaging them and making we have proper
making sure we have proper bug reports
for them and so on and so forth and it's
that managing that change which is part
of what we do and incorporating that
into our planning means that we're not
well unless something's on catastrophic
iran we're not typically call out right
too much and the final point of the top
they're embracing MVP is something that
we actually do in more than just
features so MVP is typically used the
minimal Viable Product to produce a
small amount that use a small amount as
work as possible to produce a feature
that's useful to your users now of
course we do that with our features but
you also probably at to a number of
number of
so for example in terms of bugs would
apply MVP to bug fixes especially over
race weekend so say your piece of
software isn't working on a Friday
morning and we know we're going to need
that in qualifying what you want at that
point is a fix that solves that specific
use case that specific problem that's
not working without causing loads of
regressions all over the rest of the
code and the question you asked yourself
at that point is what's the minimal
impact change i can make which resolves
this issue and I've software to continue
functioning in this use case and also in
the potentially thousands of other use
cases so it's going to be put through at
the same time so we apply MVP to bugs
and also our process we're always asking
ourselves can we subtract a process and
still work at the same level efficiency
we don't want be spending all our time
in meetings trying to figure out the
best way to develop software because we
need to spend that time developing the
software so we'll take as much process
out as possible while still allowing us
to continue to function efficiently I'm
going to slip over that slide because I
want to leave plenty of time for
questions I think this onto someone's
from earlier on which is that we do have
a software engineering role permanent
position open at McLaren at the moment
doing what I've just been talking about
so if you if you think we're not a
barrel of crazy in your interest in this
kind of thing and then it's not on the
careers website at the moment it will be
shortly but if not just send me an email
and i'll be sure to put you in touch
with the right people and when we come
around to putting on the website so if
you are interested in this kind of thing
i would strongly encourage an interest
in Formula one because that's where a
lot of the benefit comes from then
you've more than welcome to get in touch
and I'll operate you two to the right
people ok so that's it i've got x a few
minutes for questions now I think yup
five minutes of questions and again if
you do have some more feedback than red
yellow green and please just do feel
free to send me an email or tweet and
I'll get back to you soon as possible
also be around for the rest of the week
including tomorrow night so if you feel
free to walk up to me at any time and
best to me about anything I've talked
about but there's any pertinent
questions that people have now based on
what I've just been talking about really
that's never happened before
yes a question hello questions about do
we have any software that's deployed to
the car so the cars run am a standard
ECU standard unit provided by applied
technologies which is provided to all
the f1 teams so that has its own tool
chain for developing software for it so
we don't really have to do any of that
because it's provided tools for teams
the same so we provide some top some
software on top of that for managing
that process but we don't actually
provide anything that gets directly run
on the car because that's a bespoke
piece of equipment that matheran apply
technologies provides to everyone in f1
and also everyone in NASCAR indeed d car
as well I think so that's kind of a
standard thing that we don't really have
to get too involved with it's also oh
yes next yep oh yeah that should mention
that she like so um I'm the grand scheme
of things I'd say about eighty percent
of our software in total that I've
talked about is written in dotnet and
the advantage that is that we have to
really worry too much about the
deployment of it because we've all got
windows boxes and we write at once and
it works everywhere and there's quite a
lot of desktop analysis software which
is easy for us to develop internet and
because it provides a decent UI
framework and it makes it easy to blow
in battery all up together and so yeah I
didn't really mention that but actually
the vast majority of it is net basin and
that reason that it's very easy for us
to build it and deploy it fear I mean
because we we don't know as i mentioned
we're working a very fast paced and we
need to get stuff pushed out quickly and
so we're we're not looking at working in
systems that slows down whereas for us
we find that dotnet and specifically
c-sharp allows us to work quickly and
innovate by adding new functionality or
modifying an existing code quite quickly
and easily it also allows us to building
that level of flexibility that we need
to we can very quickly diversify system
out
work in different areas by exploiting
that kind of technology I think that's
very short answers to what could be a
very long-winded explanation there so
that's that's just a summary really but
I think that's the main reasons why we
kind of work that way yes okay so how
much appetite we have for using the
latest technology over things old and
eat a stable or sale stable make all be
the same maybe the same point so we have
a very strong appetite for new
technology so there's a lot of things
that I'd love to tell you about that
cotton where we're innovating in some
really interesting areas and that kind
of I couldn't really go into much detail
within the talk and only only hint it
with the kind of introduction on me on
the innovation that we do and but we do
aggressively adopt new technology where
it is a performance advantage for us
obviously sometimes we just need
software to be rock solid and absolutely
stable and it's worked for the last
three years it's going to carry on
working there's no need to go messing
about with it conversely if there's a
new a new paradigm or new way of working
or new methodology or whatever and we
can see that that's all we think that's
going to provide some advantage then
we'll go and investigate that and if it
does then we'll go and invest heavily in
that area because for it to bring into
competitive advantage and so long as it
does so there is a very strong appetite
for it yeah hello
so is it all software and the telemetry
devices so on the car and can we tweak
the amount of data that we get back and
during them and the types of data during
the race so it's so our configuration on
top of the Applied Technology software
that's running on the car it's not
allowed within the rules to modify that
all the cars on track and but it is
within the rules to modify it between
runs so we'll set it up in a specific
configuration of the day we want to
receive and then that will be the
configuration that's used until the car
comes back and we reconfigure it
essentially I think it might actually be
I think that configuration might be
subject to park for me which means when
you go in qualifying it's n64 the
weekend but certainly when you're in
practice and you've put an aerodynamic
rake on then you're going to need to
have to change your configuration so you
can log the data from that rake may be
transmitted it back so the engine is
collected it straight away so certainly
you do need to modify that sometimes on
a per run basis but you can't modify it
while the cars on the track now it's
technically possible but prohibited it's
yummy hello which frameworks and
libraries are we using on top of net so
sorry third party ones so um so we use a
reason amount of microsoft kit I'm not
going to lie and some of our older
applications use things like mess and
prism especially when they're running
desktop you eyes it's not necessarily
trendy your call but it is stable and
working which is the other side of soup
side of the equation so there's always
the question of technical debt when
you're introducing new things so the
mess and prism stuff is it's good for us
because it's easy to maintain in pretty
reliable I mean you don't know and you
don't introduce a new library that then
turns out to be an absolute pain three
years down the line so there's a whole
lot of stuff that we use but because
what we do is actually really solve it
is really quite bespoke it comes both
into the scale we have stuff that's kind
of plain old everyday development and
that you find almost anywhere and then
you've got the other end of scale where
it's just weird bespoke stuff and
sometimes I find myself with a user
story which is like I'm just started
going okay well I'm gonna need a book to
figure this out like an engineering or
mathematics booked to go what I've got
build here there's some stuff which is
like you're updating the database or
whatever and something that everybody
does have almost every other day so so
that for that kind of everyday stuff
then we'll use typically off-the-shelf
stuff that we know is reliable and will
get the job done and then for the most
spoke stuff we actually have a over the
years we've built up a vast library of
internal software that it's not we look
if we don't use it will at least be the
foundation or the inspiration or give us
the technical implementation direction
for what we're trying to do so whether
it's a specific algorithm there will
probably be an implementation somewhere
in the company if it's not available in
the library so will we use the
implementation or translate it or
whatever where do we need to okay I
think nearly nearly time for a couple
more questions yep
and so the question is do does what we
do ever interrupt or cause problems with
the strategy during a race or what how's
it Drive arrives in the race causing
problems for the drive you erase is
generally a no-no and that's something
that one of our main priority is to
avoid so you don't want to you dont to
break stuff that's going to cause
problems with the driver fortunately
once the drive is out on circuit our
software can't really do much to affect
it because as I said we can't send stuff
to the car so once it's out unless
there's a precoded problem or something
breaks then that's very difficult for us
to cause too many problems fortunately
and you don't want to produce software
that's slow or unreliable for what the
engineers are trying to do to analyze
the car while it's on the track and so
you don't want to be introducing
performance problems in that code and
and they suddenly find that a piece of
narcissus they used to be able to do
between the car crossing the line and
getting to the end of the first corner
now takes them from the car crossing
line to the end of the second sector
two-thirds the way around the lab
because they don't then have time to
tell the drive to get into pits for
example so you've got to watch out for
that kind of thing off off the car on on
the user's software that they're using
for example so yeah I think we hunt like
break the car but we can introduce
problems in the software which reduces
the operational effectiveness of the
company and the team which can cause
that kind of problem so that's that's
one of the main things that you seek to
avoid yeah as I mentioned earlier don't
break codes that seized during
qualifying on similarly don't slow it
down too much because and that's problem
hello
so the good news is that we don't we
have the engineer to a specifying what
they want so they have a very good
technical understanding so they might
not be them on the software engineers
they might not necessarily decoders but
they do have a strong technical
background so that it's one that's one
of the things actually enjoy most about
what I do which is collaborating with
those engineers and understanding what
they want having them expressed their
engineering problem in terms that they
understand and then doom and working
with them to do that translation into
this piece of software if whether it's a
design or a first initial implementation
or a wire frame or whatever it is that
then helped that shows them how the
software will solve that problem for
them so we don't necessarily use
analysts but we will con suck them in
that role by the user and us coming
together to kind of perform at work and
without kind of an intermedia if you
like because we know what they're
talking about to an extent and they know
what we're talking about to an extent so
that kind of collaboration I think
excludes the need for that and also
again the time we don't necessarily try
to avoid is people coming in on a monday
or even a thursday and saying ah i just
had this great idea for a completely new
piece of software i need it tomorrow
yeah so people tend to understand though
that that kind of inner work whereas
what we've had stuff where people like
this year people have asked for new
pieces of software on the fourth of
january because I've been thinking your
own Christmas how we should do that and
we're going to deliver it for the first
test in was it four weeks time I should
probably know in retrospect I think it's
three or four weeks time and we're well
on the journey for that so that's kind
of for a completely new bespoke piece of
software and you a big new feature
that's more what you're looking at but
to bug fixes then yeah they'll be space
for them for them to expect us to fix it
for the next race then they will have to
explicitly say this is what's gone wrong
for example this squiggly line should be
this squiggly line and it's not that
kind of thing so that helps us to
reproduce it and understand the problem
but a lot of what we do is investigating
when people say oh this isn't working
correctly
screenshot with the circle around the
bit that's wrong okays well where's that
day to come from what fishings is it
passed through okay now I've got the
debugger set up and I'm stepping through
all these different pieces of the chain
and now suddenly off oh yes I've seen
area this is a bit where it diverts from
where I'd expect it to you and that's
the problem so on so forth us to these
configuration that was wrong all that's
the setting that's wrong or that's the
bit of code that's wrong or whatever so
you do tend to find yourself diving deep
into specific technical areas
occasionally and engineering areas to be
able to understand those issues so that
you can turn them around okay I think
people keep wanting to come in so if you
do have any other questions then please
feel free to talk to me as I said we are
looking for people to do a job very
similar to what I've just described so
it'd be more than mobile to come and
talking about that as well but yes
thanks very much coming and hopefully
see your end of next few days thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
