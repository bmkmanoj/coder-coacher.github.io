talking about exploring stack overflow
data so first little disclaimer i am in
a no way related to stack overflow i am
just a normal person like you are liar i
use stack overflow i am not related to
stack overflow in any other way in fact
i am related with university of
cambridge because this is where I work
and if you have never been to Cambridge
you should definitely go because it's a
complete a very beautiful place it looks
like this but then I work here so move
on I work actually in violence
rheumatics and I have biologists analyze
their biomedical data and get some
insight on that and how to basically
analyze how cancer develops so it's
fairly complex area because I'm not a
biologist in any way and the data that I
work with they look like this it's not
exactly interpretable so these are the
files that I work with I don't have any
idea what that means either basically so
what I like to do is to play with some
interesting data sets so for example I
did social network analysis of Star Wars
movies this is the social network of All
Star Wars movies well it doesn't include
the rogue one yet I should do that it's
even got published in the french edition
of Scientific American but then when I
actually looked at the article this is
like an introduction in the article I
don't speak any French but I'm pretty
sure this says that I'm from Oxford this
is if you are Scottish and someone said
oh you are from England right no doesn't
work like that so let's never speak
about this again and let's move on to
stack overflow so why psycho the flow
well oh we all do this right in some
degree so everyone uses stack overflow
so I think this is the data set that
every one of us can sort of relate to
and you can get quite a lot of data out
of psych overflow but you can either use
their api which is completely open you
can get quite a lot of information from
that but
for data scientists that's kind of slow
so luckily well right now about a month
ago they open stack overflow data sent
on Google bigquery so now you can write
your sequel queries and get inside from
that but this is only disappeared two
months ago and I did this analysis a
little while ago so what I did actually
I used Stack Overflow data dump and they
publish this every three months and
every three months you can download a
fresh data down through of the entire
stack overflow all the data that's kind
of amazing right so how does the data
look actually well this is when I just
looked at it in command line and this is
the column that shows the size of the
files so for example post history is a
single XML file than a 67 gigabytes
that's kind of big well all together
it's 100 and certifies gigabytes of XML
files is this big data well I wouldn't
say it's big data because it fits into
ram on my desktop it doesn't fit
interact on my laptop yet but it fits
into my desktop so i can just load it
into memory and work with it as I had
another smaller data set so I wouldn't
say this is big data which is kind of
nice because it makes everything easier
to analyze so I had 135 gigabytes of
data what shall I do with it well that's
the questions what do I do with it and
if sometimes happens at work as well I
could college comes and hence me over
like a eight terabyte of hard drive with
data and says okay here are your data
and I'm like what shall I do with it and
they say well the data I want all the
data tell you know the data won't tell
you what you need to know you need to
ask questions and if you collaborate
within a data scientist at work they
also need to ask questions because if
you have data and there are complex you
don't get anywhere you can look at
correlations and like float variables
against each other but
ask questions you don't get anything and
if you have big data that's nice about
questions please remember that ask
questions so first question with stack
overflow this is actually the first
question on Stack Overflow ever and what
I noticed is that they have tags which
is amazing for a machine learning person
if something tells you okay this is the
topic of the post that's amazing and
this post has typed c-sharp winforms
types conversion decimal and opacity so
it tells me a lot about what it's about
so my first question might be like what
are the most common tags nice question
so Stack Overflow already tells you that
so this is just a screenshot from stack
overflow and the most common tax our
JavaScript Java C sharp and PHP so this
is a complete valid question it's not
that interesting because yeah I could
have guessed that privilege alice krige
will be the most common one but then I
noticed that right here in the bottom
they also tell you how many questions
were asked this week so that's kind of
more interesting so instead of asking
what are the most common tags I decided
to ask to when do people actually ask
the questions so the first question is
one and I have some pre process data
here abusing X sharp for my demos so
here I have a file and it's actually
about one and a half gigabyte of CSV
files because I pre-processed the XML
files into a CSV because that's the data
science format and what can I do with it
now well luckily F sharp has some very
nice features that i will show you a
little and one of them is called sty
providers so this is over 1 gigabyte so
it's not very big but it still takes
some time to load it into memory if you
want to work with it interactively hello
sorry i can use types providers which is
a very nice way to interact with data in
F sharp and vehicles this is a CSV file
i will use the csv type provider and i
will explain a little bit what it does
so this file contains information on the
tag
sometimes when people are asking
question by the tag so I will use the
CSC provider and I will just give it the
address of the file and that's all and
what this does behind the scenes is that
it looks at the file looks at the
beginning and tries to infer the
structure of the file including all the
types that are in the file so now I can
actually load it I can create a variable
called stack time and slowed it in i
usually get sample method and if I now
do like time dot Rose because it's CSV
file it has rose and I can iterate over
it so now if i do Rho dot it tells me
that the CSV file has three columns one
is called day of week the second one is
called type and the third one is called
time so now you can without opening the
file in Excel or whatever I can I know
the structure and also you can see that
the tag is a string time is systems date
time so it in spurts even that and that
makes working with these types of files
much easier because now I know exactly
what's in there and I don't even load
anything in anywhere I haven't done
anything this is all happening in the
type system so this is incredibly useful
and you can see that it's reacting very
quickly even though it's a gigantic file
underneath so the CSV file CSV type
provider is the way to go if you are
analyzing any of these data files so i
won't actually run anything and i will
show you some results so when i run it
this is for example for F sharp because
i was using a sharp i first looked at F
sharp so when are people asking XR
questions so mostly it's monday to
friday and then it drops over the
weekend that kind of makes sense right
because people are at work monday to
friday so if they are working with a
sharp their use
f sharp questions how does it look for C
sharp it's very similar but then I
noticed that can you see that the ratio
between the weekend and the weekdays is
different people are asking relatively
more questions about a sharp over the
weekend than they are asking questions
about C sharp and I said okay maybe I'm
up to something another interesting
thing is that people are asking us
questions on Monday and on Friday than
the other weekdays just an operation so
what do people do on weekends well they
work on their hobby projects so this is
my friend Chris who actually wrote the
ionized plug-in that I was using in vs
code for F sharp and this is him
probably working on it on some weekend
trip somewhere so maybe he's asking a
question on Stack Overflow about
something so on weekends people work on
hobby projects on things that they don't
have time to work on during the weekday
so let's formalize this a little i will
show you a very scientific graph so this
is the stuff that people do at work when
they work with something they ask
questions on stack overflow about it
this is the stuff that people work on on
evenings late at night cetera whenever
they can get time and this will be
fairly similarly distributed across
weekdays and weekends and then there is
a stuff that people do in their
completely free time when they can have
time actually on weekend so it can be
either a lot when they really enjoy
doing something and they don't have time
to do that during the weekday or it can
be very little it can be people stuck at
work Asking hopeless questions because
they have to solve something critical
and read that weekend so if I look at
the ratio of the number of questions
that are asked during the week and that
are asked during the weekend it can tell
me how people use products or languages
in their free time basically so if its
larger than 1 that means people are
using something more over the weekend
then they are using it over weekdays and
if it's smaller than 1 that means they
are using it more during the week than
on weekends
everything clear so far and the larger
the value the more people probably enjoy
working with that technology in their
free time so the mall I will call this
the weekend index so the most weekends
technologies minecraft so it kind of
makes sense right people ask twenty
percent more minecraft questions over
the weekend and during the week then
lwjgl its is lightweight java game live
library sfml this is simple and fast
multimedia library that people use when
they are writing games to do 2d graphics
then d and by game so it's mostly games
so that's interesting people during
weekends usually just play with games
and are writing their own games just for
fun probably so any guesses on the most
weekday stuff sequel server reporting
services 2008 so these are the
technology that people like wouldn't
play with in their free time and you can
see that the ratio between the weekend
and weekday is very very small like
people ask ten percent the questions on
weekends then they would ask on a
weekday on seco Server reporting
services alright so now I plotted the
most common type so they are fairly
similar around 0.5 that means the number
of questions drops by fifty percent over
the weekend and actually the most
weekend stuff is Python and the most
weekday the language is C sharp so C
sharp is more enterprising C sharp is
more enterprising and Python I think we
can agree on that so how does it look
for a functional languages so down here
you can see elm which is now everyone's
favorite functional language to write
the web and its index is actually larger
than 1 that means it's a very whole
the language still at least based on the
language on the questions that people
ask online and the least weekend
language is actually Ireland which has a
very similar index to other mainstream
languages and then we have scholar and
then we have F sharp so people are
probably actually using F sharp in the
industry because they are asking
questions on stack overflow and after
Elm the most weekend language is
actually half scale so it seems a lot of
people like to play with it in their
free time the index is almost zero point
nine so it's mostly still a hobby
language for a lot of people so then I
looked at some similar technologies so
for example for continuous integration
you can use Jenkins we can use Travis CI
this is a question from stack overflow
which was closed because its opinion
based so how does it look for the two
technologies actually travis has much
higher index than Jenkins and I guess is
why they have very similar icons now the
thing is that Travis is actually hosted
for free for open source projects and
with Jenkins you have to host it
yourself so if you are just working on
some open source projects or something
hobby then you would probably use Travis
and then you ask more questions on a
weekend than you would use with Jenkins
it kind of makes sense so if you are
doing something think about who is your
target user if you want people to use
your product in their free time make it
as easy as possible for them so I think
we covered like when are people asking
questions what can we do next well I
looked at some of the stack overflow
profiles and I noticed this little item
it tells you where people are located
and I thought well it might be
interesting to see where our people
actually located we use different
languages because it differs for
different countries they use different
languages in general so my second
question is where are
people and I looked at the data all
together I have more than 5 million
users that were registered on stack
overflow and almost eight hundred
thousands of them filled in their
location that's basically fifteen
percent of the entire youth base and if
you are a statistician and fifteen
percent of all people that's a lot so
maybe you can get something out of that
so some of the locations that people
felt in look like this yeah dollar home
yes it's a home address for some people
but actually eighty-three percent of the
people filled in a location that I could
match to a country in the world that's a
lot so some of them look like this
unfortunately Germany it's still Germany
some people put in their address down to
their office number maybe they expect
someone to come and knock on the door
and say oh thank you that anthro
brilliant helped me so much some people
put in their very specific address I
don't think they expect you to come
knock on their door I shall have to look
this address up because this is so
surreal and it looks like this so people
are asking from Stack Overflow questions
everywhere so so where are people well
first eighty-three percent of the
locations I could just determine by
matching them to real countries in the
world what about the rest well some of
them were locations like London which is
pretty obvious where that is or San
Francisco but it doesn't list an entire
country so I thought well maybe I can
use some search engine and I decided to
use bank which provides location
services i use bank purely because it
gave me two hundred and fifty thousand
requests for free so i had i think about
120,000 locations that i couldn't
determine easily so i had to attempt to
do that good and as i mentioned before i
was using a csv type
rider that basically loaded CSV file
into my tight system and allows me to
easily access that and I can use almost
the same thing with rest based services
so this is an example query that I can
use for Bing location services and it
returns adjacent it's just a rest query
and I can do something similar that I
did with the CSV file but with a Jason
now so i will use adjacent provider so i
will first create a type i'll call it
Bing search and it will be adjacent
provider because this will return a
Jason and I can give it my sample
request and if internet works it will
get loaded into my type system and now i
can write a little function i will call
it locate i will try to locate eggs
maybe it's not a very good variable
naming but x marks the spot on a map and
I'm trying to locate x and all i have to
do is basically take this request that I
had as an example and just modify it and
I will do link search load and give it
the example request and all i have to do
is change the location here it was proud
because i am from Prague but I will just
change it into X and that's basically
all I need but because i am a nice
programmer i will try to clean it up a
little so i will save this this is my
response and it's quite an ugly JSON
format so if i go to log dots it tells
me everything that's in de Jason that
got returned from that request and if I
remember correctly then the location is
in resource sets which is an array and
rs dot
and this is what that contains in the
JSON because it's quite a big nested
Jason so I can look at resources and do
again the same thing because it's a list
of resources and our dots and we have
addressed nice and the address contains
country-region we have what we needed so
I think this returns a list of the
closest locations to my query I will
just change this to collect to get it
and do nice format and for the first
time today I'm actually going to run
something because we need to test it
right so I'm running it in a sharp
interactive worked so now i can do
locate London and London is most likely
in united kingdom yes well if I do
something like locate Cambridge because
i was in Cambridge it tells me most
likely in United States and that's
because all the best universities in the
world are in Cambridge some of them are
MIT in the US and some of them are
Cambridge in the UK but if I do
Cambridge University it should find it
hopefully and yes cambridge university
is in the united kingdom most likely so
it's working and this is what i used to
get information where all the rest of
the program is located so how does it
look for example this is JavaScript and
it's kind of boring right well there are
a lot of programmers in the US so
obviously that would be more c-sharp
more JavaScript programmers and there
are a lot of programmers in India so of
course there will be a lot of JavaScript
programmers there so nothing really
interesting there but what I really want
to know is among the population of
programmers how likely am I to meet
programmer that does the technology that
I'm actually interested in so I created
a new
here so if I compute basically the how
many and it's the number of users that I
managed to locate so if I compute the
number of located users in the entire
population of the country and then scale
it by a factor that tells me how likely
people are to tell me their location the
details are not that important then
multiply it by 1 million for whatever
reason the unit of this measure is
actually programmers per million ppm so
if I compute this I can get an actual
idea how many I don't know xshare
programmer sound when he share
programmers how many JavaScript
programmers are in a country related to
the population of the country nice the
only thing is well where are the people
really the only thing is how do I know
what's the population of each country
and type providers to the rescue because
there is another type provider and this
one actually uses HTML files so I can go
to Wikipedia now I'll show you the
wikipedia page so does the internet work
yes so list of countries and
dependencies by population it has some
information and enhance a table with the
countries and how many people live in
there nice I can use that directly so I
have just the URL you don't have to go
to that website and change it right now
to some complete rubbish because i am
using a stable URL of some earlier edit
and i can again use type providers
because they will give me a nice typed
access to all the information in the
table so i will create another type
called Ricky and this time it will be
the HTML provider and just give it the
sample URL
this demo depends very much on the speed
of the internet so bear with me if it
doesn't work very well so I'll just get
the sample and now i can do i can
extract the table from that website I
don't have to parse anything so if i do
Ricky does it tells me okay do I want to
access the source HTML or do I want to
access list on this website or do I want
two tables and yeah I won't say both and
from the tables I want countries and
dependencies by population easy now I
got almost everything I wanted so now i
can do table the rose and in the table i
can do let's say Matt o dot ok do I want
the column called present of world
population or the country or the date or
population or the rank I don't have to
well in some languages you have to look
at like on one side of the screen on the
actual table and then methods to the
code and extract it through that here
you just get everything here so I can
look at the country and I can look at
the percent of world population let's
say and if I run this just to prove my
point maybe i should add the print
oh just print it all right this should
work okay so now I get all the
information from the table and I know
that mmm let's get past the small
countries it's quite a large table
actually so for example Germany has one
point one four percent populate of the
earth's population and China has 18.5
percent of the world's population if it
is it well it took me very few lines to
actually get all the information and now
I can use it in my code so i use that
and i plugged it into my equation so
where are really the programmers well
this is an example of it f sharp and you
can see that if you are an f-sharp
programmer you should probably be either
in the UK or in Scandinavia nice this is
NBC so this somehow correlates with the
locations and here i will just load some
code to look at some other countries or
settle some other languages this might
take a little longer because it's
loading all the information did its
initiate finish so how does it look for
C sharp C sharp looks fairly similar but
there are more see sharpers in Iceland
than a sharp first so maybe a sharp
should expand into Iceland well it
behaves slightly strangely for very
small countries because there is quite a
large privilege of getting an outlier
and then I didn't start well no is it
actually telling me the truth so I
decided to try something that's that
will be probably quite regional and I
decided to look at airline
and air Lang is actually most used in
Sweden which is the country that's made
airline so kind of probably makes sense
and the second one is China I'm not sure
what they are doing in China with
airlink we maybe don't want to know so
does anyone have a they're like favorite
language that they want to know where
it's used python well as I said it
behaves strangely for small countries
like Iceland but it seems well if you
look at the if you ignore the outliers
it seems it's used in all the countries
that are programming so that's not
actually telling you anything that
anything like very interesting what
about Fortran oh yeah it's not one of
the very oh yeah thank you for trying
[Laughter]
well there is some outliers somewhere I
have to fix the code to actually ignore
some of the outliers because there are
some very small countries that are
outliers and then it shows sort of very
brief colors but let's say well for
example in Norway according to my
estimation there are about 25
programmers per million doing for tron
in England there about 18 I gave this
talk in Copenhagen and some guys came to
ask me what about APL because they are
using APL in Copenhagen and I posted it
and turns out the only country that
stood out with Denmark so it was
probably just those guys so let's go
back to the talk and as I mentioned
there were some outliers and one of them
that was an outlier for a lot of
languages was the Dominican Republic so
I'm imagining all the digital nomads
sitting on the beach and asking
questions on stack overflow
so if you want to move somewhere after
Briggs it probably choose the Dominican
Republic but yeah it's not very precise
because it depends on how frequently
people are likely to give their location
in Stack Overflow and for other for some
countries it would be very different
from some other countries some countries
people are more than happy to give their
location some other go with more careful
so take this with a grain of salt so
what else can we do within spec overflow
data well I have information on tags I
have information on users and this is
kind of nice because this sort of gives
me a community structure because I can
look at groups of users that ask or
answer questions with the same tag so
for example if I look at people who ask
and answer questions with F sharp this
will probably give me a community of
people who use F sharp and I can look at
other languages that I also use so tags
in sort of define relations and if i
take my friend Chris again for example
well hope I can formalize this well I
use a sharp I don't use C sharp
sometimes I use JavaScript sometimes I
use our and I don't use kobo so this
sort of gives me a binary vector that
defines my behavior and Chris uses F
sharp use the C sharp using javascript
doesn't use our doesn't Discover either
so now I know that we are similar in F
sharp and JavaScript and we are
different in C sharp and in our and if I
apply this to all the users I have a
matrix and if I have a matrix unhappy
data scientist so altogether there are
forty four thousand tags and over five
million users so that's kind of a big
matrix and most of it are zeros so I
decided to concentrate on a smaller
subset so I took just users with more
than 1,000 posts you're quite a lot of
them and tags that have more than 5,000
posts that means the tags that are used
a lot and this gave me 800 tags and 1600
use
and these are power users so they use
some technologies and they use them a
lot and they answer a lot of questions
so what can I do with it well as a
proper data scientist I have to
visualize things and this teach me the T
distributed stochastic neighborhood
embedding quite a mouthful it's a very
nice methods to visualize very complex
high dimensional data and I will try to
give you some idea how it works I don't
want to go into details so don't be
afraid but the key word here is
embedding and my dink means in this case
that you are basically embedding a very
high dimensional space in my case if i
look at the users and tags I will have
say 800 tags that I want to embed into
two dimensional space based on how they
behave across users so it's an embedding
of a very high dimensional space into 2d
and that I can visualize so how does it
work imagine one thousand dimensional
space in my gene I have a 2d space
that's heard of curve in 3d space let's
say a sheet of paper and if I have these
two points on the paper there are sort
of very close in space in the 3d but in
the logic of the data they are very far
from each other so what piece need us it
looks at just local neighborhood of each
point and it tries to map very similar
points to very similar locations in the
2d projection in the embedding and if
points are very far from each other then
it will just put them somewhere so it
amazes the local neighborhood and it
ignores larger distances very very
confusing or okay-ish it just tries to
preserve local distances so how I how do
i compute that well in our you just call
a library called stiffly and you just
run algorithm called TC easy in f-sharp
you can do exactly the same because you
can call our from F sharp using
something called our provider
so the only difference is that now I
have to open an hour provider and then
open the library within it and call
basically the same thing well if you do
are just plot the results you get
something like this amazing right yeah r
is an amazing language because it
contains libraries for everything but
yeah this is kind of not so such a nice
visualization so this is the point where
you probably want to use something else
like yeah oh the best thing about our is
that it was written by seditious study
sessions and the worst thing about our
into a threatened by so decisions so at
this point I decided to go for
JavaScript but because I'm doing things
in f-sharp i use it used sable which is
an f-sharp to JavaScript compiler and
yeah if you go from something like our
to JavaScript you can do things like
optimize label placements so that they
don't overlap too much which is nice and
our probe can't even do that so if i
look at it into a bit more detail so
this is one cluster in the visualization
and it sort of tells me about the
community structure or like what
community what now what languages and
what technologies are used by similar
people so this is a little cluster of
people doing Android and Google
technologies so there is like Android
Android activity layouts etc makes sense
kind of this is another cluster of
people doing a lot of web stuff so in
the top is JavaScript and node.js and
for some reason google maps and then
canvas angular etc angularjs typescript
so kind of tells you something about
what technologies are closely related
and this algorithm doesn't have any idea
about the actual technologies but it
could figure out that based on who uses
them what are the similar things and
this is another little cluster of people
being confused about the object-oriented
concepts
yes polymorphisms iterators perform
constructors inheritance etc and because
i'm using fable i can even do something
like this like let's look at F sharp and
F sharp is here yeah if we can't see
when I hover my mouse but it's saying F
sharp and what's next f sharp say this
is mono so f sharp people are more
likely to use mono at least the ones
that are on stackoverflow and if i look
at sea shall c sharp is up here and
what's next to c sharp it's dotnet so
let's kind of tells you that the F sharp
community is a bit more open probably
and the fish arts community at least
based on how people ask questions on
stack overflow and hopefully I'll be
able to prove you that it's using
f-sharp didn't want that so here I
should be able to look at the sources
and this is my sharp code that actually
got compiled into JavaScript and I can
even debug it in f-sharp because here I
can set a breakpoint rerun it and it
should stop there and it stopped at the
breakpoint nice thank you so now you can
use a sharp everywhere and you should
definitely you should give a favor a try
because it's a very nice library and I
believe tomorrow Thomas over there is
giving a talk that will include much
more fable than here so and this
algorithm that easily it's used quite a
lot even in my work because you can
visualize a lot of different things for
example this is visualizing with genetic
diversity among people among humans and
different communities that live in
different places on the earth are
separated and you can see which ones are
like
closer together and which ones are more
different so for example this is Chinese
people and this lower corner is the ones
that are living in the US and these ones
are the ones that are living in in China
and these are Japanese people so you can
see that they are genetically closer
than the rest of the people so you can
visualize very very very
high-dimensional data sets with this
well so i looked at stags I look at
users I looked at various technologies
but I haven't even looked at the
questions and the answers yet well it's
quite a lot of text so what can I do
with that I decided to use another
method that does embedding and this is
called words too vague and from the name
you can probably guess what it does it
tries to map words into vectors and this
is quite complicated but the key word
here is embedding again it's basically
embedding words into some kind of vector
space and I don't want to go into too
much details on how it does that but
Keith knee was looking at points and
their local neighborhoods which was very
other points and defining as embedding
into two dimensions what works to make
this it looks at words and their local
context in sentences and match that into
a vector space how that does that it's
complicated I don't want to go into that
but it's using neural networks to do
that but again it's just mapping words
and their local context so if i look at
two sentences like f sharp is a
functional language on the.net platform
and Scala is a functional object
oriented language on a JVM from this you
can see that the sentences are very
similar in a way they use mostly similar
words but you can see that the object of
the first sentence is f sharp and on the
second is Scala so these are probably
programming languages or they are used
in similar place in the two sentences
and dotnet and JVM they are also used in
similar place in the sentences and they
surrounded by similar words and if you
look at large text you can extract this
kind of relationship so and the cool
thing is that once you have your words
in numbers yes yes so the question is
does it understand the English grammar
or is it just looking at positions of
words in text it's looking at the
neighborhood in words of each word so
it's two words are surrounded by similar
words all the time that means they are
similar can you take german and put it
into the exactly the same place in the
algorithm and you get the same thing no
because in german words are surrounded
by german words in English they are
surrounded by English words so they are
different yes but you can you can use it
on any language you want so the cool
thing is once you extract the sort of
relationship and encoded in a numerical
vector you can do mathematical
operations with words so you can do
Scala and subtract jvm and add dotnet
what do you think you get well actually
the closest thing based on this
algorithm is fish sharp and the second
closest thing is f sharp interesting how
could it say that Scala is more
object-oriented than F sharp so the
closest might be he sharp another thing
if I do a sharp and subtract dotnet any
guesses for them I might get well SML
and ochem oh it's an mo family of
languages so the closest matches are
other ml languages that are not on.net
that's amazing it extracted this just
from how f sharp is proved in sentences
really nice and then Haskell and Idris
which are other program functional
programming languages so actually based
on how people use the term
f sharp in sentences f sharp is much
closer to half scale than the C sharp or
at least based on how people use it in
sentences so this kind of thing is used
quite a lot even in academia and what I
work on these are some examples of
academic papers that because it would be
nice to I work a lot with jeans and it
will be nice to have sort of algorithm
that tells you okay so this gene that's
involved in cancer if I just transfer it
into a different tissue what other genes
are affected there and you can extract
the sort of relations sometimes from
scientific literature if you just let
the algorithm read a lot of papers it
might come up with something so this is
a very cool idea of extracting
relationships between elements from
giving the algorithm a lot of text but
now well let's go into some like proper
questions here these are just some fun
facts about like how people use
technologies on stack overflow so if
speck overflow and meritocracy meaning
if someone asked you a question and you
answer will the score that you get for
your answer actually reflect how good
your question or if how good your answer
was so it's like over for a meritocracy
so this is what I plot it we can look at
how much the score you get for an answer
depends on your reputation that you
already have if the score you get
depends a lot on the reputation you
already have that might mean that people
just look at your name and just upvote
yeah that's a good guy let's give him
more votes so this is how it looks if
you just plot it well it doesn't tell
you much because there are a lot of
people with low reputation and like very
very scores this is how it looks if you
don't put it on logarithmic scale so
both axes are logarithmic and this
already tells you something quite
interesting so if your reputation is
about 1,000 then you probably don't get
more than
100 for your answer there are some
outliers here but they are not that many
and if your reputation is one then you
probably get one for your answer maybe
so there might be some relation but
nothing really clear so what I did I
used one machine learning methods called
regression so I try to predict given
some data predict what will be the score
you get for your answer and the input
data can be anything so what I used were
actually all the answers on Stack
Overflow there were 18 million of them
and I looked at if the question was
accepted what was the question score
what were the number of tags on the
question how many people try to answer
that how many people commented on the
question how many people favorite it a
question etc etc etc a lot of different
inputs and I tried to predict what will
be the score you get for your answer
based on all the information including
what's your reputation on stack overflow
and students elsewhere no I tried a lot
of different methods make various
standards less standards regression
methods the results were fairly similar
you can predict only certain amount of
the score let the most predictive
elements in the input we're actually how
many people favorited the question let's
reflect how many people find the
question interesting how many people
looked at the question for we googled it
and if your answer was accepted that's
kind of nice right Chuck Norris approves
because that means that the quality of
your answer really matters and then I
was looking at some diagnostic plots and
it's not really that important what this
really means but on the y-axis it
basically tells you how different are
your predictions from the actual score
you get for your answer so not that much
and on this axis it tells you something
called leverage
which is one indicator that tells you
how much some groups of data influence
the outcome and this is leverage and it
literally tells you okay are some data
that are outliers just basically pushing
your whole prediction somewhere else so
for example this guy here is leverage
because you can move if see moves up
then the whole prediction will move up a
little so this guy has a high leverage
so I looked at this plot and I noticed
well there is kind of like a lot of
points that have very high leverage and
that are sort of outliers from the rest
so they are probably affecting my
prediction a lot and then I looked at
these points in more detail I looked at
what do they actually corresponds to
because they are outliers they are very
far from the rest of the data and turns
out it's all John skeet so if you don't
use the stack overflow and if you are
not asking the questions on stack
overflow jon skeet is the check nor is
expect overflow especially in C sharp so
he answers all the questions and he gets
much higher score for all of them so my
answer is that quality of your answer
really matters well unless you are John
skeet yeah so this is quite an insight
from stack overflow so just to wrap up a
little so on the technological side of
things I was using a sharp a lot but I
was using a lot of technologies from F
sharp so i was using javascript and are
and i'll be using other things as well
so for me the data science and machine
learning is mostly about just finding
the right tool for the job use whatever
you like but just play with data because
i think you can get quite a lot of
information just with playing with data
and this was me playing with spec
overflow data and you can download the
data as well and play with them yourself
and this is very wording because you
understand the data and you can get
quite a lot of out of that and so that I
got some interesting insights some less
interesting insights maybe and I can do
automatics with programming language is
now wonderful and all the data science
side of things ask questions like if you
have data and if you have questions then
just bake into it and maybe ask
questions about it on stack overflow and
increase the data set and maybe maybe
maybe move to the Dominican Republic
thank you so are there any questions yes
so the question is what made me do the
side who is psych overflow well it's a
decent data set that you can download
for free and it's very real world so
it's you have to wrangle the data a lot
so it gives you a sort of a feeling how
real world data look like so although I
have a lot of data wrangling to do with
my job this is it's a real world data
set it's not something that you download
and you just play with it for the sake
of playing with it it's a real data set
and it can tell you something about the
people as well so I think it's really
nice and interesting data set that was
for example playing with the Star Wars
data before which is the data set that I
created from movie scripts but it's sort
of artificial a little it's very small
and yeah you can play with that but
stack overflow is a decent size we were
data set and it's free to use for your
insight yes another question
Oh geographical location of our of
course ar-ar-ar is used a lot in
Northern Europe in China what are they
doing in China Australia and Northern
America which is kind of obvious it's in
Europe it's used quite a lot in
Switzerland more than in Germany yeah
probably proly banks are using our
friends make sense and then the
Netherlands is using our a lot and in
the UK it's again quite popular and
Scandinavia so again if you want to use
our and move somewhere after Briggs it
either go to Scandinavia Switzerland or
maybe australia or new zealand yes so
what at what point do I feel to bring in
our well our has library for everything
I'm sure doesn't have libraries for
everything and I think a lot of
languages don't have libraries for
everything but data related you use
either are or Python because they have
libraries and are it's very
straightforward to use from F sharp so
you can use type providers to load your
data into a sharp process them so
through them etc and then just call our
to do the data of sciency stuff and then
get results back into our F sharp I
didn't show the our provider near life
because that's actually quite a
time-consuming algorithm to compute but
it works very nicely any other questions
if not there will be a machine-learning
panel in the next section so come to
that one and if you known to know my
opinions on some things in our come two
popcorns on Friday thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
