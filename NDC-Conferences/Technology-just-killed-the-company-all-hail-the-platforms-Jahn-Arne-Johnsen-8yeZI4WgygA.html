started hi guys this is going to be a
intimate session I guess on the end of
the second day I hope you all ready to
get a bit of a break from all the great
technical talks that's been going on at
this year's NDC while I'm here to talk
about technology today I'm not going to
go into very underlying technical
details I'm going to focus on some of
the consequences of the platforms that
you've all probably seen have their
breakthrough in recent years so
hopefully I can keep you somewhat
entertained over the last over the next
hour or so and yes I am aware that I'm
what stands between you and at least for
some of you a cold beer but before we
get started if everyone could find your
smartphones your laptops your iPad
surfaces whatever you use to access the
Internet when the speaker gets a bit
boring and could you just flip it up and
go to this address it's a slide dot DL
flash NDC 2017 and just to get a feel of
the audience and also make sure that
everything is working and we put up a
poll there so you can select the
alternative that fits best with your
current job let's just see here one user
that worked okay so it's it's there it's
working hey yeah sure so it's a slight
OTO / NBC 2017 okay
there's stuff happening there that's
great so I'll come back to this at the
end of the talk and the idea is whenever
you have a question that you want to ask
you can just type it in here and you can
also see questions that other people
have
put in bottom up button down and reply
to them if you have okay so this talk is
going to be about platforms and it's
going to be of what I like to call the
platform economy I'm guessing that
pretty much everyone has seen this quote
from TechCrunch in them 2015 they they
stated that uber the world's largest
text company I was no vehicles that
Facebook the world's most popular media
owner creates no content that allagadda
the most valuable retailer has no
inventory and that our area be the
world's largest at a combination
provider owns no real estate and even
though wise I think this has been
overused there's something interesting
that's happening there it's impossible
to ignore this seismic change in global
economy the largest companies in the
world are no longer producers in the
conventional sense instead they've
become distributors there are complex
networks that connects demands with
those who can fulfill those demands so
let's start today I'm going to start off
by discussing some of the underlying
assumptions that I think that all of us
have and there's also been the main
story in in the mainstream media then
our focus a bit on why I feel that tech
is really the enabler of the trends that
we're seeing and not the characteristics
of generations or research and now in
order to understand why these trends has
such a potentially great effect on
company structures I'll share with you
some research into why company exists
and also why the platform revolution
might threaten these companies our
companies and towards the end I'll see
and discussing what what this might mean
for the future work
for caring firms out there and also for
for society before I get started just
let me introduce myself my name is
Johnny Olsen I'm primarily a
technologist but also economists want to
be the last 11 years I've worked in the
consultant industry in a great variety
of roles and for those of you who
doesn't know me and haven't heard of me
which I suppose is most of you guys I'm
the kind of annoying guy in the industry
I'm the guy who blurs out all the
secrets and therefore it's not
particularly liked by management of
different firms and I suspect that this
talk won't make them love me anymore
and currently I'm head of two companies
one is called blunt and the other one is
called Fork Blanc is a small consultancy
firm we started up about one and a half
years ago just wanted to test out some
hypothesis on how to run a consultancy
firm in a bit of a different way we're
now around 30 people and we started this
subsidiary which is called foot and
that's our effort to try to bring the
platform economy into the consulting
industry so it's a platform for vetted
independent IT consultants okay enough
about building my ethos while I'm sure
that you would love for me to go into my
background and really discuss my
companies and get to know all different
details we're here to talk about these
new buzzword economies they all go by
different names depending on who you
talk to and what you're selling but
they're all merely iterations of the
same so whether you're you BER or Airbnb
or TaskRabbit or the Norwegian novel
Beale you all represent a fundamental
change in how work and services are sold
and delivered but first what we all kind
of think of when we think of the sharing
economy we think about it who
are these people who are using these
platforms the Millennials who else is
these urban lazy narcissistic and
entitled digital youngsters and selfie
lovers
I also known as Generation Y digital
natives generation me generation rent
Echo Boomers all born between 1982 and
2000 so I'm probably the oldest
millennial out there born in March 1992
that just made it but this generation is
probably the most studied and talked
about generation to the States
it's the first generation in history
that's grown up totally immersed in a
world full of technology and this has
shaped our identities that the
hypothesis is that this has created
lasting political social and culture at
cultural attitudes in Millennials as
well and we're all surrounded by myths
and mystique and mainstream media does
this job very nicely they love to paint
a picture of the social carefree
self-obsessed meaning seeking generation
and the Millennials they they are
supposed to lack a sense of loyalty they
are impatient the heat the corporate
silos and structures and business
consultants both in Norway and also
elsewhere in the world they love to
publish articles and reports on how you
can understand the Millennials or how
you can recruit the best millennial
heads and basically the truth about
these mysterious variety of humans has
been quite the hot commodity for four
years recent years and there are others
who who like to add to this myth in
Norway we have something called
innovation norway and their leader the
head of animation norway on easter film
joseph she made a statement
last year during a conference called
audio conferencing and what she stated
was that what we're seeing out there
with the sharing economy is a result of
Millennials doesn't they don't want to
own anything they don't want to own an
apartment they do not want a steady job
what they do is they prefer freedom they
prefer sharing and they are the main
fuel of the platform economy so funny
thing is if you look closely most of
these things are myths
they're not the characteristics of the
generation in fact if you there's
something called Pew Research in in the
US and they just published a review of
recently released government data in the
US and what they found was that
millennial workers are just as likely to
stick with their employers than their
older counterparts in Generation X when
Generation X were the young adults it's
basically the same in fact among
college-educated Millennials they're
more prone they're more loyal than
Generation X was when they were the same
age so one factor of this mate may be
that Millennials are more have a
relatively higher level of education and
higher level education is typically
associated with longer tenure at jobs
but these findings are more in
accordance with my own conviction that
the transfer witnessing are more
concerned about the advancement in
technology and less with the habits the
features the general characteristics of
a generation and this is really
fascinated me throughout this period and
that's why I wrote this talking in the
first place it's how much focus at least
in the mainstream media that has been on
the sharing aspect and that these are
stuff about the generation and how
little focuses has been on the actual
driver of
strength the platform tech in my opinion
the sharing economy the platform economy
the geeky economy are all just
consequences that we now finally have
the tools to find someone else besides
the large existing actors in the market
it's the platform's who provide the
infrastructure which makes it possible
for you to share your car share your
ride your apartment or your tools so
that's for me the interesting part and
that is what I will focus on for the
remainder of my talk today if you think
back if you came to a city let's say 30
years ago and you needed to find a
doctor or a shoemaker or a bank how
would you go about you could just walk
around look for signs maybe ask a local
for help but even though this was a test
which required a lot of effort the
effort part of this it was is what I
will later refer to as transaction cost
so that's something to keep in mind but
at least we have the yellow pages so
they helped give to give an overview of
the different service providers as well
as individuals and for you all know this
for over a hundred years the telephone
at ago kept the log as part of every
Norwegian home and finally small fun
fact is that there were all wiped up
until 1984 when the Norwegian telco
company decided to print them on yellow
paper so from that day forward yellow
the Yellow Pages has been a synonym for
the catalogues over companies and
service professionals but with the
introducing of platforms we
simultaneously created what Jean Charles
Ross Chia and jean tirole
called two-sided markets
and two-sided markets are roughly
defined as markets in which one or
several platforms enable interactions
between end-users and they try to get
two or multiple sides of a board on
board by appropriately charging each
side of of the market and by the way a
chanterelle he also went on to win the
Nobel Prize in Economics in 2014 in part
because of his research into these
markets and but what they found is that
the platform market the two sided
markets that were looking at here
they're highly prone to what we call
network effects network effects is
simply meaning that it pays off to be a
supplier or a buyer in a network where
there's a lot of parties on the other
side of the board so in other words the
more users they beget more users again
which is a dynamic which in turns
trigger a very self-enforcing
cycle of growth and the markets
themselves become much more valuable as
more users and starts to use them and
this is a very very common effect in the
platform economy this is something that
can be seen all over and in some
instances this is also what causes what
you can see is the monopoly of the
platforms and if you think of it it
makes perfect sense if you have an
apartment and you want to run it out
you'll most probably use Airbnb because
it has the most amount of people there
instead of using a smaller lesser-known
sharing site just because you through
Airbnb will get more traffic and you
have more potential guests and if you're
a guest you will probably also start on
Airbnb because it has the most amount of
objects but one
talk about these platform economies try
to don't they take him as just these
sharing platforms it's the same thing
that drives Apple's App Store it's the
same principles probably that's why
windows failed with the old micro fail
with its Windows Phone and why Alibaba
is one of the most valuable companies in
the world it pays off to be in a market
where there many other parties on the
other side of the world so Sanjeet
Chaudhary he he wrote a book which is
called platform scale and in this book
he wrote that platforms enable value
creations and exchange by matching the
most relevant resources from producers
in the ecosystems with the consumers on
the platform that need those resources
so the platform itself is the central
piece of infrastructure which enables
these interactions between the end-users
it consists of a technical
infrastructure as well as a set of
working processes organizational
incentives which is supportive of the
value-added processes it takes place in
the interaction between users and an old
platform says as this kind of basic
layer right you have a basic layer of
infrastructure that handles the basic
functionality creating a profile for
your resource so this profile might be a
profile for your people for your car for
your house or any other resource which
is supposed to be traded on your
platform but in addition to this the
layer that the infrastructure layer
needs more services the platform needs
services to make interactions easier
such as payments and also means of
communications and infrastructure layer
should handle all these different
actions between the different parties of
your platform now the data of these
transactions they're used to develop a
separate layer in the platform and this
layer is used of course for the
documentation that the transaction
happened but what's interesting here is
using the layer to analyze the platform
services itself and how the potential
customers find what they're looking for
so we all know these type of
collaborative filtering where you for
instance if you used Amazon you always
get good recommendations on okay I've
got this other people who have this
similar with purchasing history have
bought these items and this is one of
the essential parts of platforms and
this is also why platforms help drive
transaction costs down it needs to mimic
or improve on the corresponding human
factors that would normally help buyers
find service providers I'm going to give
you an example of this to make it easier
and please bear with me for a couple of
minutes why I use some parts of my own
company to use as an example here but it
illustrates how a platform needs to
match the users needs with the suppliers
service as I said I've been in the
consultancy industry since 2006 and I
worked in sales since 2008 normally when
we get a request from our customers you
receive a specification of what they're
looking for and this rings true both if
there is a role requirement or if it's a
project requirement and when they are
looking to staff a particular role we
used to get a wish list consisting of
many 20-30 buzzwords that they want
their candidates to
to match as well as desired timeframe on
when the candidate should start and as a
salesman I normally know that the
customer rarely expect the candidate to
meet all these requirements I also know
that they often value hands-on project
experience with the technologies more
than certifications and that they for
the right candidates also might be
willing to wait a bit so here's the
interface of the main page of the fourth
platform that we're launching in August
now if we did this kind of this
straightforward just in them implemented
a searcher filtering in an avi naive way
the customer would always often at least
find that no candidate matched their
list and at least none who also are
available in the timeframe that they
want to be so what the matching
technologies of this platform would need
to do is to mimic my behavior as the
salesman it needs to help the customer
do my job without me there but also
hopefully do it a lot better and more
transparent and this might mean always
giving out results even though you don't
have the perfect hit but always giving
out results but being transparent on how
does this candidate fulfill your
specification it also will mean
adjusting the ranking algorithms and
boosting for instance project
experiences that if this is what we feel
is most important in the resume and if
we're smart making this matching
algorithms we will be storing searches
during search results and also storing
the actual candidates that customers
ended up contacting in order to feed
these into a machine learning algorithm
later on
thus turning tuning engine to become
better than the salesman or the
saleswoman and thus making me basically
obsolete now when we come to actually
presenting results presenting objects
presenting candidates in this instance
the presentation of these must be done
in a credible way and platform providers
often simplify this process for
themselves by building communities so a
platform you will try to build a
community of people and community of
providers so that experienced people can
help guide newcomers help build them
their own profile and as a platform
provider we need to build trust and
confidence in the platform we need to
develop a platform culture meaning that
we share norms we when we make a resume
we use the same words we explain things
in the same way we have platform culture
that can be seen as a parallel to the
organizational culture that we usually
have in organizations and the platform
culture will also help your platform
grow by showing and promoting the
desired values the behavior in your
network one of the best ones at making
this kind of platform culture is Airbnb
and they can be seen as one of the most
conscious on in developing it and
several times they actually gathered
their most experienced the most loyal
hosts to their own conferences to help
other hosts make their profiles and one
thing they said that this is a global
movement and it's all about you this is
a matter of this guy hearing a check
only who was Airbnb hospitality guru and
calling was recruited to an Airbnb
solely to develop the service quality
and act on culture and he was recruited
based on his success as a hotel
entrepreneur and also his several books
on emotional marketing soak only made
Airbnb be presented in more positive
ways by appealing to renters appealing
to tenants and their emotional
experience and it did this by
emphasizing a very honest and positive
experience when the different actors
interacted and this also underlines the
hypothesis that platforms are about more
things than just technology they are
also about culture Network organizations
and complete ecosystems and the last
essential thing of the platform before
we can see how this affects
organizations is the concept of trust
this is the also the last kind an
essential part of platform if you think
of it in your normal day traditionally
you earn trust by learning that the
people you deal with are rational
they're loyal and you can expect them to
deliver what they say they do and will
that you they will deliver on their word
and when we do this in our normal work
when we rely on trust we're lowering the
transaction costs in the market because
we don't need contracts we can trust
each other to do the stuff that we want
to do so Trust can replace contracts
which in turn make the transaction make
the purchase cheaper but on platforms
how can you trust one big
key thing is that the platform itself
needs to earn trust it needs to earn the
trust on different parties it's the same
way that the bank needs to earn trust
from all of us in order for us to say
okay take care of my money I trust that
you want do we harm even if you rent it
out with someone else or borrow it out
to someone else so when the platform
does this it acts as as what we usually
call the confidence man in other word
the kind of third party which mediates a
transaction and to gain such trust there
must be built-in trust mechanisms in
your platform
these can be openness on transactions
these can be ratings endorsements user
made descriptions and so forth and you
all know these different kind of trust
management's from platforms such as
Apple App Store Amazon eBay and so on so
up until now most of the platforms that
we've seen has been just that it's been
concentrated on sales of products either
physical project products such as Amazon
or Alibaba but also virtual project
products such as the Apple App Store the
sorry
Google's ah nevermind but what's changed
in recent years is that companies have
started to use the platform economy to
disrupt traditional service sectors
Airbnb has become a real nuisance for
the hotel industry and we've all heard
of the effect that uber has had on
transport businesses and I don't know if
you're aware of task rabbit the task
rabbit in the u.s. is helping people to
have help on different chores you can I
need to paint a wall or I need to fix a
sink or something
and the list of this is pretty much
endless and all these services all these
platforms is usually what we dubbed the
gig economy small chores that happens
and if we need people to do for us and
the people here are no longer employees
they are no longer hired by someone
they're considered as independent
contractors freelancers who are waiting
for their next gig
ok fine
how will this affect your company you
might say to figure that out we have to
go disturbingly long back let me go back
to 1937 we're quite famous economist
British economist called Ronald Coase he
brought this article here which has now
become quite infamous the nature of the
firm in this article he answered the
simple question of why do companies
exists because if you consider it if all
markets were completely efficient the
best thing would be for all transactions
to happen directly between individuals
we would all be freelancers in this kind
of perfect market economy companies
would not exist and no one would be
employees an answer that he discovered
was these transaction costs that I've
been talking about what he realized is
that there are what we call transaction
costs that incur when you use the market
so in this in addition to a cost of the
service that you're purchasing for
instance if you're purchasing a
graphical designer in addition to the
cost of that service there are costs
acting to acquiring that service getting
the information gaining trust
negotiating prices negotiating contracts
in this article he showed how by
establishing a firm you can reduce these
costs or in other words he showed how it
would often be cheaper to have an
employee to have a graphical designer
in-house rather than having to negotiate
every time a task needed to be done and
this would kind of a revolution it still
is and the revolution in his argument
was that a firm would emerge exist and
continue to exist consist successfully
if it performed its planning its
coordination and its management function
at the lower costs then if you use the
market kind of makes sense so they also
had to be at a lower cost than if you
had another company do the same things
and this is where competition come in
and this is why competition keeps firms
internally efficient this is also where
the non competition in some places of
the public sector can create very
complex very non efficient governance
models and units that just outgrow
themselves because you all probably know
this but managerial overheads increase
as the organization grows and whenever
the transaction costs inside the
organization reach the same level as the
transaction cost in the market market
starts outperforming the firm and when
it all performs the firm that is when
you usually outsource different parts of
your organization and as the corporation
grows if it doesn't adjust this and it
doesn't try to trim away some of these
things the energy of the corporation we
will eventually just go into maintaining
itself and the existence of these high
transaction costs outside of the firm
that is what led to firms as we know
them today that is why we have a group
of people gathering a firm with one
common goal and the world has just
changed because what happens when the
platform company comes in and what the
platform has done and that's what the
platform economy has done and managed to
do is to dramatically reduce the
transaction costs related to the market
so when you previously had to pick up
your telephone book browse the market
try to figure where who are the
different firms I can call to who know I
know what's the information there and
all these kind of things the platform
economy has reduced the cost by
simplifying a name and enabling
interaction coordination communication
and trade between parties who neither
know each other or trust each other so
that's the kind of brilliant thing about
the platform economy and why have you in
the 90s you know if you were I remember
when when I turned 18 in a minute now
this were way before that this was when
I turned 16 we went to to London and we
were ok where do we stay so you we went
to one of the established hotel chains
and we booked the room a room and today
you don't do that you go online and you
can find a luxury home in the Tuscan
countryside if you want to or a couch in
the Bronx
so using Airbnb and not the big hotel
chains they don't
incur a higher transaction cost anymore
I don't have to call all these different
farms in the US Caen countryside in
order to find something that suits me
it's actually adding value to me by not
restricting me to the traditional hotel
districts or to the traditional hotel
buildings this is an illustration of San
Francisco and as you probably already
guessed the green ones are there
available hotel hotel locations and the
red is the different types of common
accommodation that you can get on Airbnb
so when these two things happen
at the same time on platforms you
dramatically reduce transaction costs
and you have value added service through
using the platform things will start to
happen with your organization because
from a purely organizational standpoint
these platforms will disrupt our
traditional hierarchy organizations
dramatically as I just said the reasons
why we have companies where a lot of
people are working together to reach
this common goal is that the company
helped reduce the transactional costs
more than the market is able to do but
this is no longer the case the platform
will be taking over as a coordinating
infrastructure for the organization and
what's funny about this is that in 1937
costs already foresaw some of this he
stated in his article and I'll quote him
just directly and the transaction cost
may be reduced but it will not be
eliminated by the emergence of
specialists who sell the information so
it's quite right platforms are just that
specialists who will sell you the
information about the market but what he
didn't for so and what we can now see is
if you also consider that the platform's
create Network effects where the value
of the platform goes up as the number of
actors
increases it will also increase your
profits and the reason why this is the
costs of using the platform doesn't
scale in the same way that the revenue
from the platform does so this means
that the average cost of your
transactions actually go down which is
the exact opposite that would happen in
a traditional organization and if the
transaction cost of exchanging value in
a society go down as drastically as it's
happening today the form and the logic
of economic entities such as firms will
need to change so the traditional firm
will be the more expensive way the more
expensive alternative almost by default
so if you think of this because this
will mean at a very very different kind
of management will be needed when
coordination can be performed without
people just with the help of Technology
Digital transparency will make response
the coronation possible and that's the
main difference between ruber and a
traditional taxi service the app can do
what the management used to do and my
hypothesis is that the platform economy
will be it's nothing less than an
extension extinction-level event
yeah yes so the comment is made was that
today reverse is loosing a hell of a lot
of money and is really subsidized by the
semesters and that is true and the yeah
I have many theories on on that and this
is also very much discussed and what we
were is doing is really buying
themselves a monopoly and then by you by
the monopoly they'll use that to and
it's kind of network effects that that
they're hoping to use that okay for now
you have this taxi market that we're
disrupting and the taxi market is this
big but by introducing you were and also
introducing the price mechanism in uber
will make more people use taxes so the
market expands to this and when the
market expands to this we have these
network effects that makes it more
interesting and more valuable to become
a part of it so the next thing that they
hope for is to let me see if I remember
the kind of order correctly next thing
they're hoping is that the rental market
of course will kind of just go away
because now it's cheaper to just use
uber instead and when they conquer the
kind of in rental market what they're
hoping then is that the leasing market
will go and so and so forth so what
they're betting on by by using this kind
of huge amount of money is to change the
entire transport sector even though they
know now these days is in much trouble
and is losing money in an unimaginable
way but that's the kind of their big
game plan so it's using the platform and
also taking advantage of the network
effects that they hope will we're kind
of ripple on over time I know if that's
an adequate response or
yeah yeah I agree so and the point is
that you can't just conclude that
everything will work the way you would
work because uber is losing a lot of
money and I do agree with that but it's
more of the example in itself that you
can see that we were overrun a enormous
Liebig company using apps and using the
platform as a coordination
infrastructure instead of using middle
managers which is what usually everyone
else does but I appreciate your point
exactly
but what I think we'll see is that very
very small firms because we had now have
a platform that enables us to kinda have
a different market a different service
market that we see emerging very small
firms can do things that in the past
required very very large organizations
and if you run a company if you run a
company today consider the fact that you
now can have on-demand business talent
available to you for very short term
contracts so you can save money on
benefits on office space on training and
it will be cheaper than using existing
companies such as the consultancy firm
that I had myself because these
freelancers that are using these
platforms they don't have the same
overhead costs that the traditional for
himself they don't need to pay people
like me to find them projects they don't
need the fancy offices they don't mean
the support staff and so on and so forth
and that often means that you as a
company can gain hiring higher skilled
people to help you when you really need
them
and of course this is not just a black
and white conversation because a lot of
critics will claim that the company
structures is not all about reducing
transaction costs it's kind of a
offensive to say that all your company
does is reduce transaction costs and
that
the only reason why it exists there are
other value increasing parts of your
company you have culture you have a
community you have a sense of meaning
and what often people say is that this
is not this is not something that the
open market can cater and why while I
agree with them and I think this is
something that we as leaders or
companies need to consider when we're
structuring our organizations for the
future of work because on the other side
the platform economy in itself social
media the effective cooperation and
coordination tools such as slack or
Trello they help maintain a culture they
help drive a community and they also
keep a sense of meaning in a company
free world and for the people who I
think make up the most of the other
audience today if you don't own your own
company why should you have a boss and I
think most of you also already know the
IT industry both globally but definitely
here in Norway it's currently booming
the all of you guys are individuals in
high demand and by becoming independent
and that's a part of the platform
economy you will get a lot more of the
profit in Norway an independent
consultant usually make double of what
everyone else does they make double of
what I do and while this is so Financial
Times or other very interesting articles
about six months ago and it made an
interesting argument for the
entrepreneur side of things and what
they wrote in their piece on on the
independent worker was that young people
especially are currently working as
independent consultants why they try to
start their own company and it's not
39% of independents consider starting
their own business is their most likely
next move so what do we actually know
about the future and I will lean on some
research done by McKinsey and financial
times in this so McKinsey did a survey
where they had 8,000 respondents in the
US the UK Germany Sweden France and
Spain and what they found what was that
currently the independent workforce it's
around twenty to thirty percent of the
working age population in the United
States and the EU countries but what
they found was the independent workforce
was very diverse in terms of age in
terms of income levels education gender
and that was also across countries so
being your own boss
clearly cuts across borders in all
occupations all industries and in other
words not just the thing for Millennials
they had these four different kinds of
segments where they had these
independent workers to very simply if
you do this as your primary income or
just as a supplement and if this because
you want to do it it's your preferred
choice or is it because you have to do
it
and
and the data so showed that the casual
earners so the people on top right side
here there are the definitely the
largest segments in all six countries
and followed by the free agents and
these two groups are around 75 percent
of the independent earners one of the
interesting things that we found that
McKinsey found in their research was
that the independent people who chose to
be independent are generally more
satisfied all the way on the board than
traditional workers almost in every
dimension like the overall work life and
for me Moore's more surprisingly also on
Income Security so on Income Security
they're just as satisfied they don't
have the worries that you might suspect
when you compare them to traditional
workers they score just as good okay
where do we go from here what what can
we expect what can be excited is it's
estimated at least fourteen fourteen
more percent of the people who now are
in traditional jobs will wish to become
independent primary owners they say that
they're inclined to pursue such career
and the paradox of it is even the when
you look at the media coverage that them
even you when you look at my
presentation where I say oh the platform
economy is great is going to
revolutionize everything digital
platforms is almost not found only six
percent of the independent people have
used who provide labor that is has used
the platform six percent ninety four
percent use other ways of finding work
I'll leave you with
and even though your companies are not
willing to change with these kind of new
realities that I think you're coming you
can be sure that some of your
competitors some of your partners will
try to benefit from the scale some will
try to keep the core operation focused
on what they do best and then call in
independent service providers when they
need them this can be if you think of it
this can this flexibility can allow
organizations to just add a new entity a
new capability by calling in for
instance writers and designers do this
one-time marketing thing or is one of
the sponsors of this comfort I'm not
going to tell you who but one of the
sponsors they've done exactly this
they've opened up a new department just
by hiring a lot of independent
consultants which make up an entire
department in their structure and as
we've seen taxi and the hotel industries
always Fest this competition I think
it's likely that we'll see this in other
industry and my own industry I think is
one of these one it's going to happen
quite quickly and I'll just walk you
very very briefly through through the
consultancy here in Norway and why this
will happen I don't know if you know
Clayton Christensen but he wrote in 2013
is a business professor at Harvard
Business School he wrote an article
where he said the consultancy industry
is on the brink of disruption and the
key drivers for this disruption is the
democratization of knowledge and
increasingly sophisticated client-side
and the rise of a tournament alternative
professional service firms such as Eden
McCollum and the business Talent Group
and what these firms do is that they
assemble project themes for their
clients using freelance consultants so
you have mid-level and senior alumni
from the top consultancy going freelance
and
and making a partnership with business
Talent Group and business our will will
set these people together in a project
team and then offer them in competition
with the traditional firms and of course
this will be at a lower cost because
again the freelance consultants or
sometimes the same costs and as all the
rest of us
and this has already happened in Norway
and we can see in the IT consultancy
industry that the client side side has
become increasingly more sophisticated
it's become mature and along with agile
mythology's it has shifted the way that
companies source in their consultancy
needs most of the clients in the
Norwegian market they source people one
by one they take responsibility for the
project themselves and then they source
in rolls and my best bet is that around
70 to 75 percent of all the sales in the
consulting team is generally is already
happening with this type of sale that
you use sourcing in people one by one
and doing Bali shopping even though all
the firms are very clever at the high
Lingus and this has done things on the
independent side so the independent side
of the Norwegian IT consulting market
has grown rapidly and you can see the
broker side of the market has grown to
know almost half a billion Norwegian
groaners in just a few years so
everything is kind of set for disruption
of our market and I think it will happen
pretty soon and when it happens my guess
is that a lot of companies including my
own will need to change and fast okay I
will try to
it up as you probably got no sense of I
believe for the most people here in the
audience the special life on the highly
skilled one I think that the platform
economy will probably be good for us it
will work to our advantage
and as McKinsey study showed most the
people who choose to be independent are
mostly very happy and happier than a
traditional worker and when the entire
industry like now is dying for you to
join them you can shop around you can be
a part of the elite and even in the
platform economy you don't have to trade
away your security you have the ability
to to set the terms in a completely
different mind another but the flipside
of it will be I think it's quite
possible that a full fledge platform
economy will create a two-tier labor
market and we we have already seen
tendencies of this in Spain where low
income households they make up 40% of
the independent workers since then and
among young people two-thirds of the
working young people in Spain are
working as independent and on very very
short contracts so this is kind of lost
generation of Spain and will be very
troublesome in years to come coming up
three key takeaways and I always know
it's been a long taught one the sharing
economy the gig economy and so forth it
is not driven by character traits it's
not driven by one generation but it's
driven by two sided markets run on a
digital platform enabled by digital
platforms number two by dramatically
reducing transaction costs and adding
Network value the platform's pressing
to disrupt the traditional hierarchical
organization and three independence by
choice our more satisfied with their
work life than traditional workers and
they are believed to grow in the coming
years I'll see if we got any questions
I'll take the first one I run a
consultancy company you think the
consultancy company will exist in five
years I do but I think it needs to
change it needs to be driven I think the
consultancy firms needs to provide
something that you can't get as an
independent consultant you have to take
more risks you have to accept lower
margins you have to be willing to do
stuff and and that you can't do as an
independent and if we're able to do that
then I think we'll exist if we're not
able to to do that if we just continue
as we do today five years maybe ten
years no way consultancy firms driven as
they are today just focusing on having
25% margins giving back to the
industrial owners when we have the
platform company coming no way it won't
happen I don't think they're they're
elitist
the next one how do teams fit into the
perfect market of freelancers alone is a
good question but here I think I'll just
have to refer to the two companies as I
mentioned its Eden McCullen and business
Talent Group and they do this exact
thing they have their vetted freelancers
and when they get the project proposals
or team requirements or something like
that they look through their freelancers
and they set they put together the team
that they think will be the best one for
this particular project and then they
offer that to the
stammers and that's how I think the
teams will fit into the freelancers and
our team of freelancers will will fit in
okay any other questions or no okay
