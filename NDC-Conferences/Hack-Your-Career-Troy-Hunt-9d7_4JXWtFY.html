coming to a talk of mine that is not a
security talk which is really weird if
you want to counter a security talk come
this afternoon and we'll actually break
stuff which is which kind of fun but
this is going to be fun but it's just
very different because this is sort of
more about I guess the softer side or
what we all do and I actually didn't
realize how important that was and how
interested software people were in the
softer side of building a career until
my wife started doing soft skills talk
and did really well and I was like there
might actually be something in this shot
of this so what I thought I'd talk to
you about is effectively managing your
career in ways that sort of help you
grow and expand and do more awesome
things now that might be awesome things
in the place you're at now it might be
awesome things going working someone
else it might be awesome things going
and doing your own thing the intention
is to sort of be cross-cutting and make
sure that you have things out of this or
work no matter where you go now having
said that a lot of this is about my
experiences at this place just here so I
worked at Pfizer which is out in West
right here in Sydney for 14 years and in
case you don't know who Pfizer is you
probably know what we made in case you
don't they're the emails you get every
day so that was these guys so I work at
Pfizer and a lot of people might think
that it must be a lot of fun working for
a company that makes for Agra like the
whole place must just be a barrel of
laughs right and admittedly there were
bits of it that were and bits of it that
went a little bit like any job I guess
so anyway I started writing a blog this
was back in about 2009 now and there are
many reasons why I started writing the
blog and it's just sort of interesting
to look back at it now and this is the
first blog post I ever wrote why online
identities are smart career moves and
the premise of this was that
I thought it would be a good idea to
have some sort of online presence and a
lot of this was sort of dawning on me as
I was interviewing other people so I
didn't view other people for roles and
that send in their CV and you wouldn't
believe it every CV said they were
awesome all right it's always like I'm
great at this is great you don't have
some savvy sort of rate all the
technologies and they're fantastic it
you know c-sharp HTML notepad all these
things and then that guy yeah but you
know I speak to my references I've got
references and they'll tell you that I'm
awesome as well right so you chose the
references right it's always going to be
this sort of echo chamber of
self-congratulation feedback and I
thought I'd write this post and sort of
a few things in here that that I look
back on now and were a bit more
insightful than what I knew at the time
so I'd said things like look I reckon
one of the best things you should do as
a developer is to have a good online
profile now when you have a good online
profile it means things like this like
being able to actually illustrate your
competency and your interests over time
so rather than just being like a one-hit
wonder I did this you know fantastic
thing here's my CV it's great let's show
a track record of success so that was
sort of a theory and I went on to say
look like I'm not trying to change my
job at the moment it's not that I want
to go somewhere else now it's that I
don't know if in the future I might want
to and I think I'll sort of partly
writing this because I wanted to to
cover my own ass because like if my boss
reads this you know like it it may not
go down so well now as it turned out it
took me about five years before I really
hated my job and it took me another year
after that before I was actually gone
but because I started thinking about
this back then it made the time I had at
the job significantly more enjoyable and
it meant that when the job did finish I
had some really neat options that's sort
of what I want to talk about here now
I'm just going to redo this machine
because it is not spitting content out
the right way it should
and we'll get there what's plural sides
alrighty that is better okay so we did
that we did that we did that now I want
to talk a little bit about where it was
that I was working and what I was
actually doing there as well and
hopefully this will give you some
context so I'm gonna sort of tell you as
much as I can openly and candidly and
I'm happy to answer any questions at the
end of it as well so I would go out to
Westar I and I'd go out to this spot
here and this was the manufacturing
plant out there so we made among other
things viagra at the plant out there and
I'd go out into my office which was in
this little building here and there's an
interesting thing that happens with the
technology department I'm sure this will
resonate with many of you they kind of
put them in the most inconvenient spot
alright because you're not meant to be
publicly facing and at the end of the
day you're developers look at you're all
in hoodies who cares where we put you
so so I ended up down here it was my
office and it was an office in the
middle of the building in the basement
of the building so of course he got no
windows now my boss he had windows it
was important for a boss to have windows
because that's reflective status there
are other people that had the same
seniority as me but because I'd been
there at the time I moved into here
about 12 years other people been there
twelve and a half years they go to get
windows and this was what it was like
very very hierarchical many
organizations to still like this so that
was where I was and it's it's sort of
interesting now to just oppose this to
how life looks today because very
regularly today when I work I work from
here now I did this talk in Norway a
couple of months ago and I'm sure people
are looking at this going yeah that's
pretty much what I expect all of
Australia's like and we do keep telling
them that too by the way but hey this is
an all seriousness yes where I work I
live on the Gold Coast now and this is
South straddie and it's great because I
can ride the jet ski up to South
Australia I chucked my little laptop in
there's just enough 3G that I can do
email and Twitter's and things like that
and I go somewhere nice and peaceful
that doesn't even need windows
and I ride the jet Scout there and then
I go home and I ride the jet ski home
and my family's at home I always arrive
very excited when I come home on the jet
ski since during summer when I've worked
up a bit more of a tan obviously so I go
home but in all seriousness I do ride
the jet ski back and that nice thing
about jet ski is that everybody you ever
see on a jet ski is happy I defy you to
find a photo anywhere I saw no jet ski
it's not happy this is one of the
speakers actually from end AC here last
year so he came up to the Gold Coast and
we wit jet skiing it was all enormous ly
good and this is genuinely what life is
like now so I ride home down here this
is where we live on the Gold Coast a lot
of houses on the canals in the Gold
Coast people don't realize this Gold
Coast has got more canals than Amsterdam
and Venice combined so a lot of people
live on the water like this so we live
there and I ride back to the house we
live in now and there's a little boat
shed and there's a trolley that comes
down the ramp and you put the jet ski on
there and it takes it up there and I
never worry about traffic so one of the
reasons I left Sydney the bloody traffic
but you know you're right the jet ski
around you'd have to worry about any of
that
and I sort of wanted to show this
because it it it looks nice and
sensational and everything and it is
very nice but I wanted to kind of make
the point of how things have changed
over time and I want to kind of take you
through that journey of what I did to
get there and I'm overtly conscious that
there is always this risk as seeming
like a dick it's like ooh look how nice
this looks yeah yeah I'm showing it
because I want to try and take you
through that path and as I go through
this and I sort of show the way some
aspects of life are now I think the
question everyone's got to ask
themselves is how you want this to
change your life so what is it that you
want to get out of your careers as
technology professionals and look I mean
obviously one of them is the money sort
of thing so this is generally what
drives most of us to go to work you know
like if we had the choice we said hey
we'll still pay you even see don't go
into the office if you've got a job
where you'd go in without getting paid
like good on you that is awesome
you are exceptional because most of us
are doing it because at the end of the
day we need to earn a living so
hopefully some of the things you take
out of this might give you the
opportunity to get more money from your
current job from another job from
independence there's a bunch of people
that are just unhappy with what they're
doing at work there are some jobs
there there let's be honest and the
things that I'm going to talk about
today many of them made aspects of a job
which I increasingly was disenfranchised
with it made it better made it happier
lasted a lot longer what I would
otherwise and of course for many other
people as well the desire is just to
have more family time so I want to
change the way I work or change the
options I have available to me so I can
spend more time with family
many of these are interlinked as well
certainly when you have the opportunity
to earn more money from things you start
to have more choices about how you work
as well so let's jump into it I want to
start sort of talking about the blog
side of things because for me I showed
you the blog this was really where
everything kind of started and I think
with the benefit of hindsight nerves a
little bit hard with my boss because he
wasn't particularly technical
particularly going back about eight
years there was sort of less I guess
openness and technology today I reckon
talking to your boss about writing a
blog starting a blog is actually a
really good idea and one of the reasons
for that is that it does help you do
your job better now I want to sort of
give you some examples of what I mean by
that one of the things that I found very
difficult at Pfizer was that due to the
structure of the organization where
there wasn't a lot of technical people a
lot of it was out sourced a lot of it
was done by people in other countries so
the people around me were generally
managers and marketing people and things
like this and I'd come up with what I
thought was a good idea and they'd go
yeah that's awesome like no matter what
it was we like yeah that's what yeah so
long as it didn't cost them money yeah
that's awesome we like this and what I
constantly found and I'm sure many
people find
is that I was often in environments
where I was the smartest person in the
room and that's not to be self
ingratiating it's just because there
weren't other people doing the things
that I do around me and I didn't have a
peer group that I could just go hey I'm
thinking about doing this thing and
they'd come back and say no no maybe you
should you know do it differently here's
another technical implementation of a
architectural pattern so I didn't have
this but when I started writing and
putting things out there publicly I've
got a massive peer group and I'll tell
you what people on the internet if you
do something stupid on the internet
don't say this I'll show you later on
some of the things they say if they
don't like you so the point is you put
yourself out there and you start getting
all of this interesting feedback from
the community and I'll give you some
examples of this I wrote back in 2010
this five-part series on continuous
integration and deployment via team city
and I was actually building out Pfizer's
CI environment at the time and as I was
building it I went what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna write this whole thing up so I
blogged a five-part series heaps of
people read it and there were an
interesting couple of things that
happened when I did this number one is
that if I screw it up in Pfizer and
let's qualify this if I if I made a
claim that was technically inaccurate if
I've had a pattern which wasn't the most
optimal no one's gonna call me on it
when you put it out here they will call
you on it and I knew that call me on it
so I put a lot more work into making
sure that I had everything spot-on
because I didn't wanna look stupid so
that was really good the other thing
that happened was that I put this thing
here and all these other people came and
gave us free consultation by way
comments because they come back in the
comments they go have you thought about
doing this in our organization we did
that here's another tool that may help
you and the penny was dropping for me
back in 2010 or so no boss this is
awesome like there's all these people
coming and helping us do this thing
better and we didn't even have to pay
them any money and it's very very true
go and read the comments on blog posts
like this so that was one example
another one would be something like this
we were moving to Azure we had sort of
traditional
shared hosting based models picking
everything up moving it into Azure and I
decided alright well we we should
automate this because if you keep doing
the same thing over and over again
automation is good so I went and our
shelled the whole thing everything from
creating the website to the databases to
setting up host names you name it did it
all in PowerShell and put it out there
and the same thing happened is the team
City series right
loads of people popped up and said have
you thought about doing it this way or
another more effective mechanism but one
of the things that sort of started to
happen as I was doing this is I realized
that every error of effort I invested
was now being leveraged much further
than what it was before
so I'll give you an example I would
still sit down and write this and do
this for Pfizer I had to go through and
document it right the process whether I
put it on the web or not I'd have to
invest the effort when I invested the
effort and put it on the web
this also started building my profile as
the guy that knows stuff about in this
case is Europe so it sort of started to
help build profile build reputation it
helped a lot of other people and this is
anonymously important as well you know
I've invested the effort but there's all
these other people who have just had a
problem solved for them and look that
may not directly impact the bottom line
of fires or put more money in my pocket
but it made me happy like it's nice
having all these comments that come back
saying hey you've just done something
that's been really useful for me and
that's kind of the happiness part of
this where it made me more content with
what I was doing every day and what I
find now is is every time I'm doing
something I keep thinking about this
leverage thing right so how can I do
this in a way that it doesn't just
achieve this one objective but all these
other things happen as a result and as I
go through that the rest of the talk
you'll see multiple examples of this now
to sort of start drawing it to like an
actionable Isum if you want to write a
blog I reckon the best thing you can do
these days is go and get ghosts in fact
I just saw ghost was in the news today
they just launched version 1.0 been
around for four years a lot of pre one
versions in there but ghost is fantastic
great blogging platform without a lot of
the dramas that come along with
WordPress when you get a ghost blog go
and put it on Ghost Pro you pay 62 cents
a day tax tax deductible in Australia as
well so it's really less than that and
they manage the whole thing for you
it runs on their platform they keep it
alive they upgrade it they support it
they keep the bad guys out they do all
of this stuff and I've had people in the
past go why don't you run this in Azure
and you can manage the server yourself
and you can be a hero like your own
little kingdom and you can patch it and
upgrade it I don't want to do that I
just want to block so seriously think
about they get a blog on a managed
platform so that's awesome
very very easy to get started and also
go and get a template you know there's a
bunch of stuff out there that's either
free or you pay 10 bucks for and then
you upload it into the site job done
looks fantastic responsive works across
everything easy-peasy
so you can get started very simply then
you got a cloud flare and you get HTTP
because you got to have HTTPS on this
the security guys get telling us this so
you got to do that and that's free not
only do you get HTTPS you get education
in a hundred and sixteen different nodes
around the world
DDoS defense a whole bunch of other
things so the point is it's very cheap
and very easy to get this up and running
you can literally do this in the space
of an hour and now you've got a platform
where you can start to write stuff now
you may not know what to write I didn't
know what to write when I first started
other than that first blog post that was
how far ahead I was thinking it's like I
should have a blog I write about that
thing the career thing and that will be
the start as I started writing
all right stuff like this this was in
chronological order after that first
post subversion stuff vs 2010 and
incidentally on this I was just grabbing
examples that I found around the web I
was like let's just find the 25 most
interesting things and you got to have a
number that's an increment of five I
don't know if you noticed this when you
do a top thing I learned this from
BuzzFeed
so that I did some stuff around having a
baby to be a better programmer in
retrospect I do not recommend this but
it got me writing and all of this
sometimes it was scratching in etcher I
was like I there was this thing Zionist
bugging me and I want to kind of get it
out all bloggers and it may not be of
much relevance to people but it got me
writing I went to ride around things
like this software quality's important
virgin blood screwed something up this
was my first public shaming of a company
the memories yeah some things had
changed some things it's still just the
same things like PDC and I professional
developers conference oh nine again I
didn't go to this thing I was just
reading stuff on the web that I thought
was interesting and writing in here and
it certainly wasn't ripping it off it
was just like there's all this noise
here are the things that I think are
interesting I don't think these were
read very much I think I could have got
excited if I had had a hundred people in
a week come by and read this and
sometimes now it's a hundred thousand
people in a day that read stuff but it
began with this ultimate virtual office
the reason I did this is because I'd
already written it on the internal blog
and I thought this would be an easy way
of putting another block out publicly
copy/paste job done none of this was
about security none of it is about Azur
which are the two sort of biggest things
I do these days I had no idea at this
time I was going to be the security guy
the role I had was an architectural
security was one little slice of that
and the point I'm trying to make is that
you don't have to know what the end goal
is you don't have to know what is it
that I'm going to be the specialist in
and I'm going to sort of own the space
it's something that gets you started and
gets you moving in the right direction
now the blogs one thing I was writing as
well for Redgate and their simple talk
newsletter for a while and we can see
this is sort of nearly seven years ago
based on the date that I pay you
anything but they give you a platform to
put stuff out there and again nothing to
do a security that one's nothing to do a
security that was nothing to do a
security and I didn't earn a cent from
any of it but it all started to
contribute to profile
and the profiles are non ously important
but I needed the platforms in order to
do it and anyone can go and write pieces
like this for all sorts of publications
now as you do this one of the things you
may find happening is your boss may have
a moment of hesitation here's something
I've heard a few times if you are in an
environment like this firstly imagine
this because this is the premise and
this is a genuine concern I hear if the
premise is that your boss is concerned
that you may get really good at what you
do and that it is a problem that you get
really good at what you do I think the
writing's on the wall and I hear the
same thing often with training why
people go well if you go to those
conference and go to Troy's workshop you
might get good at that and then you
might go and get a better job better
keep you in your box that's not a good
environment and this happens a lot many
many places so the Bloggie is one thing
speaking is another one and speaking is
an enormous ly good way of again sort of
leveraging the effort that you invest so
it's great insofar as obviously you get
exposure you get profile I'm doing it
right now right lots of people knowing
it also really forces you to refine your
thinking around the thing that you're
talking about you know you've got to
have confidence in the subject that
makes you much better at what you do and
I think there's a lot of sort of other
good social things that come as a result
of being comfortable getting up and
speaking to any of you can go and do
this this was the first public talk I
ever did this was in 2012 at SSW over
there in neutral Bay so first one over
did and I went from there
all the way through to last year in Oslo
in DC during the opening keynote in
front of thousands of people but it
started from that first one that first
little one and it incrementally stepped
up and any of you can go and speak at
events like this there are calls for
paper open at the moment friend DC
London
London is a very long way away they are
going to want to get people when they
buy international tickets who they know
are going to do a good job but the calls
for paper friendly see Sydney will be
open a few months from now are they are
they what's really I don't I think they
are closing on October 2 this October oh
ok so imagine you fast forwarded one
year I don't it may come across
implicitly but I don't always pay a huge
amount of attention to detail this lady
does thank you alright so be those it
made there are loads of events around
both in Australia and internationally
where you can submit and you can go and
speak and just incidentally for things
like in DC London or a lot of things
like that and I know there are other
speakers in here as well that will back
me up on this you don't get paid to go
and speak no one's paying me to go to
I'll go to London in 2018 and do in DC
but you get a plane ticket mean you get
a hotel and you get an absolutely
awesome experience for a few days but
seriously think about the likes of NBC
and Sydney next year as well and even as
a sort of I guess an easier way of
easing yourself into this things like
user groups are really good there are
heaps of user groups in Sydney this was
a user group I did a little while ago in
Denmark and in case you don't know the
mechanics of a user group it can be
anything from like a dozen people
through to some of them like this
hundreds of people in a big university
and I stand up and you do a still sort
of a talk about whatever it is that
you're interested in a little bit like
this but quite a bit more casual and
then I sat around for an hour and just
answered questions and stuff because
there's no schedule you're not rushing
off to see something else it's very
relaxed so if you wanted to sort of get
started have a look at the local user
groups there's a heap around in Sydney
for all sorts of technologies another
one that's really good if you want to
sort of start getting a bit more
exposure is speaking on podcasts so many
of you all know these guys that's a
great podcast there are a heap of them
now I'll give you an example and I've
sort of I've got a challenge here for
you mate of mine Lars Clint does the
Dane and the pain Lars is another
speaker here he runs this podcast he's
always looking for people to speak so I
said hey I want to put your thing up and
offer people if they would like to talk
to go on your show so if anyone has
something that they think is interesting
and they want to share it and sort of
start moving in that direction of
speaking more get in touch with Lars or
me and I'll connect utilise can't
speaking this podcast it's easy
you sit there at home on skype and
record it simple so in terms of sort of
building profile another really useful
resource is Stack Overflow now a reason
why I think Stack Overflow is so great
is that you can go to someone's profile
you can look at something like this you
can see what are the questions they're
asking now for me when I was employing
people if I couldn't find any presence
of someone whatsoever not even asking a
question that worried me because I'm
like what do you what do you actually do
when you get stuck and they're like well
like Google and I keep googling and good
and like at what point do you stop
googling and just ask for help and I
don't know but when this is here it's
like now I've got a pretty good idea
when you're asking for help what you're
asking for help for I've got a good idea
that you're comfortable asking for help
and saying that you just don't know some
things obviously answering questions as
well being able to build your psyche
overflow reputation is awesome because
you've got this documented independent
history of the things that you've been
doing and when you go in and hand your
CV to someone and go hey I'm awesome by
the way
here's my Stack Overflow profile and
shows what I've actually been doing in
the sorts of things I do and don't know
that is enormous ly valuable independent
verification another one that's really
good is getting involved in projects so
I built a project some easier now called
a safer web which was for analyzing
asp.net websites and I built this
because I had a problem I needed to
solve in the office
and the problem is that we're putting
all these asp.net websites out there and
I'll go and look at it it's like you
haven't turned on custom areas you've
got tracing enabled you've got they'll
just mundane stupid things so I built a
project on my own time and I put it out
there and I made my job at Pfizer easier
I solved that problem but the leverage
was that people started going troy's
that guy in knows about asp.net and it
started building that part of my brand
now whether you build your own project
and it's never been easier to do that
because we've got cloud and we've got
cheap certificates free certificates
cheap hosting everything else we need or
whether you go and contribute to open
source or something like that getting
involved in stuff like this is really
useful so I went from that to this one
and many people probably know this one
and this is now an enormous ly popular
and obviously valuable project which I
originally built sitting in a hotel room
in the Philippines on a Pfizer trip
because I had time and I had an itch I
wanted to scratch the leverage of this
was that many people think I did this to
search for data breaches which is true
about 50% of the reason I did it is
because I wanted to do stuff with Azure
and anger I didn't want to just go I've
read a few blog posts now I'm gonna
start moving corporate websites so wrong
and actually create stuff myself so I
managed to satisfy that requirement
actually getting hands-on experience and
I built this up a thing which in many
ways is defining a lot of what I do now
on my spare time anyone can do this like
literally just sitting at home building
stuff like this for next to no money
particularly if you've got an MSD and
subscription you got free as your
credits dead easy
so getting yourself out there and
getting that exposure is really good and
what you've got to remember is that when
you do that you are facing the world
right and there's sort of a couple of
interesting things that happen when you
write stuff that faces the world one of
those is that every now and then you're
reminded that there are other cultures
out there with quite different views to
ours now I want to give you an example
of this
I did a talk in Brisbane in January DDD
in Brisbane and I showed a little video
with a hacker now I actually showed this
same video here at NDC in Sydney last
year as well but it wasn't until DDD in
Brisbane and someone pointed something
out to me I'll go show you the clip very
briefly all right so that's it it's like
five seconds and the purpose of this
clip is to show that this particular
company makes a product called Cujo is
trying to scare people with hackers
because he's scary right he's got a
hoodie he's got green text we know he's
a hacker and it sort of illustrates the
theme I was trying to convey so I did
the usual thing and I've done this all
over the world so I'd probably shown
this 20 times in different talks
everyone always goes this is hilarious
it's insightful yada yada one guy came
up to me after the talk at DDD and he
said something about your talk and like
okay well maybe he liked it that's
that's good and and he said yeah he did
like it was really good but obviously he
had something that he wanted to get off
his chest about the hacker and he was a
little bit pensive and I'm like alright
oh geez
what about mister what's happened and he
brushed it very very gently
he said he's black so was he I
don't know it's just a hacker it's a guy
from the video and the penny that
dropped is I realize the guys American
and there is a very very sensitive
stereotype there around race and crime
and if you make that Association people
can get upset now after he said this
that the penny dropped and I think
particular in the last week we've seen
the terrible things on these lines and
we realized that there there is this
thing in the US which is much more
sensitive than places like Australia and
I sort of felt in a way I felt bad about
it because I thought gee I hope I
haven't first of all I hope I haven't
upset the guy second of all I hope I
haven't perpetuated a stereotype and
then I went back to the slide and I
found the other hackers so there
Gazza hacker he's a hacker he's a hacker
I'm not sure what color he is but he's a
hacker and this was a beer and I sort of
went well yeah you know I'm balanced I'm
Aixa okay with it so on balance so I
don't think of sort of perpetuate a
stereotype but I'm just now becoming
extra conscious of the cultural
sensitivities that can be in other parts
of the world and for the most part we
think of the US as being very like us
bar one major exception at the might we
won't get into it's just interesting I
hadn't really had the penny drop there
but I have actually seen this play out
multiple times in different forms and
this is a good example here where I
wrote this blog post about how to do
password resets and password resets they
sort of seem like a simple idea but it's
really easy to screw them up and do
things wrong and I wrote this blog post
and one of the points I was trying to
make in here is that when you do a
password reset and you sort of enter
your email address and it comes back and
it says something you don't really want
that something to say yes we've sent you
an email versus no your account doesn't
exist because an enumeration or escrow
tells you whether the account exists or
not and depending on the site that can
be a privacy issue if it's this site
that's a problem the reason why there's
a porn site on there which incidentally
I cropped very very carefully I had to
rearrange pictures I'm sure like my wife
sees some of the blog posts all right
she's like what the hell are you doing
it's all research anyway
in red text you can see it says there is
no user registered with this email
address now the point of it was is that
particularly for a site of that nature
and incidentally a site let's say a site
that deals with depression or medical
issues you have a much higher
expectation of privacy and this really
Illustrated that point and I then had
multiple comments from people saying if
my boss walked past and saw this on the
screen I've been a lot of trouble and
I'm looking at going there's like 5,000
words of text on here and diagrams and
charts and things like that and what is
clearly a screen cap in the middle of it
what is wrong with you but interestingly
again it was a very US dominated
audience and I was checking the IP
addresses cause like is this a cultural
thing particularly in the US and I guess
there's sort of more conservative parts
the u.s. they're very worried about it
so I ended up sky and okay the way I'll
address this is right up the top I put a
big red box and I said in text further
down the page there is a screen cap of
an adult web site where you can't see
anything you won't see at the beach if
you're worried about this click here now
to replace it with a picture of fluffy
bunnies the fluffy bunnies are not
wearing any clothes
it's just that little bit lander get him
and I saw this play out again recently
where I wrote this and this was about
using CloudFlare and people's
perspectives of security and I made one
comment in there just one comment one
sentence which upset a few people and
I'm sure you'll see why once he's ready
now this was about October so it was
before he got the job and a couple of
people weren't real happy and yeah I
like this in a way it's it's not a bad
comment but also to sort of go hey
you've just written thousands of words
worth of content which are really useful
and can help people do good things by
the way please don't mention the
election I just thought was really odd
someone else was a little bit stronger
as well they thought that after the
years of earning my reputation I'd lose
it in seconds so I haven't thought
of that he was really upset a small part
of me died today and it was once so I
saw that was all right mate but it is
possible that there are some people out
there that are just too easily offended
and I got to think about this like maybe
there are people that are offended when
they shouldn't be and maybe it doesn't
matter that there are always going to be
a very real small very small slice of
people that do get upset and I found
this epic explanation of that by nosy
comedian called Steve Hughes so I'm
gonna play this because I think it
perfectly illustrates how we should be
looking at this
and it's very true I look in fairness
it's not that that gives you free
license to go out there and just upset
people left right and center but the
penny that dropped to me as well is that
if you try too hard not to upset anyone
you become enormous ly boring you just
sort of a road your entire personality
and if at the end of the day there's one
guy that didn't like okay two guys that
didn't like one comment about Trump I'm
okay with that
and if really if a little part of him
dies inside so be it now some people
take offense slightly differently and
again people will take offense at things
that you could never imagine that will
take offense that sometimes they get
quite upset and this sort of brings us
to the bit where I start talking about
how upset people get one guy got so
upset he created an entire wordpress
blog about how much I suck unfortunately
it is no longer available because I
really really wanted to get bits of it
to show you here he also created a
disgust account about how much I suck
and between these two that were
dominated by many hours of invested time
into explaining to everyone how much I
suck I have to I got my mics off
Regional Director award which by all
accounts is a positive thing
wrote about how much I sucked invested a
lot of time and it's just unfortunate
that it's gone but I was I was worried
because I thought what if people
believed him what if people genuinely
think I suck so what I'll do is I will
make a preemptive strike and I will go
out and I will register Troy hunt sucks
calm and I did so this now exists you
keep your laughing but you can go there
as works and I registered this and then
I had the leverage thing in mind right
about you've got to try and leverage
other things you do and I thought
there's another upside to this now have
any of you registered a domain recently
and not paid for who is privacy what
happens after you do that span you get
calls non-stop from people normally on
the other side of the world trying to
sell you web development skills and I
was ready for this and I thought I'm
going to get called and they're going to
explain that domain name to me I wonder
how many times I can get them to say
Troy hunt sucks
I got 11 my wife is so embarrassed when
these calls come in and she can hear
these people talking and look I don't
have much patience for them because
ultimately it is cold calling it's
illegal if they were in Australia
because we've got doing a cor registers
and stuff they're wasting my time it
just seems like fair game now a lot of
this as well is is relatively benign
insofar as it's not too abusive it's
like it's annoying it's a little bit
funny but occasionally it does kind of
go off the rails a little bit and I've
got some some sort of very candid
feedback here and there's really two
ways we can go now who would like to see
the censored version who I'd like to see
the uncensored version well that's good
because I only have an uncensored
version I'm just going to put the
comment up on the screen and in all
honestly like normally this is what I
would read with mates drinking beer like
we'd sit around we have a couple of
beers and I'll go you never believe what
I got the other day and it's funny but
because they're all friends in here
this is normally the reaction when we're
doing the beer drinking thing and
reading abusive comments as well it is
creative I think the thing I like most
about this is showing my useless face at
a conference and putting this up on the
big screen but this is what does
occasionally happen you get to the point
where someone is just unhinged and if
anyone's to ask me later on I'll tell
you why they made this kind but it was
it was wasn't even to do a security it
was about a GoDaddy thing and this
person was obviously very upset
they were very offended and and they
left this comment and in fairness as
well this is nothing compared to what
some people get particularly women in
this industry some of the that they
get from people is just absolutely
obscene so for me it really hasn't
gotten much worse than this in this
particular case I was a little bit
worried someone who'd go a bit further
in different ways but again that's an
offstage discussion so occasionally a
sort of thing happens but I don't want
you to sort of see this and go well I'm
kind of afraid to go on the internet now
because I might get something like this
because the reality of it is there are a
huge number of really really positive
interactions and I find these
particularly by the likes of Twitter and
I want to sort of change the tone of in
let's like talk about the positive stuff
and the good things that can come of
engagement through channels like this so
one of the things that I found really
interesting particularly as I've
traveled around I've met people in other
places is that there's a huge number of
people that I've communicated with
online who then turn up at events want
to take selfies and believe me no one
thinks this is more weird than me right
when someone goes open the way can we
take a selfie so yeah yeah but you know
the nice thing about this is everyone is
smiling these are all people I met on
Twitter and then they saw me in
different parts of the world and said
hey you know let's have a photo let's go
chat and it was very very nice and what
I started doing is when I travel I'll
often Twitter I'll say hey I'm going to
somewhere I'm going to be in a place
would you
random follower I like to catch up and
have a coffee or something and I've done
this in many different countries and met
loads of different people and none of
them have been axe murderers
no like they've all been really really
nice so things like this bloke down the
bottom right
this is Stein and he did come and see me
in Antwerp earlier on in the air and it
was great because we sort of met up the
guy I'd like I've chatted to him Twitter
had an idea who he was and he took me
for a little tour and then he gave me
the world's best beer and you know how
loads of people go you know this was
like the best thing in the world and you
go yeah sure it is you know that's
perspective and I looked it up and it
was the world's best beer west Fletcher
and 10 so that they keep gets
consistently rated as the world's best
he gave me two of them and I did try it
and yes it was it was vents a tional and
it was just from meeting up with the
random person so I want to kind of make
the point that there are many many
positive experiences that do happen
online part of the challenge though is
that when you start to sort of have
these online profiles people follow you
because they're interested in something
that you do now a lot of people follow
me because I do the security things and
what I find sometimes happens now is
people will say I followed you because
the security thing and then you did
something that wasn't security I'll give
you an example this I bought a car
recently in Melbourne and I flew down
from the Gold Coast pick the car up
drove two back to Sydney in fact and
wrote to Sydney to do the agenda
committee for this event and then drive
home the Gold Coast and I posted a sound
of the exhaust on my Twitter feed cuz it
sounds epic and someone popped up very
unhappy about this
why aren't you tweeting about security
I'm following you for security how dare
you have a life involving something that
is not security and I was a little bit
upset about this but I kind of ignored
it and what I found was very interesting
is immediately after that someone else
did this and it just kind of reminds you
that there are so many people out there
with different views like you're going
to get people that love what you do and
equally people that hate what you do and
I think it's really only when there's a
pattern of particularly the former or
the latter that you have to worry about
now the other thing about sort of being
online via social media
is that it it gives you other
opportunities to demonstrate who you are
so recently I got a new machine and I
got this machine and I went home and I
plugged it in and I thought it would be
interesting to see what a brand new
Windows 10 machine direct from Lenovo
plug it in the network how much data
doesn't need to download just to update
all the packs service patches from etc
and I found out is about 12 gig and I
tweeted it so 12 Giga data brand new
machine I think those creators updates
and stuff like this as well and I
tweeted this and I said stats of IUB
until you being teased ubiquity they
make the network here I use and I said
stuff by ubiquity because I'd put the
table in here and the table has the
numbers and if I didn't say that I would
have people saying well where are the
numbers from and then I'd have this
continual you know response thing and
someone was very upset with that they
really didn't like that those three
words were jamming ubiquity down their
throat and when I sort of saw this I
went every bone in my body now wants to
just tell them they're a dickhead you
know because this is what it feels like
I mean it was just such a random thing
and I kind of thought well let's turn
this completely around I'll say
something completely different and I'll
acknowledge that maybe it's just
something they're not interested in and
just so the person didn't think I was
trying to take the piss put a smiley
face that'll fix it but here's the
interesting thing that happened as a
result of it and that I liked the whole
tone of everything changed now going
back and incidentally they did reef
follow me as well I still follow me
today I checked because I was like this
is not going to be a good demo otherwise
going back to sort of the point of the
online profile and everything is that
interactions like this give you a really
good opportunity because imagine later
on when someone's looking at you perhaps
you're going for another job for example
and they're going let's figure out who
this person is we'll look at their
social network and everyone does this
right you're hiring someone you got to
look at the publicly available info
and they read through and they see
interactions like that what are they
going to think of me compared to if I
had a said mate you're a dickhead that
would be a very very different
perception and it's not that I'm
artificially fabricating a persona by
responding like I did it's just that
that was the nice thing to do and it
leverages it has this upside of being a
positive thing that other people may see
so we'll change pace on this a little
bit because I want to sort of talk about
how I did end up transitioning out of
that Pfizer job I spoke about earlier
and it really all started with this now
this is a very popular thing in
Australia in lots of parts of the world
you know we're going to outsource all
the things I'm sure many of you have
sort of been through this process of
where certain things that you've done in
the organisation have moved elsewhere
and the the Pfizer sort of view of
things and again it's a very common view
was that you've got people in the
organisation that are selling things and
marketing things and they make money
salespeople marketing people you've got
people like us in the organization and
we cost money make money cost money what
we should do is we should get rid of the
things that cost us money because we're
going backwards paying these technology
people and they increasingly outsource
more and more and more and more to
low-cost markets and of course all the
things that you guys as technology
people know would happen did happen
which is part of what made it a very
unpleasant environment but this would
sort of continue to surface this
favoritism of the sales and the
marketing and the I guess the negative
view of the tech people and you'd see it
over and over again sales and marketing
that would have their annual conference
they're Hamilton Island looks nice
doesn't it so they'd go after Hamilton
Island we'd have our annual event at the
West Ride lawn bowls Club
now don't laugh everyone got a $20 ahead
budget and I'm not making that up it was
$20 a head this was the Christmas party
actually he have $20 a head to spend on
beer which was barely enough to get
drunk enough to make the pain go away so
this was happening over and over again
and now we got three out of 24 down I
got a new boss and this boss was in the
Philippines and the role I had I looked
after asia-pacific so it kind of didn't
matter where I was in the world or where
my boss was so that wasn't so much the
issue but obviously there's a very
different cultural set of ideals and
values and when I started reporting I
said look I'm on going off to speak at
code mania in New Zealand and this was
going to be in about April 2014 and
everyone was cool with this yup no
problems all agreed all booked in
approved and then a little bit
beforehand he said I'd like you to come
to Manila in the Philippines for a
meeting so well you know I can't because
of a thing and he said no no I really
want you to come so yeah be you really
really no I can't because I'm going to
code mania and I'm going to talk and
people buying tickets in part because
there now I'm going to talk and then I'm
going to have a holiday with my wife
afterwards over the weekend before I
come back to the office on Monday and
then he said the only priority is the
company and this was literally the
sentence and it was a combination of
sort of the outsourcing in the continual
sort of devaluation of technology and
technology people and attitudes like
this that meant every day I was going
into work and I was feeling like this
if you don't know this feeling firsthand
I'm sure you can imagine it
metaphorically I was feeling like this
and I'm sure you've all had times in
jobs with us a current one or an old one
we just felt like every day so this
was April and I I got obviously pretty
upset about this and I did end up going
to the Philippines and I did end up
going to New Zealand as well but I got
there about an hour before my talk
started which was a closing keynote on a
Friday afternoon missed everything
just very upset about it so when Ann got
all the paperwork from HR to leave and I
was sort of looking at the paperwork and
going well if they ask me to leave it
would be much better and I'll get back
to that at the moment but the thing that
I sort of started doing said okay look
I've got to have an exit plan now I had
had five years with the blogging and
speaking all this other stuff and I went
what I got to do is every opportunity
that comes up to write something to
record something to do whatever I'm
gonna say yes to and I clearly remember
having this vision of Jim Carrey and yes
man so if you've seen yes man it's the
one where he just says yes to everything
do really crazy stuff and his life does
all these wonderful things as a result
I'm not gonna go quite to that extreme
but I'm gonna say yes to as much as I
possibly can and I was in particular
saying yes to Pluralsight courses as
well so I was still writing all of the
blogs and all this sort of thing because
that's good exposure and profile but the
Pluralsight courses ruined honestly
useful because they were getting to the
point with our starting to make money
now to make money of course like course
people are got to watch them
it's a royalty based model the more
people watch the more the authors make
but I was writing enough stuff and
building enough profile from there all
the other things are spoken about
earlier on that by the end of 2014 it's
making more money from plural so I was
making more money going home staying up
late recording courses recording them on
the weekend recording on my holidays
then I was going into work every day
getting hit in the nuts metaphorically
and this was great because it meant that
when we got to in 2014 my wife and I had
this chat we said well
you know we can pretty much go now
problem is is that when you go now half
of your newly adjusted income disappears
but we said look we got to do it because
there was a trajectory the only thing
that actually made things a little bit
more bearable is that my boss had
stopped talking to me about six months
earlier and I'm not joking and I had
plenty to do because I've been there for
13 years at the time so no problem got
plenty of stuff to keep myself amused
with so we went away at Christmas the
end of 2014
went up to the Gold Coast where we
always went because my family's there
and we said all right we're going to
come back 2015 is gonna be the year
gonna be gone and a week after I got
back I got a meeting invite said updates
and you're like you sort of look at the
attendee list you know that is a really
unusual attendee list
there's about dozen people there and so
I've gone to the updates meeting and
there's a lady there she wasn't most
senior lady there and she was crying
this was getting interesting and we go
in there and my boss was on the phone
and the Philippines and his boss is on
the phone from somewhere and there's
sort of the twelve of us sitting around
with the ladies crying and they say this
is the org chart now and it's got names
this is the org chart in the future no
names only roles and some people are
getting really visibly distressed
because think about what this means and
you may have been in this situation that
past yourself they're suddenly worried
that they're out of a job and they're
going what is going to happen to me for
me I was reacting somewhat differently
and inevitably this is what happened
they went okay that's it and what was
even better though than being fired is
it was redundancy and I'm yet to meet
someone who's had a redundancy that
hasn't at least afterwards been very
happy about it it's often a shock right
my wife had a redundancy as well but the
great thing about our done see is they
pay you to go and Pfizer had very good
provisions and I've been there 14 years
and they end up paying me nearly two
years worth of income to go and I just
about walked out without it a few months
earlier so there are a lot of people
around that was starting to feel very
upset and it is a shock when it first
happens but once you sort of sit there
and you start thinking about what it
actually means to have that choice and
I'll still say yes to everything so I'll
still saying yes I'll write that course
yes we'll do everything else and by the
time I left four months later after they
announced redundancy those two phases
which is good because now it was only a
third of my income a tag on plus guess
what I got a lot of time free now so the
day I left I was very happy
I don't remember an awful lot about that
day other than what's in the photos but
it did make me very happy and it was as
a result of all those other themes that
I now had this choice and I think back
to that blog post I showed it in start
where it's like I don't know how long I
want to be here I don't know how long my
job wants me to be here but at some
point in the future I may need the
choices to be able to do what I want to
do so today often it means traveling
around a lot so this was in Copenhagen
in October and you know this is sort of
a double-edged sword so it's neat going
interesting places
it also means I was there on my son's
birthday so his birthday was FaceTime
and one of the things that you got to
think about when you even when you're
just blogging in the nights and the
weekends or something like that is this
thing about putting a price on your
family and this is a really
uncomfortable question for people people
don't like to think about it this way
because they say their family is
priceless that you're all here watching
me you're not having their family
we make this trade-off every day we go
to work as I said earlier on usually
because we need to make money and we
trade off and all that happens with this
sort of independence and these other
options is I've got more ways of trading
it off I could go and get a nine-to-five
job and do the normal thing
or I could be independent and what it
does do is it means I get to make
choices about things like this where I
go hey I'm just gonna go and play tennis
with my seven-year-old as much as I can
7:00 a.m. in the morning sitting down
there I don't have to go anywhere I
probably got to do some emails I'll
probably work late or work on the
weekend whatever the thing about that
though is that it it is anonymously
difficult and honestly day by day even
this week I'm continually sort of
changing my tolerance to how much this
stuff I do but the most important thing
for me with the way I've done this is
that it's been something I've done with
Kylie with my wife as well so we've had
to discuss together like what is the
right balance should I go to this event
should I do this piece of work you know
are we willing to trade off family and
life time and quality of time together
to do that and I think the most
important thing I'll leave you with on
this is that for those of you who have
families whether it's a partner or kids
or other responsibilities is that you've
got to have a shared vision on this if
you go off and you just work 110 percent
the whole time and your wife or husband
is at home feeling neglected that's
probably not going to be the outcome
that you want so on that note thank you
very much for coming and I hope that
that's been useful I know it's a bit
different to what I normally do but I
hope you enjoyed it thanks guys
