numbers and tell me what is the
relationship between each series and
between the numbers in each series it's
kind of a rhetorical question it's
really really hard to look at data in
this format and get any useful
information out of them
however if we plot these as a simple
scatter diagram then the relationship
jumps out really quickly you can see
there's a very strong correlation
between x and y series some series have
a stronger correlation than others some
series have a some outliers you notice
three and four there's a couple of
outliers there which might represent bad
pieces of data it might represent a
reason for us to modify the model that
would have if we didn't have it the
point is that it's possible to glean a
lot more information a lot more quickly
very often when we look at data this way
in terms of pictures graphs charts and
maps than it is to look at the raw data
itself and that becomes more true the
more data we have this process of
turning numerical data into pictures is
called data visualization and I'm a
software developer I've been doing that
for a long time it's a big part of my
job is turning numbers into pictures I
was a consultant for over 20 years
and we collect data I went short back to
the user in some usable format often is
a graph or a chart or a map a lot of us
do that how many software developers in
the house almost everybody is and when
we do this we use tools this is not a
tools talk but there's a lot of really
good tools out there you know you there
they become evolved to the point where
they're ridiculously easy to use you
point at a data source you select a type
of a chart and then next next finish and
bang you have a pie chart but what if
the pie chart is not the best way to
display your data or a more fundamental
question is what do I even mean
when I say best way to display data and
this is something that I really didn't
think about for a long time for a good
part of my career I I would hit next
next finish and problem-solve I'm on to
the next problem and my purpose today is
to get you to maybe stop for a second
after you hit next next finish and think
about some of the principles they were
talking about what how can I make my my
visualizations a little bit better not
so much in terms of choosing the right
tools the tools are using are probably
really good I mean Excel is a really
cheap tool and then it does a great job
and there's you know every control
better has a set of visualizations
they're they're really good they're easy
to use
not this is our tool slug I want to talk
about some principles of data
visualization because my guess is that
maybe like me a lot of you are not
thinking about that no one person who is
thinking about it is Edward Tufte Edward
Tufte is a professor at Yale University
and he's a leader in the field of data
visualization he writes about it
extensively he has done so for decades a
lot of what I'm going to present today
came out of his writings this is an
excellent book here the visual display
of quantitative information he
self-published it about 30 years ago
it's still very relevant today he he
what he began his study decades ago
about data visualizations he began
looking at pictures of data that spoke
to him and trying to find him out why
they spoke him why were they good
visualizations and they weren't
necessarily computer generated this one
for example is a train schedule from the
19th century in France and it shows this
this is on the y-axis are the stations
in France where the trains stopped and
one of the x-axis are the times of day
goes from 6 a.m. 24 hours later to 6
a.m. the next day and these vertical
lines or the upstart further these
diagonal line segments represent the
routes that each train takes so the left
endpoint of each line segment is the
time and place of a departure of a train
and the right endpoint is the timing
place of a destination so because a
simple matter of following one of these
lines to see that there is a train that
leaves Paris at about 12:20 an afternoon
than it arrives in tone air it looks
like about 6:30 in the
evening once you know it's not a perfect
visualization but it's simple it's easy
to read and it's maybe even easier than
airline schedules take another thing
from its simplicity here's another one
this is this shows each vertical line is
a decade and there are several graphs
plotted leap along the same x axis x
axis is time here
the bar chart in the middle is the cost
of a bushel of wheat in England for each
decade whereas the red line below it is
the wages paid to a mechanic over that
same period of time so what we're seeing
is the cost of commodities and the cost
of labor and you can see that they more
or less follow the they go up and down
at about the same rate except that the
cost of commodities is a lot more
volatile than the cost of labor which
might be related to the lines of the
very top up here which show the monarchs
that were raining over the United
Kingdom during those periods time or
maybe more likely the wars that those
monarchs were waging so we can start
seeing correlations here between this
data and we can start coming up with
hypotheses as to why those correlations
exist and we do so because they're all
sharing us say a common axis in this
case it's time is the x axis here of
course is geographical data this is from
the 1960 United States Census I know
it's really hard to tell but I'm
actually from the United States and this
is this is shows every county in the US
there's I think about 2000 counties in
the US there's a lot of this is a lot
even in aggregate this is a heck of a
lot of data but what it shows is
concentrations of high-income families
in each county and concentrations of low
income families in each county the
darker shades represent high
concentrations lowered lighter shades
represent low concentrations so on the
top that's our our poor families
low-income families dark red means lots
of poor families those counties light
bread means very few and on the bottom
of these are high-income families so
there's a lot of rich people in southern
for neon the southwest part of the US
the very few rich people in the
southeastern part of the US
they almost correspond to each other but
not entirely there's uh there are
counties in Alaska for example that have
a high percentage of high income
families and a high percentage of low
income families there's appears to be no
middle-class at least 1960 very little
middle class at that time and in fact
the the where I come from where I
recently moved from Detroit to Chicago
to big Midwestern cities
well Detroit is not doing very well
financially but I can look at this map
and I can see that it seemed to be doing
pretty darn well in 1960 it seems it's
fallen on hard times over the last 50
years this map will probably look very
different if it were drawn today the
point of this is that there is a lot of
data that we can just take in very
quickly that human beings have a love
the ability to look at I mean this is
millions of pieces of data but even
aggregates it's thousands of pieces of
data and because we're using shades our
eyes can really quickly pick light
shades dark shades in a way that if they
had chosen the designers of this graphic
it's chosen to use like let's say blue
for low concentration and orange for
high concentration probably not so much
but shades light and dark so even we're
colorblind we could see that other
there's this graphic this is Edward
Tufte calls this the greatest data
visualization ever created it's created
by a French engineer named Charles
Minard and it is it's actually a map a
map of Russia and it shows the advance
on and retreat from Moscow by the
importer in Apulia near the end and the
poliana quarry it has a couple of lines
here this tan line at the top right here
is a represents the route that Napoleon
and his men took as they marched
eastward toward Moscow so here is the
Polish Russian border right here over
here on the far right side as the is the
city of Moscow this is the route as they
marched eastward a few proofs branched
out here and and then this black line
below is their retreat their march away
from Moscow back into Poland and towards
the rest of Europe the thickness of each
line is proportional to the number of
troops than the
Oh Liam had at each point now knowing
just that you can look at this picture
and you can see that this was a disaster
for Napoleon Napoleon entered Russia
with almost half a million men and his
expectation was that he would overwhelm
his enemy with superior numbers and live
off the land that's what he had done by
conquering the rest of Europe
prior to this but that didn't work out
that way he doesn't does anybody what
happened any Russians and they were
audience I would tell him it happened
winner is a factor so armed are you
Russian good man so the Russians they
were badly outnumbered so rather than
engaging him directly in battle they
retreated and as they retreated they
destroyed their farms and their towns
and their livestock and they stretched
Napoleon's supply lines so thin that he
really didn't lose that many men to
Russian bullets but he lost a huge
number of men to disease and starvation
and suicide and desertion and you can
see that you can clearly see this by the
time he reached Moscow that half a
million men was barely a hundred
thousand men and when they left about a
month later though the trip back was
even worse because the trip back is when
the bad winter starts and that we could
see that down here this there's an extra
line down here showing the temperature
on the dates during the way back back I
know it's the numbers are very hard to
read but down here Oh November 26 at
least a minus 40 degrees which might be
Fahrenheit it might be Celsius but it
doesn't matter it was minus 40 degrees
and this hundred thousand men they left
with even with reinforcements arriving
was down to ten thousand ninety percent
attrition these numbers just jump out at
you when you know what these things do
it's there's a huge amount of
information packed into this small
amount of ink being used I think you can
see why Tufte loved this visualization
on a single axis Charles Minard has
managed to plot number of troops
position of troops direction of movement
time
and temperature lots of information and
we can make comparisons to come up with
hypotheses as to why correlations exist
between all this data okay
that's some good stuff let's talk about
some of the bad things that you can do
with visualizations and then mine of
Edward Tufte the worst thing you do with
your data visualizations is to lie to
your viewers now in the United States
ROM front we have adopted an Australian
named Rupert Murdock Murdock he has a TV
station called Fox News and sometimes
they stretch the truth here's an example
of it this is we're having a
presidential election in the US right
now you probably don't read about it at
all but we but it's a big deal to us and
this is actually from the last
presidential election President Obama
was running for a second term and so
they Fox News put this graphic up to
plot out unemployment rate during that
time there's a few problems with this
one is that the zero axis is not on
there so fluctuations look very large
but the real big problem here the reason
I say this is a blatantly wrong is this
number 8.6 the very last number is
actually plotted at the same level as
9.0 in a plot of above eight point eight
eight point six is actually the lowest
number on this graph and yet it's
plotted as one of the one of the highest
numbers visually it's hard to imagine
that they weren't trying to mislead
people by you know hiding the fact that
the unemployment had dropped at the very
end of this graph in context because
they have they did not endorse Obama
during that election here's another one
here this is from a mining company whose
mining company exists anymore but this
was an annual report of a mining company
showing net income over the course of
five years it's not at all obvious when
I look at this that this number right
here is a negative number they had this
country actually lost money during one
of those years and the reason it's not
obvious at all is because they've chosen
to show that that negative eleven
thousand dollars as a really tall
vertical line and they've also chosen to
omit
zero from this graph so again I think
this is deliberate but the problem is
that when I notice something like this
it causes me to call into question every
number and every visual is every chart
in this graphic which is probably the
opposite effect they were hoping to
achieve by doing this uh here's another
one this is from the New York Times and
this may actually I don't think is
deliberate but it's still wrong
still misleading very misleading this is
from the I need a little more backstory
I'm gonna give you a lot of history here
is that okay so this is in the 1970s and
1980s we had an energy crisis we
suddenly desired sight at least in the
United States that we were very
dependent on foreign fuel consumption
and we better stop driving these
gigantic cars that's all we did we drove
big long cars with the Corinthian
leather and they got hoards portable gas
mileage and so the United States
government stepped in and said car
companies you must build more build and
sell more fuel-efficient cars buy so
we're gonna do is we take the fuel
economy of every car you sell add them
all up and divide by the number of cars
and that number had better be X and if
it's not X if it's above X then there'll
be penalties that's pretty harsh so it
was they had never done that before that
was that was the bad news for car comers
the good news was they had some time to
adjust and that's what this is Shawn
here it said that in 1978 that number
the average miles per gallon of every
car sold had to be 18 miles per gallon
it would go up a little bit every year
19 and 20 and 22 etc until it reached 27
and a half 85 so this graph is that
lines get bigger these numbers get
bigger totally makes sense except that
if you look at this line right here
representing 18 and this line
representing 27 and a half they're not
at all proportional 27 half yes is
bigger than 18 but it's not it's not as
much bigger as this line suggests than
this is so it's misleading you could
argue that this picture does show the
the direction of change so so what if
it's although the magnitude is off by a
little bit but is it off by a little bit
I mean how much is off by that's that's
a question
we start to ask for some this is
something that Edward Tufte acum came up
with a measurement for it was my
favorite name of any ratio in all of
Statistics he aim of the way to measure
this he called it the lie factor and the
lie factor simply the size the effects
shown in the graphic divided by the size
the effect in the data that that graphic
is supposed to represent ideally should
be one now this is a hand-drawn grass so
if it's off if it's not quite one that's
totally forgivable but it should be
close to one at least and in this
particular graphic the data increased by
53% quite a bit amount and from eighteen
to twenty seven half but those liens
increased by seven hundred and eighty
three percent so this thing is lying to
us almost fifteen times over it's it's
not off the magnitude is not off by a
little bit it's up by a lot which is the
problem it's a lie but I said originally
I didn't think this was deliberate I'm
curious I could be wrong I don't know
the people that created this at the New
York Times but does anybody have any
theories why something will be that
wrong other than they totally want to
mislead their audience yeah for the
graphical effect that's my theory as
well so you said you said they went
through gravel and I think that's right
I think what happened is that the person
that created this graphic was not the
automotive correspondent he was not a
statistician he was not an engineer he
was an artist the responsibility for
creating this picture was moved away
from the people who understood the data
the automotive reporting department into
the art department because the New York
Times decided that it was more important
for this to be pretty than for it to be
right which is dangerous in my opinion
it's it's because it's a lie and it's a
lie even if it's unconscious if they
didn't mean to do it it's still wrong
it's misleading us here's what the truth
looks like it's yeah went up but not
nearly at the rate that that picture
showed here's another one that's wrong
for a different reason this is showing
the decreasing number
of family practitioners in the u.s. or
in California for three degree or from
1964 to 1990 this axis is it not
proportional but I don't think that's a
big problem here the big problem here is
that the representing this number 27%
16% and 12% by these shrinking doctors
the big problem with this picture is
that there's they've chosen to to
represent us a one-dimensional data
point as a two dimensional object and
that object is actually varying by both
its height and its width so as you
learned in elementary school the object
the size of an object isn't proportional
to both its height and its width so if
they both change then the size will
change with both of them so even though
the the height of this doctor is about
twice the size of the height of that
doctor he's about four times the size an
area as that doctor is so just simply
because they've chosen to represent one
dimensional data points as two
dimensional objects this is a live
factor of almost four and if we take
this here's another example I think this
is from Time magazine this is here
they've they've actually tried to draw a
three-dimensional picture to represent
the price of oil during each year and if
we take the metaphor that presenting to
us then three-dimensional objects of
course the size of them is proportional
to their height and their width and
their depth and so these these barrels
of oil are increasing extremely you know
order of magnitude taller than you would
expect as far as I know this is a record
live factor and I again I don't think it
was deliver I think they thought three
dimensional let's make it pretty let's
and this is the way it came out this is
the cost of focusing on aesthetics over
accuracy here's one this is from the
London Times there's actually much more
accurate here this is one I'm sorry luck
because it uses both real and nominal
that dollar values which was a big deal
the time period presented here was a
period of high inflation so there was a
big difference between the real dollars
are dollars that are adjusted for
inflation
anytime you used to have money over a
extended period of time you should
always adjust it for inflation
period here's another one this is a
graphic showing the Commission's paid to
travel agents for four different
airlines for three different time
periods and for each of these four
arrows you can see that they went up for
the from period one to two went up and
turn period two or three went down that
happened for all four of these airlines
what's not at all obvious here is that
this third period is a six-month period
the other two are 12-month because of
course it went down it was only half as
long it's not it's not obvious at all
whether it went down proportionately
it's really what they should have done
is either annualized that third period
or split these other two up into six
months or is it stands now it's pretty
much useless that that third period so
it went down so what let's see context
context is a really important here's an
example this is the number of traffic
deaths in the state of Connecticut that
occurs a state in the United States and
it's there's two points here 1955 and
1956 I'll call up but I've actually
omitted the zero axis here just I'm not
trying to emphasize the slope of the
line just simply the fact that they went
down but they reduced from 325 to about
270 or 280 I guess during that year and
the reason those two dates were chosen
is because that's when Connecticut
started to strictly enforce speed limits
prior to that time I think they had
speed limits but they weren't strictly
enforced and it looks like enforcing
speed limits saves lives it kind of
makes sense but does it we don't really
know we can't infer that from this
graphic because there's really no
context we don't know what happened
before 1955 we ran from 1956 this
graphic could look like this or this or
this we're only looking at two points
and in fact we would draw different
conclusions depending upon what the
graphic looked like in fact the data of
the full data will looks like this
it was trending upward prior to 1955 and
after 1956 it went down and it continued
to go down so this is actually with this
context here added this is pretty strong
evidence that driving for some people to
drive slower will stabilize
and here's another here's even more
context these are the states that are
contiguous to Connecticut and these are
the deaths per hundred thousand because
many of these states are have a lot more
people than Connecticut and you can see
in these other states the number of
deaths after 9656 either remained level
or went up Connecticut is the only one
that was significantly read reduced
number of traffic deaths so the context
here provides a lot more information
than just a couple of points all right
I'm gonna pause here just reiterate some
of the things I talked about so far if
you're working with data keep your data
proportional don't don't keep your live
factor to one don't lie with your data
and you do so by keeping your data
represented proportional to your data
and one way to avoid that is with the
don't use two dimension or three
dimensional data visualizations to
represent one dimensional data I should
point out that bar charts
those are two-dimensional objects they
don't have that problem because the
width of a bar does not change it's only
when the width and the height change
they both changed that we have this
problem adjust for inflation over any
extended period of time and provide
context pause here for questions any
questions so far
data Inc this is a concept that goes
back to when we used to print you guys
probably remember this but we used to
print stuff on paper we'd read it to
chart out we'd all have these these
inkjet printers and at home and laser
printers at work and print it all out
well we don't do that anymore we look at
stuff on screen usually but we still
think conceptually the dark parts are
the ink and there's something called the
data ink ratio this is another dimension
of tough tease the data ink divided by
the total ink is the the data ink ratio
and the data ink is the part of the ink
the dark parts that directly represent
data so the most this can ever be is one
if all the ink is dating your goal
should be to maximize this ratio within
reason and I'm gonna talk about what
that means within reason but you're
probably maybe asking yourself well all
right well if the data ink is the part
of the chart that directly represents
data what else is there what else is
there's other ink on the page what could
there be and so let's talk about that
for one one thing that could be
redundant data if you got the same data
represented multiple times that only one
of those is data egg the rest of it is
kind of wasted it's a distraction so
here's an example here this is a bar
chart so bar charts aren't perfect
they're not really efficient and this is
just one point it represents a number
35.9 and let's count the number of ways
that represents that whether this
visualization represents 35.9 first we
have a vertical line here that's 35
point 19 is tall another one over here
also thirty five point nine us so this
bar right here at the top is 35 point
nine us from the x-axis the shade of the
area 35 point and I'm Yours tall the the
number is 35 point nine units from the
x-axis and it is of course the number is
in fact the number thirty five point
nine there's a lot of redundant
information in this so it has a very low
data ink ratio and I'm gonna go through
that same exercise here but a lot of
people fall in love with 3d graphs
well 3d graphs there's a lot of ink here
there's a lot for the mind to absorb
just to get that one number and so the
idea of keeping the data ink ratio high
is to remove distractions and focus on
the data as much as you can
and this is not a good way to do it this
is the 3d graphics tend to be very bad
at that so that's we're done the data
metadata metadata sometimes is important
but it isn't data it is a ink that's
that is about that it maybe tells part
of the story about the data so here's an
example here doesn't really matter what
we're adding here but it's a scanner
diagram with a trend line through it on
some graph paper and what's the data
here who can tell me what the data is
the data Inc the dots the dots or the
dating everything else is metadata and
it's it could be important but it's not
data only the dots of the data what
happens if we remove some of this like
for example what if we remove some of
the gridlines I'm gonna show that you
get theirs before there's after this I
think it's way better I don't have the
distraction of all those gridlines that
data jumps out at me I've also it's
probably I don't think it tell on the
screen but those lines they used to be
black and now they're light gray and
this is a lesson that if anybody
remembers using like the very first
spreadsheets for Windows Lotus and Excel
and Quattro Pro they have borders
between the cells and those borders in
the first versions were black but now
they're not now they're grey because the
people that created those spreadsheets
realized those borders not the data the
numbers of the data the borders are
metadata de-emphasize the metadata that
makes the data jump out more in fact
maybe we don't even need those we could
get rid of them the data jumps out even
more maybe we don't need the top and the
right border maybe we don't need all the
numbers along the left side and on the
bottom maybe fewer numbers less ink
means the data jumps out more let's take
it a step further what if we remove the
trend line that's metadata that's not
data I can see the data better but in
this example I think the trim line adds
something to it I think it emphasizes
this a linear relationship I'm gonna put
it back
so without the trend line by data ink
ratio goes up but I'm gonna put it back
even though it lowers my data a great
show because I want to I want that
information that's why I talk about this
is an iterative process I talk about
let's
increase that ratio within reason here's
another one this is actually by Linus
Pauling Linus Pauling is a great admirer
of his he has a Nobel Prize in Physics
and peace the only person to have both
those Nobel Prizes just amazing man and
he got it check it out no grim lines he
replaced them with these little plus
signs instead this is the atomic volume
versus the atomic number for dozens of
elements the periodic table but he'd
really need those plus signs get rid of
them why not get rid of some of the
lines like this I think this is better
now in this case he's drawn some lines
here these lines are actually the rows
in the periodic table that represent the
the number of shells of electron if I
remove those we lose a lot of
information I would definitely put those
back in that that provides a lot of
information and then he's even labeled
or whoever created this adjustment here
has labeled the first element and the
first atomic number in each row so each
one of these has common characteristics
its most important to group them
together so maybe we could look maybe
Linus Pauling could learn something from
us I actually have a degree in
biochemistry that's that's what nobody
knows that about me except for you guys
so here's another so we saw this before
this was the train schedule and it has
actually probably now see a lot of
problems with this train schedule but
one thing that isn't obvious is there's
a problem with it what if a train is in
transit at midnight if that happens now
we have to our eyes have to move over
here to find out the exact schedule
which is hard you should never have
viewers for students to move their eyes
over multiple parts of a graphic we can
solve that problem by significantly
reducing the data Inc ratio so I told
you we should we should increase the
data in grayscale but in this case if we
reduce it by copying half the graph over
to the right that solves that problem
now you're probably thinking well we
could probably offset that by removing
some of these gridlines which is true so
there's a way of helping that as well
all right some principles about the
section we just talked about I think
think about the data and what is the
data here what is the data it can show
the data show that it is show the data
this part of tough is writing is what
changed my work more than anything else
I when I was a consultant I had a lot of
people that would come to me and say hey
we've got this application we build our
whole business on this Excel spreadsheet
and and we need to either but it's good
it's growing too big for Excel so we
want you to rather than you know ASP
sequel server or whatever it is and but
we want you to make it look just like
Excel because our people are used to
Excel we don't have to retrain them and
so they would have these mock-ups with
all these grid lines all over it and all
this extra ink and I'll see you know
what if we got rid of all these grid
lines oh we can't get rid of those
they're our people they can't they'll
freak out there used to though well if
we been them grade you know got rid of
like every other one we'd have that
conversation it really changed the way I
was doing not just in terms of creating
charts and graphs but changes in terms
of changing the user interface because
all these things are just distractions
is this metadata this redundant data
alright so think about the data and
think about the data Inc in the data
integration what's not data get rid of
nondating get rid of redundant get rid
of metadata but every time you do that
this is iterative process take a step
back and take a step back and say is it
better it was not there put it back but
chances are it is better chances are you
have a lot of extra ink in your
visualization after you've hit next next
finish vibrations read over time till
6:40 Invitrogen less of a problem now
than they were back when we had remember
we're pretty often laser printers we'd
have stuff like this you know black and
white laser printers we'd use things
like this and people would look at
they'd have seizures and stuff like that
because there's a real a very real
effect it's called a moiré a effective
if you stare at this thing it looks like
it's moving and epileptic people
actually literally would there would be
problems for them and even if you're not
only come with scrap like this is just
impossible
let me see here here's an example here
so I look at this one here I really hate
the fact that this has a legend this is
another example I look up and look down
again and see where everything is so if
I look at like the bottom part of it
here I see oh those are diagonal lines
or those are unfinished oils no no
unfair soils are diagonalized going this
way those must be the crude oil here's
another example here same sort of thing
this was the number of news stories
printed during the 1972 presidential
election and I've got to figure out
inflation what kind of you know diagonal
line is inflation versus unemployment so
on it's really hard to read it some of
these things they're they're diagonals
that are close together or yeah micron
further apart don't do that this is much
better colors are better to represent
assuming that your your users aren't
color blinding if you know your audience
you want to think about that but really
labeling directly is the best way to do
this if you can labor your things
directly that's way better than a legend
and then even better than this actually
one of my audience members I gave this
talk about a year ago somebody so why
don't you just sort those and that way
you can tell like competence and
inflation they'll go back the other one
it was hard to tell which one was higher
but you put them to sort them if you
think about what's what natural kind of
natural question is what people ask in
this case it's pretty obvious that why
access the percent of articles is the
number they want about sort by that
number and be able to very quickly see
which is the highest one what's the most
important one charge drunken ducks those
are the same thing this is stuff that
it's not even metadata it's just it's
just decorations that people throw on
just to make things pretty it was named
after a tough D named that this this
ducks after this building in Flanders
New York that is shaped like a duck for
no other reason than that people will be
driving down the road and say oh look
there's a building it's shaped like a
duck let's go check it out
it's just a call attention to itself
there's nothing about the duck shape
that makes it better as a building and
anything about your graphics that
doesn't make it better as a graphic you
should throw away this one right here
somebody try to get clever I think they
were they're making
the the curved lines to emphasize the
downward slope of this graph but now I
don't even know whether I should be
looking at the left point or the right
point of it
stuff like this here they're using
colors instead of shades to represent
the values the high and low values same
thing here they're possible to read and
this oh wait this is this is a real
graphic this is from an educational
journal this is there's only five points
of data in here oh it has a look at this
it is the five different years it is the
percent of students in college who are
under 25 and older 20 over 25 so I guess
there's 10 points of data but if you add
them up there once if you had 5 of them
you could just subtract one and you get
the other five and they've chosen to
show these points of data with just what
five different colors and these curves
I'm convinced these curves mean
absolutely nothing the three-dimensional
aspect of it means nothing at all and
then even the fact that these numbers I
know this to be true and I still have
trouble grasping at that this for a
given year this number Plus this number
always equals a hundred percent this
number Plus this number they always
equal hoursa I know this to be true I
still don't see it in the graph it
doesn't jump out at me it's just really
really hard to read this graph and I was
looking at this graph it's I it came out
of this educational journal that in
Tuffy's book he quoted it
I was wondered if the guy that created
that graphic was in a bookstore one day
and came across his own picture in there
and for a second before you read the
text thought it was very flattering but
it's not
I started thinking what's a better way
to depict the same data here and I came
up with I think the best way to depict
this data it's just like that this is
actually really simple data small data
sets you might not need any kind of
visualization we could have a column
here that's a percent of students over
25 and there just be a hundred minus
that but still these are you don't
necessarily need visualizations all
right a couple other things here
multi-functioning graphical elements
these are these were important this
isn't always possible in whatever tools
you have I thought they were really
clever so I'm gonna throw a few of them
out here these are the number of troops
that were
deployed during World War one a clever
deaf sergeant with a typewriter created
this this graphic and it is not only the
data points themselves actually are the
divisions they were deployed to France
during that time so you can actually
look at the data not only see them going
up but you can see which data is is
which divisions were being deployed so
the data increase she was very high in
this one
same thing here there's nothing there's
a rule that says that you have to have
everything projected down onto the
x-axis there's no rule says you have to
have lines on the x and y axis in this
case rather having points here projected
out of the axis they the points
themselves are the data and there's also
no rule that says you have to have
equidistant values on each axis so in
this case we actually have the data you
do not to do any interpolation that data
is actually here on this data density is
a concept here again this is something
that there's a formula for it but I
don't think I think it's meaningless
when we talk about seeing things on
screen because we don't really know the
area of the graphic but the point about
data density is that you should not be
afraid to have high data density in your
graphics I'm just practicing good good
practices about data visualization human
beings can take in a lot of data so this
is obviously a very low data density
graphic is only a few pieces of
information on there and this is a high
density it's got the weather information
for every single day in New York City
it's got a high and low temperature it's
got information for precipitation for
the year and the actual this year versus
the normal every single month it's got
the relative humidity every single day
there's tons of information in here and
you can see you know oh look it's hotter
in the summertime and cooler in the
wintertime it's weakened as human beings
zoom in and get a lot of information in
the zoom out see it very quickly we
could process a lot of information it's
as if it's preserved presented really
well this is even more information this
is sunlight data so cloudy days are
represented by this it's backwards in my
opinion it should be the dark part
should be the sunlight whereas the
lights are should be the cloudy but in
this case dark is is the sunlight that's
every hour of every day these dashed
lines are sunrise and sunsets so
obviously
in the nighttime but even the daytime a
lot more there are a few cloudy days in
June and July as an evidence by this
there's just a lot of information we can
zoom into and zoom out and see trends
small multiples are ways if you don't
have access to animation you want to add
an extra dimension geograph you can
repeat the same graphic multiple times
and that shows instead of just two
dimensions it has a third dimension to
it so this is the age of fish being
caught out of Northern European streams
and you can see right here at 1908 1909
that same graphic it's essentially the
same graphic with data from different
years and you can see it's shifting to
the right indicating that the fish
they're being caught are older and these
these streams are not being overfished
this is the same thing this is the
graphic of the age of your friends these
are the when you're 15 years old all
your friends are between 15 and 29
basically when you're 20 in your college
you're basically you know all your
friends live down the hall from your
dorm and that's tends to be true so
right here you've got friends at your
own friends plus you have your parents
friends right here we have basically you
have your own friends all your friends
are your own age because you're not
living with your parents anymore
and then as you get older then you start
to get your friends and your kids
friends and then they get really old and
your friends start to die off and now
suddenly there's your 70 years old and
you don't you just don't know that 87
year old people so this kind of this
this is an example of seeing that trend
over time every one of these things has
the same X and y-axis they've just met
they've just changed one variable on
here I had here's another one this is
there's a lot of data here this is from
consumer reports Consumer Reports rated
a bunch of different make and models of
automobiles and that's what each one is
rectangle is the difference is the
chevrolet chevy malibu and a Datsun
something or other Ford Granada and each
one of these is potential trouble spots
each row is a potential trouble spot so
air conditioning and body exterior and
body interior so on and then each one of
these columns is the year it's from 76
to 81
what they've done is these circles
represent if it's a white circle
unfilled encircled that means that's
there's very few problems with that so
let me grab one of these things here so
the air conditioning on a 1978 Plymouth
Volare was really good it was really
reliable but hardly any problems with
that
but on a the seam I'm having trouble
reading this but I think that's the body
rust maybe on the Plymouth Volare the
1978 Plymouth farm my preliminary it's
all filled in so there's a lot of
problems with that and then of course
partially filled ones are in between
there the more dark they are the more
problems they had so all this data here
we can look at it you're going to step
back and say oh it looks like this car
right over here this Mercedes Benz well
that was a pretty reliable car I mean
probably paid more for that that's why
it's expensive where's this over all
this car right here this Plymouth Volare
was probably kind of a crappy car it had
a lot of you buy it maybe you'd buy it
for cheaper but you'd have a lot of
repair bills on it and this one right
here is in between this one seem to have
gotten worse over time this Toyota
Corolla in the earlier days it was good
but the last couple of models were not
so good again a lot of information to be
the spot really quickly and we could see
differences between them because they're
they're essentially the same graphic
over and over again and I have actually
let me show you this if my internet
works I brought this up here this is now
that we have again not a tools talk but
there are tools that will do this this
is immigration shown through animation
so if you're they could have done this
with small multiples these are showing
the the paths that immigrants are taking
so the big blue circles represent
countries where there's a net increase
in population people are coming to those
countries and it looks like Australia
and United States people are coming to
those countries and then this is areas
like Syria people are leaving those
countries the red represents people are
littering there's a war in Syria and so
a lot of refugees are fleeing there and
you can actually see where they're
coming from through these the movement
of these dots is that people are leaving
Oh looks like what Eastern Europe and
going to Russia for example that's a
common spot or they're leaving Western
Europe and they're going to Canada we
could do something similar to that with
multiples just have multiple graphs but
with animation it's even more powerful
all right good time for a quick review
context come on Paul in biochemistry
principles vibrations ducts
let's see almost there Oh what's in some
of Edward Tufte these inventions want
one of which became really really
popular so if used sparklines at all
that's actually Edward Tuffy's invention
sparklines are great for financial data
because they have a there they're able
we're going to stack them up really fast
so we're in a small space the idea the
kind of spark line is it shows the
volatility of a trend over time but it
doesn't show every data point so there's
no x-axis there's no y-axis it just
calls out significant points like the
beginning the ending the high and the
low and as a result of that it's really
compact and you'll see in papers like
The Wall Street Journal will list stock
prices or there are commodity trading
prices over time and they'll be able to
stack them all at once you see the
trends upwards or downwards and you can
see the volatility of them and compare
them really quickly and in fact in excel
you can actually create a sparkline
graph and stick it inside of a cell
which is really kind of cool it's
extremely high density ratio and so you
can you could put a lot of spark lines
on top of these than for comparison for
small multiples there's another graph I
just mentioned just cut for historical
purposes but I hardly ever see it in the
wild it's a slope graph and as the I
tough T invented this and the idea is
just to show some trends the direction
and magnitude of trends over time so in
this case between 1970 1979 and
I think gross current receipts of
governments during those two time
periods
this one here somebody sent me this one
I had never actually seen one in the
wild I mentioned that during a talk and
somebody somebody sent me a picture of
this one I thought was better it's the
consumer confidence of certain I'm sure
it's just from the US but it's for
between during the decade between 2000
to 2002 2011 between those nine years
how did consumer confidence did it go up
or down for all these public
institutions like confidence and the
police went down during that period comp
visits and church and religions went up
what some things went way down banks
went way down the confidence the
president will weigh down the criminal
justice system went up so I mean it was
just I don't see it's a lot in the wild
I showed for historical purposes but
those bar graphs those are extremely
popular all right
more tickets this is the same wave of
the whole thing we're getting near the
end here I see some people taking
pictures I'll make these slides
available they're happy to do so all
right don't lie children maintain
graphical integrity there's I know
there's some people in the room that
your job your boss is telling you to lie
so here's the gears the data make it
show this but and I'm not here to judge
but be aware that this can be a problem
this that if you're if you're doing it
to deceive your users they it may have
the opposite effect that you want and if
you're doing it to entertain your users
if you want to make it more snazzy
because you don't think you don't
respect your users you don't think the
data itself is interesting enough maybe
you need to get more data maybe even get
better data that to make the data itself
Porcupine rather than dressing up with
pretty pictures but be aware of that
that lying is bad ok it can be it can be
self-defeating
not just not just morally bad but could
be somebody think about the data in
Croatian like I said this is this is the
the biggest effect it had on me as a
software developer is that iterative
process maximize the data Inc ratio
what's data what's not data
and within reason do that iterative
process if it's if it's just decoration
just throw it out there's no point to it
at all don't worry about I didn't say
this earlier about it don't worry about
if there's some people say don't mix
text and images together don't put too
much text on your pictures I totally
disagree that I think it's just fine to
put descriptive text to label your
graphics as long as it adds to it and I
think it's probably okay to mix graphics
in the middle of your paragraphs I think
it's fine to just do it intelligently
doing a way that's gonna be clearer to
your users multi photographic elements
sometimes that's not possible but it's
kind of cool if you can do it
just keep that data in graciously Ohio
and avoid legends avoid anything that
makes it more complicated if your users
are moving their eyes back and forth
that's bad and don't be afraid to have
really dense data it's more important
that you've structure that that prop
your your graphics clearly than it is
that you remove all this extra stuff we
as human beings we could see a lot of
data we could we could process a whole
lot of data let's return to this this is
the graphic of Napoleon's March
Charles Menard was the guy that created
he was a French engineer and he could
have just done whatever was the
nineteenth century equivalent of next
next finish if he wanted to he could he
was obviously a very good artist he
could have dress it up and stand up and
made it pretty but he didn't these
graphics here don't show they don't tell
the story in the way that Menard chose
to tell the story and that that's what I
want you to think about as you're
building your visualizations no matter
what tools you're using start thinking
about after you hit next next finish
take a step back and say do I need all
of this ink is some of it in that attic
I get rid of this can I get rid of that
can I simplify this and increase my data
ink ratio and if I do so the data will
jump out more I may even have room to
put another series in there along the
same axis so I can start doing
correlations and once I start seeing
correlations then I can start coming up
with hypotheses
why those correlations exist and this
this is information this isn't just data
this is power and your users will thank
you and my name is David G yard and I
have a Technical Evangelist for
Microsoft and I thank you
there's a party in about nine minutes so
if you leave now I won't oh I totally
understand but if you want ask many
questions I'm here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
