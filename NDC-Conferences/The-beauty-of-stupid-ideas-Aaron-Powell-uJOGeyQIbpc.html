beauty
I just wanted to start off this talk
with the warning the following slide
deck is going to contain examples of bad
code and poorly thought out ideas do not
try this on a production system I'm a
trained professional
it was professional on that one I won't
open this talk with a bit of a story
this is me in 2013 I was getting married
I want to be clear that that wasn't the
stupid idea
my wife saw me putting together this
slide deck you saw this photo from our
wedding in there and she's like why is
there a photo of us at our wedding in
the slides I told her of which talk was
for us like why is he gonna talk about
stupid ideas so I want to be very clear
upfront that getting married wasn't the
stupid idea that's why that's why it's
in the slide son oh I'm sure she's gonna
watch this video at some point but we
did after our wedding we did what can we
tend to do on a offer a wedding we went
on a honeymoon we went away for a week
we went to a rainforest retreat in
northern New South Wales isolated
there's no no real phone reception or an
internet really anything like that so I
did what any good IT person would do I
took my laptop you might be starting to
kind of formulate where this kind of bad
idea it could be coming from well the
reason that I did was I said we're going
to be a wave by isolate oh I wasn't
gonna have any outside distractions and
there was this really popular new
JavaScript framework that was or at
least it wasn't particularly new but it
was making a lot of traction
particularly in the Microsoft space
where I tend to play he might have heard
of it it's called angularjs it's it's
still kind of popular from what I can
gather but it was really starting to
make ways and there was one particular
feature that I found really interesting
about it and it was that it had
dependency injection built into it is
something that as a dotnet developer and
I'd spent most of my career writing down
eight applications I had kind of baited
into me that day I was a really good
thing because it made things like
testability a whole lot easier
and I'd been doing front-end development
for a while and I never kind of thought
of it
in that space that it was something that
could be could be needed but it was a
big selling point of angularjs and was
it's why that I saw it as a very popular
and interesting framework to get
involved with so there would be code
demos all around that you would find
like this and it had really interesting
things like you'd inject things like
doles scope and dollars locale here
which were these things that were coming
out of the the loosely described type
system with inside of angularjs and you
were able to resolve these and the way
it created the controller just magically
knew what dollars scope represented what
dolls locale represented based off of
how they worked and and what I found
really interesting was thing about how
did they actually work yeah because you
could write code like this and would run
in the browser and JavaScript doesn't
have a type system and that was what I
understood about dependency injection
that was how you did dependency
injections you needed to know about type
so you can know what to inject and it
also one thing that this kind of example
didn't really take care of was what
happens for a manifestation perspective
where these two things are no longer
called dollar scope and dollars locale
they'd become a and B or something
equally less obvious about what they
originally were and so then we would
look at things like the dolls in Jeff
property or we would pass in the array
where we'd have string representations
of all the arguments that we get
inserted now so I was it so it had been
bugging me for a few months at this
point like how this all kind of came
together how to work under the hood and
I really wanted to know but I simply
didn't have time I had a wedding that I
was at least I was pretending that I was
helping plan but let's be real I
probably wasn't really doing anything
constructive in that space we would just
we'd bought a house or there was all
this stuff going on I just didn't have
time to sit there and follow an esoteric
idea of how like how to write know this
in JavaScript how does it work inside of
angularjs but one lazy afternoon on our
honeymoon my wife was having a nap on on
the couch and I was like well time to
write some code so I cracked out of my
laptop and started playing around
thinking about how could this work and I
came across the the realize that the
function object with inside of
JavaScript has a two string property
oh sorry a two-string method what does
that method do so execute that method oh
hey I've got the original string or the
function as a string as was passed by
the the JavaScript runtime well that's
kind of interesting because if I've got
a string I can then introduce a regex
that can walk over that string and pull
it out this is the basic core of how it
takes that function in angular and turns
it into the arguments that you would be
passing in if you don't use the any of
the the more explicit dependency
injection options with inside of with
inside of angular now this actually
slightly simpler than the angular one
because doesn't take another counts of
putting comments with inside of between
the open and closed parenthesis and
stuff like that but at the end of the
day this was how it would work
so I wrote a things wife is still asleep
on the couch so I decided to write a
thing and publish it to github well at
least I've published it to you how when
we got back from our honeymoon so I
wrote an IOC container in JavaScript and
why I I as I said I'd been doing
front-end development for a couple years
at this point and and coming from a
background I knew all about IOC and why
I was valuable but I'd never found a
need for an IOC container in JavaScript
I had never needed one but I just ridden
one yeah and and at that time if I went
to any of my colleagues it was like hey
you know what we need we need to dice a
container in JavaScript they just look
at me go really no we don't there's no
need for an IOC container in JavaScript
but I've done it yay and so that was
like that was it was kind of a stupid
idea to sit down and do that and for no
value really whatsoever at the end of
the day no one needed this no one needed
this problem sold as a generic
general-purpose ioc container in
javascript but it's been really valuable
for me in kind of learning some of the
more advanced features of JavaScript and
in my day to day job it's been very
valuable for helping to illustrate
things in JavaScript like how you do
partial application on a function how do
you provide arguments
to pass that function around and and why
does that work and how that can be
valuable the internals of this artifact
is that I wrote it does a whole bunch of
that stuff but it does providing of
arguments and it starts then exploring
the idea of like function carrying which
is if you've done functional programming
that's obviously a very valuable thing
to understand and as I've started to
explore more and more about functional
programming I've understood a lot of the
concepts of there talking about there
because I I did in the language I was
familiar with for a problem I didn't
need to solve that I can now translate
into other languages other places that I
actually have problems that I want to
solve um also I learned that you
probably shouldn't write code on your
honeymoon and that's also why this was
probably not the best idea it was a bit
of a stupid idea
but at the end of the day it all comes
down to why and that's the crux of this
talk I want to talk about why we do
these sorts of things why we follow
stupid ideas and why we should encourage
people to embrace stupid ideas so back
to the introductions my name's Aaron
Powell I'm a consultant so this is me in
my day job you know consulting and all
that kind of cool stuff I work I'm from
Australia
if the accent hadn't given that away for
you just yet in Australia the
consultancy I work for it's called
ratify and we've worked with some of
Australia's largest banks I've worked
for some small startups companies that
have hundreds of developers companies
companies that have tens of developers
companies that have one developer I've
worked with with them all across that
that kind of space so I've seen a lot of
different working environments in a lot
of different ways that we can encourage
people motivate people to do a better
job and a part of being a consultant
part of being IT is constantly one of
wanting to learn and that's what doing
something like an IOC container and
JavaScript was all about it was it was
an exchange to learn I'm also a huge
Simpsons fan
and be prepared for a lot of Simpsons
images throughout the rest of this talk
so on to or back to bad ideas this time
I want to talk about gif and something
that I was theorizing and doing in the
ways of abusing yet as a source control
system so back in the the height of the
source control wars between git and
mercurial those dark days those dark
days we were seeing as soon as companies
like Microsoft sudden breaking it and it
was becoming a first class citizen
inside of things like TFS and then later
on V V STS and now they're pushing
things through to github and stuff like
that we're starting to see it become
more popular particularly in big
enterprise companies that were very
traditionally TF VC in TFS or SVN shops
and were very very regimented in the way
they worked but we were starting to see
a lot more opportunities to forget
coming up with inside of our clients and
that meant for me as a consultant I was
often going in and having to teach
people how to use git and these were
people that had potentially never used a
distributed source control system or in
some rare cases had never even heard of
source control before those were those
are the really fun ones to work with but
because I was doing a lot of training I
really wanted to understand how it was
working internally because while that
might not be the kind of thing I have to
explain to someone upfront if I could
talk about the really high level
concepts as well as the fundamentals and
I knew the fundamentals really well so
what are the basic building blocks of
git and how that all works if I knew
that kind of stuff I could talk to them
about why you would use the the get in
side of Visual Studio tooling or why I'd
be using SourceTree or any of the other
get GUI tools or then if they wanted to
go advanced in command line I could
explain all that stuff and relate it
back to things that they might be a lot
more comfortable with a lot more
familiar with rather than just focusing
on all these terminologies that were
throwing out there he's doing a pull
request and this is how you click
buttons and magic pull requests are all
happening for you and that kind of stuff
it also
I wanted to be able to go in and if
there was a problem the with the git
repository that someone had on their
machines the solution to that wasn't I
just deleted and clone it again because
that was too often the time the case
particularly someone that had never
worked with anything other than TFS if
they got to bad stage that's just easier
to delete and fix it up so I wanted to I
wanted to know the the underlying
workings of it so that I could help them
through that pain and potentially not
lose and not lose any work that they
might have done that has not been pushed
and things like that
oops wrong button so I had this idea
involving chess I used to play chess
when I was younger I was never
particularly good at it but it always
resonated quite nicely with the logical
part of my brain I so I was thinking
about how chess and get could work
together now bear with me because
remember this is a talk about stupid
ideas
so I see if every move could be
represented as a committing gear we
could then branch off every single move
you could then use the underlying data
structures the that work with inside of
gear to be shared across branches
because there's a finite number of moves
that can ever happen within chess or
there's a finite finite number of
layouts of pieces on a chess board and
the number of layouts that you as you
remove pieces off the board then you
you've got different ways that you can
achieve that same layout so you can
always so you could use the same
underlying data structure the the blob
is what it's called with inside of get
multiple times so you could then oh and
this was what I was theorizing was you
could then represent every potential
outcome and then just walk to get
branches and make it like a little bot
that would sit there and essentially
play chess against itself by traversing
and get branches to work out if it
played this move what were the potential
outcomes that it could get to at the end
of the game where is it going to be in
10 15 20 moves time because there that's
how chess a eyes tend to work is they
try and predict where they're going to
be well if you had every potential
outcome you could then work
every potential way the game go based
off of the move that you play I that was
the theory at least turns out that this
is a little bit more of a complex
problem than I was initially hoping it
would be initially initially
anticipating it turns out there's
actually a lot of moves that can be done
in chess a lot of potential outcomes of
a game somewhere between 10 to the power
port 42 10 to the power of 50 in one
Stack Exchange thread that's that's what
they're they theorized the potential
number of placements and outcomes based
off of those placements there's another
school thought that is that the number
of moves inside of chess is greater than
the number of atoms in the observable
universe so you're probably gonna run
out a hard drive space if you try and
model this in a git repository like I
said it was a good idea in theory I
talked to one of my friends works at
github and he's like hey yeah you could
probably do that I don't think it's a
good idea though so hey it was a stupid
idea so I thought I'll try something a
little bit simpler I'll go with
tic-tac-toe it's only two there's only 2
colors there's only 9 squares there's a
whole lot less number of moves that you
could actually potentially do alright so
how does it work and doing this I wanted
to said I wanted to learn the underlying
structures of get so we started off with
the gate hash object function Oh get out
and get hash object thing carrier if
they're called functions or not
so hash object it takes an input stream
you can take something from standard in
or in this case I'm actually reading it
from a file on disk so that file is
representing my game state my board as
it were the contents of this file is a
nine by nine and a set of whitespace
characters representing the style of the
game an empty board the - W flag says
that you're going to write this to the
get objects when you run hash objects so
you can hash object over an input stream
it will give you the char that you would
get
but in this case I want to actually
write that that creates a brand new blob
inside of a git repository done attached
to anything
it's just a it's just a bit of data than
sitting inside of gear it lives inside
of the dot get slash objects folder so
if you've ever poked inside of there
you'll see a whole bunch of folders
generally three characters in length
it's the first two digits or first two
characters of the the char that you've
got so in this case I would have a
folder called 27 and then inside of that
a file with the the rest of that file
Monica so 88 onwards so I've created a
blob that lives with inside of kid that
is not used anywhere the next thing we
want to do is we want to use that bomb
so I'm gonna use the update your Dex
command what this does is it takes the
shard that we've generated for that blob
previously and it adds that till you get
stage so if you do get add it's
essentially putting everything in that
stage but instead of using the files
that are on disk it's using a blob that
was previously created now and what I'm
doing with this blob is I want to
actually create a file with inside of
the it stage so I've created a file
called Tic Tac Toe XE oh sorry dot txt
not actually don't want to actually run
it so you'll notice that this file name
is different to the input file stream
that we've got so what I'm doing is I'm
creating something inside of get that is
just that it's just a file that it knows
about that I could restore from there
but it's not actually representing any
of the England's on disk I don't have
that file anywhere on my hard drive we
and this is where I started to learn how
git works internally it's actually very
similar to a UNIX file system I could
have cut in a Jurassic Park image of
it's a UNIX system but I didn't so
because this is a UNIX file system or
has a lot of similarities to a UNIX file
system I have to give the file that I'm
creating in that index some file system
attributes so it's readable and writable
and all that kind of stuff so that's the
case you throw that I've got there so
this I said it adds it to the stage and
then the next thing I need to do is I
need to start actually created that
faucet and I do that with a tree get
right tree takes what's currently in
your stage
creates a tree with inside of your gate
index that's how you'll get objects
again this ends up and you don't get
such objects for I will have a folder
called 90 and then a file inside of that
which is the rest of the information and
a tree is essentially a folder structure
so because this is sitting at the root
of of this particular git repository so
that will this tree represents like
slash in the file system but you would
you would then have multiple trees to
represent folders that are files with
inside of folders and stuff like that so
you would have a tree that has blobs
that have trees and so on and so forth
and that's how you would build up a
complex file system or a complex folder
structure with inside of kit so we've
now got our tree which points to a blob
which is now something we want to commit
so we want to create a git commit so I
used the commit tree command I take that
char from the tree that I created on the
previous slide I give it a message so
they get a lovely commit message and
then this gives me a shower of that
commit that's been created and there we
go congratulations you have just
committed one file to a git repository I
can then use that shower and use commit
tree again plus the previous commands
and pass that shot to a - P flag and
then I create that's giving it a parent
commit so I now have a commit that has a
parent so I could do different across
them I could then create a another
commit that has that makes commits
parent and so on and so forth and that's
how you start building out a branch if I
create another one that has that uses
the parent of an existing commit well
now I've I've branched from that point
in the the git repository going so on
and so forth I was this particularly
useful probably not I'm Addison
hand-rolled git repositories using just
hash object commit rewrite tree and
update index and not really the easiest
way to go about working with git
definitely not things like add commit
those sorts of things they're a whole
whole lot easier but now we know the
building blocks of how it works yeah we
understand the underpinnings of it
then you can if you know what's
happening at the at the base level a it
gets easier to start relating those
concepts you know why why do we have
files and folders and I've created a
file I've created a folder and then why
doesn't why can I add just that empty
folder into again index four because it
doesn't have any files instead inside of
there so it doesn't understand those
kinds of things where and that's a very
common one for someone that's come from
a TFS background well why can't I just
create that folder TFS tfv C more
accurately allows me to have an empty
folder with inside of my my source
control why can't I do that and get well
because it actually expects files inside
of there and folders don't really exist
they're just trees of object graphs and
that's as far as I got I actually only
got to about three moves in and wait
well this is just super tedious so I
decided to stop playing or stop writing
again in a git repository of on top of
just hash object and stuff and such so
you've probably never really necessarily
gonna use those commands directly but
knowing that they're there it can be
valuable so back to the like the
underlying theme that I'm hopefully
conveying throughout the this talk is
how do we motivate people with inside of
the organizations that we work with how
do we make our staff happy at the end of
the day we want to make sure that people
are happy where they work so that as so
they're less likely to leave that they
enjoy their job there that they giving
it their all and all those fluffy things
that we tend to say about about people
and working with inside of him
organizations but at the end of the day
we want to make sure that our staff our
colleagues are happy okay traditional
management will say that you throw money
at them that's that's how we make
someone happy the more money you pay
someone the more how they're happier
they're going to be at work right but
that's how that's how management works
isn't it I mean we are moving away from
this kind of mentality but I still don't
know a lot of people that have they're
purely motivated motivated by money
now that's there's nothing wrong we've
been motivated by money to do a better
job but the problem is that if someone
is purely motivate motivated by money at
work they're always gonna be chasing
money
someone's always gonna have more money
for them so they're going to follow that
rather than you know stay with your
company and try and do the best they can
have for you so this is commonly
referred to as the the carrot and the
stick type of management but what
research is telling us is that people
they just generally want to do a good
job they generally want to have fun at
the the place that they work that they
genuinely will just want to do a better
job than they did yesterday and this is
particularly in a creative industry like
IT people are going to want to be better
and continually improving themselves and
things like that
I was actually talking to a dev manager
at one of my clients about this talking
and what I was talking about here and
the care and the stick problem because
where we're working and working with him
and his team leads and he actually gave
me a really good anecdote that I'm
stealing for this talk and that is that
if you approaching management with a
carrot and stick mentality any
sufficiently large carrot can also be
used as a stick okay keep that in mind
so if we're trying to make a learning
environment and that's a way that we
motivate people how do we encourage
learning it comes down to trust not
necessarily the kind of trust that Hank
Scorpio is discern demonstrating here
but actual trust we want to give people
room to experiment with inside of a site
in a safe environment in a company that
they're happy and that management is not
going to make them feel bad if they
don't succeed in everything they they
try so don't discredit failure failure
is a great learning tool it is life in
general but particularly in IT you do
something that's why we refactor code
code we wrote yesterday is rubbish the
code we write tomorrow is amazing and
the code where I am today is it's going
to solve today's problem so really want
to give people room to learn the classic
adage that people a closing example that
people have
when you're talking about room to learn
is Google's 20% time now the jury is
kind of out at the moment whether Google
still does the 20% time some people say
it's 120 percent so you have to do 20%
on top of your day job but the idea of
the 20% time is giving their employees
time out of their day to day tasks to
explore to experiment to try things and
and follow ideas that they've always
wanted to follow with we've seen heaps
of really interesting projects coming
out of Google 20% time probably the
biggest example of that has been Gmail
Gmail started as a 20% project inside of
Google that has obviously become a bit
bigger than 20% time I think it's about
25% time now is used on Gmail but it's
been one of their most successful
successful platforms Latin is a great
example of a IT company in Australia
that's done very very well for
themselves and they have this program
that they run called shipit it's a 24
hour time window that you have to
deliver value to the company and this
can be done in many different ways
they've had it's been 24 hour bashes
against things like JIRA they've had
tools like the Jura Service Desk
actually started as a shepherd project
and then evolved into obviously
something that is now part of the the
JIRA platform there was a 20% project
oh sorry a shepherd project where they
went around and replaced all the light
bowls on the floor with energy-efficient
lightbulbs that's giving benefit for the
company long term because it's saving
money better for the environment those
kinds of things it could also be seen as
a social experiment maybe don't go and
just change all the light bulbs to green
to see if that has a positive outcome on
on your colleagues and your your
employees those kinds of things are
other ways you if someone said hey I'm
gonna replace every light bulb on the
floor it sounds like a great idea and
everyone's go yeah it sounds like a
stupid idea or you might have so many
management that goes go for it let's see
what happens and that's that's one way
to approach motivating people a company
I work for ratify we have similar to the
20% time is paid a time where we can
take paid leave essentially to work on
something to do
thing that we want up skill on we want
to learn we want to get better at we
want to come to a conference like this
and present we've had a number of open
source projects that people have built
using that 20% time because it was
something that they wanted to learn to
explore and out of that has come
something that they've felt is valuable
enough for other people to then run with
and publish up so I want to talk about
something that started for me from a PD
time that it was and something that
seemed relatively simple an idea when I
first started but at the same time it
was still a pretty stupid idea so what
if I said let's write our number system
in c-sharp do you point out that
computers actually kind of good with
numbers and that we probably don't need
to write our own number system yeah like
that's that's what computers do just
shake your head in walk away really like
and I'm like you're gonna write int in
c-sharp pretty sure they've done that
just saying do you remind me that it is
actually a really stupid idea and and
they're they these are these are common
things when I when I tell people hey
let's write let's write a number system
so we know how numbers work right right
like we know that if we add two numbers
together we get the sum of them at the
end of the day and we turn two plus two
is something around about five for a
sufficiently large value of two we get
five math nerd joke they're not enough
math nerds here I'm a little bit of a
math nerd but not enough of one to
really truly have appreciated the code
that I'm gonna walk through next so I
thought well you're creating your own
number system you can't be that hard can
it computers denied computers are really
good at it but sure I can I can totally
do this myself it it actually started I
was at a conference in Australia Jeff
Davis convey you a couple of years ago
and there was a presenter that was doing
a talk about surreal numbers it was in
amongst a kind of a talk like this about
it
crazy things and that he was he was
doing so it was talking about surreal
numbers so if there are any like really
big math nerds and all mathematicians in
the room I'm going to apologize for
probably the next ten minutes of this
talk where I just you know completely
threw things wrong about mathematics
because that's probably what I'm about
to do but surreal numbers is based on
the idea of working with sets of data so
we start off with like a an empty set
which represents zero so I'm just using
empty arrays and it has a left and a
right component to it so this is a it's
a it's a set that has two empty sets
that represents zero represents one we
have something on the left hand side
which is have an empty set so we have
one empty set on the left hand side that
represents one we have an empty set
inside of a side of a set inside of a
set which represents two and again this
is a positive value so it's on the left
hand side for negative values it's on
the right hand side and similarly and so
on and so forth so we basically
represent we can represent numbers as
these as these collections of sets all
right so I'm actually going to jump over
to the code to some code because at the
end of the day this is actually a
theoretically a technical talk so I want
to show a little bit of code at the very
least so I wrote a thing I wrote an
implementation of surreal numbers in in
dotnet and well by doing that I needed
to I had these two things that I said
with numbers so I needed to be able to
treat them like numbers if I created two
surreal numbers based off of some input
that I received
I like they should be equal to if there
were just in values that I was adding
together so if I take 0 &amp;amp; 1
I add them together I should get 1 or if
I take 1 and negative 1 and I add them
together I get 0 yeah I get
I guess it not enough to be always just
completely off the top my head but
enough that I'm pretty sure that this
code all works I mean the tests all pass
so yeah shipped that to production right
and because this is not necessarily you
like the surreal number is not
necessarily useful unless I can convert
it back to a real number that's how I
would then do a quality testing so I do
an example here and who had surreal one
to surreal to and that should be the
same as adding AMD okay so we have a
look at how that is implemented I do
some unboxing of the the two serial
numbers that have been passed in create
new instances of them the reason that
I'm doing that is because this actually
uses a whole bunch of mutable data
structures instead of immutable data
that is just through sheer laziness if
you want to do this properly you'd have
these as immutable things and then there
would be a lot more akin to the way int
and float and double and such work but
yeah this was this was not to ship to
production so we can there deal with the
fact that there's some hacks in there
essentially alright so we've got the two
values I'm gonna treat oh sorry we've
got there we've got our two values and I
want to look at is the right-hand side
of the operator a positive or a negative
value if it's a positive value we're
just gonna loop around and increment the
left-hand side of our alvaro operator
while decrementing the right-hand side
so essentially we're taking one from the
right and moving it to the left and we
keep doing that until we get to zero if
it's a negative if it's a negative
number we do the opposite but so
essentially we we decrease the left hand
side while increasing the right hand
side again walking back up to zero so I
I know how addition and subtraction
operators work yeah I learned that when
I was in when I was like five six years
old and that kind of stuff in it that
kind of mathematics is really simple
right you know how that works but it
wasn't until I sat down and wrote this
code that I really had that lie
moment of light oh wow that's right
that's that's how addition works it is
really just take something from here and
move it to here and subtraction is the
opposite I have a young son at home and
I know that at some point I'm gonna have
to help him with his maths homework I
now feel a lot more confident in my
ability to explain that to him in a
really simplistic manner that he's going
to be able to grasp when he's you know
three four five six and hopefully after
that he'll be smarter than me at maths
but that's how it works and then if we
expand that out into a multiplication or
division operator essentially that's
addition but inside of a loop if we if
we multiply two numbers together it's
actually a it's a it's addition n number
of times so we can do that that's that's
actually really simple it just builds on
top of the the addition operator that
we've got again I've got some little
shortcuts in here to check if something
is or isn't zero if it's zero then I
know I can bail early because I know
that zero multiple multiplied by
anything is going to return these zero
so I can just short-circuit that but I
could essentially prove that through my
own code if I remove that and then did
the multiplication at the end of the day
we're going to get down to zero anyway
on one of the by doing this recursive
operation the vision is a little bit
more tricky because you've got
remainders so it's fine if you're doing
like whole number division so like nine
divided by three but if you do 9 divided
by four well then like in surreal
numbers that actually gets really tricky
like how do you do deal with the
remainder and this is designed to
replace int not designed to place
doubles or floats or anything like that
okay so once we understand how we can do
things like you elementary arithmetic we
probably also want to be able to say is
one number greater than another number
or less than another number or less than
or equal to etcetera etc how do we
implement all of those well if something
is less than well it's definitely not
greater than or equal to that right so I
can that's that's how you do less than
it's just not greater than or equal to
is something greater than or equal to
something well it's less than or equal
to it right and the greater than or less
than operators cancel each other out the
equal side of that statement will then
match right and so that's her
if it's equal then it's definitely
greater than or equal to that as well
I'm pretty sure that this code all works
and then greater than is essentially the
the officer it's it's so it's not less
than or equal to so really at the end of
the day you only actually have to
implement one of those four test types
so I've just implemented less than or
equal to and we we clone our values I
check you if they're if they're negative
or zero and the other one is also the
solution Explorer if you other one is
positive or zero then this is just
short-circuit code so that I can bail
out early rather than having to actually
do the complex logic down below but it's
a lot of just testing something as
against zero and then is it positive or
negative and then process of elimination
to eventually determine is something I
who gets to zero faster that's that's
the final bit that we get to unlike line
ten and such this is just a race to zero
I realized that this is probably an
efficient because I decreased both of
them at the same time and one will hit
zero before the other but if I just race
this one to zero if it gets to zero
before that one gets to zero then then
we can bail out and then that's how we
determine if if for a pot if both of
them are positive numbers is it less
than or equal to and then obviously I
got a whole lovely test suite that
covers all of those things off my craft
slides so there we go that's how you
implement your own number system again I
push this up to github because you know
it it was really useful code that I saw
other people can learn from but yeah I
really did find out that computers are
pretty good with working with numbers
now if people had already told me that I
but I I now have proof myself I've
worked out why computers are really good
with numbers because someone a lot
smarter than me has worked out how to
write a number system that is a lot more
efficient than mine and built it a lot
more low-level then on top of the dotnet
runtime
but I said this is where I started to
understand a lot more about the things
that I just take for granted in the way
that number systems work that that
really negation less than greater than
and all those sorts of tests boiled down
to different combinations of the same
check and the value 0 and y 0 is such a
special magical number to deal with and
and y0 is really very important with
inside of mathematics and that
elementary arithmetic addition
subtraction multiplication division and
then I didn't kind of explore further
than those four operators but if you
think of things like power of operators
they're just recursions on top of
recursion on top of recursions on top of
addition at the end of the day it all
comes down to add or remove one really I
was giving this talk at ratify to to my
colleagues and one of them said well how
do you prove that one plus one equals
two and I just kind of moved on from
that point he's his partner is actually
a math teacher at school and it turns
out to prove that one plus one equals
two you're looking at hundreds of pages
of mathematical theorem so it's it's
provable definitely it's actually very
complex to prove that that addition and
subtraction work a lot more difficult
than I ever intended to go into but I'm
not constrained by the primitive notions
of maxvalue with inside of with inside
of your number systems here I don't in
next I leave it's not a problem I've I
am constrained by CPU and memory and
time I I tried to do in doc max value
plus in dot max value because I can go
beyond that even though the inputs are
it's six hours later I decided that I
wanted my computer back so I terminated
the program I actually have no idea how
far it got when doing that that addition
mostly because I have no way of
debugging what the real number is inside
of it other than trying to walk the walk
the internal data structures I've got
which is actually an ienumerable of
empty objects and so it's actually then
an ienumerable of ienumerable of irony
roll I so trying to walk that is
actually very slow as well so to get the
real value is kind of yeah a problem so
I'm only constrained by CPU memory in
time maybe it's something for the cloud
sorry
well why don't we do something like this
why don't we go out and and make a crazy
number system it is is it to make people
happy is it so that I can go yeah like
look at me I'm making people happy and
and like be like really sarcastically
happy about you know doing that not
really it comes back to this idea of
intrinsic motivation intrinsic
motivation is that people have a desire
to solve a problem regardless of the
reward that you're trying to give
someone this going all the way back to
talking about the carrot and the stick
approach to management you don't have to
dangle money in front of someone to make
them do a better job people naturally
want to do a better job we want to share
our experiences that's why we get up at
conferences like this and talk about
something crazy like I'm doing here or
any of the other talks that are
happening this this week we want to
share what we've learned because it
makes us happy it's exciting regardless
of whether or not it's going to
necessarily got tomorrow it might spark
an idea like seeing someone talking
about how to write a number systems by
the idea of all I want to know how that
works myself had the satisfaction of
saying well why not I'm sure I can make
a better wheel it's that's kind of where
it comes down what it comes down to no
we we do all these things because it it
makes us happy we we're motivated to do
that and then if someone does something
and it is amazing and we give them that
feedback afterwards we told them that I
was exciting I learned something it's
fast an idea in me it's given me some
passion to follow HTTP idea if that is
often reward enough that we don't need
to pay someone to have done a better job
that that knowing that they've made
something that someone else is funny
exciting that is that can be motivation
and satisfaction enough don't want to
talk about my fourth bad idea and this
is it's not as silly an idea as some of
the other things that I've talked about
here but it's still this is one of the
first things I did that I think was
really crazy so this will be the final
story
talked of our journey of bad ideas so
seeing is its its circa 2008 I'd been in
the IT industry for about three or four
years at that point so I was still
fairly junior in the company I was
working with I was sort of working for
at the time and we just started doing I
started using an open-source content
management system called Umbraco and
this was circa 2008 don't net ecosystem
so a resource was not particularly a big
thing there was also something else
happened really exciting in the.net
environment in 2009 there was the
release of Visual Studio 2008 I don't
know 3.5 and with that came linked to me
link is kind of the the feature with
inside of net and it's the thing that if
I'm talking to someone about dotnet
compared to other programming languages
this is this is the thing that I say
this is the reason why I write dotnet
and why I love dotnet over the top of
many other things and I've written
implementations of linking things like
JavaScript because I've just I've
wandered it there because I think it's
such a cool aspect of dotnet so I was
starting to look at link and I'd been
reading all the stuff as was coming up
to to its release and what they were
talking about was you link to sequel and
how awesome it was for working with
sequel and linked objects and how
awesome was for that but I wanted to
know what could you do is link beyond
sequel on the kind of on the edges of
the the don't know community that some
there was some really smart people that
were talking about using a link but not
with sequel but with using it with other
things
there was a blogger though I was
following that now works for Microsoft
that was looking at it for working with
PowerShell so no powerful Active
Directory so you've wrote a way of
working we've linked over the top of
Active Directory and all kinds of crazy
stuff like that so I had this brilliant
idea I would write my own link provider
I said I was still a fairly junior
developer I
I but I had this idea I can totally
write a link provider and I thought what
would it be useful for well I'm working
with a broker at the moment and Umbraco
is it's a mid 2000 era content
management system so it's using XSLT if
you weren't using XSLT in a content
management system in early to mid-2000s
I know what you were using you're
probably using WordPress but everything
else was using XSLT and as a dotnet
developer that was not the kind of thing
I want to do writing I did not want to
write XSL daily it was it was not fun
hey they had had on it a few I that I
could work with but it was it was okay
it definitely wasn't ridden to the
caliber of dotnet API that I believed
should have been there and that I
believe that I could write so I decided
I would write a link provider forum
rocker yeah that seems like a good idea
write a link provided to a content
management system yeah how hard could
that be seems like a natural thing so I
this it's an open source project so I I
can get started with this I can easily
pick up the code and start working with
it but I kind of wanted to validate my
idea with the the core team that was
behind the the project to make sure that
they weren't thinking of something in
this space or anything like that
so I had to work out how do you get in
contact with a bunch of developers that
are in Copenhagen that's that's where
they were located I'm I'm in Australia
which is pretty much as far away from
Copenhagen as I could be to try and then
get in contact with them but I think
there was um it was 2008 and there was
another thing that was kind of popping
up that I aim wasn't particular
interested in I didn't think it had a
much longevity but it was I found it was
a useful way to get in contact with them
so I found them on Twitter it was that's
how I got involved and that's how I
became the absolute Twitter junkie that
I seem to be these days I had to make
sure my phone was on silent so I don't
keep hearing pings and someone's
messaging me while I'm up here on stage
so I got in contact with them and I
pitched them the idea I was like here I
reckon this is how we can make the
dotnet experience from
a whole lot better I built a really
simple proof of concept over the top of
their net API which was actually really
just linked to objects over there don't
need API little did I realize that the
part of the API that I'd used to
underpin this was painfully database
intent heavy so every time you wanted to
read a property to display on a page or
to access a page it was a hell of a lot
of database hits we actually shoot my
proof of concept into a production
website and pretty much brought it down
that was that was not a not a fun day
but I pitched this idea and they're like
hey sounds cool
do you wanna come to our conference in
June and talk to us about it
do you want to come to the the core
contributor retreat that we're doing the
week before the conference and and we'll
hack on it together we'll put together
this idea and we'll get it going I was
like sure it's like January it's like
six months I mean it coding right yeah
so I I'd never Romilda provider at this
point in time I've got six months I can
totally get that done I cracked out
reflector started poking around had it
linked to sequel work Hey
copy that hard I can work it out myself
I'm smart guy right the Hexen expression
tree I didn't realize that there was a
will like were able and I neural and
there were different things that's fine
that I can totally get around this it's
not really that hard wait I go to like
pass the method calls that people are
doing inside of these expression trees
so if someone does like something that
equals something else that's different
to if they use the equals operator and
know me to donate 3.5 RTM version of
link and the expression trees was a lot
different to the first service pack to
that and I learned all this like it if
you did if you just had an a collection
and I new rule and you did not select
and didn't pass anything in there that
was different than if you had just the
collection just the eye crew well that
was my whole different expression tree
and I if you had aware and they did a
select and if you didn't if you hadn't
just the wear then that was an entirely
different expression tree as well and
these sorts of things like they really
hurt my brain
I don't know I can totally make this
work still I will get it done I wanted
to have something like the day BML file
if anyone still remembers link to see
who had the lovely schema thing behind
it was this XML but you had this pretty
GUI that you could drag and drop tables
onto and would generate code and under
the under the hood I wanted something
like that I wanted to be able to take an
XML file that represented the the data
structures that Umbraco used internally
and turn those into dotnet objects
automatically and I'd never done
anything with visual studio
extensibility at this point and I'd
never done a code generator at this
point but I could totally work this
stuff out I'm one guy that's on the
other side of the world to the fable
during this actual product and just like
madly writing code and googling and like
sending out emails for health to anyone
that would actually listen to me but I
got a shift it was a little bit more
brutal than I intended when I finally
got it released it never gained is the
kind of traction that I was hoping I
thought this like this was totally gonna
change the way that we did a development
in Braco but it really didn't but I
still got it shipped I was happy with
myself I got to go to this conference
and it was a complete change of life for
me I this thing that started is just a
crazy idea that I never thought that I
could actually achieve it was a complete
change of life it was the first chance
I'd had to public speaking I'd never
even been to a user group at this point
I'd never spoken to the user group
obviously hadn't really been to a
conference let alone presented at a
conference let alone spoken to members
of an open-source project that were that
had some notoriety in and of themselves
but that was massive opportunity for me
it I say it got me my style in public
speaking on the back of that I actually
got offered a job I was living in
Melbourne at the time and I got offered
a job in Sydney so I I really had it I
literally picked up my wife and moved to
Sydney based off of this idea and having
built this and going and presenting at
this conference I got my start in
open-source development I I'd played
around with open source projects I'd
pushed something and this is 2008
Microsoft open-source so it is complex
with TFS or TF VC is the back end or SVN
bridge if you really wanted to go that
route
there was no github there was no real
get the git mercurial s via a source
control walls were still a couple years
off so it was completely different to
what it was like doing open source now I
got to contribute to a contribute to the
Umbraco project for a number of years I
worked with them on an ill-fated rewrite
of it called Umbraco v I then went to
the conference where they actually
killed that project that they'd been
working on for about three years at that
point in time and I I was there at the
back of the keynote while the founder of
this this project announced that this
thing that they'd been spent they'd
spent three years on development and
countless resources and people had been
through training it was dead I and and
that was a harrowing experience like
being in that room with 400 people well
someone is announcing that the project
that they are there for a three-day
conference to learn about is dead
exciting that kind of that kind of stuff
it was that was an intense experience
and this wouldn't have happened without
the support of my employee my employer
was really really encouraging me to get
involved in this project
I admit early that kind of backfired on
them when I resigned after coming back
from this conference and moved into
state but so keep that part in mind when
you're when I'm talking about motivating
people there it can go to extremes but
it was it was a really great opportunity
and it all started as I said from what
you could be seen as a bad idea of a
junior dev going I'm totally right a
link provider so the next time that you
have an idea or one of your colleagues
comes to you with an idea don't
Millhouse it up it's not a stupid idea
think about the last time that you
challenged yourself to just do something
that you didn't think was the best thing
that you could do or the right thing
that you could do when was the last time
you freaked out the establishment thank
you
some of the fluffy you'll kill us all
we've got a couple minutes if anyone has
any questions there's a microphone
around if anyone has any questions
otherwise I'll be around for the rest of
the conference feel free to find me and
ask me questions or validate your stupid
ideas with me I'm more than happy to be
a sounding board or in I said thank you
enjoy the rest of the conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
