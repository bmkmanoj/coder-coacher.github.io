so this is kind of an interesting talk
partly it came from me telling these
stories about crazy things that happened
to me getting ready for or right before
conferences and people are like oh you
got a blog that or you got it that's a
great story and so I figured this was a
time where I'm gonna tell you some fun
stories and also in the in the context
of getting myself out of jams using
cross platform and why I think it's
actually kind of a real thing and not
just a trick to do during keynotes or
whatever so this is a drama in three
parts we're going to begin with a
prelude which is the idealistic
gentleman so I've been interested and
thinking there was possibility for
cross-platform dotnet and cross-platform
just goodness for a long time I've so
this was from something I did back and
we actually started this in 2004 I
wanted to play with mono way back then
actually getting mono set up on Linux to
run an ASP net site was a weekend
project if you knew what you were doing
kind of yeah it took a little bit at
least for me it did and so there was a
live CD back then people like CDs do I
need to explain CDs do we have some kids
in there so they had these live CDs
where you could just boot you know boot
to a CD and it had Linux on them and so
there was one called Knoppix KN OPP IX
and so I was talking with people and and
said hey we need if we could like just
built so actually Twitter wasn't around
back then so I wrote a blog post hey
wouldn't it be cool if so I was
basically a tweet and I said wouldn't it
be neat if we could make a live CD with
mono precooked start it up it's got my
sequel it's got everything all
pre-configured and it runs so that you
can start writing your dotnet code right
away you know and and spend less time
fiddling and getting infrastructure
going this was one of my first like
forays into like doing anything like
open source E and distributing software
and I'm at work and all sudden I'm
realizing I'm getting tons of downloads
and I'm having to figure out how to host
like a legal torrent
and all this stuff so that was a lot of
fun but so I've been you know thinking
like we're almost there soon this is
gonna happen for a long time there been
some like you know disappointments and
setbacks I remember at a mixed
conference talking to someone I'm like
why doesn't Microsoft just ship a bunch
of open source stuff like it's out there
why don't they ship paint.net why don't
they chip this and that and you know I
got some like I don't know if it's it
was at least the reality of the time
people were like well because there's
all these liabilities and all this stuff
and you know you could get and and a lot
of it was just like the way software was
shipped by Microsoft right so it's kind
of like well I don't know I still think
it could happen and and then you know
finally things are we're getting this
promise right people are saying like
yeah you really can do it and and so it
was neat to see you know if I can go out
to the the.net site so dot dot net which
is kind of silly but so if you org you
just you know google for dotnet core or
whatever so but here's here's you know
what you see when you go to it so you go
to the dotnet course site and you have
all these different things plus there's
the other downloads and you can click
over and you can get other downloads
right so that isn't heat so you know
like I started playing around with it so
I said let me see
so I don't know why it is but I mix up
two commands on a Mac and Linux I always
type MD because I think that makes sense
to make a directory right and then I
should just alias it but I don't on
Windows all the time in the command
prompt I'm always typing LS and again I
should alias it right but I don't or I
could just run bash here but so I can do
something like on here I'll say so it's
an empty directory I'll say yo SP net
and all I'm using yeoman I'm gonna
create a simple directory or simple
application right and what's cool with
this is I almost typed LS again
there's a docker file in here right so
this Wow
that was me it's like kind of sparkly
isn't it oh there's a matrix part coming
up so hold on okay so so there's a
docker file like included in these
scaffolds right so I can go in I can say
like dotnet restore and I can run this
locally of course this is just running
on Windows but when I'm running docker
this is actually running in a VM right
this is this
Mobe Linux VM so that's how docker is
running on Windows and and so that's
that is neat so let's see if that's done
okay so I could run this here of course
but I can also say dotnet aresome docker
build dash T and so I'm tagging it with
a name and we'll call this monkey face
and so I've tried I was wondering why do
I call everything monkey face or monkey
or spaghetti and I and the only reason I
can really think of is I do that so that
I know I can delete those directories
that's or just because I have tourettes
I'm not sure but so okay so that's going
through and it's building an image and
then once that's done I can actually I
actually have my docker commands because
I might like explode my laptop but so
that is actually building it in that
docker container right and now I can do
docker run - D - Pisa - D is daemon and
P is port and I'm mapping 8080 to 5,000
so what's happening is and then it's
monkey face so what's happening there is
i'm telling dr. to run the image i just
created
well monkey face and i'm saying run it
as a daemon so keep it running and then
mapping the internal port the
applications running on 5,000 i'm
mapping that to 8080 as an external so
now if i go here
and so hopefully that's spinning up
right so so that actually in and of
itself is kind of wild right because I
built on Windows I scale did something
but then I'm actually running it in a
Linux VM running on my laptop and then
I'm actually you know like calling back
into it from Windows and I'm already
getting dizzy right so that so that's
mean now let's talk about how this got a
little more fun so I was going to I was
invited as many of these stories start
for me I was invited because somebody
wanted Scott Hanselman to speak in
Moscow right at Moscow DEFCON and and
which is a cool conference is really
cool conference and Scott was busy and
so then I was the third or a choice or
whatever so so I fly over there and I'm
ready right I'm excited about this and
some of the stuff they were talking to
me about was like want you to do the the
the azure Kino right this is I think my
names up there somewhere in Russian and
I spoke Russian fluently no but I did
have a translator which was cool so like
if you watch this on channel 9 it's like
I have this deep Russian voice so um so
I was going to present on some things
and they had some things that they this
was the second a keynote and they had
some stuff they wanted me to talk about
one was publishing asp net core app to
darker swarm on Azure container service
I'm like I know some of those words that
sounds great
we can do this and so I'm I you know
practice got everything ready the day
the day before the conference started I
actually went when I booked to travel
they said there's some weird thing where
for whatever reason the Ritz right on
Red Square has an incredible corporate
rate for Microsoft right now and you can
you can stay there at the Ritz I'm like
all right I won't argue so I'm at the
Ritz the day before the conference and
there was actually that night was a tech
check going through my slides going
through my demos sipping some coffee all
of a sudden the world's you
just sneeze just attacks me out of the
blue you ever had one of those like this
sneeze word sure you know it was bizarre
and coffee flying in the we're in the
air and it was like oh and the coffee
spills right on the laptop right so then
I'm going I'm like it's good I'm sure
it's fine I'll type all the keys
everything's good
em doesn't work well there's no em in
docker and I won't use Monkeyface but I
can make oh and now the end keys out
dotnet pretty one by one the keys stop
working right this is on my Windows
laptop it's the morning of the tech
check the next day the conference starts
and I'm on the second day keynote right
freaking out what am i doing I flew all
the way over to Russia and they're like
and then I'm like can I go buy another
laptop and then I remembered that I
actually in my bag also had MacBook Air
and I just always bring both with me
because partly when I do asp net demos
and stuff I want to be able to show
things working on both right but I'd
done it all my demos were in visual
studio
everything is PowerPoint I'm like is
this even gonna work well it has to
right so I decided to you know see if in
a few hours I could switch everything
over right so I did that and I actually
ran through all of this stuff again this
morning just because I don't know it was
reliving the memory let me see if I can
do this
so what I'm going to show you is
creating and publishing a docker just
like we did on the windows laptop we're
gonna do that on Mac but we're also
gonna publish to docker swarm you guys
are worried I'm gonna like drop the
laptop straight okay
so let's bring up right okay so I just
love typing LS why is that
okay so I'm going to make a directory
great it exists Monkeyface exists okay
super okay it's either that or poop
right and I'm just not stooping to that
level okay so I'm going to scaffold out
something so I'll do again yo asp net
now I actually ran through this morning
doing this using Steve Sanderson's
really cool asp net core spa scaffold
err and it's it's great and it deployed
to docker but it did take about a
fortnight because it also has to like
the docker image has to build node and
it has to build all these other things
right so this I'm doing this because
it's just a little faster right so this
is yeoman scaffold err and I'm going to
do to keep it simple all this stuff so
again this is this pulling things down
also the new the new scaffold the new
templates don't have NPM you don't have
to use NPM right this just uses Bower
which I was kind of going back and forth
on what I thought about it because I
kind of like node an NPM but it does in
this case there's no restoring it's
super fast so it winds today for me
so yes okay so here we're popping this
up again and I showed you that docker
file really quick but I didn't we didn't
really look at what's in there right so
it's actually pretty simple
it's if I can remember on here thanks
right so
there's an official great
okay so there's an official like out on
the docker hub there's this a dotnet
image right so all that this does is a
script and it just says copy from my
directory to this app directory in the
in the container sets the work directory
runs dotnet restore which is a standard
dotnet restore command and dotnet build
and then these last two then it exposes
that 5,000 entry point and then it runs
dotnet run so you can actually read this
and it makes sense which is nice great
so I'm going to want to do let's do
dotnet restore well so I can restore and
run this you've seen this probably 90
times at this conference so I'm not
gonna run it locally it's the standard
asp net it scaffold what i do want to do
is first will do docker version do i
need to bump up the font size or just
work okay alright so what we're seeing
here is up at the top is the client
that's what i'm running there that is
not the latest thing which you just
thought pop up and tell me to upgrade
but it's good enough for me different
for today so that's the client the
server is my docker server which is also
running on here it's a it's a vm right
so it's just it's running locally
there's a whale that proves it
so i can go in here and I could say
again darker build
so it's building that I think it's gonna
be it's a little bit faster because I've
I sort of cheated I built similar image
on here today and so there's there's
less for it to build but also since its
buildings off of just that that standard
image it doesn't have to do a bunch of
app get that's something that slows down
a lot of these so alright so OS ten
laptop with a Linux VM it's doing this
restore stuff in the Linux VM it's about
to run then I got to remember my command
again all that DP business so I'll say
and what they call it thank you
all right so let's go over here
all right so that's not all that
exciting what we are gonna see like it
spins up great you know it would work no
excitement there so we'll stop it
what I do want to do next though is I
want to show it running in the swarm
that or as your container service warm
so what that what that does and again
this is one of those things where it was
frustrating because it takes just long
enough where you wouldn't want to sit
there and watch it go but it's just fast
enough for you like I almost could right
so what I did is I went in here and I
said new and in this marketplace there
is in recent I've got a juror container
service and you go through and you click
you fill in a few things you say create
you click the only button you can and
then you go through and you set some
basic like your SSH key and your
username and that kind of stuff right
and then it spins out and it took under
ten minutes five ten minutes something
like that okay so that's that's what I
spun up and you can see that right here
okay so it actually does spin up a good
amount of stuff and this is a test swarm
so it's it's actually not a big swarm
it's just for testing they have other
ones that are larger right so there's
that so what I'm gonna do I already set
up my SSH so if I do see export and I
forget its exports copy and paste so
what I'm doing here is this is just
setting an environment variable that is
telling the docker host where it
connects to so now if I do docker
version
it's gonna scare me it should be
connecting to that other one but make
sure I have internet and stuff I was
clicking around in there I'll do a
google just for John
yeah got Internet all right let's see
error occurred not cool all right let's
make sure I'm SSH
okay so now we can export it
good okay so the important thing we're
seeing here is my client is the same
that's where I'm connecting from but my
server now is swarm so like really all I
did there's a tutorial here on the azure
can as your site but all I did in order
to do that is I've SSH to it to this
container service and then I just say
you know then that's it right so now if
I do the same kind of thing if I say
docker build wow that should be it go
from a docker file so there's my doctor
file
Oh dot there we go cool so this is doing
the same kind of thing it's going
through its building an image for me and
then I can run it so we're waiting here
well on like up in the magical clouds
it's installing these things right so
where SSH tin so we can see it it's
installing the new get packages
somewhere so here it's running instead
of like NPM restore it's that bundler
minify or core so that's a new tool that
shipped that came in just at our TM so
you still can run NPM if you want to but
you're you're not required to it in this
case I'm happy because it is really darn
fast so now I can do docker - Dee
and what I call spaghetti
right okay so now I'm gonna go over to
here here so this is the URL of a docker
swarm so this is a swarm in this case I
think there's just one in this warm so
it's not a large swarm but it could be
like any size right I can add multiple
into it so what we just saw there I spun
I created that that docker swarmed this
morning in about 5-10 minutes and then I
just now created a site and published to
it right so I can go and do all the I
can go in and command the swarm I can so
now if I say right there's there's the
running application I can go through and
kill it or whatever so that is kind of
cool and that got me through the moscow
a conundrum
great okay any questions thoughts so far
good everyone's so quiet right okay
next the case of the curious cursor so I
got back from Moscow I was kind of tired
and I didn't have a huge amount of like
stuff lined up and I was kind of
enjoying the quiet month and then Scott
hunter contact me so Hanselman sparse he
contacted me and said hey do you want to
go to Red Hat because we're we're
launching you know dot net cord that
sounds fun you know do you have anything
for me to do there and there's a booth
you know I could be fine just hang out
and have fun
that sounds great you know so the this
was exciting where we were launching it
you know it's a big thing
Red Hat that sounded fun this is
actually the booth while we were there I
was surprised I was wondering what the
reception would be like I was thinking
you know people are be gonna be like not
happy were there or something I wasn't
sure people loved Dennis people it was
tons of we were given away penguins that
said Microsoft loves Linux and they
liked that
there are also water bottles down here
and people love coming to get those
until somebody stole them all which
that's not cool but but anyhow these are
guys from the the.net team and so we had
a great time I actually and for a little
bit I couldn't really like it didn't
make sense to me but then it totally
made sense to me right cuz Red Hat
Enterprise Linux these are people that
are running like Enterprise jobs and
they there are a lot of cases where
they're like hey I would love to be able
to run dotnet but you know we're this is
our shop runs runs Linux but like the
whole kind of enterprise linux and and
dotnet and and Microsoft stuff we also
we're launching sequel server on Linux
there as well and so people we had tons
of people coming up from all these you
know big universities and and NASA and
all kinds of stuff they were excited to
talk to us so so yeah excite
so but I'm just kind of getting ready
and I'm like I'm gonna go hang out at
the booth and give away penguins and
that'll be cool and then a couple of
weeks before we can have two weeks
before the conference I started getting
copied on emails that said stuff like
yeah make sure Galloway knows about this
what's up and they were like yeah for a
handsome ones keynote you're on that
right ok yeah you know or like so so
pretty soon I'm right enhancements
keynote right and and learning Red Hat
and you know like trying to make a
keynote up which is which was totally
fun but also like like red hats
anyone here know red hat much use red
hat it's interesting right it's kind of
cool but it's like it's locked down in
ways that are different than ways I'm
used to Linux being locked down and so
learning about software collections and
all the stuff and so that was cool and
so I ended up you know like working it
was it was getting kind of it was busy
and then and then Hunter was like hey
you can co-present with me we're doing
this talk on like running you know
dotnet on RedHat and like running on on
the there public cloud or there pass
system and all this that sounds fun you
know and then it's kind of emailing him
and I wasn't hearing back and pretty
soon he's like yeah crazy swamp but you
know maybe we'll connect on the phone or
whatever and so it's getting closer and
I'm getting a little like where are we
good on this talk and then then like
maybe four days before he like emails me
he was like I can't go you gotta take
the talk so this was one where I was
planning I'd like hanging out on the
side being like yeah yeah you go that's
cool you know it's all right yeah so now
I'm like writing you know the demo for a
Hanson was keynote which was which was
fine and we catch showed tons of cool
stuff but it was a lot to do and then
I'm also like having to learn about
about Red Hat and also there's this
thing called open shift which is really
neat actually it's their platform
as-a-service it runs on Red Hat and it
is it's using docker and kubernetes
under the hood so so
it all kind of like the parts fit
together and it was pretty neat dotnet
running on docker anyways and it's so so
I'm like you know working on that and
stuff so we get through the get through
Hansel Minsky note that was that was
fine and then I basically had to write
my talk for for the next day which was
the previously hunter now me talk so
that was cool and and a lot of it was on
RedHat OpenShift and and as you can see
from here it's like it's now supported I
accept that was like the day that it was
announced and it actually wasn't
supported but nobody told me
so I seriously stayed up the entire day
like these commands are supposed to work
and it's not working and it turned out
like basically I could have almost done
it if I had been able to publish to
docker to docker hub except they had
like this then I was like oh I should
have done that and I'm like I actually
worked with some of their engineers the
next day and they're like yeah but we
actually disabled that you could for
security you know we're not like
allowing people so so that was a futile
quest but got through all that I'm like
okay here's I can talk my way around
that and then I then I was getting right
up to my thing to my talk and actually
I'll switch back over while we're doing
this and I was going to be running on a
VM running Red Hat and the the the cool
thing about it is actually for the most
part it's the same thing over and over
again right so installing and running
dotnet on other platforms you still you
get the framework you do you do the
standard like dotnet build on that
restore there's restoring then build
right but where'd it go just a second so
kind of the standard thing there are
some interesting differences right
there's like I said you have to in order
to install on Red Hat you have to
basically give yourself permission are
we
yes cool let's get a hand but the
exciting thing here actually I guess I
could show you that first right so
here's my Red Hat VM cool and in this
case I just had to make it green type on
black just just for old school so so
here's you know here's an example one I
can bring up code right so vs code works
on here as well
so I can go through and build my app
that you know the same thing there's a
docker file I could make you go through
watching that again but the interesting
thing here so if I go right so I'm going
through and this is the standard
let's go 5,000
yeah
okay so you know your standard MVC site
the exciting thing that I found out
though and it was roughly 45 minutes
before my talk and I was in the hotel so
maybe closer to an hour is I wanted to
go fullscreen because this was not very
big and I had to present on a small
thing so I tried some different buttons
and I ended up hitting ctrl alt and
someone said home what's what I needed
to do in order to get fullscreen and I
hit control f8 and that's exactly what I
saw and and then I tried hitting other
control all things and that was very
scream so in this case it wasn't
completely dotnet core to the rescue but
I actually did freak out and try
installing on pretty much anything in
sight
I tried you know the press any key
solution actually I found this out after
after the fact well I found it out
actually as I was searching but it
didn't totally work because the way the
hyper-v was mapping the keys back in but
did people know about this as are people
laughing when I did this for you of
course you did but ctrl alt and then
higher number F keys switch you to a
virtual console which is super useful in
probably some cases that I don't know
about but who is not useful to me at the
time and then again like I was saying
people I actually was freaking out and
on Twitter I'm like how do I make the
screen not be black with a cursor in the
top and then people are saying just hit
this and this but because of the way
hyper-v was like you know like hyper-v
was grabbing some of those keystrokes on
the way in and so it was not working so
I started thinking what can I do
and so I started I had the the MacBook
with me and I installed on a VM on there
I started installing which actually
there's a process takes a little while
to install Red Hat because there's like
license thing and there's like there's
things that have to happen so I tried
building another VM on here
so started spinning up an azure VM at
the same time because 45 minutes right
and and then also a openshift
right I started trying to deploy in case
they had their their image like the
security enabled for it now but actually
what I ended up doing was just rebooting
the the VM and then rebooting my laptop
like nine times and then eventually on
the ninth time it actually worked so I
think I'm pretty fast I thought that the
the docker swarm thing would take longer
this is really kind of wrapping up here
so if you have thoughts or questions I'm
happy to take them but thoughts on kind
of what this means and and why I think
it's important so first of all it's
great that I can run dotnet pretty much
everywhere and I love as a developer not
just being able to do one thing but to
be able to run you know like oh I can
work on that computer or I can help you
with this program or whatever I can
spill coffee wherever I want and it
seems to be working out for me I do
think it's neat that I can build on one
computer and deploy to another and
actually you saw me do that over and
over today right because I'm building on
Mac and deploying to a Linux VM and
building on Windows and employing a VM
I'm deploying to the cloud so really
that portable code is is great and
another thing I was talking I mentioned
this to Steve Sanderson the other day
and he's like well don't forget also the
the importance of being able to have a
team and everyone builds on whatever
they want and in fact like Steve for
instance most of the time he's always on
his Mac and he's building a vs code and
and deploying the stuff and I'm pulling
it down and running it in Visual Studio
like it doesn't matter right and I I'm
sure probably a lot of you that have
worked on web dev teams you end up where
all the designers are Max and maybe some
of the developers are on you know UNIX
and some are on Windows and some like
again it doesn't matter and that's been
frustrating for me in the past where we
were all working together on things and
the designers could not get at the code
or they couldn't run the
or whatever right and and then finally a
really big thing for me is not having to
choose so I think I think that there's a
difference between between choices and
options and I love to have a lot of
options but I don't like to be forced to
make choices right so you have to make a
choice it's like I'm only doing this
thing or I'm only and especially I think
as developers we do that a little too
much like we say I am a database
developer or I am a Windows developer I
only do Windows or I'm a Mac developer I
am of this or that right I'm a c-sharp
dev and I think it's great to be a
developer that like you can go anywhere
and and enjoy working wherever you'd
like that's actually all I got that went
way faster than I thought does anyone
have any thoughts questions yes what
what aspect of cross-platform dot - net
still frustrates me the most um okay
this is just off the top of my head so
that I think one thing is there there
are cases where you feel like there's a
lowest common denominator where we still
need to kind of build up - I do see that
moving pretty quickly
but that is something there I wouldn't
call it a frustration but there is just
a thing to know about which is there are
slightly different steps involved right
so like like as I was showing there's
but you know that's just that's how the
platforms are right so like here's the
thing if I go into red hat like I've got
to enable scription subscription manager
and I've got a so there's some places
where like to get OpenSSL on a Mac you
know you go through and you like how do
you get that how do you so I think those
are some things that are still kind of
being worked out yeah I know those are
really kind of did any thoughts for you
my recent frustration has been bundling
native binaries for different things
yeah that's just you know what I happen
to have been doing recently
yeah that's incredibly frustrating and
you know I run into that all the time
like on note as well right like if
you're doing a note on Windows and and
you run into anything that uses note or
MPN Gipp you know and it's or you're
like is it going to build this time so
that's I think my hope is that we get to
like the more of the stack that is
managed a lot of that kind of goes away
so yeah any other that's question yeah
do you feel that
so yeah the technical answer is yes I
mean it's it's released now the the
qualifiers on that are the tools are
still in preview so what does that mean
tools are like Visual Studio you know
like any of the kind of command-line
tools including are those are still in
preview the tough thing with that with
what the team kind of decided and that
my personal thoughts on this too it had
been kind of in this not release date
for years right who was in this kind of
bit was a beta and then it was our C and
then it was like maybe should have been
beta again and then it was like is but
eventually like you get into the spot
where you're waiting for like people
aren't going to ship database drivers
and people aren't going to like port
their large systems to it and start
actually doing things that make the
platform useful until it releases so you
need kind of to say like okay it's time
we're releasing and then you go right
it's never gonna be the perfect time but
it has to happen I feel like for me I've
been like playing with it since it
started so I'm kind of like is this
still not released yet you know so so I
mean technically yeah it depends it's
got to be so it's it's up to you because
it is a version one product so I don't
know that is anyone here running in
production running dotnet core in
production so I do talk to people there
are like some early adopters that are
doing some pretty cool things with it
right but it really kind of depends on
what you're running what your stability
is if and then and then there's the
whole kind of like we have this big
slide to show like is dotnet core even
like if you've got working existing code
that's deployed and running on dotnet
full framework what's what's your
motivation to to move to it you know and
I think it is a better thing where if
you're starting a project today I would
I would consider it so cool
you spoke briefly around in your blog
post from the open the attitude towards
open source at Microsoft yeah quite some
years ago what do you think kind of
caused that shift in attitude from your
perspective Scott Guthrie yeah well I
mean there's a lot of things I mean
definitely having leadership move up
over time that does believe in it
believes an open source and sees it as a
as a real legitimate like business you
know like it's good business right I
think also seeing like the entire
industry has kind of figured out good
ways to to use open source and to
contribute to open source not just like
take from open source but also
contribute to it so that's been good I
think also some things like you know
there were some baby steps at Microsoft
where we started shipping jQuery you
know which actually sounds like nothing
now but that was a huge thing because we
actually by shipping this code then we
had to support it and we had to like if
something came up and like there were
there still was that the you know people
worry about like what if something in
jQuery is actually found to be covered
under some patent and now what what does
that mean we have DVDs out there printed
you know with MSDN subscription that you
know that kind of thing and I think you
know then over time you know this guy
Guthrie Scott Hanselman there are a lot
of people inside of Microsoft that
actually we're kind of pushing pretty
hard for it there's also over time
there's just there's turnover at any
company and there are more people coming
in saying like everything I did in
college was open source why can't we do
you know that kind of thing it seemed
like some kind of successes over time
and then NBC that was also at the time
that was a big deal for that to be open
source and it worked you know so so that
also over time we kind of trained the
the legal department you know that like
and and so the the legal department like
you we bashed on them enough times and
there there's some great people in the
legal team that are that are wanting to
see how they can help with it you know
so now a lot of the time inside inside
Microsoft it depends which group you're
in and stuff but the kind of default
assumption is you're gonna open-source
something like you know so especially
with developer products you know but so
that's gotten a lot easier there's some
some quick as long as you stay within
some certain guidelines there's some
really there's like a fast path to open
sourcing things so yeah so it's a
combination of a lot of things it's
really something I've been at Microsoft
six years actually so my people have an
alias at Microsoft it's like you know
and like the dorky people like call them
call each other by their aliases and
that's how you know they're dorks so
mine is joga llo w which is kind of
stupid and I was like it doesn't matter
people are telling me you should change
it like I'm not gonna be here long
enough I'll be here a year or two like
it's a big company and so six years
later and I'm still there and and I know
why I'm still there is because all these
crazy things I like it would be so great
if they would just do this like all that
stuff kept happening right so so maybe I
should change my alias yeah yeah great
questions by the way thank you yeah I'm
just gonna have any other net core team
done any performance benchmarks and the
different operating systems and has
there been any consistent difference
between the different operating systems
so yes there's a huge so the main one
the obvious one is the s peanut
benchmarks and what we're seeing there
is it's basically a it's pretty much a
draw so if we look at and there there is
newer stuff here but we were seeing 1.1
million on an asp net core on kestrel on
Windows and on Linux nine hundred and
twenty eight thousand and there are
cases with with some of the perfect
software we'll see faster on on Linux so
you know it really kind of goes back and
forth they do have I was talking to
Damien I don't I don't know more about
this but there's a whole perf lab and
all they do is like they have these huge
beefy machines and they'll do things
like on check and they'll run perf tests
so I
really the goal is not to have things
like you know there's always a thing of
like of course Microsoft's gonna make it
like Sark on Linux and say you have to
use MIT but I mean I see that still
regularly I'm hacker news you know it's
like what are they trying to do I know
there's something evil going on but you
know really it's it's it's make it work
as fast as as possible I'm sure there's
going to be some places where due to the
you know some differences just some
process model and stuff on Linux where
there will be places it'll be faster and
that's that's fine you know that's cool
other thoughts comments all right well
thank you for your time bye
this was definitely a quicker one than I
expected um I thought my demos would
kind of fail and they didn't guess I
shouldn't so so thanks that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
