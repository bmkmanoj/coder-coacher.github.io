well done homestretch nearly made it so
there's no shortage of books courses
coaching conference sessions these days
on being agile and running an agile team
have you ever worked as a software
solution provider where you've adopted
agile practices in your team you're
doing TDD you're doing squirm you're
doing Kanban continuous integration all
these really good things but around the
team there is like a massive gray cloud
this specter of more traditional project
management practices commercial
practices which are like a big gray
cloud hanging of your development team
more time spent arguing about whether
things that in or out of scope than just
getting on on doing things more time
spent doing bureaucratic change across
processes than just really just getting
on it and delivering the software hardly
in the spirits of the agile manifesto
what was it again customer collaboration
over contract negotiation responding to
change over following a plan maybe this
is familiar to you I don't know my name
is camila Brown I work as a engineering
manager / scrum master / project manager
/ whatever you are not called somebody
who basically helps people deliver
software what I'd like to do today is
talk to you about my experience in
trying to push some of these agile
processes outside of the development
team up to the project through to the
legal and commercial level to really
make it all a much better experience
both for for you as a software supplier
and also for the customer to get a
better end result so it's not
necessarily the right way that I'm
proposing here this is just what I've
done I have to say when I first set out
trying to do things a little bit
differently I wasn't really overwhelmed
with the with literature about there on
on how to change things at that higher
level so this is really about you know
what I've done in my city
raishin but I'd be really interested to
hear from any of you guys maybe you've
solved the problem you can just tell me
how to do it that that would be great so
just a show of hands who here is a
software developer quite a lot manager
e-types and who's in-house and everybody
else is delivering software to other
people that'd be show hands yeah well
hopefully some of this will ring true
for some of you
so and just a bit of background so I
work at Sony in sunny Basingstoke it's
actually quite a nice place there
country to so many many myths so this is
Sony professional so no Playstations
no movies no TVs this is the
business-to-business part of Sony Sony
professional deals in various markets
medical education but broadcast is one
particular market which is very big for
Sony professional and this has come from
very much a hardware background where
Sony makes a lot of products in this
area so a typical project typical
broadcast projects would consist of for
example fitting out a studio or
delivering an outside broadcast truck
with lots of Kitty and all plug together
so this is these the sorts of things you
might get you know tape decks video
rooters cameras link them together with
some SDI cables some serial cables and
then you know everything everything
works easy-peasy in the past everything
that well the transfer method was tape
so you know they didn't used to be any
file or IP or anything like that you'd
get your video for me to be by putting
on a tape and then people cutting up the
tape but over the years like many
industries IT and broadcast have
converged and these days people wants IT
media solutions files come in as actual
files that you know you know mobs or
whatever and we have to plug it all
together with IP so well hey it's easy
isn't it we just replay
some of these hardware components with
software components and follow the same
processes before how hard can it be so
over the years I've moved from software
developer to team lead term or
management type and I've seen various
projects done in this way with varying
degrees of success so first of all I'll
just highlight a couple of headaches
which may or may not be familiar to you
so headache one is you've signed up to a
fixed price fix cope contract and at the
start the solution architects the
pre-sales people they all went away they
come up with the design and people
thought yeah it'd be great we could take
this component from vendor a this
component from vendor B but we'll get
them to add on a bit of custom API we'll
put our own product in at the bottom
it'll all work fine won't it but over
time it becomes apparent that's without
some fundamental redesign of the
solution maybe because of some
requirement that wasn't properly
understood at the start you know no
fault of anybody really these things
happen and things start to go a bit
wrong but because of the fixed price fix
cope nature of the project there's no
will to do the bold thing and just
refactor it or change the design because
at the end of the day you've committed
to delivering something from it for a
certain price and if the developers are
saying look you know we need to scrap
that bit and bring in a new bit or we
need to rewrite that bit the the will of
the project is often to not do that so
as a developer it can be very
frustrating you get forced to to make
your software work in ways that you
never believed possible but anyway if
you're lucky it'll all work and maybe
your customer will will sign the magical
acceptance certificate at the end the
other headache and at the common one
you've finished the software solution
customers using it and they're in
acceptance space they say well this is
an issue you know you need to fix that
but then as the supply you say well that
does clearly not an issue that's
a feature request and then you spend
months maybe arguing about this and if
you look you might come to some
agreements if you're unlucky these sorts
of things can go on for a very very very
long time so you can imagine having seen
various projects over the years the
trepidation I felt for the impending day
when my manager would say to me Camilla
we'd like you to take on project
managing the blardy blar project would I
suffer the same fate so the project I
was given was again about a it's about
media logistics and the original project
which I didn't do one of my colleagues
delivered was about moving from a tape
based system to a file based system and
the system as you're probably technical
types as technical as it gets I'm afraid
there was an asset management system
provided by Sony one of our products we
had an enterprise service bus with some
kind of core stuff that we do plus some
custom workflows lots of third-party
software that we integrated transcoders
transfer software lots of video II type
stuff and media logistics is all about
as a broadcaster you got lots of videos
coming in you want to do stuff to them
you want to make sure that they're good
quality you might check them and then
essentially you want to send the videos
out again to be viewed either on linear
TV or over IP that kind of thing so
phase one which I didn't do was your
traditional waterfall style project
there was a paid-for design consultancy
where everybody decided exactly they
were going to do and then implementation
and delivery the implementation delivery
took about a year and actually of all
the projects I've seen this has been
probably the most successful one which
obviously credit to my colleagues who
delivered the project but also credit to
the customer the customers a commercial
broadcaster and really wanted to go live
with this thing and they were very
pragmatic
and the thing that was amazing was how
much where we came to headache number
two that I described earlier about
things being issues or features if there
was this argument they say well it looks
fine we'll just work around it and they
were quite good at your kind of you know
in your garage knocking up some scripts
to work around the solution for now so
that they could go live which was very
impressive and not all customers are
like that so at this point my colleague
who was an engineering manager said I
ought to do project management decided
he wanted to get back to product
development project management there was
enough for him and I took over for a
phase two a so again pretty waterfall
like we did a bit of consultancy at the
start to discuss what we were going to
implement but we took instead of
waterfall we took a water scrum fall
approach so we had the the spec for what
we were going to deliver specified front
and but we did five releases to the
customer once a month to deliver the
piece of work that we decided at the
beginning and it went reasonably well I
was fairly new to project management at
the start as expected we got to sort
around delivery to delivery three and
the things that we'd specified in the
paid for design consultancy at the start
started to up and wind a bit so then you
have to make changes there's a change
request process you fill in the forms
you figure out how much it's going to
cost but it was fine we delivered and
the customer was still pretty happy with
us so they said we want to do more but
we want to be more agile as your
customer I want to receive a monthly
delivery that's great we've been doing
that so take for that one
but I want to maintain a list of
prioritize items I've got a backlog of
stuff and I want to be able to move
things around the backlog pretty much
any day of the week because my business
priorities are changing all the time and
I just want to concentrate on specifying
the items at the top
the backlog I don't want to specify all
my items at front so that I can meet my
business needs as effectively as
possible so I was like great this is
really great I want to be more agile
this waterfall thing it's just not me at
all but how do we do that at the
commercial basis so first port of call
the lawyers what on earth are the
lawyers going to say about this so I
didn't know much about this kind of
thing before this but a traditional
fixed price fix coke contract normally
consists of your master services
agreement called an MSA typically and
this sets out the terms and conditions
under which you're going to work with
your customer so things like warranty
purchases obligations clean site access
escrow maybe might be included there and
so this will typically take a long time
to negotiate especially when you've got
corporate legal teams involved they can
spend a long time talking about these
things and then what you have is a
statement of work now this is the thing
which is different per instance of the
contract and that details the the scope
so this is you know as mentioning
earlier about how a buddy goes off and
comes up with their design that goes
into the setting to work how much it's
going to cost and what time scales we're
going to deliver against and as far as I
understand that that's fairly standard
way that that contracts work for this
sort of thing so I spoke to our legal
counsel and explained what I wanted to
do we want to be agile we want to
deliver random stuff every month how can
we how can we have a contract for this
and she was actually really
understanding and she dug out some agile
sample contracts from the web if you do
a bit of searching you know there are
various Argyl contracts that you can
download but the problem with it was
this is the original MSA the master
services agreements had taken months to
negotiate
and the customer wants to get going
straight away and our legal counsel she
said look you know if we go back to
square one with the contract we're not
going to be started for another six
months
but she said I think there's a way we
can do this so instead of saying what we
were going to deliver she said well we
can just modify it to say what sort of
things are going to be delivered and she
thought that the legal people would be
happy if then we referred to the process
for determining what will be delivered
so she picked up on all my explanations
of our jaya and sprints and sprint
planning and backlogs and she said well
that's all great I think we can work
with this so she said what you need to
do is you need to write the process and
it needs to be referred to by the
contract so typically in an IT contract
you sign the contract and then the
project manager comes onboard and as
part of the startup process again if any
of you have done princ - you'll be
familiar with the sort of things you
start the project and you do your
communication strategy your strategy for
reporting strategy for how you're going
to deliver it so what I did is I vote a
project approach which actually went to
the lawyers and it got legally fired in
terms of the way I'd written it and that
formed a part of the contract so what we
were doing instead of ripping up the old
contract we were tweaking the existing
contract and kind of jamming in our own
agile approach into the existing
contract so the project approach so what
did I talk about in there so we had to
define various terms for things we
talked about the backlog there's
prioritized list of things roles and
responsibilities so now this is crucial
really because some customers might get
a software supplier to deliver a
solution because basically they just
want to wait for the software to be
delivered and they're quite happy to sit
back and wait for it to turn up but for
this agile approach to work
you've really got to have the customer
engaged and the the product donor role
needs to sit on the customer side so
it's vitally important that those roles
and responsibilities get written in and
the customers signing up to those rules
and responsibilities we talked about the
ceremonies sprint planning
retrospectives sprint reviews and again
it's all about making sure that it's
well understood what the customers
buying into by doing this process
there's no point doing this process if
they're not going to be available for
all these agile type things estimation
talks about that and we'll talk a bit
more about that later and also
acceptance so again a normal waterfall
project you'd get to the end and you
have a great big acceptance which can go
on for days weeks or even months but
because we're delivering per sprint or
per iteration because we're going to do
a scrum style process we're going to be
getting acceptance basically at the end
of each iteration because we're going to
deliver working software for each sprint
so that was the project approach and as
I say this was the first time that the
project approach a project approach had
formed part of any of our contractual
documentation for any of our
professional contracts through the plan
now if you've ever worked with bid
managers bid managers love a plan first
thing they say if you work with the bid
manager is where's the plan Microsoft
Project Sun so well that kind of goes
away really because we're doing all
these things not necessarily in this
order and we're doing them all the time
and I'm not going to tell you when we're
going to do them because we need to do
them on an ongoing basis you know we're
backlog grooming the customers
prioritizing that we're taking a look
we're doing workshops we're doing design
discussions specifying we're breaking
things down we're doing our planning
poker sessions you know all good
agile things and then we basically got
our off Sprint's because we're going to
do a scrum style process so we plan the
sprints we do our development in the
sprints we demo to the customer and then
we release it to the users and then we
just do the same same again so it always
makes me chuckle that whenever we do a
new statement of work for another phase
the bid manager says so we need to
update the plan huh but the plan is the
same there is no plan we just do the
same thing but once I give him the dates
of the iterations he always goes off and
creates a Microsoft Project plan so if
you're listening Paul on video thank you
for all the Microsoft Project plans
you've done for me over the years so
that's the legal part sorted out but
then how are we going to sell it so we
know what we're going to do and the
legal people are happy but what are we
selling so the two main models are fixed
price fixed scope which we talked about
earlier so this is a bit like getting
somebody to build you an extension you
tell them what you wants and they say
right we'll do it for this price and
it'll take this long oh there's time and
materials where essentially you're
paying for the time that somebody spends
on the work so you pay maybe by the hour
or by the day you'll have different
rates and you also pay for any materials
that have to be bought as part the
process so fixed price fixed scope is
generally regarded as the risk being
with the vendor so this is because
you're going to sign up to a particular
price based on your understanding of
what you have to be what needs to be
delivered but more often than not if
there any mistakes and that
understanding then your costs as a
supplier are going to far exceed what
what you originally thought some say
that actually fixed price fixed scope is
risky for the end customer because quite
often they'll get through the process
and realized that what they said they
wanted originally is not what they
actually want so there is a risk to them
that they don't get a solution that
works for them but ultimately I think
the risk is primary with the vendor and
then time materials will the risk is
with the purchaser because you're just
paying for hours spent but what's the
guarantee that you're going to get
anything useful after X
of hours have been spent in the project
so my customer was actually fairly
warmed to the idea of time and materials
but when pressed they said well we yeah
we could consider tie materials but you
know time sheets now I'm we're not
bothered about those hourly rates no no
we just want you to deliver stuff so I
said well how is that going to work then
but actually a lot of the reluctance to
do time materials was also on the Sony
side how can we make sure that the
customer is happy that we're delivering
value for money and then another sort of
more cultural aspect of that is that
Sony isn't really the sort of company
that just hires out bodies you know
we're not one of these big consulting
companies or companies that just has
lots of people to hire out to do stuff
there were questions about intellectual
property what does that mean for our
products if people are paying for time
materials so time mathilde was out fixed
price fixed scope well that's out
because we haven't got any fixed scope
we're working from the backlog it could
be anything so what we need is something
else how can we sell this thing does
anybody have any ideas so timing
materials so how do you
so the last time sorry so the response
there was two bodies for fixed period of
time no no no timesheets just pay for
those two people or however many you
want to bill for so actually the the
other time I've done this this session
and I asked the same question and there
was a guy there who said well he did
exactly that so he worked for a very
small company and he said well we just
have a monthly subscription and the
customer pays us to do stuff and
everything is open-source and if they
don't like what we're delivering then
they can walk away at any time I was
like yeah that's absolutely brilliant
but I'm not sure that would work for a
corporation because I'm not sure the
legal people would be happy with it
because they want to get some they want
to be assured but they're going to have
something of value delivered I don't I'm
not sure it will give them the business
confidence but I like it
oh no well they want to be invoiced but
they don't want to have to deal with
things like Tyson you know this person
is a junior person and he's charged at
five pounds an hour you know this person
is a senior person in his ten pounds an
hour you know did that junior person
actually deliver anything for the time
we spent on them you know yep so so the
suggestion there was to price each
feature yep yeah yeah okay fantastic
suggestions so the first suggestion was
to price each item as as you go along
actually I have a colleague who is doing
that for another customer another
colleague of mine who's running a
similar type of thing
the only problem were one of the
problems with that I think is is how you
get commitment that they're going to pay
for a certain amount of stuff for an
ongoing time and if they don't do the
minimum loan yep yep yep so the answer
there was to put in a minimum maximum
load penalties if they stopped trying to
procure additional work packages
essentially but from what you're saying
you would have to price each one
individually as you go along so again
like that one the only thing I don't
like about that is you have to kind of
think carefully about the price for each
one and it feels a bit more bureaucratic
than your second suggestion which was
what do you call it functional points
lines of code yeah I think I could write
a lot of lines of code if I was being
paid for that yeah
but yes some symmetric for for
delivering any other suggestions fight
it by Sprint's and how do you know how
much you're going to get pursuant or do
you just yep yep yep yep yeah yeah yeah
okay all all good suggestions and you
know all going along the sort of lines
which I'll be going along so let's just
see what the project management
methodologies say about this
so dsdm it's narrowly branded as agile
p.m. what does it say about agile
contracts so it says where the supplier
and the customer are from different
organizations and development is covered
by a formal contract the relationship
must accommodate the evolution of the
solutions requirements well yes that's
what I'm trying to say without imposing
ownerís change management overheads and
it does talk about measurements so it
talks about measuring outcome as opposed
to output so you know I want my media
logistics solution to enable me to
deliver high quality video to all the
people who play it out but it doesn't
specify that in order to do that we're
going to have a GUI and we're going to
have this and that so outcome vs.
outputs but it doesn't talk about that
as a basis for a commercial relationship
so a bit more of a new kid on the block
prince2 agile which is like the agile
version of prince2
which actually does a reasonable job of
marrying up agile and project management
if anybody's interested
so it says again if possible make the
focus of what is being delivered outcome
based inference to output based but
again I'm quite nervous about making my
contract outcome based I really wouldn't
want to sign up to something that talked
about the outcome unless they were very
clear metrics on what it was that the
outcome was measured on and actually
from the customer point of view I don't
think I'd want to sign up to that
without having some idea of how my
supplier was going to meet these these
outcomes so that one doesn't really fly
with me but it does say a middle ground
between outcome and outputs is is to use
things as service levels or throughputs
eg velocity story points points you
mentioned functional points so how can
we sell the throughput so story points
we all know about story points right
agile story points there's always some
debate on what is a story point is it
complexity or is it efforts but let's
just refer to Mike Cohn big agile person
and he says that story points represent
the effort involved to deliver a product
backlog item so that's great that's like
where you're going with with functional
points but I can hear you saying well
hang on that doesn't make sense because
five points for this team here isn't the
same as five points for this team here
it's a relative thing so what we need to
do is fall back onto the slightly lesser
sibling of the of the story points which
is the the ideal day ideal developer day
and in the project approach which I
mentioned earlier what we did is define
an ideal developer day and what it means
so the ideal developer day is a is a day
where a developer can just get on with
their job without undue interruptions
but doing anything related to the work
that they're supposed to be working on
we actually started with points in the
in the first contract and with
this definition but the customer is
still pretty nervous about points so we
actually renamed everything from points
to ID DS all the way through just to
make them feel better and then what we
did is say well we'll what goes into an
ideal developer day an ID D now you
could cut this various ways you can say
an ideal day consists of all your
activities but the way we cut it was to
say well the ideal developer day is just
the day developing the software and
we're going to make some assumptions
about the activities that funnel into
that and the activities that funnel out
of that so before the development we're
going to have workshop design
discussions write some stories and then
once the software's ready we're going to
be doing some testing with customer
we've got a deploy it got to do demos
bug boards that kind of thing now again
we're making an assumption here and some
features you might find that the funnel
at the top is very wide because it takes
you ages to get something that you're
discussing with the customer to the
point that you can develop it and there
may be other features where that funnel
that the talk is going to be very narrow
because the customer says well please
can you implement this and we'll say yes
that's really obvious we'll go ahead and
implement it but when you put together
your you're costing you're making an
assumption about all these kind of
overhead activities that go on to
facilitate the the developer getting on
with actually developing the software so
then our statement of work becomes
really simple all the customer says is
actually I want buy 100 idds over six
monthly drops for five hundred pounds
all really simple what could possibly go
wrong so what we end up here is actually
not too dissimilar from fixed scope
because we're defining the story what
we're going to deliver and we have
effectively a price per idd so what
we've got is kind of like a story level
fixed price fixed scope
as a vendor I'm making a commitment to
deliver a particular story which we've
estimated for say three idds
now if it turns out that it takes a week
or two weeks to implement then you know
we've estimated it wrong and there may
be some stories where we slightly
overestimates and some stories where we
slightly underestimate but overall you
know the idea is that it would all kind
of even out and if we do get it wrong
then it's only on a per story basis so
if I lose money because I underestimated
at least it's minimized to a particular
story we're not signing up to some
million pound contract where we've got
it so completely wrong that actually it
costs us five million and the nice thing
about this is that there's no burdensome
burdensome change request process and
it's a bit more slick than giving a
price per work package because each time
you get something new to do you don't
have to think about how much it's going
to cost you you just estimate it with
the developers and continue the process
so it just makes it a lot more slick so
does this work how can we make this work
in practice
did it work when I tried it trust Trust
is one of the key things in this process
when I was trying to sell this
internally about this this new way that
we could sell projects to customers or
to this particular customer people like
well that's great because you know if
you fall behind then you can just up the
estimates can't you that's not the point
because as soon as that trust breaks
down the customers not going to renew so
at the end of the day you're going to be
out of pocket more than if you were just
honest in the first place and so one of
the big ways that we've got trust in the
process is we always have the customer
present for our planning poker
estimation sessions so all in a room
with all the developers any be a
solution architect whoever and the
customer can totally hear what we're
talking about and when the estimates
vary wildly
customer gets to hear that they get to
hear you know warts-and-all
what the developers think and and we
don't censor the developers on this this
either it's all about building up the
trust and confidence in the process so
other advice I'd give to make this work
is the preparation so you know you can't
skimp on those activities before the
development you know you need to have
those detailed design discussions the
stories need to be quite detailed now
that may feel a bit less agile you know
you might get accusations of squirmer
fall where you know you're kind of doing
mini waterfall for everything but to a
certain extent I think you need that
extra detail that you might not
necessarily get or do beforehand if you
were doing say in-house developments you
know they're typically your development
team isn't going to be located in the
same building as your customer so you
can't just get up and go and ask the
customer a question and if you're going
back to the stories later to work out if
something is an issue or a feature
you're going to have to refer back to
what you agreed to do in the stories so
you know adding mock-ups scenarios
diagrams that all works well for this
and if you can lob it onto a digital
board that makes it very easy for both
sides to work off of the same
information so this is a typical story
from the project so we've got the
original description which is kind of
quoted from the customer this one we
actually mainly implemented with me
something that had already been done
with some extra changes so you know
maybe this is less detail or more detail
than stories that you're used to I don't
know so bonus include accept acceptance
criteria now in an ideal world the
customer will be sat down with us
writing the acceptance criteria at the
point that we're writing the stories
unfortunately a lot of customers the
reason they've got you in in the first
place to do the development is because
I haven't got time to do the development
themselves so if you can get them to
write the acceptance criteria great we
end up hatch B writing that ourselves
and then having the customer validate
that one of the ways we do that is
collaborative test tools so this enables
us to to write kind of a set of steps
for the customer to to go through what
we've delivered and naturally check it
off so this is JIRA there's a plug-in
called Zephyr that goes into JIRA that
allows you to run cycles of tests I'm
sure there were other things from other
companies that do the same kind of thing
and there were other as well as JIRA
you've got sunglasses pivotal tracker
other online digital board type things I
was quite skeptical about the digital
board at the start of the project I'd
always been you know one for physical
boards moving cards around you could
maybe have a physical board and then
just replicate the information into here
but you know these days if you're doing
your stand-ups around the board
there's no reason why you can't have a
big screen where you do your stand-ups
and you can all huddle around your
digital board it isn't I'm not sure you
would lose too much there and this is
our board which are the customer can see
and we can see and we work them on a
daily basis and the other good thing
about the digital digital type boards is
you get the reporting and the tracking
for free and again we're not hiding
anything here you know if the customer
wants to see how we're doing in aa
sprints or whether we've delivered as
many idds as we said we would it's all
there freely available for them to see
where we're not hiding anything
so what could possibly go wrong why
isn't everybody doing it are you doing
it is anybody doing it so what's the
relationship between Sprint's or
iterations drops and points what happens
if we say that we're going to do 10
sprints for
100 points and we don't deliver them all
that those points in that time oh what
if we over deliver so say we deliver
those points early does the customer
still get the same number of drops and
we spent quite a lot of time discussing
this but in the end we just settled on
the simple fact that we have to deliver
that many points and if we deliver them
early then the customer gets less
Sprint's and if we don't deliver in the
time that we thought the customer gets
gets more Sprint's so we've had this
more than once in a particular phase
it's quite difficult to get your
velocity back on track if you start
going off track for whatever reason so
we've had snow as where we've gone off
track and it doesn't matter often if you
put on extra resources trying to claw
back the points that you lost last last
month it is hard so we go off track we
carry on we don't quite get back on
track again and we end up having to add
on an extra an extra drop and I have to
say I did miss sell this a little bit
internally when I was selling the
concept originally I say it's great
we'll do these points and it's ten
months what you know and we'll just
deliver the points and I don't think
people internally had quite realized
that actually there is risk there
because you know if all your team gets
run over by a bus tomorrow
you're not going to deliver any points
and your project will continue a lot
longer than you thought and you'll end
up losing money so one of the other big
challenges that I found is is feeding
the backlog the backlogs like a hungry
dog it's always there asking for more
food before you know it the next sprint
is upon you and if you haven't got
enough stuff there isn't a suitable form
for the developers to get going on then
what do you do do you just as a
development team just you know kick
their feet up if they do then you're
accruing cost for them even though
they're not doing anything
so we've been pretty close on many
occasions to not having enough specified
now again having a good customer is is
very important for this because you know
you'll you'll be at the start of a month
and your customers say well next month
I really want to get this feature in so
let's workshop this this month but the
feature turns out to be really
complicated and you get to the end of
the month and you've had three workshops
and you still can't quite agree with the
users how are you going to approach this
and all that month you've spent so much
time talking about this really
complicated thing that you haven't got
anything else ready to take up the the
sprint backlog for when the Sprint
starts so keeping an eye on that all the
time is is is really critical and from a
contractual point of view we've not
really figured out what it means if we
don't have enough I suppose you could
argue that if it's because we haven't
got enough specified then it's Sony's
fault and we should just take the cost
but you know if there's nobody available
at the customer side to discuss these
things you could argue that they're the
ones who are delaying so another tool
that we used here was to have two
backlogs so in agile you would typically
have a product backlog and a sprint
backlog sprint backlog is what you're
doing in your sprints and the product
backlog is the whole thing but we just
extended the Sprint backlog a bit more
to include anything that's ready for
that to go into the next sprint or maybe
the sprint after that and by separating
those two things out it gives you a lot
better visibility on how much stuff
you've got that's ready to go and then
the last thing that you really need to
think about that can go wrong is is how
to deal with support or operations I
guess is what people call it these days
but Sonia it's called support where you
normally have a big project so again
thinking back to our old example of the
tape decks the cameras the video
switches you know you deliver this and
then say the tape deck breaks and you
phones
pause he say my tape decks broken can
you send me another one spot say yep
that's fine I know how to do that but
there's nothing really changing about
the system so when things go wrong the
the operations guys that are really
happy dealing with this stuff and they
know what to do but suddenly we've
completely ruined their world instead of
having a not live system that goes live
with little change we've got this big
bit in the middle where they're now this
they're responsible for the system
because the support contract started
once the system went live
but these pesky developers over here
they keep on changing stuff they're
delivering new stuff every month if
you're a support person you know how are
you expected to deal with that and this
really brings in their sort of DevOps
sessions that have been had during the
conference and that whole movement and
and it really forces you to engage with
some of the practices of bringing those
operations people into developments I'm
not going to make a big speech about
DevOps but unless you sort this out what
you'll end up with is some very unhappy
operations people and it'll also impact
your ability to deliver the I D DS that
you've committed to because you'll get
lots of calls from the operations people
asking you to help out so you need to
factor that in so final thoughts how can
you make this what what the success
factors to make this work so the first
one is about the people and the
responsibilities really having the right
customer you know we had a really
pragmatic customer who wanted to work
this way and really happy to take
responsibility for stuff so any
decisions we make about what to pull out
of the spin what's put in the sprint
whether to making certain decisions
about what's going live and what's not
you know the customer is always there
with us making decisions together and
particularly that that product owner
role it is is key could you take a
customer who's not so nice and get them
to do this methodology I think that
would be a question I'd really like to
see somebody take a really horrible
customer and try this method with them
and see if it works
I don't know engage and be honest so
don't try and gain the system be honest
keep your integrity and don't let
anybody higher up in the chain try and
tell you otherwise we talked to our
customer pretty much every day we have
scrum calls with the customer it's it's
a high-touch engagement it's not one of
those sorts of engagements where the
customer signs up to something walks
away and then comes back a six months or
a year later and we have the advantage
that we know the domain really well we
know what we're delivering we've done
this type of project many times before
so we're confident about our estimation
the people in the teams are pretty
consistent could you do this with a new
area of Technology mmm
it could be worth a try but again you
maybe don't have quite the confidence
there that'd be enough to bring the
customer on board I don't know
interesting question and I'm sure
there's still a place for fixed price
fix cope or TNM and hey if you can get
your customer to sign up for TM
with no questions asks then go for it or
credit to you need to be an open-ended
contract where you can walk away at any
time yeah
and that's it has anybody got any
questions yeah hello you were saying
that you are having ongoing interaction
with the customer they're part of this
the the scrum calls etc which seems to
me yeah against that how did you stop
them from interfering there seems to be
a bit more too much interference
yes so how do we stop the customer from
interfering so I probably wasn't very
clear on that so once we've committed to
what's in the Sprint the customer can't
change it so we're having daily
conversations but that's more about you
know the operation of the platform
talking about things on the backlog
talking about any support issues but the
the Sprint is still sacred you know once
we've signed up to what we're delivering
in that Sprint's where we're doing you
know normal scrum from that point of
view and actually and the customer
respects that and again that comes back
to having the mature responsible
pragmatic customer who's gonna respect
that because otherwise I think the
process is just gonna fall apart just so
understand the model is actually a fixed
price per feature function per ID deeper
future function yeah yeah but the ID D
is just a way of making a fixed price so
saying yes to deliver this screen I'll
use seven days at five thousand so
that's a fixed price yes once you define
that that price doesn't change exactly
yes take twenty days we could take
Japanese yes exactly
yeah yeah it's up to me as the as the
vendor I'm making a commitment to
deliver it for seven if it takes me 20
that's my dad it's fixed price yeah
sorry how can you include the technical
refactorings into this approach how can
I include technical work technical work
like refactoring or cleanup or
redoing some work from the past which
turns out to be not so good yeah
so it's good questions so I think again
it's that comes back to being honest and
making sure that the customer is present
at the the estimation and the planning
poker sessions so if we get to a feature
and the developers say we'll look we
really can't do that as part of this
piece of work without a big refactoring
we have to put that into the estimate so
it doesn't give much scope for
refactoring things which aren't changing
but if you get to an area which is being
changed for a new feature you you have
to bundle that estimate in and the
customer has to accept that and again
without a mature customer again I think
that would be very difficult but because
there because we're being open and
honest about what it takes you know I
think we can do that so we've had a
feature recently where the customer has
a particular workflow to do some
functionality and what they wanted to do
is augment that to do a lot more
functionality and we've said to them
we'll look we can't really build that on
top of the one we've already got we need
to start afresh and actually they've
been fine with that you know there are
benefits for them as well because it
means the old functionality can run on
the old version and by developing this
new version separately we're thinking
with completely new code it means that
they can continue their business
operations on the old one without having
any risk that we're going to to break
things with this new development so yeah
I think it gets back to having an
understanding customer
okay I think that's it thank you
everybody enjoy the party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
