coming a little bit of a sound check my
voice does go a little
I'm preparing the sound people to scream
every time I've raised my voice which
happens a lot it is now 1740 thank you
for taking time to to come and listen to
me ramble and rant about HTTP api's I
know it's a very busy slot with very big
headliners so thank you for spending a
little bit of time with me I am
Sebastian and I'll be a host for the
next hour and we're going to be talking
about links data api's or as i like to
call them how to stop reinventing the
bloody will all the time and to
introduce you to the topic you'll notice
there's a little bit goodbye there's a
little that's a good info right I've
just emptied half of my room just by
saying hello you know that the rest of
it is going to go down well this is the
link on this there's a laser I'm sure
there's a laser there so here's the link
where you can have access to the
comments and the questions that people
already asked previous videos of the
talk and anything else that is related
to that topic in case you fall asleep
like I usually do when you send it to
discuss all this of course we're going
to be doing it through the medium of
Mary Poppins Mary Poppins does anyone
know who wrote Mary Poppins they went in
a movie saving mr. banks okay there's
something interested about Mary Poppins
it was written in 1964 do you know what
else was written in 1964 the first line
of basic code and it's absolutely
completely useless piece of trivia but
it allows me to connect Mary Poppins and
code which allow come in come in and so
yes that's the explanation why Mary
Poppins and Mary Poppins because she's
awesome Mary Poppins as you know was was
a nanny and she took care of the bank's
children
and then an economic crisis happened I
don't know if any president had an
orange skin at that point but certainly
the economy was in a bad state and so
Mary Poppins decided to recycle herself
into into oops I'm not very dexterous
with this she decided to reconvert
herself and find a new job as a web
development agency because that's what
you used to do back in the days you know
IP protocol / pigeon carrier comes from
those days it's an RFC go check it out
but she decided to create a web agency
to develop to develop HTTP API and so
she went to her first consumer she
discovered that she had a customer
already waiting for her this is really
not working at all click customer
arrived this is the pigeon lady everyone
recognized the pigeon lady and the
visual lady said our wide I've got a
business model I want to build an API no
that's not how it usually happens of
course you don't that's not a business
model any company they're trying to tell
you an API as a business model is a
company should probably not learn not
learn the name of for they will probably
disappear very soon however there is a
business model behind the pigeon lady
she wants to sell bird feed josef albers
fee that's her business she wants to
deliver bird feed selling as a
distributed software architecture cloud
microservice restful enabled insert next
lingo in there and so that's the first
customers that they get and of course
any good web agency shoot what's going
ok I'm going to drop this cuz I don't
like it doesn't work boom so she wants
to be sale but feed we have established
and needs feed the birds
and a service we're going to design
which is selling the bird fees now any
good web agency has a junior developer
in it it says the junior developer it's
called bird but is very very keen on
HTTP API is he loves the idea that rest
is crud with Jason over some random
pieces of data that you sent over HTTP m
it just magically works because you've
read all the books you read all the
blogs and even put a v1 and v2 and as
URLs assume a other talk about that but
um so we also have we also have a proxy
customers right now other people are
going to use the API they are very young
but very very very smart so they already
know how to use api's but they start
from really not knowing very much in the
table right so there's a service of us
hitting diverse we need to know how are
we going to feed the birds what's going
to be the technology we use of course
but as a good girl as a good girl expert
beginner is proposing to build our own
network protocol because who doesn't
want to build an asn.1 passer and mary
poppins of course is not very impressed
and now now I've read about this stuff
it's HTTP is really cool let's use HTTP
instead it goes everywhere and
everybody's very happy why are we using
HTTP and services it's a small it's a
small community I expect you to answer
when I asked questions are the way them
I'm going to feel very lonely on this
stage because it's a standard why is it
good that it suspended you can take
advantage of the fact that people have
already implemented a standard for you
that's why standards are useful this is
because we have a thing called network
in fact the network effects of the
effect that one user of a good service
good also it has on the value of that
product to other people if I use a
standard and then you user standards
then we both use the same standard we
can reuse code we can interoperate we
can discuss about the stuff where the
spec is unclear we can argue about who
passed the ABN I think correctly I mean
there's a lot of stuff you can do from a
standard but mostly it's about the fact
that the wider technology is adopted the
less work for you in theory you get
though we did try that with WS star but
we've learned a few things since then so
HTTP inhibit quitters you have HTTP
libraries everywhere you don't have to
think about how to do a get operation
and HTTP is composed of a bunch of
things I'm putting them in there because
it's useful to remind ourselves or HTTPS
about it is not an RPC protocol or cross
protocol it's a protocol that exposes
things right things called resources the
only thing for something to be a
resources that it has an identifier that
is a URI that is it there is nothing
else I can take a coffee cup and writer
you are I on it and becomes a resource
easy simple and I can manipulate that
coffee cup through operations HTTP
methods HTTP verbs for people from the
90s and their frameworks but we have an
operation where we can manipulate each
of those resources using again the same
semantics across the whole internet get
always mean retrieved to me something
useful about that resource and then
whenever I asked for something which is
the operation also get a response so
five you buddy should be quite
comfortable with with this so if I try
to get / mary poppins I get 200 super
careful
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious which
after four beers is quite a mouthful but
nevertheless valid HTTP response I think
it's useful to my
people that ok is not the only thing you
could put in there and so we have common
responses they mean the same thing
across the whole internet if it's a 400
range of the client it's something wrong
in festive 500 range asp.net did
something wrong if and if it's a 200
something went quite right now all this
stuff is standardized and it's allowing
us to model things because we have a way
to give names to things anyone
interested in psychology can go and read
Allah can and the child god that creates
things by naming them that's exactly
what we do where we build infrastructure
we give you our eyes to things because
we want to talk about them independently
we can interact with them in a standard
fashion they all support stuff that is
known over the internet all these things
I've standardized every single service
will implement post patch put gaps and
all the other standard methods and we
understand the result of the interaction
in the standardized fashion which means
that everything or piece of code that we
can use is going to understand even for
an API they don't know if something was
successful or not that's the value of
the network effect that allows us one
interface to be told for everything the
network effect is just not the
technology is also the knowledge if you
know how to use one HTTP API at the HTTP
level then you can use the next one
right all this stuff should be pretty
basic and everybody should now
understand that it was different ten
years ago and we were talking about this
because everybody was trying to write
data on a get by fetching stuff in the
URL crary parameters but thankfully
we've moved on people are discovered
post yay that's good and but this is why
we do that so so I've got a website I
know how to send it a request but I
still need to know how what you asked
the lady right I kind of know that I
want to I'm a human being if I go to a
web page how do I know how to order bird
feed on a web page yeah I click on the
link because the Glink has a text saying
bye bird feed or I bought bird feed from
that lady you want
believe I have an X dot right and so so
how do you interact with this stuff
right I mean you need to get a form to
do it so bird says all right now I just
discovered that they are they are backup
files from our databases so why don't we
just take that send it to the customer
and then they can go in the binary and
add the stuff they want to go back right
our own binary binary representation of
a resource so Mary Poppins is not
impressed of course because you know she
she wants to ship stuff so there instead
of just saying a blog of binary that is
only for that service and only works for
that service she proposes to use a
standard piece of Jason Jason like XML
before it is very good at representing
structured data right so far it's very
easy but just like HTTP gaves us
standard methods standard operation
standard response codes and standard
identification standard ID'd well when
you get to Jason you've got standard a
standard object that has a webel libel
which has a key and value of wiggle
wiggle wiggle wiggle right if you're a
generic processor and you know that this
application Jason this is what you're
seeing of the world you have absolutely
no idea where the weebles mean because
the applications like Jason media type
is just representing the structure
there's a thing there is an object on a
house key value pairs and it has other
objects inside it right is this useful
already what use do we get out of them
the fact that is structured data in the
standard fashion what can you do with it
if you know that is Jason as opposed to
just a stream of binary like if I click
on something that is binary and I
barroso doesn't know it it downloads the
file I can't really do anything with it
when it's jason has anyone using
adjacent view and chrome right so Jason
in Chrome if you have the right plugin
will draw nice little squiggly things
nice little colors and there will be
unfold above plus and minus because what
you described it in suspended fashion is
the structure there is a parent-child
relationship between objects and that
allows a generic browser to provide
generic functionality which is to
provide little plus and minus just like
XML did 12 years ago it 12 years ago
thank you what is 95 X&amp;amp;O 22,000 thing
started in 96 and hey doesn't matter
most of you were not born I see all of
human up on except for but I won't say
who so yes that's why we go with Jason
while we use Jason now we have structure
with DES Daesan structure that means
that we can embed things in things
coming me he dives allow it exactly to
do that we have a structure that is
common across the whole internet will
control everything the network effects
we can reuse existing libraries again
but I just have a structure right now
right it's a chunk of binary I can't
really do anything useful with it the
API doesn't have any description for
that now your server may pass in the
information than me as a generic piece
of code I can't know that there is
anything except we both swivels right
because I can't click on the link yet so
what Bert is suggesting is all I know I
will do will just write documentation
and put your eyes on their templates for
everything I will put it in
documentation and because we're very
very very at the top of our technology
game will put it in mug down format and
then we'll do a word version so that the
enterprise people don't get too shocked
so yes you could do that a lot of people
are doing that this is this is our PC
disguised as as HTTP has anyone seen
that before is anyone using github
documentation on the api's yeah they
probably they publish your bunch of your
right templates for each of their you
arise if you want an issue you take HTTP
blah blah blah / issues / and then the
ID
right the identifier but what did we
discuss just earlier what is an
identifier and web technologies a URI
that's why it's called a URI uniform
resource identifier so when you publish
a bit of string where you put an ID to
give an ID that's that's nothing to live
to be a little bit strange to me because
you already gave it a name I don't know
where you need to but fair enough people
like exposing the internal ID from the
data bases across the internet and I
understand but yes you could publish all
the URLs and a lot of a lot of services
do that this is usually my reaction when
people suggest that she's got better
jaws than me but she was younger than
the other time nevertheless we'll just
use a format not support sling so
instead of trying to write them down in
markdown because as we know
documentation away stays in sync with
code right and what we'll use is the
language maybe that suppose links
already right we'll embed the links as
part of the response in a generic
fashion so anything that understands
links can navigate without actually
understanding the content of the pages
is what makes the web I can put the link
the browser doesn't understand what I'm
selling it just knows there's links and
photos links so we did that with HTML in
HTML 10.9 whatever it was the first HTML
already had that and 25 years later HTTP
API developers a discovery that looks so
good idea so we were used these things
so we need to select which links right
now as we said earlier when I want to
buy bird feed I need to know where to go
when I'm a human being i use the text to
decide which links i'm going to follow
when i'm a machine that can't do that
because not everybody has Watson from
IBM running the show and so you know
doing contextual analysis on text to
decide which links to follow is not
going to be a very practical solution
so we invented some people call it type
things and it's it's a it's a way to
describe it it it sells well so I'll use
it every use it here but we have a link
to the pain thing that we want to drop
in and I typed it with a relationship of
next they went in a rel before they were
not seen around before now link or a
legal stylesheet link rel alternate'
there's a lot of different things so
with that type links by having the link
and a description that is always
standard as well and always well
described of which link to follow this
is your equivalent of the text on a base
thing by the bird feed here so you
follow this link because that's encoded
as part of your contract very early on
saying when you want a bird to buy bird
feed you find the link that has a rel of
bird feed buying so people invented a
bunch of languages to allow you to do
that how is a good example of that from
mike kelly you can see that i forgot to
put the title at that and you will also
see that we still have the structured
data that Jason gives us we also have a
standardized way of between your link
with a relationship of author which is
your cell becomes less about this is my
URI to describe me and you will see we
still have here our wibblewobble equal
weeble wobble because right now where
we've standardized is now I have a
document that has links but the document
itself is still a bunch of wibbels that
are particular to your domain so we've
come up with half of me to the media
times just like HTML was and we still
have exactly the same benefits i'm not
going to go for it again we shall the
same benefits we can use how libraries a
browser that understand how links can
probably give you nice little clickable
things mostly because Jason didn't have
links all dates and it's done the most
used data interchange format in the
world which is probably over a good
reflection of the state of our industry
but there you go no dates no links and
the most widely use format in the world
so doing it right is not necessarily
useful for adoption nevertheless will
have Jason we have links once you have
links are sprayed you can navigate to
the form but how do you understand why
she actually talks about well you could
just take you know all these wibbles and
describe them into a big word document
just long line alongside all the links
you have I said well you know we'll have
a key there that is called all the lines
and then insides there you have an order
with a quantity and the product you know
the kind of examples that bore everybody
to death but you can describe your JSON
document in that way and you could
publish it in a word document says but
because it's easy it's simple everybody
everybody has words now right and again
instead of doing that we could just
continue pushing all the stuff that you
already know about by pushing a little
bit further down and now you will notice
first and foremost the absence of any
wibbles rebels there is none because now
we usually standards not only for the
links but also for the format so here
for example I have so the context block
you can look at a separate bit you can
put that into another document this is a
description of the of the inside of the
Jason look this is what's your JSON
document is so it looks exactly like all
the JSON you ever sent from your API it
has an offer and that offer how the link
and here the context is describing what
this actually means so offer how the
type of ID what is an ID we discussed
that before what's an idea how do you
write an ID are you are I so we have a
type of ID which means are you all right
that means that it has a name and it is
of type schema.org /url technically it
could be a nod yes it could be an rdf
person it could be a type of data the
important thing is that all this is
absolutely standard and compatible
if I have the internet which I may or
may not have let's try to switch to that
mirror there is a the same value in the
same value we have from reusing and
displaying structured data and links
using standard formats and HTTP
operations has exactly the same in Jason
filling data we can go to the playground
here and the playground is a little
piece of application that shows you how
you can navigate and discover the
content of adjacent file that is
annotated with json-ld I can take an
event for example and you will see that
the event has again the same kind of
structure we have just the key values
like you normally would in your Jason
although in this case it has little
prefixes and then we have a context that
describe exactly what this is so for
example this is a self-describing JSON
document that says that geeky start is
actually a date that's compatible
everywhere if i was to to build a
slightly better playground i could
display that using a calendar control in
a generic fashion without knowing your
API I could extract the interesting
information from it the summary the
location could be standardized as well
and then I could go to any API extract
all the data without knowing what it is
and still manage to make sense of the
content more importantly I don't have to
write a documentation because someone
else already did because these things
are standard and so that applies to a
bunch of things these some of the
examples are not very good but the other
one that is very useful is this way
there is a context that is just
standardizing on schema.org has anyone
heard of schema.org before is anyone
building web pages here on the white
internet okay so if you know about
google and SEO you already know
schema.org because this is how you
annotate your web pages to be discovered
by the browsers this is exactly the same
thing it just says that by the way
everything that comes there is defined
by these guys so I don't have to have
that big block of confusing stuff that
is very
frightening to people that see Jason LD
the first time and now I have name job
title telephone and URL any browser for
an API can cook for example detects that
as a phone number and make your iPhone
call it's because the data type is
standardized across the whole internet
and I can probably use a library to do
it that's Jason LZ it provides you with
the next step in the evolution of AP is
it allows you to reuse vocabularies so
if we switch back to this now yeah that
was Jason LG content so we ask now you
have the phone all the information you
still don't know anything about what
you're doing but you're building a
generic browser because you want to
reuse code so now we know about the data
the contents that is in there and now we
want to pay for to pay for it but we
only have links and data right now so we
can't really do much more one remember
we were talking about operations earlier
with my comedy yet so of course i
usually get so many laughs in this talk
and I what's going on today money is
easy she'll ask for it and give it to us
and we'll put into savings account and
then gets very angry and then very lucky
and die so something something along
those lines it's a terrible story Mary
Poppins when you think about it it's
mostly about deaths and craziness and
anyway so we need to know how to give
the money to the bird lady and we've
seen how we have a semantic way of
describing every single thing in Jason
and in your API in a way that is
standardized across the whole internet
so you don't have to reinvent stuff all
the time but we've not covered
operations this is Hydra for people
interested in mythology or web standards
hydrates and extensions json-ld that
goes the next step so you're recognized
you json-ld contact here you'll
recognize the semantic data here that
says that all this stuff is standards
there is no we will wibble anymore but
we now have
an operation here and that operation is
of type delivery source operation that's
the thing that you embedded in your
contract when you design your code and
it tells you that the thing at that
address can receive a delete message to
have a delivery source operation which
results in the speaker buggering off
from the stage you can try it if you can
do a delete method from your phone if
you had a high to are compatible client
will go to that web page and get me off
the stage without ever writing a custom
HTTP client for it also right how to get
rid of Sebastian with that custom code
it's that I should put that as the
description of the talk so hydra hydra
is a way of describing resources i used
to have a demo for that but this
unfortunately broken so trust me when i
say we could still apply the same thing
within since the beginning generic
browser that can now visit an api show
you all the operations show you semantic
data showing you rich information about
the json that is possible and even allow
you to go to each of the operations that
are supported a little bit like open API
and swagger and the other 25 thousand
different standards we have but this one
is standard and describes absolutely
everything and it's based on json-ld so
of course at that point the children are
very excited they learned so much but
they want to understand a little bit
more by the concepts we saw just a
little bit more because we want to go
early in this dog for there is a party
afterwards so we describe the fact that
there is a thing right there is Mary
Poppins calm I don't know if it exists
but I hope it does and we have the
author of the page which would be here
PL travers we've discussed that at the
beginning and basically what we have is
a thing that has a type link source we
discuss of officer with another thing
that has that has an identifier that has
an identifier and that's it typed link
between the two and now we're going to
go into the thing that you can tell you
brands or other conference attendees
when you start presenting this is the
stuff that makes you look smart this is
called a subject difficult predicates
and this is called an object anyone that
has done a little bit of grammar in a
language they don't know my recognize
those terms it's also the standardized
way of discussing about so we're going
to skip that we're going to skip that as
well cuz I don't want to do it this is
how you make people believe that you are
very advanced of what you do my bit is
better at math than you which is not
untrue for I'm terrible at math but this
is called a directed graph there you go
now you have the keyword you can look
very smart to people we have MARY
POPPINS Mary Poppins as an author which
is PL travers serial 7 knows PL travers
I swear it's true that relationship is
also standard this is friend of a friend
it's a vocabulary that describes people
that know one another and pl travers has
a home page for Mary Poppins look up
Vega all these things are different
nodes in a graph that you can traverse
this is what your browser already does
continuously and what your HTTP API
could do if you design them without one
thing to reinvent the wheel all the time
by building your own custom Jason in a
very poor fashion by throwing objects
down a serializer and hoping for the
best because if you're going to do our
PC to obviously you just don't bother
with Jason nevertheless what we've seen
mostly is vocabularies and anthologies
what we have seen is instead of
designing your API is a bunch of D TOS
that literally die the data from your
from your database and further night in
Jason and hope for the best and because
you're not sure you'll ever manage to to
to evolve any of this stuff because you
don't even know how it happens because
your framework does it for you then you
slap a v1 on it just in case and then
next time you can break stuff by doing a
v2 and love and lose half of your
customers in the process and believe
what you're doing is building more and
more world gardens every single API in
East Java custom clients every single
custom client increases a number of
libraries you have to do I will not I
will say that the majority of companies
are work with have a clean
20 different client access libraries to
access their HTTP services and that's in
the same building just imagine the
amount of code that took so I don't not
giving names but you know what I mean
and it's all over the place like that
right because everybody wants to run
HTTP client so we have 200 of them also
doing things slightly differently so
instead what we can look at is using
vocabularies by extracting the
information agreeing on the terms they
have and creating a list of terms that
are standardizing that other people can
reuse if they want which maps very
nicely too ubiquitous language is a DDG
and a couple of other concerts
especially as you can start doing
equivalences between all these things
this is a stuff that the Semantic Web
tried to do a long time ago but because
it was not based on people actually
doing anything useful for businesses it
doesn't really go and explode it but
today we have a real need to stop
rebuilding the same stuff over and over
again and so you can start learning a
language a vocabulary once say
schema.org because you already need it
for google or front of a friend or DC
cool all these things are well known
you've been using them in HTML for a
while you can apply them to your API
there had to be learned once it means
that developers in your business will be
able to reuse the same knowledge of jit
of the JSON format you use without
having to rewrite a single HTTP client
ever again and you can learn so many
languages and start leveraging the code
we don't really need custom media types
anymore although that MARY POPPINS has
always been a very very optimistic
person if anyone is interested i'll
explain to you why media types are still
very interesting in combination with
json-ld so that people don't see the apt
context in the jason so they don't freak
out because they don't know what it is
and it looks weird because there's an
app in it we can define a custom media
type that has the definition of jj's MLG
