while I was 17 years old I was called a
cyberpunk on Swedish national television
I think that was one of the greatest
moments of my life actually and I'm here
to talk about view I come from a company
called super stereo by the way view is a
JavaScript framework the crowd goes yeah
I've never heard that before
now today if you want to talk about a
yell through framework it's like you
serious didn't you get the memo it's
like it's over man the battle is done
there are like one winner and there's a
runner-up and the rest is like forget
about it
well I'm here to argue differently I'm
here to talk about ujf and I'm going to
do it by using two of the most powerful
entities known to man James Bond and
eighties music and I think 80s music is
sort of like a theme here we have like
dice trades starting up and the latest
cover band yesterday and together they
become power overwhelming so this is by
the way the view from our office window
if we were in a Bond movie we would
totally be the villain but fortunately
we're kind of nice
we like win awards for that stuff thanks
iPad but this image is kind of like this
one so we go back in time to 1985 great
year I got my first computer my
Commodore 64 life's never been the same
but also this is the last performance of
the now lay Sir Roger Moore as James
Bond in a view to a kill is up against
the mad IT billionaire max Oren you can
see him up there holding an Uzi and
they're on top of the Golden Gate Bridge
and saurons henchmen woman bodyguard is
the beautiful but deadly Mayday and I
couldn't find it Christopher Walken who
plays max Oren I couldn't find
Christopher Walken
or Grace Jones so I had to have some
other villains for the story and well
there they are
so yeah it's the warrior two lost or is
there still a chance for our secret
agent yeah well the first thing when
you're front-end developer today David
talked about this yesterday of it it's
that you have to have all this setup
just to get started see frustrating
okay react as some sort of get started
up and sort of view but you actually
makes it a lot simpler to get started
that's what you need
drop that single line of code and you're
good to go you can start writing you
right now no problem if you want to
spend two and a half minutes you can use
you installed web pack you project or
whatever you want to call it and then
you're really good to go
then you have a complete set up
environment what I mean by that is yes
yes yes yes yes oh yeah yes yeah so
that's what you need to get started you
don't need anything else but of course
there's more to you than that view is
really small
it's 28 kilobytes kiseop if you want
routing state management and resource
management API calls then it's around 50
so it's really small it's really fast
it's about it's up to 33% faster than
react it's because the way it
manipulates the DOM and it's yes it's
component-based yes yes yes yes yeah and
you can use another instance or you can
use view X which is like redux but
better I don't want to say better but
it's it's tailor-made view so it really
plays on the benefits that you comes
with yes
oh yeah you can write yes xq like why
why should you you is good enough
without it yes this is the one major
selling point for view as far as I'm
concerned you probably already know it
if you have done any front-end
development you know how to write view
yes as you could see the first slide
that I didn't talk about WordPress is
considering using it the three major
biggest tech compass in Chinese using it
the biggest one has a net worth of three
hundred and eighty billion dollars so
yes people are using it Stack Overflow
laravel gitlab there's really no M to it
yes it already have yes my god yes it
went okay
sorry I mean we have a nice view when I
work it's okay
so back to bond I'm sorry Dave no I
can't do that what yes you can house
really I want to go back to bond the
you're from the wrong from the wrong
decade and you're also not the villain
William I'm looking for even though it's
an interesting parallel cause
Stanley Kubrick when he did 2001 a Space
Odyssey
he used hell as a warning for the power
of IBM that the IBM corporation would
consume all other technology techno
business thingies and but Stanley
Kubrick always said that it didn't do it
but everyone will assume that it was IBM
but when you look at the new digitally
enhanced movies you can see the letters
IBM being reflected reflected in days
helmet so yes it was a warning for IBM
but for our purposes house not going to
cut it so we need a new fresher villain
and of course that still is react but I
say that really there is no there's
really no hard feelings between reactive
view because they are so similar that
you can't really trash talk each other
and as you can see I'm like squeezed in
here between to react speakers and
there's there are no eggs flying my way
yet but maybe that's because they know
of the one major weakness that GPU has
because you have a major major flaw and
these are the things that make a
framework successful I believe and a
online educational company called you
DMA has made comparison
I mean you shouldn't really compare
frameworks but they have like different
stages and they compared view react and
angular and leave well you can see it
yourself but spoilers you did really
really well but there is one major issue
let's react Skype Facebook behind it and
Google is behind angular while view well
it's this guy so that's Evan you he's by
all accounts a genius and now he has a
team working for him so that's good but
it's still for Evan should get hit by
bus or something you would be like
probably well maybe not now when so many
big companies are starting the interview
but still it's a big risk so it's very
difficult to take the leap so this is
from get from github
the popularity of different frameworks
you can see that view has now passed
angular 1 and it's really gaining
traction in terms of popularity the
green one is angular 2 and the blue
rocket is react but if you look closely
you will see that if you compare only
react and view you gets about double the
amount of stars that react us and it's
been doing that for quite a while so
it's got a lot of traction it's got a
lot of momentum it's got a lot of people
wanting to use it the community loves it
and there's also alright sorry and did I
tell you about Max or in the beginning
the mad IT billionaire so his master
plan is to be the only tech company in
Silicon Valley and it's going to do this
by destroying all other companies so
that he may reign supreme and it's going
to do this looking from his blimp on
hi just watching the destruction all
around him Oh on a completely different
note yes yes maybe not completely
different because last year about a year
ago Facebook added a patent clause to
react so it's not really open anymore
they own it and the community was what
what you did what now but Facebook they
took it out six months and then they
released a statement that said well you
have nothing to worry about nothing to
see here please continue and no one
really knows what that means
but it kind of leads me like okay they
do that what will they do next and so I
think the transition to view is sort of
natural for an open-source community but
I'm not here to discuss that I'm talk
about view and what I think you does
best
what why do you use frameworks any one
no one no one uses the framework great
you're all your script developers no no
no no we're lazy yes it makes our lives
easier we do different difficult stuff
and we need something to help us you
like shiny stuff as well as soon as
there's new framework we guys yeah but
view is so easy it's like it feels like
cheating when you do it and we're going
to look at a few examples think I have
time for that drive just about so if we
look - gonna close this down don't say
don't need it anymore
we have some shiny code here if I know
we don't have an HR code where's my
shiny code this work
yes great so if I write this in react we
try to understand this code what it does
well I see that I have a button
I should have begun with this when you
write a view component component
it always has three parts it has the
HTML it has the yellow script it has the
CSS which can be scoped if you like the
template which is the HTML HTML with
some code in it we try to figure out
what this this does it says we have a
button it says click add item add item
says this numbers push this numbers
length of 1 what this and this is part
of their view magic that this keyword
somehow knows that numbers is this
numbers and if you try to do that in
your script you're going to go no no no
no this points somewhere completely
different and if we say that ok so this
button will be disabled if we are length
of this array is greater than 4 and then
we have a component which we pass
numbers and then we have a transition
yes because we have to talk about CSS
animations this is the same ok so I'm
out of time ok quickly I will do this
and we will see I've got a minute yeah
so this is how it works if we have it
always knows what's what in the
component and if we look at the code of
the SIA in the HTML you can see that
there is nothing here there's nothing
here there is a couple of comments so if
you it's not like hidden or anything
it's just not there until I press an
item then it shows up and
the thing this is this is the only thing
that changes in your Dom this is why
view is so fast so if you change one
thing it's not going to change the rest
of the Dom tree it's not going to change
how to check down to find other places
to change it's just going to find this
one spot that it needs to change and
replace it so that's why view is so fast
so with that I think earlier say thank
you
tri view it takes you 15 minutes to try
out it takes you two hours to be
productive even in a production
environment thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
