now being locked you can no longer
escape and I'm really glad you've all
come to learn about the best way to use
punishment to motivate your teams
fantastic fantastic stuff so I actually
wanted to call this blame driven
development but apparently BDD is
already being used who knew so this is
PDD but given that BDD stole something
from me I'm stealing something from them
so here's an example of our punishment
driven development given that a team
isn't delivering fast enough when you
have told them the delivery date time
and time again then punish them with no
bonus and bad performance reviews this
is my suggestion for the real way to get
there they won't do it again Oh coming
late into a punishment type scenario is
not a good news okay so one organization
that I joined had a tale about a
previous CIO that had been there who
apparently whenever anything went wrong
in live would stand behind to the person
who was trying to sort the issue out and
shout at them until it was fixed
apparently this was a really good
motivating way of getting them to do it
I also have another boss who the minute
that anything was wrong would exactly
ask this question who's to blame would
come straight out of her mouth and to
which my response would be it doesn't
really matter who's to blame what
matters is what we're going to learn and
what we're not going to do again and to
give her her credit she would go oh yes
you're right that's fine but this was
still the very first question that would
come out of her mouth each time now I
have a challenge for you I should have
warned you this is very interactive you
guys are not going to get just get to
sit there because otherwise I'll have to
do more work so we don't do that so I
need one volunteer from each side
it's not looking good there we go you
see this side is now winning I'm just
saying we need a volunteer there you go
come on then
so we have the winning team and a losing
team at the moments come up come up so
not too much encouragement please it'll
go to their heads
so here's yours and here's your's your
challenge is for everybody on your side
you need to make sure they have exactly
one of those no more than one no less
than one and all of the spare ones are
back with me okay go faster than this
this is a competition you know I have to
say neither side is really showing very
much enthusiasm on this at the moment
just kind of getting there thank you so
does everybody on this side have one
just hold it up so I can see I don't
think it's quite true there is it thank
you thank you do you have one thank you
you can sit down now I have to say that
wasn't the most competitive of
competitions I've ever seen in my life
too much exercise rather it's not the
competition side it's just like the
effort I admit this is just before lunch
which is quite a good time to do some
punishment I think keep you from lunch
for as long as possible so we're now
going to do an experiment so this is why
you have the cards I'm going to tell you
that there are five stages of this
experiment that were going to go through
but you're not going to know why we're
doing it until the end my husband says I
have to tell people that cause it he
he's very much needs to know exactly how
many and what's gonna go on and where
things are at so for any one of you of
his ilk out in the audience there will
be five so this experiment what you need
to do is show me the green side of your
card if you think that the answer to the
question I'm asking you is low and the
red side if you think the answer is high
we'll go through you'll see what I mean
here's the first part of the experiment
John is at a football game when he sees
another fan wearing a scarf that he just
shouldn't be wearing it's quite
reasonable so he it gives him a chance
he asks him to take the scarf off I mean
that that's very kind really you know
you could have just but he refused
so John hit him so I have two questions
for you after each one of these
scenarios we're going to do the first
one is how blameworthy is John so this
is where you use your cards if you think
he's very much to blame for this you'd
show me the red card that's high if you
think he's not very much to blame you
showed me the green card which is low
okay so so generally this side the
winning side I'm just saying think he's
very much to blame and generally the
losing side think he's not that much to
blame on as a whole
alright I asked in order to get some
obviously very representative answers on
these questions I asked my Facebook
friends all of these questions and they
filled in a lot of fun for me they were
able to do things a little bit more at a
detailed level than you guys so they
were able to give a 1 to 9 answer for
each of those questions so one was not
very a 9 was very and they were able to
do a little in the middle and here's
their results so you can see generally a
lot of people thought that he was very
to blame but that he didn't deserve that
much punishment ok now we do have one
person up there thought it was very to
blame and I think the score there was
about 7 out of 9 for punishment so I
think this guy is probably in prison for
20 years for doing this and there's one
person who obviously does this every
weekend so I I'm I made one big mistake
we're doing this survey that I just put
out there and ask my friends on Facebook
to fill in is it was anonymous and I
actually don't know
who these people were who gave these
answers so if this actually gets a
little worrying as we go on okay so
there are lots of forms of punishment in
the workplace and so the one that I
started with this one that most people
think of it's the manager punishing
people for not doing what the managers
decided should be done but actually we
talk a lot in agile around things like
bonuses etc this was a really
interesting example I was speaking to a
product owner at a conference and we
were all having a conversation about how
can you use bonuses to really motivate
people you know what should we be doing
in the agile world around this and he
had this great answer that he did with
his team which is that he gives them the
bonus as a product owner he's actually
in charge of the bonus in their area and
he gives them a bonus which is inversely
proportional to the number of bugs he
finds in UAT so the more bugs in uit the
lower your bonus and he thought this was
great and that this was what he was
suggesting through so I have an
imaginary team for him so we'll start
off there with Albert so Albert is a new
graduate he's not worked in industry
before so his stuff was okay but he
doesn't really know how to write robust
software that's going to stand the test
of time and is maintainable and all
those things and so he needs a lot of
help from other people that he's just
been there a couple of weeks he's still
coming on board so what do you think
this bonus scheme is going to do to his
output it's interactive Oh red well not
good not good do you does everyone agree
at best it's gonna make no difference to
his output because he can't improve his
quality at this point it's not a choice
that he's making and at worst it worries
him and he actually ends up doing less
well so then we have Betty now Betty at
the moment is actually she has some
really big issues in her personal life
and she's not able to be as mentally
there at work as she ordinarily would be
so what difference is this bonus scheme
going to make to
t0 will give extra stress yeah so at
best it would have no effect and at
worst it might make it worse and she
might golf with stress for a while yeah
and we have Charlie trouble is just
plain lazy so he's going to do the
absolute minimum that he can do so
actually he's probably the one that this
type of bonus scheme was designed for so
what effect do we think this bonus
scheme will have on charlie no code no
bugs absolutely so he's also clever he's
lazy so it's designed for him but he's
too clever to fall for it both of you
got that and he just won't write
anything and then he gets his full bonus
cuz he hasn't got any issues in UAT and
then we have Doris
so Doris is actually really good at what
she does she prides herself on the
quality code that she writes and she
helps all the other team members brings
them along builds their skills so what
impact is this bonus scheme gonna have
on Doris she'll change her focus in what
way stop helping that's a possibility
isn't it focused on our own code any
other thoughts she'll quit yeah quite
possibly so you know I think she would
probably find it highly offensive that
this type of bonus scheme is going in
which she already prides herself on the
quality of the code that she writes and
there's a distinct possibility that
she'll stop supporting the others if it
were to worked for her in some way so
all in all this bonus scheme to me is a
form of punishment it's an assumption
that you're lazy and you're only not
delivering quality because of your
laziness and its motivation is
questionable so why do we punish people
do none of you ever punish anyone so
they don't do it again that's one reason
any other reasons we might punish people
so that you feel better
to assert authority here ah so it's kind
of an ongoing behavior we were punished
before so now we punish anything else
because we might be expected to punish
other people okay so the literature says
there are four reasons that we punish so
this is general rather than necessarily
software world so to put people off from
doing the same thing to stop that person
from doing the same thing for
retribution because it feels good and to
compensate the victim so obviously
you're generally not in the software
world the last one so I think often when
you see punishment in the software world
we claim it's for one of the first two
reasons but it's really for retribution
because it feels good they've done
something bad and we've told them and
that feels good it's nearly always about
the person who's doing the punishing
more than it is really about the people
being punished
so scenario two so John and Steve made
it up though they're good friends now so
they go out hunting
so John followed all the safety rules
but his gun misfires and he accidentally
killed Steve now this wasn't deliberate
I know he punched him in the face before
but that was all over with this was not
deliberate okay so how blameworthy is
John so red side if you think he's
highly blameworthy and green side if you
think he's not okay so we have a bit of
a mixture probably mainly green but
there's a really big smattering of red
there okay and how much punishment does
John deserve hi is red green is low okay
so generally lower level of punishment
although I have to say the winning team
was a little more on the punishment side
than the losing team was so my Facebook
friends generally you can see the
majority of them it is quite
this isn't it the majority of them were
down at that not to blame where they
shouldn't have too much punishment the
one that's right at the top there I know
who that one was because he contacted me
afterwards on Facebook on my desk
questions wrong and and said you know
you shouldn't be pointing your gun at
somebody if you and that's part of the
safety rules etc so he had extra
information which led him down that
route but generally people felt you know
it was an accident he didn't mean to do
it even though the consequences were
high okay I joined one organization
where there was a team where one of the
developers in the team was ostracized no
one liked him no one wanted to work with
him he they would have meetings chat
about what it was they wanted to do he
was much slower on the uptake in those
meetings than the other developers were
he kept asking really stupid basic
questions until they just had to stop
him doing it so they could get on with
their work and he also never would stick
to any decisions that they made in the
meeting even though he was part of
making those decisions and no one wanted
to work with him no one made and you
know everyone knew he knew nobody
respected him in any way at all and I
asked the team to do two things for me
the first one was to let him ask his
questions not to stop him what they
actually found was around a third of the
time he found fundamental issues in the
way that they were going to do something
by asking those basic questions and they
started to see that there was actually
some value in letting him do that and
the second thing I asked them to do was
to actually when they made a decision in
a meeting just send a quick email
afterwards just a one-sentence email
saying we agreed to do X and then he
stuck to each and every single decision
that was made because for some people a
verbal decision doesn't feel very real
and that's where he was that it just
didn't feel very real to him so although
he was part of that he didn't really
feel my husband's like that which is
probably why I picked up but maybe we
could try this
I don't email him with our decisions but
he's but
yeah yeah I slack channel him just say
you're doing this you said you would but
the so he started to be valued within
the team he was having something that no
other person in that team was adding he
was bringing something very different to
that group and actually we see that a
lot where I see a team which is really
close-knit except for one person that
person probably could really add value
it's just that they are not like the
other people in that team but
neurodiversity that willingness to stand
back and accept someone's not like me
but what they're bringing may be more
valuable then I do in that one area you
know let's let's actually experiment
with that we play a special game of that
in my organization called blame the BA
yeah just like I mentioned that okay so
next part of the experiment scenario 3
did someone just come in by the way
shocking come get your card you get a
red card did you come in as well you see
someone's snuck in I didn't notice now
I'm failing in my punishment nurse
that's a technical term in case any of
you were wondering welcome
so scenario 3 Steve has recovered from
his death and but he's not very happy
with John okay so he decides john john
actually as a driver of a security firm
with lots of money in it and steve
kidnaps John's daughter and he says if
he doesn't give him the money then he's
you know he's gonna kill her no he's not
very happy to be fair we have to allow
that for Steve he's he's not a happy man
you know he's been punched in the face
and then he was dead so and John gives
Steve the money and gets his daughter
back so John has committed a crime here
so what we're looking at is John not
Steve but John's so how blameworthy is
John for stealing the money so show me
the greenside if you think that he is
not very blameworthy and the red side if
you think he is blameworthy
okay so we're mainly green with some
smattering Reds and how much punishment
does he deserve green for low red for
high okay with a very tough man at the
back there but generally generally were
thinking he's not needing that much
punishment so here are my Facebook
friends again and mostly they agree with
you there are some hardliners amongst my
Facebook friends apparently
you should make friends with them I'm
not sure exactly which one that you're
on my facebook friend ie I'm just
checking no okay so another form of
punishment this is when we blame
ourselves my most recent example of this
is one of the developers who went on to
live thinking they were on tests and
they submitted something that would have
gotten somebody a new mortgage offer and
luckily they realized the second they
pushed that button but that's what they
had done and we rushed around and
stopped it from actually happening so
there was no customer impact but this
guy was so down on himself and just kept
putting himself down all the time for
doing it gave himself a big note which
is still on his desk to this day which
says do not go on live well sure how
that's meant to help so we tried a lot
of things we spoke to him about all the
terrible things we had ever done of
which there were lots it was it was
quite an amusing story time actually we
also you know sort of said well actually
what can we learn from this so we had a
situation where life looks like tests
why have we got that this is a really
good learning point let's actually
change that so live test dev just have
completed in color schemes so that we
can't do this again also you know there
are other reasons and other things in
there so how come he could login to live
using same credentials that he used in
tests so there's all sorts of lessons
here and things to learn but actually
self punishment is one of the things
that we do that really isn't helpful and
really doesn't push forward
okay because I'm really into agile and
lean we have to have some Japanese words
because apparently it's the law
so hands is about knowing yourself
looking at yourself and what you do and
actually spending that time to try and
understand why you behave the way you
behave and looking at what you can do
about that particularly in this talk
with regards to punishment so here's an
example of one of those I worked at one
organization where yes Batman worked so
for my sins at that time I was doing
project management I'm glad to say I
left that life far behind and he was the
team lead of one of the teams there the
development teams and he he had been
there really long time it was like 2025
years there he was safe he had a good
job they all respected him and he would
just say yeah so mainly I worked with a
different team but there were just some
bits and pieces that I would need from
his team occasionally to help my team
work through and he would just say yes
he would just say yes we can do that yes
that day it's fine and whenever we got
to that day it was not there something
more important had come up so I started
to check in with him earlier and more
regularly is it still going to be a case
it's still going to be okay
and it's like yes don't asking me it's
absolutely fine no problem at all and
yet every single time it wasn't there
when I needed it to be there and I tried
everything with this guy all the tricks
in the books so I tried being nice and
friendly and kind of getting to know him
a bit he wasn't really very interested I
tried to get to know his team to see if
I could kind of get in underneath I even
went to the extent of buying the Marks
and Spencers chocolate biscuits which is
the extreme they normally only come out
as the thank you afterwards for things
but you know there were an offer but
nonetheless it was it was a big thing to
do still don't work made no difference
at all and I've never been in a
situation where the Marks and Spencers
chocolate biscuit bit fails so it was
very hard and what I ended up doing I
was
desperate at this point so I'm just
experimenting trying different things
what I ended up doing that worked was
effectively saying to him oh I'm a bit
ditzy you're amazing you know all this
stuff I'm a bit stupid I should have
asked you before could you help me out
because hey I'm a bit ditzy and you know
get this done for me
and that brought out his it fared his
arrogant side so he was able to feel
superior and then he would do it and he
delivered each and every single time and
I'm sitting there saying these things
not exactly that obviously thinking in
my head you sad sad man but it worked
did it solve the problem for everyone
else and I did it solve the problem of
his behavior no but that wasn't my role
there that wasn't my job there
I was contracting I was a temporary
member of staff he was a permanent
member of staff it wasn't my job to
actually solve this issue as a personnel
issue it was my job to deliver my
projects and I got that and I did that
so I guess that's where I'm I'm coming
from in the thinking standing back
taking your own emotion out of it so I
use the fact that I feel that strong
emotion in the workplace I actually use
that as a signal to say right it's time
to stand back and actually look at what
do I want out of this so what I wanted
out of this situation was to be able to
to get my stuff delivered I didn't
actually care about anything else what I
wanted was to get my stuff delivered and
then I tried lots of ways to try and get
there I also try and do that in my
personal life so my poor husband we got
in my car of a good few months ago now
and I was driving my car but he'd driven
my car the day before and he'd adjusted
the seat and everything I mean it's just
shocking behavior and so I got in and I
had to adjust it and I just felt that
irritation and the minute I felt that I
just stood back mentally and said is
this reasonable and I mean no that's
stupid of course it's not reasonable I
wanted him to drive my car so he was
driving me the day before it wasn't like
he'd just randomly
my car and so I didn't say anything and
I was able to just completely let go of
that irritation straightaway because
right now it's not reasonable so I try
and do that in the workplace also right
scenario for so you've been feeling a
little sorry for John recently but so he
planned to kill his mother for the
inheritance so he dragged her to the bed
lit her oxygen mask with his cigarette
to make it look like an accident and she
burnt to death
so how blameworthy is John for this I
thought you were going to give me a
green then that you kind of pretended it
was accidental and turned it around in
you and how much punishment does he
deserve I think we're pretty unanimous
on red red they're mostly my my Facebook
friends agree with you I am a little
worried I haven't gone on Facebook very
much since I did this poll I'm kind of
thinking I might just sort of slowly
step back from all my friends on
Facebook but yes mostly they agree okay
angry man so I joined one organization
and in my first week there I had
somebody come to me and say you know
I've got this thing I need your team to
do for me we've been having a bit of a
talk about it but you've just started so
you know can you talk to them and come
to me with a proposal so I had a bit of
a chat to my team a few days later he'd
organized a meeting there about ten of
us in there and we start to tell him or
I start to tell him about the ideas
we've had of what we might do to solve
his problem and he just started to get
really angry and I didn't know why he
was having to control his voice it was a
very tight he was having to he was doing
things with his hands he was controlling
it he wasn't shouting he wasn't throwing
things he wasn't doing any of those
things but he was very very angry and
I'm sitting there going I don't know
what I've done to this guy I'm just I'm
not even saying anything contentious I'm
not saying anything that I can imagine
could possibly upset anybody and I had
no idea what to do so I just
continued as if this wasn't happening I
just continued the meeting and at one
point he said he had to go and he left
now bear in mind I was brand new to this
organization so I didn't know the other
people in the room very well at all and
I sort of turned around to them and said
can any of you tell me what that was
about and they said no and I was like
well at least it wasn't anything
obviously stupid so you know I and I was
sitting there not a ton of miles for
this meeting was first thing in the day
and I was just sitting there trying to
Mull what do I do about this I mean I
had all sorts of emotions that came out
the back of that it's quite unacceptable
to treat somebody that way particularly
somebody very new to the organization
but unacceptable anyway also I'm quite
internally referenced so I don't really
mind what other people think of me
because I know I'm good which is great
for me not so good for my manager but so
you know so for me it was okay because
I'm very internally reference but he
didn't know me he didn't know I was
internally referenced I could have been
very excellently referenced and that
could have really affected me and really
upset me and so I had a lot of emotions
around this and the unacceptability of
what happened but as I say I used that
as a signal to myself to stand back and
say what do I actually want here because
I find when I just react out of those
things I always regret it it's never the
best solution that I could have gone for
my situation so I stood back and I said
what do I want and the answer for me was
what I wanted was a good working
relationship with this guy actually the
fact that this had happened wasn't the
important thing the important thing was
how do we work together going forward so
I was ready to experiment again it's
it's kind of like Lean Startup apply to
people and so I was ready to experiment
Bashi the first thing I tried worked
which was quite a shock to me what I was
thinking about was why did he behave
that way I couldn't see anything I've
done to do it so I came up with a theory
that maybe he was unhappy with other
things that had been going on in his
life so maybe there was something at her
maybe there was something like that and
even if I went up to him and said let's
have a conversation about this
it would probably still be very
emotional very fraught very difficult
and in a way I'm saying justify your
behavior to me that's the form of
punishment as well when I'm saying oh
I'm being perfectly reasonable and
talking about it afterwards I'm actually
making you justify the fact you behaved
that way to me so what I actually did
was went up to him and said I have no
idea what I did that upset you this
morning but whatever it is I'm really
sorry and he smiled and that was it it's
really unsatisfying because I still
don't know to this day what I did that
upset him but it worked
I got a good relationship with him we
carried on it was important to me that
he knew that I didn't know what I'd done
so if I did the same thing again it
wasn't like complete Armageddon but you
know to me that was an opening gambit
and then maybe that might lead onto the
conversation if he wanted to talk about
it but the main thing for me was I gave
him a get out clause I gave him his
dignity and that led us to a good
working relationship subsequently so
this is the last Japanese word I promise
so when we talk about continuous
improvement of processes etc I like to
apply that from the to the people side
as well so this is about applying that
to yourself how did that go
could that have gone better could you've
gotten a better answer out of that could
you've worked with that person better
could you have left them feeling better
a new feeling better at the end of that
particular interaction actually just
applying that analytical thinking which
anybody who works in software industry
has and is able to do to your own
behavior into your interactions with
other people the last part of the
experiment so John managed to get away
with killing his mother now I found him
so he's fine he's around steve is still
alive
we've so they're friends now they've
gotten over all of this murder and death
and punching and things for they're good
friends now but they are a bit
competitive with each other they like to
play tennis
and they're out there playing tennis and
you know Steve's easily winning today
normally they're pretty well matched but
you know he's easily winning today and
and John's getting a bit frustrated
about this so he hits the ball really
hard it goes and it hits Steve in the
eye gives him a black eye
so how blameworthy is John for this
behavior oh we've got some competitive
people in the room not where blameworthy
at all a lot of you so about half and
half that interesting and how much
punishment does he deserve oh you're a
bit mean that's like ten years in prison
or something so let's see what my
strange Facebook friends said so we do
have generally different levels of
blameworthiness felt but generally low
level there was someone who agreed with
us kind of like 10 to 20 years in prison
here
you're not my facebook friend either are
you I'm just I'm still trying to work
out who these people are and yeah so why
have we been doing all of these
questions
there was an experiment that was done in
published in 2015 which was looking at
why do we blame people how much do we
blame people are there errors of our
brain which affects that and they were
looking particularly at the dorsal
lateral prefrontal cortex and what they
did they put a magnetic coil on people's
heads and they asked them the types of
questions that I've been asking you
these are stolen from their particular
study they have a lot more than these
and sometimes that coil was turned on
and sometimes it wasn't and when it was
turned on it dampened the behavior in
that part of the brain so it just
dampened it down and when it was turned
off
it had no effect at all and the person
who was sitting there was no sign for
them as to whether it was or not whether
it was off and they asked him a lot of
these types of questions and what they
found was that how blameworthy somebody
thought John was was consistent for that
person
now everybody has their own values and
their own views on the world but they
had enough different questions of
similarity of different scopes and
different areas to be able to tell that
no matter whether the coil was on or off
the level of blame that somebody thought
somebody had was the same but the amount
they wanted to punish them was less if
the coil was on they wanted to punish
them at a lower level than if the coil
was off so there's definitely something
in this part of the brain that makes us
want to punish people so it's not about
how much blame do they deserve so it's
quite an interesting study and actually
in many ways gives me hope because if
that's purely a function of my brain
feels like punishing people at the
moment well that's something I can
overcome there's something I can choose
whether to do or not to do this isn't
something that's inherent and has to
happen I also think it gives us the
chance to maybe install some new
equipment in offices across the land and
so I think what this leads us to is we
have the punishment driven development
manifesto I like to steal things from
everywhere so finding out who is to
blame over working collaboratively
retribution over encouraging innovation
punishing mistakes over avoiding future
mistakes and venting emotions over
achieving goals and we all choose
sometimes to do the things on the
left-hand side rather and the things on
the right-hand side but I would prefer
to change this into the people driven
development manifesto respecting people
over controlling people celebrating
mistakes over punishing mistakes so I
don't mean go out go yeah hey we made a
mistake but actually seeing as a
positive thing that we now know that
problem exists putting yourself in their
place rather than putting the others in
their place changing your behavior over
changing their behavior you cannot
choose to change someone else's behavior
but you couldn't always do
change your own so we have the people
driven development rather than
punishment driven development PDD and
that's been me and that's everything
thank you so we have time for questions
if anyone's got any
so the question for anyone who didn't
quite hear that was when you work with
the Dark Lord what can you do about it
no it was slightly more than that so I
you know my fear is so you look at that
from your own emotional point of view
when you're being blamed for something
whether you're you should be blamed for
it or not it should be irrelevant you're
going to have an emotional response to
that when you're blamed for something
and I think the main thing to do is to
use that to stand back and to ask
yourself what can I do in this situation
I've got somebody they're coming the
blaming the team it's not the team's
fault what can I do about that and your
solution to that was to be
confrontational to him and that worked
for about two months each time and it
may be for him that's the right answer
and in none of this am i saying his
theory go and apply it what I'm saying
is do that stand back think about that
person what do you want out of that what
is the primary thing that you want so if
what you're wanting is for him not to
blame you or for him not to demotivate
the team or for him not to be saying
that to higher level management so you
need to pick which one of those is the
most important thing to you and then
theorize and you can do it as a team if
the whole team's being blamed and look
at how might we achieve that one thing
so if it's that we don't want him to
come and blame us we don't want to have
that conversation we don't want to be
demotivated when that happens well we
have two choices there we either stop
him doing and we stop it to motivating
us when he does it and then there's
different approaches to what we would do
in order to achieve that if it's that we
don't want him talking to high-level
management and blaming us well we start
our own conversations with management
about where things are and making sure
they're up to date with things so it
just depends what that main thing is you
want and when something doesn't work you
try the next thing so it sounds like you
I'm up with a coping mechanism of not
letting him get away with it and that
that actually worked reasonably well it
was just a repeated one so then you have
the question of do do I want to
experiment to find others or am I happy
every two months to tell him to sort is
life out yeah he might walk out on my
talk I think any other thoughts
how would you motivate the lazy person
we're going coming slightly off topic
but that's fine I'm always happy to talk
about anything the so I'm a great
believer you know you've got Theory X
Theory Y stuff I'm a huge believer that
people want to make a difference at work
they don't get up and go in because
they've got nothing better to do
and I think they want to make a
difference and if you allow them to make
a difference people are happy so where
you get somebody who is lazy who's
coming in 9:00 to 5:00 does the least
that they can do when they go in my
first question is why what has happened
in their work life but that's where
they're at did they just not enjoy this
as a job is this just not something that
do they not enjoy the creativity side of
their coding or you know what is that or
have they just been slapped down every
time they've come up with ideas for
change have they just been ignored
whenever they've tried to make any
changes tried to make a difference and
just put back in their box so often that
now they're like whatever
just pay me to come in and I'll come in
so for me in that scenario it's much
more about trying to get inside their
head and understand from them
why they're in that place why they feel
that way yeah so is it yeah
okay so I guess that talk is so if we
look back our odd man out there was an
assumption in their team that the
problem was with him and that it was him
that needed to be fixed was actually the
problem was with the team but there was
there was an accepted thing that the
problem was with him
so in comp in talking to somebody who is
that 95 person if your assumption is the
problem is with them that type of I
would expect that type of thing where
they go okay I'll sort of do some other
bits but as soon as it sort of goes off
a bit I'll just go back to where I was
so is the problem in the system is the
problem in the way that he's being
managed is that the problem in the way
he's been managed in the past and that's
just pushed him down a certain ring so
what does excite him about his job what
if he could do would he really enjoy and
could you give him a little bit of that
whenever you have something like that
maybe he could do that bit and then he'd
enjoy it and then he'd be in a different
place with his job I'm not saying that
answers to the questions are easy
because they're not another example
that's similar to that is like when
you've got a member of a team that's
very arrogant so it's it's the same
thing you know you've got someone who
knows everything whether they do what
they don't and again I would ask in that
scenario why are they like that
why do they need everybody to know that
they're the top person and it doesn't
really matter whether they are the top
person or they're not the topic what is
it why are they needing that and address
that rather than blame them for their
behavior because the minute you start
with the blame is with them that
conversation is not going to get to the
root issue I'm not saying it's always
solvable either because it isn't yeah
okay so the question being as a manager
is it actually worthwhile spending time
trying to sort out the people issues
rather than just hire someone else in
yeah I would say yes as a deeply
committed developer most of my life that
has been somehow gone into the
management route I like to view people
as an incredibly complex code they need
debugging it's it's the most amazing
problem-solving you will ever do is
working with people and trying to work
out how to make them happy because at
the end of the day that's what I'm
trying to do because happy people will
do their job well and I care that
they're happy as well but and so for me
the challenge is fantastic
so yeah I could go and buy another
module off the shelf which may not have
this problem but it might have a
different bug in it that I'm not aware
of at the moment and then I've got to
work out what that bug is well actually
I know what this problem is and I can
get into it and I can understand it and
through doing that I understand people
better I understand that person better I
can make them happier that's hugely
satisfying for me
I've solved that and solved the problem
but I've helped in that problem so that
whole problem-solving approach I think
can absolutely be applied to management
and people to great success is it worth
doing it I get a huge buzz out of where
you have someone in in exactly the
scenario that you were talking about
where they are demotivated and you can
turn them round and into somebody who
loves their job even if their
productivity stayed exactly the same I
get a huge amount out of having done
that having solved that issue I also
love it when I'm doing things and I will
always try and predict every person is
different every individual is different
and when you're introducing change or
you're bringing things through
everybody's going to react differently
and if you are a manager or even if
you're not but you everybody works with
other people you need to try and look at
it from their point of view for that
individual for that
soon not how would I feel if I was in
that situation that's just a starting
place but actually how will they feel
given what I know about them how did
they feel in that situation and so I do
that a lot and I made a change in my
organization a while ago and I had a
really interesting experience where most
people accepted it and that was my
prediction of what they would do and I'd
predicted one person was going to have a
huge problem with it and I sat down with
her and talked about it she went okay
fine I was just like that's really
interesting I'm learning more about her
now because that is not how I expected
to react given what had happened before
so let's think that one through and
another person who I thought would have
no problem with it at all was really
unhappy and that was also really
interesting to me because it means I've
gotten to know him a little better now
than I did before and I can predict him
a little better later so I view
investing in people investing in my
knowledge of them and investing in their
job satisfaction and investing in their
empowerment in investing in them being
able to make as much of a difference as
they want to make at work is incredibly
personally satisfying and also
financially for the organization of
really good investment to make so so the
question there is if they're actively
disenchanted after six months nothing
you can do you've got to manage them out
I've never actually quite been in that
situation I have been in a situation
where the person was not capable of
doing the job so a very different one he
really really wanted to do it but his
brain didn't work in the right way it's
been quite a long time since I've sat
they've let me near LiveCode but you
know even I was telling him how to solve
his problems in a technology that wasn't
my main technology set when I did
program every day and he couldn't follow
the logic and we did have to manage him
out and that was not that was not about
a lack of after he really wanted to do
it and he put in lots of fact
hours but he just was not capable of
thinking in that way I've never actually
had to manage somebody else from an
attitude point of view but having said
that now I'm going to be faced with
something I know that as soon as I get
back to work I'm going to have one of
those situations so I'm not saying it
will never happen just because you're
putting all that effort in and trying to
work it through doesn't mean it's
solvable necessarily that person might
be so far down the track of that but
it's never going to change but I just
have this huge belief in people that you
put up walls if you're a nine-to-five
though it's because you've been beaten
down you've been beaten into that's that
you're going in it's a protection thing
if you can show them they don't need
that protection anymore and give them
chances and give them things and slowly
encourage them out I'm a huge believer
it's doable but you do get the question
from over there is how much of that
effort is worth it when you've got the
whole of everybody else as well
so that's that's got to be a personal
decision it's got to be how much else on
my plate etc but I personally would
always do that investment any other
thoughts from anybody sorry I didn't
hear
what if a team works better if they have
an external person to blame this about
what you were saying okay still not the
most positive scenario there is it now I
put up a slide joking about blame the BA
when when I started at my organization
that's absolutely where we were very
functionally split very functionally
managerially split and everything was
well they didn't write the spec it was
all waterfall when I joined it wasn't in
the spec it's their fault and you kind
of said well when you when you read the
spec was it clear that there was
something missing here that's not the
point you know so that comfort and being
able to blame somebody else really is
covering up to some extent behaviors
that we could have that actually would
help that problem and the more that we
can be collaborative the more that so
you need to accept the edges when I
worked at one point in a sort of
long-term consultancy writing software
for another organization but for many
years for other than kind of go in and
tell them what to do and leave again and
and often my boss at that organization I
would work remotely but there would be
someone there that was running it they
might not be great in one area so maybe
they are really good with the budget but
they don't actually schedule anything so
my view there is well I'll step in and
do that so whatever bits it is if they
do everything great that's fine I'll
just get on with my other work but if
they don't I'll just fill in I'll just
do those bits in between and we'll get
to where we need to be and he doesn't
really matter whether that was my job
where it wasn't my job or someone else
should have done it I think in software
we get a very we'll get a lot of black
and white thinkers and I do hear from
some one of my guys quite often he'll
say well they should have done that and
my response is you're absolutely right
that job role they should have covered
that but you knew they didn't cover it
last time and you could have bobbed
upstairs and had a chat with the guys
and we wouldn't have had this issue so
you know to go and fill in for that so
there's no point blaming they're trying
to do their best job as well it's just
their view of their job is different
from yours
yes yes so the question was have I ever
been in a blame culture type
organization and had to move it so
whilst it wasn't quite as Extreme as the
whole organization was blame culture and
when I joined my current organization it
was strongly influenced in that
direction so blame the BA blame the you
know everyone blamed ite because they
didn't get what they wanted him they
only asked for it the day before things
like that you know it was kind of it was
all over same organization where I was
asked who's to blame when something went
wrong things and I just stood as a
buffer I I started in that scenario by
just being that buffer in the middle and
because I'm very internally referenced I
didn't really care with a high level
management other people on my level what
they think of me so I basically would as
soon as my boss said who's to blame I
would respond with it doesn't matter and
we're not gonna have that conversation
but in a very nice way and as soon and I
buffered my guys so my guys got none of
that they got none of the they didn't
even hear any of the blame talk so that
meant that their culture started to
change and we started to talk a lot more
about continuous improvement and what
can we learn and so that whole language
started to change but I was also using
that with managers higher than me and
started to say ah we're going to do this
differently and we're going to do that
and we made a mistake then we failed
here and I started to very deliberately
used the word failed a lot and failure
in general and experiment I don't know
if I just beat them down it's but I
think the important thing is that it
came from below so once they were
protected from it and not hearing it all
the time they were able to work in a way
where they felt safe and they felt
protected and that bubbled up and people
saw then the results that they were able
to get because they weren't afraid and
because the brain wasn't there now as I
say it wasn't the most extreme it wasn't
like a super blame culture but yeah that
has turned round do
the business still blame IT things yeah
of course we do you know and I'm not
saying that there's no problems at all
but we're in a very different place than
we were anyone else all right I'll stop
punishing you let you get to lunch now
