presenting
or languages after JavaScript's so to
start out I'm Jennifer Wong and this is
my cat fry he's featured later in the
presentation as well I currently work at
Eventbrite as a software engineer and
what you see on the screen is a huge
cake with the name Eventbrite as a
celebration of our 10th anniversary
some people know me as the creator of
human wasteland also known as the poop
map of San Francisco and if you don't
know what that is feel free to ask me
afterwards or you may know me as a
creator of developers developers which
is a dedication to mr. Steve Ballmer so
way back before all of those projects I
actually used to work as a civil
engineer and during that time the
languages so I actually say that my
first programming language is JavaScript
and that's a bit of a lie because when I
was a civil engineer I learned Fortran
as well as MATLAB and when I was doing
my master's in mechanical engineering I
learned G code and embedded C for CNC
machining as well as electro mechanical
systems so I didn't like any of those
languages I didn't really take to any of
them and that's why I like to say that
JavaScript was my first language fast
forward a little bit to 2010 to 2012 and
I was actually working in customer
support in the tech industry and that
was quite an interesting experience and
that's what led me into programming
today so just a bit later let's talk
about some current events that were
going on in 2013 the first developers
kit for the oculus rift was released
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that
there would be prime air or delivery by
drone Google glass was first released in
2013
and the UK was still pretty happy about
being part of the EU
and at that point I also learned
JavaScript and I was pretty excited
about it it's like good news me so this
is a tweet from 2013 with a screenshot
of me pointing out that JavaScript was
number seven in the new programming
languages languages to learn in 2013 I
was like yeah it shows correctly and I
started to use JavaScript so here I'm
tweeting yay my first JavaScript and
here we can actually take a look at the
first JavaScript I ever did so here's
what my website used to look like in
2013 and this is the first pieces of
JavaScript I wrote which is just this
silly navigation and you can tell it's
vanilla JavaScript because it's just
jumping around all over the page so
that's a peek into my history in
JavaScript all right so let's fast
forward a little bit to 2016 we now have
access to a 3d experience at $15 with
Google cardboard 711 paired up with a
company called flirty to actually
deliver 72 make 77 deliveries by drone
prior to Amazon and Google doing so
Google glass doesn't really exist
anymore
and the UK is not so happy about being
part of the EU but I'm one to talk
so speaking of trash fires JavaScript's
been a little bit crazy these days and
so I decided to learn Python while I was
working at Eventbrite and I was getting
a little bit confused by it so here you
see me tweeting that I'm concurrently
writing JavaScript and Python files to
demonstrate the differences between the
two languages to my co-workers and all
the weirdnesses between the two so
that's kind of the beginning of this
talk is I was presenting to make
co-workers and letting them know what
parts of pipe
we're confusing to me coming from the
background of JavaScript so if you could
all think back to a day when you had
first learned a program you knew one
language you thought that was the
end-all be-all
that was the one language to rule them
all and it was greatest now think back
to when you learned your second language
and for those of you who have only
learned one don't worry your time will
come but do you remember those times
when you would be writing code and you
would confuse your syntax and you just
start typing things and things would get
mixed up and you'd run your code the
compilation would be a little strange
and you'd be like wait why is that not
working and then you realize that you've
written it in the other syntax so that's
kind of what this talk is about it's
about trying to write in a new language
after just working solely in one for
such a long time so basically I'm
trading in my curly braces and
semicolons of JavaScript and I'm getting
a bit of rules via Python and a quick
history on both Python and JavaScript so
Python we see here is a high-level
dynamic interpreted programming language
it emphasizes code readability and it's
syntax
expresses concepts in fewer lines of
code than originally possible in
languages such as C++ and Java
JavaScript is again a high-level dynamic
interpreted and untyped programming
language so actually the two if you look
they sound about the same they're
high-level dynamic and interpreted it's
just that javascript is untyped
specifically so just to compare the two
I have this table and you'll see that
both Python and JavaScript have
paradigms of being functional imperative
and object-oriented although with
JavaScript its prototype based Python
was created in 1991 javascript in 1995
and you'll see that they're both
inspired or influenced by C Java and
Perl but you also see that JavaScript
was influenced
by Python and so I was like oh does that
mean that they're pretty similar and
they kind of are but when you're
learning them for the first time they're
really not so let's start a little bit
small some of the first things that I
learn in Python were comments so I can't
tell you the number of times that I've
made mistakes with comment syntax
partially because with CSS common syntax
is almost exactly the same as JavaScript
with the multi-line slash and star
actually later on in this talk it's
funny I just made corrections to some of
my code pieces I had double slashes and
some of my Python code later on and so
you can see I'm still getting confused
even though it seems very simple and
really when I look at the comment syntax
it kind of just looks like a face with
spiky hair to me okay next is whitespace
so when I was learning JavaScript and I
knew JavaScript whitespace didn't really
matter JavaScript was like that's not a
big deal don't worry about it and Python
is like no whitespace totally matters
it's really important and then that just
made me like super confused so I tweet a
lot as you guys can tell and so you see
here I'm saying I'm dude I'm doing
Python and I'm all like what and you'll
see that I have an indentation error and
Python expected an indented block so
even when I was first learning Python
you would think that whitespace wouldn't
be such a big deal but in Python it's
really important to have all of your
blocks indented in this that specific
way
okay next our primitives so again
primitives
seem pretty straightforward in
JavaScript and Python so first you'll
see the boolean switch are true and
false although in Python true and false
are capitalized if you want to refer to
nothing in JavaScript it's null and in
Python it's none what was really
confusing to me is I didn't know that in
JavaScript the idea of something being
undefined or having an empty value was
so special it seemed completely normal
to me so when I was learning Python ID I
was very confused to learn that that was
not something that was possible the
other thing is with JavaScript and
Python I didn't understand that with
Python there are all types of numbers
whereas in JavaScript there's just one
type of number it's pretty
straightforward and then as well with
sequences I didn't understand that there
are different types of sequences in
Python because in JavaScript there's
really just a raise although with the
addition of es6 we now have tuples as
well or tuples I'm not sure how to
pronounce actually and then lastly with
a key value store in JavaScript we call
them objects but in Python we call them
dictionaries which can be a little
confusing as well so with primitives in
general I learned that capitalization
really matters I can't I don't even
really want to talk about the number of
times that I had compilation errors just
because I didn't capitalize true or
false in Python so when I was learning
about these primitives I was like what
are all of these things because with
JavaScript we just have a normal number
and then in Python we have int we have
floats
we have lungs and we even have complex
numbers with real and imaginary parts
which is pretty crazy and again with
sequences we have lists and then we have
two poles or tuples and then we have
byte arrays we have buffers which are
now called memory views in Python 3 and
then we also have X ranges so at first I
was really confused by why would Python
have all these different types why can't
we just be like Java Script and be a
little bit more straightforward and just
have one
type of number or one type of sequence
and then my coworker Alice helped me
realize an idea which is that there are
trade-offs with different languages so
with JavaScript you could get faster
development and you may have more
runtime errors but with Python and
specific types of primitives you may
have slower development but you'll most
likely have fewer runtime errors and so
it's kind of a take your pick regarding
languages ok next step is concatenation
so concatenation is pretty easy with
both JavaScript and with Python you
essentially use a plus sign and you can
add some strings together one thing I
didn't understand about JavaScript is
that type coercion is something special
and it's not something you can do in
Python so here you'll see I have a
course number and I basically by
concatenating it coerce it into a string
in JavaScript and with Python you just
can't do that it's not possible so when
I was presenting this to my co-workers
my coworker Emre literally made this
face to me like whoa what do you mean
you can do type coercion she was not
happy about that at all ok next step is
functions so I'm gonna go a little bit
deep on different types of functions but
first I'll start with functions and
conditionals so here you'll see a
function called dr.seuss which basically
tells you if things are crazy or if
they're boring based on cat The Cat in
the Hat thing 1 and thing 2 being there
so some of the first things that I
noticed about Python is that it's pretty
similar syntax wise you start with an if
and then instead of saying else if as in
JavaScript you say Elif and then you say
else just as in JavaScript so the only
thing that's different for me is curly
braces versus colons and I feel like if
you if you look at the two just as code
without even really reading it pythons
definitely looks a lot better and when I
was first learning Python I was like no
Java scripts better I miss
those curly braces but now I'm kind of
coming around to the fact that yeah
Python okay it does look a lot cleaner
and here's another one of the examples
where I actually had true as lowercase
so I actually had to come back through
and make sure I had all capitalized
truths in Python so another thing with
JavaScript is I didn't understand that
there was a difference between functions
and methods so Python helped me realize
that so MDM says with functions versus
methods in JavaScript that the global
function object has no methods or
properties of its own however it does
inherit some methods and properties
through the prototype chain from
function dot prototype so that means
that essentially every function in
JavaScript that is declared is
inheriting from function dot prototype
and that's where methods come from so an
example of the methods that you would
acquire via the prototype chain are
apply bind call is generator to source
and to string so for me having learned
JavaScript I thought that essentially
functions were declared or created and
that methods were inherited or built
into functions or built into the
language of JavaScript so it wasn't
until learning Python that I learned
that functions and methods are actually
fairly different and that in most
respects they're basically the same
except for that a method is implicitly
passed the object on which it was called
and that a method is also able to
operate on the data that is contained
within the class and then I was like oh
is that why I didn't understand the
difference between functions and methods
it's probably because there are no
classes in Java scripts although there
are now in es6 which I'll talk about in
a bit so take a quick look at some silly
functions and methods that I wrote in
Python first you'll see that I have a
function called fish-and-chips
which is essentially created and
declared outside of a class and so
that's a function
and then I have a class called baking
and inside that I actually have a method
called Bakewell tart so because that is
actually called within baking that's
what makes it a method and you'll see as
well that if I log or print self you'll
see that I have access to the object on
which it was called which is baking and
so I was like oh duh okay that's why I
didn't understand the difference between
JavaScript and pythons functions and
methods okay next is Turner ease so turn
arrays are pretty straightforward as
well but for some reason nobody wants to
agree on syntax here so with JavaScript
you have the results of the conditions
at the end it which is yes/no and at
first I kind of like the way that was
organized because you have conditions
right at the end but then I noticed that
the way Python writes things is it's
written more as a sentence so you could
read it out like do I like children yes
if they're well-behaved otherwise No so
it's kind of a another situation of take
your pick on which you prefer okay so
let's get a little bit bigger now those
are all kind of like the basic
underlying principles of JavaScript and
Python but now we're going to talk about
prototypes so prototypes are a little
bit crazy and generally super confusing
to everyone I was going to say to
anybody learning object-oriented
languages but really they're confusing
to anyone so when I hear prototypes
usually I think of basically an early
sample of a product like these rings
here it's like a prototype of a ring
before they're actually put in a
production there's also a video game
called prototype and there's also a
French indie band called prototypes so
let's talk a bit about inheritance in
the prototype chain mdn says that when
it comes to inheritance JavaScript only
has one construct objects each object
has an internal link to another object
called its prototype that prototype
object has a prototype of its own and so
on until the object is reached with null
as its
type and know by definition has no
prototype because it's nothing and it
acts as the final link in the prototype
chain so I was reading that and I was
like did somebody create a band called
inheritance in the prototype chain yet
so to explain that a little bit more
clearly here I have a prototype chain so
I start out with an object called B
don't ask me about this chain or any of
the properties it's not something that I
wrote it's a little bit silly but be
essentially inherits from the beam
prototype being inherits from the Lagoon
prototype and legume inherits from the
object prototype which is built into
JavaScript so you can see that there's
this prototype chain here and that B is
an instance of being the bean prototype
is an instance of legume and the legume
prototype is an instance of object so to
explain that a little bit further
basically Python helped me understand
because it was class based prototypes in
JavaScript so I found Java scripts
prototypes extremely confusing prior to
learning Python so here I have a pretty
long example so I'm going to go through
it step by step but it's essentially I'm
creating a mammal I'm creating a cap and
inherits from mammal and then I create a
method called eat on cat and then I
instantiate a new cat called fry so to
start I have essentially the Declaration
of mammal so I start out and I say that
mammals all have Oh neocortex
so you'll see above I have it in
JavaScript I'm creating a new function
and then in Python I'm creating it as a
class that's pretty easy next I create a
cat so I create a new function cat in
the top with JavaScript and I give it a
name and I also give it a number of
years and then from there I create the
cat prototype and I set it as a new
mammal so essentially the cat prototype
is inheriting from mammal and then I set
on the
a prototype a method eat and then below
that you'll see me creating a class in
Python called cat and it's much more
straightforward here so I can just
actually feed mammal directly into cat
in order for cat to inherit from mammal
and then I initiate that with a number
of a name and number of years again and
then I create a method called eat and
lastly here what I do I feel like this
is probably the closest between
JavaScript and Python is mostly in the
function call so when I instantiate a
new frie cat he become he is a new cat
and his name is fry and he has seven
years old he's seven years old and then
he's eating some steak so because fry
cat is inheriting from cat it grabs that
method and at first I found this super
confusing because with JavaScript you
have these words new you have new
functions you have this new word called
prototype but once I had these maps side
by side it was much easier for me to
understand JavaScript prototype and for
sitting through that very long example
you guys are rewarded with a photo of my
cat eating some steak okay scope so
scope seems like it would be pretty
crazy between the two and nobody really
likes to talk about scope but actually
with JavaScript and Python scope is
pretty straightforward they're almost
exactly the same they both use lexical
scope the namespace in Python is
specifically functions classes and
modules
whereas in JavaScript only functions
will create scope although again with
es6 we actually have now classes and
modules creating scope as well and then
with Python you have the new identifier
zuv variables functions and classes
whereas with JavaScript you have
variables and functions again because
there are no classes so scopes pretty
easy between Python and JavaScript and I
was like okay that's one down
okay now there's this vs. self this is a
really confusing concept again in
JavaScript so this is from JavaScript
whereas self is from Python so you'll
see self kind of referred to quite a bit
when creating classes in Python so I was
wondering are those two things the same
they seem kind of similar I was like I
don't know so I had to do a little bit
of research on that so actually with
JavaScript this is a special keyword and
in pythons self is not a special keyword
it's actually a convention so this can
refer to the global object or the
containing object depending on the
execution context so this can refer to
many things depending on essentially
where it's declared whereas self in
Python is just a convention so it's the
explicit first argument of a function
and it refers to that instance so you
could actually name self this in Python
if you wanted to and even mdn can kind
of admits that this is quite confusing
in JavaScript because you'll see here
there's a function where they say this
dot herp is equal to derp and they also
say this dot this is easy to understand
is equal to just kidding this is at an
actual example on an MD ends web site
and then to top all of that off
there's also window dot self which is
accessible with JavaScript so this could
be self if you're in the global scope so
you'll see here I have a function
checking to see of window dot self is
window if window dot self is this and if
this is equal to window and all of those
are true assuming that this function is
executed in the global scope so this
versus self is it confusing yes very
confusing
okay now we have wasting wasting is
something that I didn't understand again
that was something special in JavaScript
I thought it was something pretty
straightforward just a weird quirk in
JavaScript but my co-workers again we're
quite horrified to learn what hoisting
was so to explain hoisting I have here
essentially a variable called boba and I
first assigned that to passion green tea
so you'd assume that con that with log
below passion green tea and then I have
a function called my order or jens order
i log boba at the beginning of that
function and one would assume it would
go out to the global scope and say oh
that must be passion green tea so you'd
assume that it would declare that or
print that and then i again assign I
create boba again inside of that
function and I assign it to mango green
milk tea and then I logged it again so
you'd assume that that would log mango
green milk tea so actually what's super
confusing is that second console.log
inside of my function logs undefined and
the reason for that is wasting and
because the fact that javascript has the
idea of something being undefined so
with hoisting you hoist the variable
definition or a variable declaration for
both boba above that console.log so
because var boba hasn't actually been
assigned anything what gets logged is
undefined so that's super confusing and
again that's something that is not
possible and doesn't exist in Python so
here you'll see I have a function called
gens order in Python and I print boba
and by doing so without declaring boba
or assigning it Python is like no that's
not possible you can't do that because
there's no wasting
okay next is es6 so equi script six is a
new standard which was released in 2015
by ahmed international prior to that a
full version of javascript hadn't been
released since 2009 so you could say
that es6 was upgraded as is an upgrade
of JavaScript or es 5 a quick note about
equi international versus a Python
Software Foundation which I didn't know
about
so Ekman international is the group
behind the standards of Java scripts and
they're actually a private nonprofit
which means that you can only join if
you're a part of a huge organization and
you have to pay into that private
nonprofit whereas with the pipe Python
Software Foundation anybody could be a
number so you could go and join today
and be a member of the Python Software
Foundation which is a non-profit it's
pretty cool my core crash Sweeney is
actually on the board so it just goes to
show that you could really be part of
that if you wanted to very easily
whereas with Ahmed International it's
much harder so that being said learning
Essex was has been really interesting
for me because python has helped me also
learn es6 so a lot of syntax and es6
overlaps that of python so I like to
kind of say that they go hand-in-hand
so to start block scope in es6 so when I
was first learning JavaScript I thought
that several things created scope in es6
or excuse me in es5 so I thought that if
statements and conditionals created
scope and then I was told that that's
not true
but with es6 it's actually now true and
so when somebody told me that block
scope exists is like what do you mean
that exists in es6 so with the addition
of const and let in javascript we now
have block scope and as an example i
have this this function called simple
example in which i have a conditional if
value
I assign var value to value and then I
assign LUT value to value as well but
that's using Lett and then when I
console.log both of those I get the
value because they're just declared
within that scope of that block however
outside of that conditional if I try to
print out var value that's no problem
because that's part of es5 and there's
no such thing as block scope at that
point but if I try to print let value
because of block scope I actually get an
uncaught reference error and so that's
something to keep in mind when you're
creating scope now in es6 so now I
actually have to add on a couple of
things to my table from earlier so we
actually have more things that create
scope in JavaScript than in Python okay
next is template literals so template
literals are string literals that allow
embedded expressions and they were
originally called template strings prior
to in Prior editions of es6 so template
literals are something that actually
already existed in Python and something
that I had ready learned so that made it
much easier for me to understand those
in es6 so see here a JavaScript template
literal so I declare both and I create
exclamation assign it to a string whoa
and then I also have a sentence they're
really similar to Python and then when I
log the template literal which basically
has some placeholders for the
exclamation and the sentence what I get
is a printout of template literals :
whoa they're really similar to Python
and it's pretty it's pretty great
because then you don't have to use the
concatenation and it's more
straightforward just having it's almost
like mad libs if you guys are familiar
with mad libs and then in Python you'll
see it's pretty similar as well so using
dot format in Python I have a string and
by using dot format those placeholders
with the curly braces will just fill in
with the two strings that
fed into dot format so this will print
out dot format going yep quite and then
those two side-by-side you can see
they're quite similar with the curly
braces for the template literals okay
next is default parameters so again
default parameters was something that
already existed in Python and that made
it easier for me to understand in
JavaScript so here you see a default
parameter I have a function called Nam
and my default parameter food is set to
icecream so if I want to call Nam
without an argument fed into that
function it'll automatically just print
out icecream as a default parameter so
it's time to eat icecream
and then again with Python it's very
similar so you can have a default
parameter again food is set equal to
ice-cream and then we print out time to
eat icecream
even though we've called the function
without any arguments and here we go
side by side
okay next is rest parameters versus args
in Python so the rest parameter syntax
allows us to represent an indefinite
number of arguments as an array and
that's actually something that already
existed in Python from its inception so
here in JavaScript I have a function
which is a joke and I log the question
and then I just go through and I print
out each of the phrases that's fed in to
the rest of the function so here I have
I assigned that yes Joe yes six Joe goes
why does JavaScript single out one
parameter and then I call that joke with
I call the function joke with the es6
joke and then three other strings which
will get essentially smashed into an
array at the end so then I'll print out
why does JavaScript single out one
parameter and then it's because it
doesn't like it doesn't really like the
rest of them so with Python something
very similar is our args here so here I
have a pirate joke and then I can take a
question and then I take a bunch of arms
which are smashed into an array so I
print the question and then I loop
through and print out the different
arguments that are fed into the rest of
the args or read fed into the rest of
the the function so with my Python joke
it prints out what's a pirate's favorite
parameter args args args
that's my pirate joke so it's pretty
cool very similar between Python and
JavaScript okay so now we come to
classes we talked about prototypes
earlier in JavaScript but now we have
classes with yet six but as it turns out
they're just syntactic sugar so they're
still based on the prototype idea or the
prototype chain within Java scripts so I
like to say that classes are like
prototype to the new video game so again
we see this example of mammal and cat
then I instantiate a new fry cat so the
only difference is here now is that
you'll have a constructor and you
actually declare a class mammal in es6
as well so it's pretty similar to the
way it looks in Python here a big
difference which makes things much
easier is that you can inherit more
easily so here cat inherits from mammal
by just saying extends mammal and that's
much more similar to the way that Python
inherits mammal and again we have a
constructor which is pretty similar to
the init function in Python so you'll
see that the syntactic sugar kind of
helps things over a lot much better or
much more easily between the two
languages and so I like to say that it's
like we're breaking the prototypes and
building something new that works out
really well okay so in conclusion evolve
this in learning Python after learning
JavaScript so what I learned is that
JavaScript has a bunch of weird quirks
that I wasn't aware of I just thought it
was natural and I thought you know all
those things happen in all different
programming languages so I thought that
job and then I learned that JavaScript
is like kind of actually a free-for-all
you can do a lot of different things
it's a super flexible language and I
thought that that was something that I
really liked and it can be really
helpful as a beginner because you can't
really make mistakes in JavaScript or
it's very hard to but then I started to
feel like oh maybe that's a bad thing
I'm not really sure how I feel about it
anymore and I got a little bit sad
because I was like JavaScript used to be
my language to rule them all but Python
has actually really helped me appreciate
all the things that I've learned in
JavaScript and I've also learned that
some rules actually can be good and so
this is how I felt after learning Python
and here's Mary very winking because why
not so thanks everybody for coming I
hope you enjoyed it and if you have any
questions feel free to ask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
