everyone I am so excited to be here in
Sydney I count this as a real honor and
a privilege to be here
as part of the NDC conference and as you
can tell I'm I'm from the States
I'm from the deep south of the states in
the state of Georgia
so I speak fluent redneck I hope you can
understand my English my version of
English my name is David Neil and you
can trust me because I have a beard and
I ride a motorcycle and I consume lots
of bacon and caffeine and I've got my
family here with me we've had just an
incredible time for the past week we
came in a little bit early and yeah
Sydney has been awesome I wish we could
see more of Australia except for these
guys I don't what is up with these
little annoying critters we try to go
see the Sydney Opera House and we're
just attacked constantly by these by
these guys so to start off I wanted to
tell you that JavaScript has won the web
you've you know you just got through
with Scott Hanselman stalk he may have
even I wasn't in there but he may have
even said this phrase he's talked about
many times about JavaScript being the
lingua DeFranco the web it's it's you
know we all like to bash on JavaScript
right it's a it's it's not the language
we would choose but it's the language we
deserve
and Atwoods law any application that can
be written in JavaScript will eventually
be written in JavaScript and if you just
search for J's Linux that's an entire
Linux operating system running in the
browser which is insane and Douglas
Crockford at a on a speaker panel when
at one conference said javascript is
tragically important and if you remember
or if you know Douglas Crockford is the
author of one of the most important
books in JavaScript JavaScript the good
parts which is suspiciously smaller than
any other JavaScript book out on the
market so it's JavaScript the good parts
just very short book so this talk is
about nodejs a little bit from my
perspective as a.net developer and we're
going to talk about why nodejs why uh
why should we even consider using
node.js as a as a technology and a bit
of a crash course some tools and
frameworks that I have found that are
great to to use with node and maybe some
integration strategies with some
existing dotnet code and of course
nodejs over the last few years is
completely exploded
unless you've been under a rock you've
seen just an incredible uptick in lots
and lots of buzz about nodejs it is an
amazing technology it is JavaScript on
the server so it's JavaScript based it's
you know it's promises that you can
focus on a single language and from from
back in the front-end so if you if you
are how many would consider themselves
web developers yeah a vast majority of
you so you know we already deal with
JavaScript on the front-end JavaScript
on the backend is a pretty interesting
premise nodejs is built on the chrome v8
JavaScript engine and is very very fast
and efficient v8 as you know has been in
the past the fastest javascript engine I
don't know if they can make that claim
anymore
Microsoft chakras got some pretty
impressive benchmarks and you can even
use chakra in with nodejs I think
there's a shim where you can swap out
the JavaScript engines but the v8 engine
is is very similar you might say that
well javascript is is dynamic it's it's
it's not a compiled language well if you
think about it dotnet is not necessarily
a compiled language either when you
compile dotnet it's turned in the IL and
it's only just in time compiled when
when it's executed in the same fashion
javascript when it's first executed in
node is also just-in-time compiled and
is running as machine code so it's just
as fast and efficient at runtime as is
net now the interesting thing about
nodejs and the javascript engine is that
it's an assay synchronous event loop so
your code is you kind of fall into an
asynchronous development pattern not
that you can't do a sync and a weight
and all those types of things with
dotnet but the kind of the patterns that
we've been presented and you know that
we've learned in dotnet over the years
has been a very synchronous pattern
whereas in nodejs when you're looking at
all the code samples and you're using
callbacks and promises and those kinds
of things you're you're falling into an
asynchronous pattern and this a single
threaded event loop it sounds
counterintuitive but because of the
context switching and stuff that you
don't have to deal with with
multi-threading it can actually be very
very efficient and handle concurrency
really well the nodejs community has
just exploded last time I checked there
were over 250,000 modules available for
nodejs
compared to some somewhere around 60,000
nougat packages the community has
embraced node.js because it is
JavaScript
regardless of your background with your
PHP net Java
because if you're a web developer you
know javascript is a language that you
know and it has attracted the web
developers from all other platforms to
to jump on board with nodejs and it's
been very very successful and then
Microsoft themselves has been also
involved it with nodejs so they're there
they were involved early on with nodejs
and making sure that node can can run on
the Windows platform nodejs is a
first-class citizen in Azure and they
make it really really easy to deploy
nodejs applications in Azure and the all
the azure services have first class no
js' libraries that you can use to to do
things like message the message bus and
other types of services that are
available and one thing I'd like to say
is that no js' javascript is not your do
not your dad's JavaScript so we all bash
on on JavaScript being you know this
language that we all love to hate but in
the in regards to node.js the latest
version of node you can take advantage
of all the great features of like es2015
or es6 6.3 of node.js is 95% es6 or
es2015 compliant so almost everything
that you can you know except for maybe
tail call optimization z' is available
if you're building on node so you can do
things like you know the fat arrow
syntax you can do spread operators you
can do all these great new features that
are in the es6 language and it is a
awesome it's a whole new world you know
in in terms of JavaScript that's really
really awesome so a little bit of
background about me
I've been a.net developer since the
early days of dotnet I was at the PDC
conference in 2000 when dotnet was
announced they gave us they gave every
attendee this book called presenting
c-sharp
being the nerd that I am I went back to
the hotel room and I read that that
entire book and I knew that I wanted to
be a dotnet developer that this c-sharp
language is really awesome so I've been
doing dotnet and c-sharp forever I work
for this company called lean kit we do
Kanban software and our stack has been
traditionally Microsoft so it's MVC and
c-sharp we use sequel server and then
hibernate and we've got a whole
spaghetti of JavaScript and jQuery top
code and just about every jQuery plug-in
on the planet is embedded in our
application at one time or another which
has led to a lot of really you know as
we've scaled and as we've grown has has
led to some you know really hard
spaghetti code to decipher some really
challenging problems with with the just
the Microsoft framework and there's been
a lot of frustration in maintaining the
application that we have and and to be
honest the the stack of technologies
that we have we've even you know started
to run into scalability issues not not
that you know dotnet it isn't capable of
scaling but you know just the choices
that we've made over the years the the
things that are embedded in our system
became really really difficult for us to
to scale and so JavaScript for us is a
strategically important language since
we are a SAS product and we build a web
application javascript is really really
important and it became clear to us that
we needed to be JavaScript experts and
ojs seems to be you know just reinforces
our our ability to to build great web
applications from a recruiting
standpoint nodejs has been awesome
because you know the community of
JavaScript developers now instead of in
our market where where my company is
based in in Nashville Tennessee the.net
community it's a large
but there's so much demand on good
talent in our community that it's hard
to get recruit you know really good
dotnet developers but if we're using
nodejs and are able to use javascript
then we can also pull in pretty much
anybody from any background any
web-based technology so we have we now
have people who have come from ruby
backgrounds from from java from PHP and
that's a good thing because they're
bringing in these you know it's polyglot
experience you know all these ideas and
concepts these patterns libraries and so
forth that they have learned on these
other platforms in there and are helping
us to be much better at what we do and
we have found that in building some of
our services with no js' that it just is
just a much more productive environment
it's there's much much less friction we
do or doing things like test test first
you know test-driven development we're
building micro services we're able to
take advantage of other technologies
like rabbitmq and react and Redis and
the fact that it's cross-platform and we
can do things like docker eyes our
applications and we can deploy to Linux
servers and all those kinds of
advantages we have you know our our
DevOps guys really love the fact that
they can take our docker containers and
vagrant and all those other technologies
and be able to easily deploy those
things into production so this has been
more of the reaction that a couple years
ago we decided to run an experiment and
and do some projects with nodejs and my
team was one of the first teams to do
that and within a couple of weeks of
into the end of this project we were
doing I asked all the you know the other
developers well how do you feel about
nodejs so far and it was just high-fives
everywhere it was we were you know just
loving the the technology loving the
you know like the less friction with
building applications and we you know we
haven't looked back now we still give
our developers that the choice if they
want to build a dotnet application you
know they're building assert a certain
feature or a certain service they can
they have the choice of building it in
net or nodejs but by far most of our
developers are building services in
nodejs
there are a number of great articles out
on the web
this one is why no js' is becoming the
go-to technology in the enterprise and
this resonated with us as well as any
lot of other companies that I've talked
to that have gone the route of using
node.js and its rapid innovation
delivery developer happiness being able
to attract and retain talent you know
it's a it's a new shiny thing you know
sort of speak so people are excited
about working with with nodejs and
javascript is just you know it's just a
great skill to have regardless of being
nodejs or not and performance has just
been amazing to me no js' exemplifies
start with the simplest solution that
works and do one thing and do it well
know jess is is essentially a JavaScript
execution platform there there's not a
whole lot that's built into nodejs
itself there's like some file system
capabilities some networking
capabilities but that's it the rest of
it is all NPM or modules that you can
pull in to to make node do whatever you
want it to do some of the node.js you
use cases single page apps API real-time
streaming all these are great examples
proxy service will talk a little bit
more about that later as part of an
integration strategy but I like to say
that no js' is you know it's anything
you want to do that's connected to the
Internet
no js' is the perfect solution for and
in particular nodejs from the very
beginning for four years now has
supported things like real-time
streaming and WebSockets and is
really really great at creating that
those modern you know push type
experiences on the web so if you're
pushing data to mobile apps or in
real-time applications on the web no js'
is a great solution for that and I'm
happy to say that no js' is is more than
just back in you know nodejs has
typically been just a back-end server
for doing API and web related things but
there's a lot more you can do at node
than that there's you can create
automation scripts since it is just a
JavaScript execution you can create you
know lots of automation things for like
DevOps you can create command line tools
using any XE I've used this to create a
number of utilities for applications and
you can create desktop apps using either
node WebKit or electron-electron is one
of my favorite new technologies and is
is so awesome
so electron was built for atom by github
and is the desktop shell that that a
number of applications have been created
on Pete how many here use slack well if
you've used slack on the desktop you've
probably used an electron application
and then Visual Studio code this was a
huge eye opening experience for me when
I saw Visual Studio code I'm thinking
wow
Microsoft has figured out how to get
dotnet to to run on on on Mac and Linux
and you know create a desktop app well
well they didn't use dotnet they used
electron they used node and and in
chrome which is what electron is built
on if you want to learn more about
electron there's I think maybe what more
than one talk here this this week but I
know there's a talk tomorrow at 11:40 on
writing desktop applications using web
technologies and if anyone's interested
I'm actually giving a talk on electron
tomorrow night at the Sydney
no js' Meetup there are quite a few case
studies of successful nodejs
implementations or you know migrations
from from platforms to node.js Fandango
which is a ticket sales for like movie
tickets in the states they have moved
from dotnet to no js' and their
experience was much like ours
dramatically shorter development cycles
they're moving toward a micro services
architecture flexibility and deployment
all those things are are just great
benefits of moving to node.js
PayPal is another great case study this
is a company who ran an experiment when
they first started looking at nodejs
they're a java-based it you know
traditionally but they're looking at at
at nodejs and they decided to have one
team create this new application in Java
and another team created a node so they
can compare you know the experiences
between the two and what they found was
when they built the node.js app they
could they create it two times faster
with fewer developers they had less code
and fewer files they had a huge
performance improvement over the Java
app and also this great performance in
average response time
what what's so interesting to me about
this particular case study is that
PayPal had been doing Java for years and
so the team who's creating this java
application the Java equivalent there
should be Java experts and yet this team
who had just you know for the first time
touch-touch nodejs they were able to
create a much better application just
right out of the gate and so you know
they've they've since switched to
node.js completely and have had great
success
Walmart is another great case study
Walmart is you know I'm sure you've
probably heard of them they're one of
the biggest retailers
they ran their experiment on Black
Friday 2013 I don't know if you know
what Black Friday is but it's like the
the number one shopping day of the year
in the States it's the day after
Thanksgiving holiday and so many and you
know what better time to run an
experiment then you know your your
heaviest shopping day of the year but
they they switch their mobile platform
to using no DJ s and they had just an
incredible phenomenal results they had
200 million concurrent users and you
know you know they heart there's their
servers that were running nodejs hardly
broke a sweat
and they also experimented with
deploying live updates during Black
Friday without any trouble
who else is using nodejs there are lots
and lots of organizations that that are
using node.js today there if you if you
search for an ojs industry i think on
node.js org you can see a long list of
companies and organizations that are now
using node.js either primarily or as a
major part of their infrastructure as I
mentioned DevOps is is loving us as a
you know internally with with nodejs
because of its small footprint and being
cross-platform
it's very event-driven so this this
DevOps movement in that we have in
software development there's already a
number of packages available for node
that do all the kinds of monitoring and
events that that DevOps is really
interested in seeing as part of the the
health of your application so it's
there's a the open source community
because it is so popular there there
just seems to be a huge number of tools
and options available to you to to help
drive a DevOps
type of environment now if you can read
this but it says this is a chart from
another article what is no js' used for
the
fifteen nodejs overview report the the
title of this chart is how long have you
worked with nodejs
and do you like your job so over time it
seems like the more you work with nodejs
the happier as a developer you are
because of the the less friction the the
number of tools that are available the
packages just the the whole the whole
overall experience is just a great place
to be installing nodejs is really really
easy you can go to node.js org click a
big green download link and run the
installer or how many here are familiar
with chocolaty awesome good number of
you are I'm surprised at how many people
are already familiar with chocolaty but
this is one of my favorite tools on you
know you can see that I'm running on a
Mac but I have VMs for Windows that I
still maintain a lot of dotnet
applications and and so forth so each
time I spin up a new Windows VM I use
chocolaty to install a lot of my base
line of tools and so to install
chocolaty just go to chocolate or
there's like one thing that you need to
install to get it running and then from
the command line you can do things like
chaco install node.js install and as I
mentioned before when you install
node.js it really is just an execution
javascript execution engine this just
node.js is not anything fancy it is -
command line utilities basically one is
node itself which is you can type node
space and then some JavaScript file to
execute it and the other is NPM NPM is
the node package manager it's it's kind
of the nougat equivalent this is how you
use NPM to install packages out of the
NPM registry - dependencies you should
be aware of with nodejs is no js' is
cross-platform compatible so you can run
nodejs on windows on
on linux and most of the modules that
you may use our our pure JavaScript but
there's also a chance that some of the
modules you use have C libraries that
need to be compiled on the machine or on
the architecture that you're running on
so in that case there's two things you
need you'll need Python version 2 some
version some version of - vert Python -
and you'll need some type of C compiler
most recently you can either if you
don't already have Visual Studio
installed you can use chaco install
microsoft build tools or you can install
the the build tools from directly or you
can download Visual Studio community
2015 and with that C++ compiler you can
have you can you know build those native
extensions or those native modules for
node and if you're running nodejs or if
you're running Visual Studio already
there are there's an open source nodejs
tools that you can install that give you
some project templates and some other
things minimum requirements are you need
Visual Studio 2012 Pro or one of the
free community editions you will need
the latest versions of Visual Studio
updates and or you can if you have MSDN
subscription you have access to a lot of
has your resources you can spin up an
azure vm that already has Visual Studio
in the node.js tools already installed
so that you can use that as your sandbox
to play around with with nodejs and
Visual Studio with that I'm going to
show you just a brief view of what those
nodejs tools look like in Visual Studio
No and stop this first
all right so I have Visual Studio open
here I know it's very small I'll zoom in
when I need to so I'm going to start a
new project and with the nodejs tools
installed you'll see that under
JavaScript there's a number of project
templates that are that are now
available under nodejs and those it can
be from existing node.js code to starter
Express applications Express is arguably
the most popular web framework or
starting point for building web
applications with nodejs and there's
also a number of azure applications that
are available I'm just going to choose
the basic nodejs Express for application
all that's fine it's going off in
creating the application now
unfortunately I won't be able to show
you everything because the the wireless
here is a little bit on the downside but
after this is created I do want to show
you at least a couple of things about
creating an application in Visual Studio
so when this comes up we've got our
project and our app.js file which is
kind of like the bootstrap for for this
Express application what nodejs tools
for Visual Studio gives me is the
ability to set breakpoints and gives
gives me a great de experience straight
from Visual Studio so I can fire this up
in my browser I would hit that break
point and I can I can inspect those
variables I can set watches I can look
at the call stack all those things that
you would expect from as a.net developer
being able to use you can also interact
with a JavaScript language as well
unfortunately when you can see this over
here all these things are missing and
that is because when you install an
application there's this metadata stored
in a in this file called package.json
and right now it's attempting to go out
to the internet and pull in those
packages that are our reference just
like nougat packages right so it's going
in trying to download those packages and
make them available to this this
application unfortunately it's not able
to do that but I can show you that if
you right-click on NPM there's this
install NPM packages dialog that comes
up and very similar to nougat it's all
cached locally so updated last night I
can do things like I can search for
lodash and I can choose a low - or
underscore those are popular JavaScript
frameworks and I can install those
directly into my my node.js application
adding it to the package.json by default
that means it's storing that metadata as
a as a package and so it's very much
like a nougat type environment for
installing nodejs
packages
what I want to show you right now is
I've got this exact same project pretty
much in Visual Studio code so this is
actually running on my Mac not in the
Windows VM but it looks identical so if
you bring up Visual Studio code on
Windows our Visual Studio code on Mac or
our Linux
these these are the exact same UIs and
it's really really good so I I almost
never use Visual Studio anymore
vigils like Visual Studio 2015 unless
I'm actually working on a net
application that I need to maintain if
I'm doing any nodejs development at all
I'm either using Visual Studio code or
something like sublime text Visual
Studio code is really really refreshing
it's it's fast and its really powerful
so just like Visual Studio I can set
breakpoints anywhere in the code and I
can I can I get intellisense
if you anybody here use typescript so
you got typescript capabilities in
Digital Studio code and you can get
intellisense those typescript
definitions and I can switch over here
to debug and fire up this application I
can switch over to say Firefox and say
localhost 3000 and now I just hit the
breakpoint here on this this particular
route and I can I can mouse over and see
inspect those variables I can see all
the properties and functions that are on
that variable I've got a call stack over
here on the left I can set watch points
so a visual studio code and I also get
like the step over and step step into
and all those kinds of things that you
would expect from a deep from a
debugging standpoint so it's really
really awesome
so we talked about Visual Studio code
Linux Mac and Windows
it's a considered code assistants so it
doesn't have the full capabilities of
like Visual Studio but it it is really
really good great environment for
JavaScript I've continually been
impressed with Visual Studio codes
ability to create nodejs projects and
debug JavaScript so some core concepts
about node.js that you should be aware
of NPM we talked about being a node
package manager so when you're creating
a new project from scratch if you're not
using like the project templates that
are in node node.js tools in Visual
Studio you're going to want to create a
project for your for your for your
application and start by using MPN in it
and this is going to step you through
some questions to say you know is it's
the name of your project and it's going
to create a project JSON file at the end
with with some of your your information
about your project and then from there
you would use NPM to install packages so
in this case I'm installing lodash and
I'm using - - save to save that
dependency in the package JSON file when
you're as I mentioned before ja the
JavaScript that you use in node.js is a
little bit different from what you may
be using on the front end so some core
concepts about nodejs is when you're
requiring in use nodejs uses common js4
dependencies and for for modular
javascript so require is kind of like
the imports or using statement in this
case require with just the name of the
module is how you would reference
built-in nodejs modules in this case
from using the FS which is a file system
allows us to read and write files in
nodejs it also with the same kind of
syntax we can we can reference modules
that have been installed by npm so
require Express would be how we would
reference the Express framework
for node that we used npm install for
and then if you're creating your own
modules you you provide a relative path
to that module and that's how you
reference it in other JavaScript modules
and in some cases your modules may be
construct have constructor functions
it's you know just a common JavaScript
thing so instead of creating a using
after you require it in as a as an
object then you might want might want to
create an instance of it using the
constructor function or you might save
our service equals new my service and
then a very very common pattern in
nodejs esta is using callbacks so if
you're calling a method on a JavaScript
function a JavaScript object like
service dot some method then you're
going to pass in any number of
parameters that are required by that
object or by that method and then you're
going to pass in a callback function and
that is this is this is part of that
being courteous of the single threaded
event loop it's like I'm going to call
this function and you you handle when
you're going to execute that function
when you're done then callback this this
callback function that I'm providing as
the last parameter so the common pattern
is to use the callback that starts with
error which is the error object and then
whatever additional results may be being
returned from that callback so we check
the error do something if we need if we
have that error there are a couple of
different module patterns that are
common with nodejs the this one is just
using plain JSON so we've got a module
sample module one Jas and it's got a
couple of functions in it a convert to
Celsius and convert to Fahrenheit and
then at the end we've got this this
plane this JSON object literal it's got
some properties like the freezing
Celsius and freezing Fahrenheit boiling
and then our we've got our two
functions here's where the magic happens
in the common Jay s module framework is
somewhere in your module you need to set
your exports and here we're saying our
exports is this this JavaScript object
so when sample module one is use
somewhere else in nodejs it's going to
see the freezing and boiling properties
and it's going to see those two
functions and that's all it's that's
that's what it that's all it's going to
see another common pattern is to use a
constructor function and here we're
requiring in the file system object and
then we've got this one function that
takes in a parameter called a path and
inside this function we're going ahead
and we're reading the config data from
that file that was provided from the
path and we're parsing that as JSON and
then we've got a number of functions
I've you know the implementation
implementation details are not so
important but we've got to get a set
save and then we've got some you know
internal function and then we're
returning from this constructor function
what we want to expose to the to the
outside world so we're returning the get
and the set and the save and then we're
setting that constructor function as our
module dot export so we use this in some
other area of our nodejs application
we're going to create an instance of it
using the require we're going to use
that path you know pass in a path and
then the object that we get at the end
is a an object that just has get set and
save return you know exposed how many
here use sequel server you're not net so
for me no js' for for many years was a
non-starter I kind of dismissed nodejs
because sequel server was not you know
very well supported once a sequel server
was supported then I became a Huhn oh I
started using node.js
more and I became a huge fan I'm a
sequel database nerd I've been using
sequel server since the you know the
late 90s so it's a it's a important
piece of technology to me so Syria is
one of the several nodejs modules that
are that's available for sequel server
it's my favorite so I get asked this a
lot so I included some of these slides
in my my talk just to talk a little bit
about how easy it is to get started with
the sequel server so Syria to have some
kind of config setting your your
database connection properties and then
you can do things like Syria is based on
finite state machines and and promises
so you can do some really interesting
things about you know I want to execute
this this this sequel code and the
results that I get back from that sequel
statement I want to execute another
sequel statement you know I can change
sequel statements together in like step
one step two step three and then do
something interesting with the whole
chain of executions at the end and then
I can wrap it up into you know you have
like a catch statement for any errors
that happen and if you want to know more
about Syria if you go to my my blog
reverent geek calm I've got an article
out there on titled painless sequel
server with no js' using Siri 8 so a
little information about deploying
typically when you deploy a node.js
application you don't include the node
node modules folder so this is a special
folder that's created when you and
you're installing packages so when I do
an NPM install lodash or NPM install
Express it puts everything in this node
modules folder if there are native
modules for you know Sam I'm developing
on a Mac and those native modules get
compiled I don't want to I don't want to
deploy node modules because it may be
the wrong architecture or the wrong you
know native modules for wherever you
know I might be deploying to a Linux
machine so typically you're going to
deploy to the server
then run npm install on that server so
that it pulls down all the packages and
compiles them for that particular server
unless you're going to create you have
like CI servers that are the exact same
architecture that you have in production
so we do this where we have build
servers that are the same architecture
and they're going to pull they're going
to do the job of pulling down those NPM
packages and building them and then
we'll take and zip all that stuff up and
move it into production as I mentioned
before as arisia
to to deploy to and then on windows if
you're deploying nodejs applications
you're going to use something like III
is node to host you can you know if
you're just doing a web application iis
node allows you to host nodejs
application in iis and if you're going
to be deploying services where you need
to start and stop those services and you
know automatically restart if something
fails windsor is a great tool for doing
that so when you're when you're
installing a node.js application on a
Windows machine that's going to live on
its own which can be a web application
or it could be a certain like a micro
service Windsor is a great way to do
that and then on linux there are a
number of options available we use a one
called forever and it does the same kind
of thing where it creates a daemon so
that you can host that application and
make sure that if it crashes it's going
to automatically restart and all those
kinds of things hosting node.js on Azure
you can do something as simple as
created a brand new at web app emptied
node.js application and then point that
to a repository this is what I do for a
number of my my personal node.js
projects including my blog is I can just
point adder to a github repository and
then anytime I push an update to that
repository to to the branch that it's
looking for it can be the master branch
or it can be some other
branch on that repository it will
automatically detect that change and
pull down the latest from that
repository and redeploy my Azure website
for me so that within less than a minute
typically I've got that version of my
node.js application running and if you
want to learn more about that I've also
got a blog post on my website about
hosting nodejs on hazzard recommended
tools so low - is a great set of
JavaScript utilities you've probably
already familiar with low - or
underscore if you're going to do
JavaScript promises when there's a
number of them when is my favorite async
is kind of like your task parallel
library your TPL for-for-for nodejs it
gives you the ability to like execute
many many JavaScript functions in
parallel or in serial so that you can
say I want I want to do all these ten
things and just let me know when all ten
things are done so I can move on if
you're going to make external calls to
other api's and rest services requests
is a great module for that gulp of
course there's you know lots of debate
on you know what what the best build
testrunner and all those kinds of things
are go pour grunt both both are great
I prefer gulp socket IO is a great
library for doing that real-time socket
web socket type implementations note
inspector for debugging is really
awesome
when you install a note inspector you
can launch your job your nodejs
applications using node - you know
instead of typing node space index jsr
whatever your your application starting
point is you can do no - debug a pas or
index a s and that will launch your
application with the chrome dev tools
open so that you can use Chrome I mean
visual
the code is really really good but
before digital studio code I was using
node inspector to do you know no
debugging on on the client side mocha
and chai and sign-on those are great
testing frameworks for doing like a TDD
or BDD style of development and again
there's there just seems to be so much
less friction with doing a test driven
development style approach to
development I don't know what your
experience has been like but there have
been over the years in my career I've
gotten like okay this time you know
we're really going to do test-driven
development and you know a dotnet
project starts we're doing everything
TDD at some point the wheels just fall
off you know it just gets so hard to
maintain the test that you end up you
know well we got to ship this we got to
get this out the door we don't have time
to fix these all these broken tests and
you just start to comment out test or
disable them and then you just give up
you know it's like you throw your hands
up that's not been the case with the
nodejs projects that we've done it's
been really really awesome and and so
much more so much less friction than
maintaining those tests there are a lot
of nodejs
frameworks available for doing web apps
and api we've talked about Express it's
like I said it's if you're if you pick
up a book on nodejs or watch any videos
almost all of them are going to point
you to Express but that's not the only
option happy is a really awesome
framework built by Walmart that's what
they use for all their production stuff
and it's all open source I've got a
couple of good friends that it worked on
happy that used to work for Walmart and
have been contributors to that meteor
and sales if you want to do just strict
API work Resta Phi is really good
loopback which is from strongloop IBM
now owns them they have built in like
push notifications for mobile apps as
part of their API
my company has a bunch of open-source
projects out on linkit labs one of those
being auto hosts and hyped it's a hyper
media based approach to doing api's in
the no js' and you can find a lot more
out on node framework in node web
modules com
there's kind of like a curated list of
lots and lots of frameworks that are
available another thing I want to tell
you about is this tool called edge j/s
edge j/s allows you to run dotnet in
process with no js' and it's not just
about c-sharp but you can run f-sharp a
do net you can even do Python and
PowerShell so this could be a way of
bridging existing dotnet code with your
nodejs applications it was built by the
guy who who created AI is node the guy
who worked at Microsoft that made sure
that no js' could run on Windows in the
first place so this is a really
interesting tool allows you to execute
inline code or you can reference like CS
files or even existing dotnet assemblies
and it's a great alternative to writing
native modules instead of having to
write them and C you could write them in
you know in dotnet or ER leverage some
existing dotnet libraries that you have
it does require dotnet 4.5 or mono 3.1
and that's because those are when a
sinking a weight were introduced because
you can't do any blocking calls on
nodejs you remember you've got that
single threaded event loop if you're if
you're using synchronous blocking calls
in for for.net then your your halting
the thread that you have so you've got
it all your code has got to follow the
async and await pattern which may mean
that if you have existing dotnet code
that you want to leverage through SJS
you you might have to wrap
those with some async in a way you know
created like a wrapper library around
that existing code so that you can use
them so what can you do with HJs well
you can as I mentioned you can leverage
some of your dotnet investment you can
do things like TF you know Shara you can
do things like Microsoft services that
don't get a whole lot of love in the
node.js community so there are a lot of
modules that are available for Microsoft
types things but most of them are
half-baked and abandoned
so dotnet is still going to be your your
best you know clients for some of these
Microsoft applications if you want to do
Active Directory or you want to in some
cases maybe dotnet has a has better
hardware support for for particular
drivers or win32 drivers and then the
there they're not that there aren't
great modules already for for node for
doing like video encoding and CPU
intensive work so those are like native
those are like C libraries that are that
are being compiled for node but if
you've got some very specific things
that you want to be able to do with node
that are CPU intensive then dotnet may
be a great alternative and then
PowerShell is is an interesting option
for doing some automation of DevOps type
things some node J s integration
strategies nodejs is a proxy so this is
a how a lot of these organizations have
introduced node into there or into their
their stack of technologies Walmart and
PayPal these guys have what they've done
is they've created first created a proxy
API which is everything that that you
can talk to right and it's you know
sometimes referred to as the
strangulation pattern where you have
some things are implemented in node and
some things are just handed off to
whatever legacy back-end system that
you're still having to
used for a while and then slowly you're
migrating those features and
functionality to no js' over time so you
might use nodejs as a proxy and even
using edge je s to be able to call into
some of those legacy if you want to call
him legacy dotnet applications or
services so that you know as you're
starting to recreate those things or
create new ones and nodejs you can do
that if you need to call into other web
api maybe you're using you know asp.net
web api for some of your things you can
use request module to call into those
api's from node and then this is this is
what we're using it at my company is
RabbitMQ you can use a message bus is a
great way to integrate different systems
together so as your service bus or
RabbitMQ or some other type of message
queueing technology you can have
messages that are published onto a
message queue and you may have some
services that are built in net and some
services built in node they're all able
to read and send messages on that queue
and the last thing I want to tell you is
that you don't need permission to be
awesome so I believe us as software
developers we are living in and you know
this is no better time to be a software
developer than then write down we have
so much technology that's available to
us we have the ability to change our
world are the companies that we work for
the reason you're here is so that you
can learn about new stuff and take that
back to your organization and do do
awesome things and I can I can tell you
my experience with node.js has been just
so much fun it's made me want to excited
about being a programmer again not you
know it's just learning new things is
such a fun thing to do and I'm so glad
that we live in a in a world and
industry that allows us to continue to
learn and to grow our skills and so
forth and with that I've got some a lot
of demos and resources at on this link
I've got a number of repositories that
have some nodejs things there's a yeah
so there's a lot of resources available
from that link again I'm reverent geek
on on the Twitter's that's probably I'm
a Twitter addict so that's probably the
best way to get ahold of me and I've got
just maybe four minutes left for some
questions anybody got a question yes sir
so the questions about upgrading node on
and having running into some issues with
with NPM be stick sticking around I ran
into some problems with that early on
earlier versions of node I think
especially if you tried to upgrade NPM
manually over that's a good question I
don't think I've run into that in recent
builds of nodejs I think they fixed some
of those problems on Windows but but
definitely the latest version of nodejs
tools for for Visual Studio does require
you to have the latest like update 3 and
those you know there's there's a number
of dependencies that may all be coming
into play there that could be messing
things up yes
so the question is do you use an ORM
with with sequel I do not see reate is
kind of like as far as a no REM it's
kind of like you might consider a micro
ORM it's got some just some very very
lightweight capabilities javascript
being a dynamic language already gives
you like instant mapping of information
that's coming from the database
so there's you're not having to go
through a bunch of Hoops to turn the
data into some object model or something
like that because JSON is just the
nature of it is just so much less work
to do that kind of thing so it I think
there are some ORM s that are available
but personally I don't I don't know of
any and can recommend any to you yes so
as soon as you get you know your results
back from from the from sequel they are
it's automatically a JSON object that
you can then take and it's you know all
the properties and things are there so
there's no additional work that has to
be done to translate the results set
into it's already in JavaScript objects
yes sir
so refactoring code without a compiler
so having lots of tests is a great way
as you know it's kind of like a
discipline to have to to catch anything
that might happen we there's there's
things like es lint and JSC SOS lint has
got some really powerful capabilities to
to let you know that you hey you're
you're using things wrong or this object
no longer exists in your code or you
know can give you you know some hints on
that but mostly I find is through
through you know having really good
tests that that can find those thing I
know some people use typescript and
that's that's their way of making sure
that things are are lining up correctly
but es6 es 2015 and all the other
features are with EES lint I think
provide a really good safety net as well
yes
so the questions about proxies and
authentication through through those
proxies from node yeah I don't have a
good answer for that I know we have used
like the request object and it has some
basic proxy authentication things and I
know we we've contributed ourselves to
like the MS sequel package for doing
like ntlm authentication but I don't
yeah I don't I don't know yeah I can I
can help help you try to track some
things down afterwards that sure well we
we are out of time and I will be here
for a while longer you can certainly
come up to me and ask questions follow
me on Twitter thank you guys very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
