waiting while people are just fighting
in I can do my diversity rent sort of
nice and early I notice it's still a
room almost entirely full of men I've
told you about this before it's great to
see that NBC is getting a better set of
diverse speakers but we need to fix the
attendees as well I will be talking
fairly later on in this talk about the
importance of diversity but it's up to
all of us okay we have to encourage
various underrepresented it's not just
women a men there's diversity in so many
ways and we need to be encouraging
everyone in our jobs in our personal
lives and encourage them to come to NDC
wouldn't you like to see a more diverse
NBC I know I would
good and it's not like NDC is the only
conference that has this issue by any
means but we need to keep doing
something about it okay
I shall actually make start now wait a
blank page or canvass the challenge to
bring order to the whole through design
composition balance tension light and
harmony those are the words that got me
into this mess and they started getting
me into this mess more 15 20 years ago
probably when I first heard them I
thought that's like software they were
written by Stephen Sondheim or perhaps
James Lepine for Sunday in the park with
George which I'll come on to in a minute
but I do want to give a little bit of
background to this talk this is the
third time I've given this talk now the
first time was last Monday so I gave it
in Detroit then in
Sandusky Ohio hi fellow coma people and
now today and it it has already been
evolving it's still a somewhat
experimental talk so please I would like
feedback you know yeah the green yellow
reds are useful but please email me
ideally after kind of a few days a week
maybe with any thoughts you've had
whether it's that section sucks you
should remove it or I've been thinking
about that part and these are the ideas
I've had and I definitely want this talk
to evolve more over time
it's my reflections on how code and art
interrelate how many of you were at the
keynote just now excellent
I think it's excellent anyway it's sort
of not quite more of the same it's it's
a different take on similar ideas let's
say we're going to look at a few
interesting pieces of art and focus
particularly on Sunday in the park with
George and those words that I spoke to
start with so let's start with this this
is a Sunday afternoon on an island on
Allah groans at by George Sura he lived
in the late 19th century died tragically
young and this was painted mostly in two
years 1884 to 1886 in two phases we're
in the second phase he reduced the
number of colors that he was using and
reduced in the first phase I believe he
did sort of quite a lot of strokes and
it became more dots in the second phase
and then there was a third phase which
added this border the you can see just
from running round that's more colored
dots and this was an experimental piece
he referred to the scientific method
that he was trying to use because it is
pointless he had the idea that instead
of most artists mixing colors on their
palette he will
did us to mix the colors in our eyes so
at one stage he had a canvas of 16
colors arranged him four by four and he
made himself a ruled that he wasn't
allowed to mix colors that were not next
to each other so if if he had two colors
that were next to each other he could
mix those to form a new color and put
that on the canvas if he wanted the mix
of two colors that were slightly further
away he had to do some dots of one color
and some dots of another and then we
would mix it someone who was at my code
mash talked mentioned afterwards that it
made them reflect on zen and the art of
motorcycle motorcycle maintenance anyone
read yep if you haven't do it's
fantastic it has this key theme of
quality and how quality happens
somewhere between the sort of source and
the observer that there's this
interesting interplay and Sora was
expanded expression and playing with the
same kind of ideas Nix comes Sunday in
the park with George so this is a
musical with music and lyrics by Stephen
Sondheim and book as it's called so
anything that's not in a song by James
Lepine and this was experimental as well
they started in 1984 I think possibly
1986 and the first 25 performances were
off-broadway at somewhere called
Playwrights Horizons out of interest how
many of you know something the part with
George okay a few you'll know it has two
acts turns out out of those 25
performances at Playwrights Horizons
only the last three had the second act I
just bows me out blows me away and one
of the famous songs from it finishing
the hat which I'll be singing little
bits of later on the first time that
Mandy Patinkin sang that song he decided
to have all the lyrics with him on stage
because it was so it's so fiddly
basically that to get it right because
things were changing so quickly
it's not like right I'm gonna rehearse
this for two months and then I'll I'll
go and do it
no he kind of learned it that morning
and so he still needed their lyrics and
I love this idea of being experimental
as I say there are two acts I've learned
in the last two times that I've done
this talk that if I try to explain the
plot of Sunday in the park with George
that will take far far too long so all
I'll mention is that it's setting two
time periods one at the time that Sora
was painting the picture and the main
characters are George
Sora although without an S which the
original painter had but George Sarah
and his girlfriend dot and Sora is very
into concentration so he is quite still
unless he's actually doing the painting
at which point it sort of did it but he
he sits and looks for an awful lot of
time a plotter I guess from the keynote
where as thought I wouldn't say she's a
panther so much as she she fiddles she
finds it very hard to concentrate and so
she's modeling for George and she'll get
distracted and start imagining that
she's in the follies instead
so there's their relationship and how
the difference is between them and
George's death devotion to his art
really hurts their relationship and
before the end of the first act she
leaves him for Louis the Baker but
that's after she's conceived a child
with George who is called Marie second
act is set a hundred years later so in
the 1980s and there's a character called
George and a character called Marie so
Marie in the second act is dot from the
first sect's daughter George is her
grandson so George from the second act
is George from the first acts
great-grandson
and the two Georges are played by the
same actor and the two Marie and
daughter played by the same actor and
there's a lot of this repetition happens
a lot of the musical themes happen the
same way in the second act as the first
act sometimes in a way that surprised
even the actors so Mandy Patinkin was at
a party with some by him enough to show
party and sometimes said you know
sorry I've got you singing the same
thing in in both halves said what do you
mean well finishing the Hat is exactly
like putting it together there's one
note of difference here finishing the
hurt putting it together I hadn't
realized I've been singing this all this
time and not noticed if the name Mandy
Patinkin doesn't mean anything to you by
the way then possibly his most famous
line will and hello my name is Inigo
Montoya you killed my father
prepare to die it's a link between
Sunday in the park and one of my
favorite films Princess Bride there's
another one later on with Ferris Bueller
I'll mention so that's his Sunday in the
park with George an experimental musical
that explores themes of communication
and art and community and relationships
between people all of Sondheim's
musicals explore relationships between
people and how we screwed them up so
where's the code I want to talk about
how code intersects with art on the Left
craft and engineering and you know I was
listening to fellini's talk and thinking
oh this engineering stuff I'm about to
talk about engineering well part of the
point of this is that not all software
is engineering and there are different
ways of looking at things so I think
we're good so if we're going to talk
about these three things I could do with
kind of defining them and I'm not
actually going to define them very
specifically and certainly not
definitively if you've got a different
idea of what art is what craft is what
engineering is that's fine I will do the
best
I can to explain what I understand them
to be and talk about art we'll look at
another picture anyone other than my
colleagues know who this is by nope but
I can see where you're going
this is by a drawn middle a Catalan
painter and this isn't actually a
painting it's an etching with a print
and this is hanging in my hallway and I
love it
and you know why I love it I was hoping
you might be able to tell me because I
don't know and that's one of the aspects
of art I think in a weird way what you
can't easily tell from the screen is
that this sort of rectangle that's got
the black ink is slightly embossed in
and it's a slightly different color you
may just about be able to pick that up
and I love the way the the green and the
yellow and the orange --red sort of
explode out from that they violate the
boundaries and I love the soft
boundaries of the green and yellow and
the orange with the black boundaries
that are much harder I've got another
mirror that explores that sort of hard
versus soft more obviously but there is
something really good about this really
satisfying and I couldn't really tell
you what it is now I could paint a
picture or well I don't know anything
about how itching works but I could do
something a bit like this but it
wouldn't be art because I don't have the
experience and the craft behind it and
the thought process that is whatever is
doing what I like here given that I
can't even express what I like how could
I possibly do the same thing myself and
when it comes to code art can be a bit
similar
so the best example I thought of in
terms of art is linked to XML how many
of you are net developers okay this is
good so my first reaction when I saw the
link to XML API was that's horrible okay
we've got loads of methods and
constructors that take object like
that's not good I want to know you know
what I can pastor something just saying
oh just give me an object I'll I'll do
whatever's right with it sounds awful
it's like I'm working in a statically
typed language for a reason darn it and
they're using the addition operator
between X namespace and string like you
can't add a namespace in a string to
this that's an abuse of the operator and
then there are all the implicit and
explicit conversion x' you can do in
link to XML oh I'll just cast this
element to a string isn't a string what
are you doing and then you try actually
using it and it's beautiful I won't just
say you know it's pleasant or it's
beautiful various beauty in it it's
novel and yet it's also exactly what you
want it to be and that idea of novelty
is more important I think in visual arts
and musical arts than it is in computing
because in computing novelty can be a
positive drag particularly in user
interface design so there is clearly art
in UX but it is not in making things
pretty and it is not in making things
novel I don't know how many of you were
around when Winamp was you know the new
hotness and it seemed that everyone
created their own media player and every
media player decided it rectangular
windows that you will know how to
interact with now we'll do our own thing
will be novel I use the CRM system in
the late nineties that on the box says
you know completely unique user
interface I don't want a unique in user
interface that means I've got more stuff
to
user experience can be art but it's in
terms of the interaction between the
user and the program and how that can be
novel and yet familiar and that tension
is part of the art of it ok so from one
beautiful picture to one that I drew um
where is craft encoding where's the
difference between art and craft where's
the boundary so is API design craft or
art I tend to think of craft as the sort
of skills that you have to learn in
order to implement the art so some
aspects of API design the the ideas that
you're trying to put across may be art
but organizing it appropriately making
sure you don't violate people's
expectations building on conventions
that's part of the craft and I view
craft as something that you can't just
get from a book so craft is experienced
you can read all the blog posts in the
world you can read all the best books
about computing but unless you practice
you won't improve your art at your craft
and this is where mentoring and pair
programming are particularly valuable
because that's a great way of learning
someone else's craft and the fact that
we're talking about craft and we have
the idea of crafts person and you know
journeying so that you learn with
someone else resonates with me and craft
doesn't just apply to art we'll talk
about engineering in a minute but think
about the craft as the skills you learn
that are still somewhat intangible that
you may not be able to say that is
exactly why I'm doing that
it's more well I've tried that several
times and that worked I tried doing that
several times and it fell over in
various different ways or this time I'm
gonna do that for some reason that's
fairly hard to explain behind it feels
right in my heart and the engineering
side completely coincidental that I
chose a bridge here and solely Fellini
or rather it's probably not coincidental
it's the metaphor that we've all been
given so many times so where the art is
almost purely subjective the engineering
side of code feels like it should be
more objective and where we apply craft
to API design you know is craft applied
to the art we still have skills that are
closely tied to experience that fall
into our engineering so I think of
benchmarking as engineering that
certainly requires craft it requires a
load of experience and how many of us
have written bad benchmarks before wow
you must be awesome folks or you just
haven't written any benchmarks or you
don't know that the benchmarks you've
written a bad one other three things
like setting up continuous integration
and making sure you have a repeatable
build all these things are more
engineering discipline that still come
with a bunch of crafts attached so I'm
not going to explain for most things in
the remaining 40 minutes which aspects I
view as engineering which are art on
which are craft I will for a few but I
want to come back to sometime saying the
point of art for this fictionalized Sora
is to bring order to the whole through
design composition balance tension II
tension light and harmony
so we'll start with design wow that's an
overloaded word I'm gonna use a couple
of meanings here but for the first one
it's by design as opposed to by accident
its intentionality and this comes
definitely back to something the park
with George so George was always very
deliberate thinking about everything he
did but its dot who actually expresses
this best and expresses some urgency in
choices that I love she sings
I chose on my world was shaken so what
the choice may have been mistaken the
choosing was not you have to move on how
many of us have found ourselves
paralyzed when coding by indecision I'm
checking that both my colleagues who are
here have definitely put their hands up
because I know you have it's so easy to
get trapped and I find that the case
where I most often get paralyzed by
indecision is where I can see and maybe
I've written up four different options
and they're all terrible and you sort of
think maybe there's that fifth option
over there that I just haven't thought
of yet so I'll just do nothing and just
wait and of course it never happens and
sooner or later you have to choose you
have to move on some design decisions
can be postponed but often they can't
and there are some aspects to making
decisions that I think aren't always
obvious
let's look this is I think there are two
slides with code on this is the first
one the second one's not much more
detailed either so imagine this is a
c-sharp method declaration what choices
have we made here okay well
the obvious ones we've made it a void
method it's not going to return anything
we've chosen a name for it we'll talk
more about names later and we've chosen
that it'll be parameterless are those
the only decisions we've made far from
it
this is an instance method it doesn't
have the static modifier assuming it's
not an interface it's not an unsafe
method it may still be able to contain
unsafe code if our type is declared as
unsafe but otherwise that's another
decision it's private and it's non
virtual and those last two decisions are
really really interesting ones to me
because imagine we had a lowercase F so
it became Java what decisions would we
have made then we would have said it's
an instance method okay there's no
unsafe modifier in in Java but there are
probably a few other ones here it's not
a none it's an unsynchronized method
importantly we still decide whether or
not it's virtual and we still decide the
access but in Java this would be a
package access method and it would be a
virtual method because Java has
different defaults why is this
interesting
because I see a lot of methods like this
I've worked in Java for quite a while
and I've worked in c-sharp quite a while
and most of the time in c-sharp you
don't see people adding the virtual
modifier and most of the time in Java
you don't see people adding the final
modifier now Java and c-sharp are
sufficiently close idiomatically
that normally if you were porting a
method a code base from one to the other
you would normally make the methods
virtual or not you know the same way
doesn't matter whether you're porting
from c-sharp to Java or Java C sharp the
situations in which you want virtual
methods are similar but the fact that
most of the time you don't see a
modifier
suggests that people are making
decisions and not being aware of them so
there are a whole other language design
decisions to be made around you know
what is reasonable to have default able
and what should always be stated
explicitly if we have if you're
declaring a class in both Java and
c-sharp you can by default derive from
that class you can make it final or
sealed in c-sharp sorry final in Java or
sealed in c-sharp but it's implicitly
unsealed unfine 'l is it reasonable to
have that as a default or should we
force people to think about things
applying this to API design some of you
may know my Noda time library for date
and time work
I very consciously went away from the
common you don't make me think I can't
remember whose book it is but don't make
me think no as the node of time designer
I force you to make decisions that's why
there are umpteen types in Noda time
where there's just date time and time
span and date time offset you know there
are there are three time related types
in dotnet basically we've got about 15
in a node of time because they represent
different things and darn it you should
know what your data represents which
makes it harder to get started but
hopefully means that once you've the the
design of notice time is you think you
make the decision decision and then it's
my job to make that decision easy to
implement but the thought about what
decisions are you making and being
intentional about those decisions is an
important one I've been interested in
date and time stuff for quite a while
but Noda time is now pretty mature I'll
be doing an update through it today
because there's a new set of timezone
data when Travis has sorted itself out
any of you waiting for Travis to be
sorted again
having lted last night very annoying but
I've moved on from being interested in
basin time to being interested in
versioning because I thought being
interested in dates and time wasn't too
obscure enough versioning is more and
more important I think and really poorly
understood how many people use semantic
versioning okay so if I present you two
versions of code you know right here's
before the commit and then what the
commit changes would you be able to tell
me whether that's fine to go in a new
patch a new minor version or a new major
version yeah it's easy isn't it if it's
non-breaking and just an implementation
detail so it doesn't affect the API then
that's a patch if it is non-breaking but
does change the API then it's a minor
version if it is a breaking change it's
a major version dead easy we can all go
home what's a breaking change if I have
a method that previously would throw an
argument null exception if you pass null
into it and then we say actually now you
can pass null in how many of you think
that should be a new major version
oh so that's a non-breaking change what
if I'm writing a method that's going to
use that method and I've said my
parameter you that what you pass in to
me that can't be null and the first
thing I do is call into that next method
passing my parameter in as an argument
to that method and that's fine because
that method throws if the arguments null
right so I don't need to do the checking
myself I'm just going to rely on this
throwing if I pass in null well if that
doesn't throw any more you've broken me
you are all wrong apart from Bill no
there are a few other hands up but you
need to work out what rules you want
maybe you decide that you're gonna
publish your set of rules and I started
writing a blog post
this last April and it's not gonna be a
blog post it's gonna be a whole github
site at some point because just there
are so many things to think about
versioning is really hard and it's all
about the impact of decisions if you
make a decision to make something public
then that affects what you can do with
it later on and that's just the simple
way of understanding things so it feels
like engineering sorry it feels like
versioning should be an engineering
issue
there's engineering there but there's an
awful lot of craft as well in
understanding the impacts next up we've
made decisions we understand or we're
trying to understand what impact those
decisions will have in terms of what
decisions we can make in the future how
do we communicate them this is
definitely a craft we cannot document
every single decision we make okay
imagine yeah I I do always put the
private modifier on c-sharp methods when
I want them to be private because it
communicates that I made a decision and
I think that's important to say but even
if there were a modifier saying
non-static you know suppose you could
say I deliberately made this an instance
method and you could say safe and in
Java you could say unsynchronized if
there are so many modifiers that we
could have but it would just be noise it
would be garbage there's only so much
bandwidth that we can have so the next
decision you need to make is which
decisions you need to talk about where
do you put comments on code there every
line of code is a decision which ones
are you going to comment
and just as all decisions we need to be
intentional about this we need to think
don't just haphazardly sometimes
comments and sometimes not think about
if I'm making this decision deliberately
why might I need to revisit it and
what's the future person whether that's
me or someone else going to need to know
in order to be able to reevaluate that
decision so intention ality and making
choices is one part of design the other
part of design that I'm going to talk
about there's an awful lot about
software design that I'm not mentioning
at all but I want to talk about
representation and this is where I want
to briefly describe the very end of Act
one of Sunday in the park with George so
as well as the characters I've mentioned
there are loads of other characters I
think my favorite is Louise who is a
young girl who's being looked after
so she's the daughter of an artist and
his wife and they're sort of being
looked after by servants and she comes
in and says let's go and throw stones at
their ducks
it's just this wonderful line and then
she tassels on her dad who's having an
affair and all kinds of things but they
all come and interact with each other
and in the very last scene of Sunland
Park with Georgia act 1 they're all
moving around and George is watching
them and they gradually settle down and
he comes and moves them just a touch and
then they all freeze as they sing Sunday
and they are in exactly the spot for the
painting and then the painting flies in
and everyone applauds because it's so
incredible but I want to just reflect on
the representations going on here
because you've got actors playing
characters and those characters somehow
also being moved by another character in
a way that would never have
in real life you don't just go up and
say right I'm just gonna move you there
because that's where you are in the
painting so you've got people
representing sort of two things at the
same time it gets weirder at the start
of act two where they start off in the
same place so this is just before it
goes to a hundred years in the future
they're in the same place and they're
singing it's hot up here at that point
they're no longer real characters so
much as they are characters in a
painting hanging in a gallery somewhere
and they're singing that it's really
annoying to be hanging in a gallery and
there are just levels of representation
there that I find really intriguing and
it's all about the view that you get
it's intriguing because it's a different
way of looking at the world and I think
art is usually about looking at the
world in a different way
and that's what we do all the time so
imagine you're trying to represent your
beautiful user how many of you have any
kind of products or software that
represents a user yeah it's a fairly
common thing to model do you try to
capture everything about the user or do
you capture the stickman version that is
just some bare essentials it's whatever
your application needs you're not trying
to represent the real at the reality
you're trying to represent the
essentials I like to use the analogy of
a photo if I took a photo of you now and
it were perfectly in focus it would be
accurate but not terribly interesting I
wouldn't view it as art how can a photo
be art by this skill and art of the
photographer capturing something more
interesting than just the accuracy of
this is what it looked like at that time
they're trying to capture maybe an
interesting juxtaposition we'll talk
about composition in a minute
some way of representing more than just
what is there at the point in time so in
software we're always making models
we're always trying to represent things
differently and again I want to sing you
a couple of lines this time from Murray
rather than from dot so this is where
Murray dots daughter is looking at the
painting and marveling and she sings the
child is so sweet and the girls are so
rapturous isn't it lovely how artists
can capture us so idea of capturing
something of the essence of something
and it can go slightly wrong coming back
to Notre time what would you think are
the essential parts of a date okay if
you were having to model a date in
software what would you model I can
stand here all day yeah month day that's
a really good start I will add calendar
system so you know January what is it
the 17th January 17th 2018 in the
Gregorian calendar system is a different
date from January 17th 2018 in the UM
I've completely forgotten the name of
the word for the calendar that came
before Gregorian guren Julian thank you
Wow um Julian calendar system or any of
the other calendar systems but having
year-month-day you know I was aware to
start with that that would exclude some
kind of systems that were sort of more
week based well I didn't realize until a
year ago was that even things that are
based on year-month-day might not be
properly represented by that model we've
got a feature request for to implement
the wondrous or bahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar system
which is each year has 19 months of 19
days in the fact that there were 19
months meant that I couldn't represent
the month as four bits anymore so that
was annoying to start with
I've got all packed is the optimization
side is a whole other talk I might do
something yeah it's really fun um but
it's nineteen months of nineteen days
and four or five other days that aren't
in a month
what so if you ask someone you know what
month is it today oh it's not it's in
the wondrous days for this year that's
really unhelpful the wondrous or Baha'i
or body calendar system I think if you
just search for a wondrous calendar
you'll find it I do find it interesting
if that's used by the Baha'i faith I
don't know whether it's occurred to you
that calendar systems are probably the
closest intersection between code and
religion
almost all calendar systems that I've
looked at have religious origins yeah
why is the Gregorian calendar stone
called Gregorian because of Pope Gregory
and time stamps UUID time stamps are
based from one point at which the
Gregorian calendar system came online as
it were took over from the Julian
calendar system whole other talk sorry I
mustn't get distracted so we're trying
to capture things and that's another
element of decision it's sort of a
simplification that does try to bring
order to the whole bring this hugely
complex and wonderful world that we're
in into something more manageable okay
talked about design
what about composition in art or in
particular in Sunday afternoon on an
island of lagron drat there are various
elements of composition three obvious
ones to start with firstly at the lowest
level we have a picture that is more
compositional than most paintings
it is little dots and those compose into
objects now a person
a hat a tree a fishing rod then there's
the more regular composition of the
artists saying how would it be
interesting to have figures in the
background or foreground or in the shade
or in the light and that's something
that you know artists know all about and
do differently and then there's sort of
meta composition I mentioned that there
was a third phase of painting where Sora
added apparently had to stretch the
canvas again to get some more space and
then he added this border so there's a
border around the work this is sort of
part of the work and then I believe
there's a white frame around it that is
part of the composition the work
includes the whole thing just yesterday
I received another mirror print it's
turning out to be quite an expensive
hobby collecting mirrors and I took it
to the framers and it looked beautiful
as it was but it will look more
beautiful when framed that is part of
the composition so what does this mean
in software so the equivalent of dots
building into people and hats and things
is the composition that happens all the
time in code we build statements from
expressions we build methods from
statements types from methods assemblies
from types bigger systems our whole
applications from types sorry from
assemblies and then larger systems from
multiple subsystems the whole aspect of
microservices is composition writ large
it is defining how you compose things
and working out that making shoving
things too much together doesn't really
help and what I find interesting around
sorry No next next slide regular
composition when you think about
preferring composition over inheritance
this is the kind of composition we would
normally think about we're building one
type for
three fields and one of the things I've
been trying to think about is where
composition adds value where the hole is
greater than some of the parts and there
are a few aspects of this one is names
we don't just have a black circle a
green square and a red triangle we have
them with particular names if we had two
moments in time and we call one a start
and one an end and we put two get them
together and call them an interval then
we are attaching meaning to each of
those values they are not just item one
and item two if I have more time I go
into how to 'pls in c-sharp have evolved
that we have the tupple of T t1 t2 type
that just has item 1 item 2 and C sharp
sevens tuples having names to the
elements come to mind and Bill's talks
later on this afternoon to find out more
about that but it adds so much value in
a way that you wouldn't expect in a way
that isn't just engineering it's not
something a computer would necessarily
appreciate but it talks to the human
side of coding additionally we have
meaning by saying well when we've got a
start and an end we can then talk about
the duration of this interval certain
operations only make sense on composed
values not on each individual value but
as a meta-level when we decide to
compose and when we decide to make that
public we are providing value by saying
that this composition has value there
are various times in our implementation
that we might compose things like a user
ID and date of birth
that isn't a useful type in itself even
though you may want to project a
database table to it so that you can
find the oldest user in your table or
whatever it is you wouldn't make that
public again the decision
because it's not a generally useful
thing when we write our code we are
telling a story and this time I'll turn
to another favorites online musical into
the woods children will look to you for
which way to turn to learn what to be
careful before you say listen to me
children will listen careful the tale
you tell that is the spell the types
that you decide to expose publicly or
even within an assembly say this has
value this has some general purpose this
is a useful way of adding things
together again the value is more than
just I've got three things and I'll put
them together it's how you put them
together and the fact that you do so
finally this is an area I know less
about but functional composition I want
to mention both link and async so link
works nicely because it composes and so
does async I can take a sequence and
either project it or filter it and then
that gives me a sequence it gives me the
same kind of thing it may be a different
shape here it may be a sequence of users
instead of a sequence of user IDs but
it's still a sequence of something which
means I can go and apply more operations
so you can chain things together
likewise tasks async/await
works well because the kind of thing you
can consume in an async method I a task
based type is the kind of thing that an
async method spits out as its output so
you can call one a sync method from
another from another from another and
that's why it's so painful when you have
to go from a sink to sink or vice versa
because you're changing the model
I think this has something to do with
monads if I knew more about monads I
could look really clever by explaining
it but instead because I think it's got
something to do with it I can appreciate
some of the value of it I can sort of
say what I like does that remind you of
anything it's exactly what I was saying
about the Miro earlier on this is
computer science as art as there's
something deep here that I can
appreciate without fully understanding
moving swiftly on tension and balance
I've put these two together partly for
the sake of time but partly because I
don't like tension and this was what I
got pulled up on most in Detroit so
tension in art can be good in Sunday the
park those lines that I said at the
start here through design composition
balance tension light and harmony after
each of those words there is a split
chord played and it's beautiful to
listen to and I didn't know why until I
read an interview with Sunday where they
showed the score and said look at all
those chords they're missing their
bottom note the natural bottom note that
sort of should be there until harmony so
as you listen to there's something
there's something there's something
missing what's going on harmony and the
tension resolves now I made the
statement in Detroit that I didn't like
tension that tension in software was
never a good thing and that balance was
sort of the best compromise we could
have to resolve it and there was
pushback saying that tension is what
drives us to be better and that it's a
natural and good force I'm still
thinking about it and I urge you to do
so as well but there is definitely
balance to be had in terms of which
projects do you work on
which issues do you work on do you write
new features or pay down technical debt
you none of us have enough hours in the
day last week it kobish I had the
attention to resolve between playing
cards against humanity' or doing a
sing-along Hamilton just good things and
you need to get the balance right this
is true in Sunday in the park with
George as well in terms of work-life
balance
George loses himself in his work so much
that he can sort of tell that he has
lost that he lives through his painting
and so he sings finishing the Hat and he
sings about the slightly manic obsessive
side of things
he sings finishing the Hat how you have
to finish the Hat how you watch the rest
of the world through a window while you
finish the Hat how many of us have been
in whether it's a death march or whether
it's just a crunch at the end of a
project or whatever where we're living
but we're not really living our lives
and sometimes that may be necessary for
brief periods ideally not with good
planning but often we put ourselves to
it when we don't need to Oh I'll skip
dinner because I really want to finish
this bug not that I have to finish this
bug but I want to and I'd urge us all to
examine that work-life balance for
ourselves but the way that finishing the
Hat ends is what speaks me most about
software he sings to the audience look I
made a hat where there never was a hat
he's created something out of nothing
and that's what drives me all the time
in computing that it's just such a
joyful experience of there was nothing
and now there is something and I can
totally see how that applies in art and
knitting not sure about running but you
know it is creating something out of
nothing and that is a joyful experience
but let's make sure that we keep
relationships and our lives and some
sense of perspective I wasn't quite sure
what to do for light
what does liked meaning terms of code in
the park sorry in Sunday afternoon on
the island of La Grande Jatte almost all
the characters are in shade to some
extent with the sort of exception of the
girl in the middle how many of you have
watched Ferris Bueller's Day Off you
have seen this painting because it's in
the Art Institute in Chicago and there's
a beautiful montage where Ferris Cameron
and Pharisees girlfriend whose name I
have temporarily forgotten go to the Art
Institute and Cameron looks at the
middle of the painting and this girl and
they gradually zoom in and if you want
to zoom in for yourself by the way that
the painting is in the Google Cultural
Institute if you search for Google
Cultural Institute and then within that
search for Sora you can zoom in to such
a fine detail all meaning evaporates
which was kind of the point of the myth
in Ferris Bueller's Day Off but you'll
also be able to see the light and that
that's one character one person who is
looking out at the viewer is in light
and almost everyone else is in some kind
of shade I think we are moving in
computing into the light as open source
becomes more and more prevalent and so
does transparency arguably with privacy
concerns we are trying to draw a more
distinct but nuanced division between
light and dark which information should
be public and which should be private
I'm not going to say that everything
should be public I'm saying it should be
a deliberate decision as to what we make
public and what really benefits being
private whether that's intellectual
property or personal information I'd
also say that just like with light
if you expose too much data it doesn't
actually give information just as if you
have a blinding light you can't see
anything if there is huge amounts of
data then you never know what's going to
be hidden there always be nervous when a
company releases thousands and thousands
of pages so you don't know which page of
the report you should actually be
looking at the final word that sometime
uses is harmony and this is copied from
from the score when they're singing
Sunday at the end of Act one and here's
where I want to talk about people more
if tension and balance are about
competing concerns then harmony is about
elements that aren't in competition but
help each other to excel and here I want
to change the analogy somewhat to
acquire or an orchestra if you're
singing solo or playing a solo
instrument then you can decide to be as
loud as you like you should use the
dynamics in the music but you could play
quite loudly if you're in an orchestra
you have to be listening to other people
and if you're playing too loud then a
good conductor will tell you
non-judgmentally constructively but
you'll be called out for playing too
loudly in a really good Orchestra the
conductor doesn't need to do it well
partly because people are less likely to
play for their own satisfaction as for
the team doing the right thing just as
in a harmony but also we could call each
other out and say hey first violin
you're playing a bit too now the second
violins can't be heard again without
judgment without implying that they're
less of a person
and obviously this talks to computing
teams
and trying to hear all the voices in a
team in an atmosphere of psychological
safety because a good team just like a
good orchestra doesn't play on one note
they don't express one idea that's
really boring can you imagine an
orchestra all playing just the melody
imagine how tedious that would be
they're contributing different notes and
again the sum is greater than just the
sum of the parts would be but they know
how to do it well so that they come
together appropriately and so it really
has to be in computing and at the moment
we have an awful lot of brass bands we
have a lot of teams that are made up of
people who have had very similar life
experiences who look kind of the same
and will have very similar ideas they
will play with similar tones at a
similar pitch and they can prep play
some nice tunes I like brass bands but I
prefer the richness of an orchestra just
in case it's been too subtle this is all
about diversity and our teams right in
our whole industry didn't want it to go
unnoticed but it's not just about our
teams either it's about listening to the
other people around us just as there is
the surround of the painting helps to
make it what it is so there's the people
around our teams so I work in Google
cloud platform on making c-sharp rock
for GCP developers or GCP rock for
c-sharp developers so I have the team
that I'm in and I need to listen to my
colleagues and make sure that everyone's
heard there but I have customers and I
have other teams that I need to work
with and I have users asking questions
on Stack Overflow and all kinds of
people in my day-to-day life I am my own
melody and they are sort of providing
the harmony but my work just provides
the harmony for their own melody
basically the world is better if we
listen to each other
we've spent huge amounts of time so many
books have been written about how to do
software well in terms of the code I
think as an industry we need to spend an
equal amount of time working out how to
pay attention to humans whether that is
our own teams or our users or all of the
other people involved this isn't art or
craft or engineering it's the background
to everything it's the canvas on which
we paint paint our work so to sum up we
are incredibly lucky to work in an
industry that is so much creative and so
much engineering because there's fun in
engineering as well it kind of sounds
boring engineering but it's fun to do
engineering and it's fun to be creative
I hope I've convinced you that software
is an artistic endeavor that has some
grounding in engineering I hope I've
persuaded you that software is far more
than just bits on a screen it's human
interactions I've spoken the first line
of the of the musical and I want to end
with the last line white a blank page or
canvas his favorite so many
possibilities thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
